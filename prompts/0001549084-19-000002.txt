Item 1.    BUSINESS
Overview
We design, develop and sell exoskeleton technology that currently has applications in healthcare and industrial markets. Our wearable exoskeletons are worn over clothing and are mechanically controlled by a trained operator to augment human strength, endurance and mobility.
Our exoskeleton technology serves multiple markets and can be used both by able-bodied users as well as by persons with physical disabilities. We have sold and rented devices that (a) enable individuals with neurological conditions affecting gait (stroke and spinal cord injury, or SCI) to rehabilitate and to walk again and (b) allow industrial workers to perform heavy duty or repetitive work for extended periods.
We believe the commercial opportunity for exoskeleton technology adoption is accelerating as a result of recent advancements in material technologies, electronic and electrical engineering, control technologies, and sensor and software development. Taken individually, many of these advancements have become ubiquitous in peoples’ everyday lives. We believe we have learned how to integrate these existing technologies and wrap the result around a human being efficiently, elegantly and safely, supported by a robust intellectual property portfolio. We further believe we can do so across a broad spectrum of applications, from persons with lower limb paralysis to able-bodied users.
While we believe advancements in technology will continue driving commercial interest in and further development of exoskeleton systems, we also recognize that we are in the early stages of development of exoskeleton capabilities. In order to advance the commercialization of our exoskeleton technology, we intend to focus our efforts in 2019 on the following key initiatives:

• | Drive robotic exoskeleton rehabilitation to become the standard of care for both in-patient and out-patient rehabilitation for patients with some form of lower limb paralysis or weakness in the United States.


• | Continue to introduce new indications and features in rehabilitation for our Ekso GT, which could expand access to care to more patients, and for our EksoPulse Analytics, which aids in providing more personalized care in rehabilitation sessions.


• | Leverage our market position in exoskeleton rehabilitation by introducing new products and therapies beyond the scope of our existing lower limb devices.


• | Expand on our momentum in industrial markets with EksoZeroG for aerial work platforms and scaffolding and EksoVest for overhead work applications by forming strategic partnerships to define and develop new uses for these and potential derivative products.


• | Build on our initial success in Singapore and Hong Kong by expanding our reach to additional select countries in Asia.


• | Take advantage of the improved cost structure afforded by our joint venture with Zhejiang Youchuang Venture Capital Investment Co., Ltd. and Shaoxing City Keqiao District Paradise Silicon Intelligent Robot Industrial Investment Partnership (Limited Partnership), who we refer to as our Joint Venture Partners for our China JV, to drive unit costs lower for both our medical and industrial products and to develop and serve the exoskeleton market in China and other Asian markets.

EksoHealth - Rehabilitation Robotics
Today, the focus of our healthcare business is on rehabilitation robotics. We are leveraging our patented exoskeleton technology to develop and market products intended to enable patients with some form of lower limb impairment to rehabilitate earlier and with better outcomes than the current standard of care.
Ekso GT
Our current product, the Ekso GT, is a wearable bionic suit that allows our hospital and rehabilitation customers to provide in-patients and out-patients with SCI and hemiplegia due to stroke the ability to stand and walk over ground with a full weight-bearing, reciprocal gait using a cane, crutches or a walker under the supervision of a physical therapist. Walking is achieved by a user shifting their body to activate sensors in the device which in turn initiate steps. Battery-powered motors drive the legs, detecting the deficient neuromuscular function and providing that level of assistance necessary for a user to complete their step. Users can expect to walk with aid from the device the first time they put on the Ekso GT exoskeleton (after passing an assessment). Physical therapists can transfer patients to or from their wheelchair and don or remove the Ekso GT in less than five minutes.
The Ekso GT incorporates SmartAssist, our proprietary, adaptive or “smart” software that detects a user’s level of motor loss and dynamically provides 0-100% power to either side of the body. SmartAssist can promote a greater number of high-quality steps 
4

in a short time period and support the early re-learning of correct step patterns and weight shifts, potentially mitigating compensatory behaviors. SmartAssist also has allowed our customers to significantly expand the spectrum of patients that can potentially benefit from robotic rehabilitation.
In addition, SmartAssist can aid in promoting early mobility by training patients (PreGait) to walk in an exoskeleton, which should expand access to care to more patients. SmartAssist also includes next generation Variable Assist technology that provides more freedom for healthcare providers to allow patients to power themselves (FreeGait) in the most appropriate ways possible. Lastly, SmartAssist includes QuickFit, a more rehabilitation friendly user-interface that should reduce potential data input / output errors.
In December of 2017, we also launched in Europe the Ekso GT Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) interface capability through a partnership with Hasomed GmbH, a developer of innovative products for neurological rehabilitation. FES is a technique that uses low energy electrical pulses to artificially generate body movements in individuals who have been paralyzed due to injury to the central nervous system. We believe the combination of exoskeleton technology with SmartAssist and FES gives clinicians the synergistic benefits of earlier mobility and muscle stimulations to provide rehabilitation to a broader spectrum of patients.
Another important feature of our Ekso GT is its Ekso Pulse Analytics, a real-time data capture program. Ekso Pulse gathers and transmits statistics and device information during Ekso GT walking sessions. This information can be used to track patient progression and to monitor device utilization. The Ekso GT records data such as steps, speed, step size, and other settings along with all error logs and operating parameters. Data is sent securely to our servers where it is available for customers to view, filter, and export through a secure web portal. This feature enables more thorough patient care while reducing manual data entry. It also enables us to provide a higher level of service through early identification and thorough reporting of device errors, saving customers the time and expense of unnecessary on-site visits.
The Ekso GT is used by customers in both in-patient and out-patient settings. Our customers believe that for patients with some motor ability intact (for example, after a stroke or an incomplete SCI), the Ekso GT exoskeleton offers unique benefits to help therapists teach proper step patterns and weight shifts, allowing patients potentially to mobilize earlier and ultimately to walk again. By allowing individuals to stand and walk in a full weight-bearing setting, early clinical evidence is also beginning to show that Ekso GT may offer potential healthcare benefits (including for patients with complete SCI) such as reducing post-injury medical costs through reduction in secondary complications such as pressure sores, urinary tract infections, bowel problems, pneumonia and other respiratory issues, bone loss/osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease and psychological disorders.
As of February 1, 2019, we had shipped over 360 Ekso GT units to 260 rehabilitation facilities or customers worldwide. The number of units utilized at a center varies from one to six, and is driven by the number of beds and rehabilitation sessions a hospital can offer and that hospital’s adoption of robotics within its rehabilitation protocols.
Market Overview

The primary market for our Ekso GT is rehabilitation clinics with significant stroke and SCI populations. In the U.S. there are about 5.9 million stroke and SCI rehabilitation sessions conducted annually on about 680,000 stroke and SCI patients at approximately 16,900 facilities, according to LexisNexis Risk Solutions medical claims data.
Due to the chronic nature of the conditions resulting in lower limb impairment, we believe these diagnoses have an enormous clinical and economic impact on both people with the conditions and the healthcare system. According to the American Heart Association, in the U.S. there are approximately 795,000 strokes per year with approximately 7 million people living who have suffered from a stroke. Direct and indirect costs associated with those who have suffered a stroke total approximately $60 billion annually. Similarly, according to the National Spinal Cord Injury Statistical Center, in the U.S. there are approximately 12,500 incidences of SCI per year with approximately 275,000 people living with SCI. Direct and indirect costs associated with those who have suffered SCI total approximately $18.5 billion annually. Global estimates for stroke and SCI populations are more than double those in the U.S. 
While the market opportunity for robotic exoskeleton rehabilitation may be large, we also recognize that the path for medical devices to become the standard of care is long and challenging. We believe our ability to accelerate adoption will also be based, in part, on our ability to build on our and our partners’ early efforts: (i) to expand clinical evidence and (ii) to drive toward standard of care. We are already seeing customers appreciate that one way for stroke patients at in-patient facilities to receive the recommended amount of rehabilitation per guidelines is by using an Ekso GT, the only device currently in the market that has the versatility to provide an over-ground gait training intervention that is task-specific, high intensity and allows for a margin of error, across the continuum of care.
Clinical Evidence
5

Many of our early clinical customers have undertaken research to evaluate the use in rehabilitation of exoskeletons in general and our Ekso GT in particular. Although these studies primarily have focused on feasibility and safety and have relied on small sample sizes, initial study findings have been favorable. In 2017, we learned of results for eleven clinical studies for SCI and four for stroke. One completed SCI study included nine Pan-European sites with 52 participants. One other study included 23 sub-acute and chronic stroke participants. Also, we have now enrolled ten sites for our company sponsored WISE (Walking Improvement for SCI with Exoskeletons) study. These sites, in turn, have enrolled over 20 patients. The primary endpoint of the WISE study seeks to demonstrate that a 12-week robotic gait training regimen can lead to a clinically meaningful improvement in independent walking speed. Secondary endpoints from the trial are examining economic factors such as number of physical therapists and staff required during training, the physical burden on physical therapists assisting and supervising during training, and the influence of factors that may modify the gait recovery.
We intend to continue our work with rehabilitation centers and clinicians studying the benefits of robotic exoskeleton rehabilitation using Ekso GT. We have also increased the number of centers of excellence to four, with the first European Center of Robotic Excellence established in northern Italy at Villa Beretta Centro di Riabilitazione coming on board. We believe that additional clinical evidence will help treating physicians to better understand the benefits of rehabilitation with the Ekso GT and will support our efforts with more industry collaboration toward achieving reimbursement for exoskeletons.
The European Union also requires a two-track approach to market penetration and subsequent coverage, requiring separate claims for purchasing the device and for requests for reimbursement. We are well represented in clinics run by German and Austrian accident insurers, with four out of 13 rehabilitation sites in Germany and four out of four rehabilitation sites in Austria. We also have a growing number of patients in Europe, who get reimbursement on a case-by-case decision covered by public and private health insurers for in-patient and out-patient treatment. The first paid out-patient trial with an accident insurer in collaboration with an out-patient rehabilitation center, where a patient trains twice a week, has also started in late 2017. This is a model we built upon in 2018 and will continue in 2019. We are using these examples to integrate exoskeletal therapy in existing care pathways. In the United Kingdom, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, or NICE, has selected us as the first exoskeleton company to produce a Medtech Innovation Briefing, or MIB, which are designed to support National Health Services, or NHS, and social care commissioners and staff who are considering using new medical devices and other medical or diagnostic technologies. The MIB highlighted the innovative aspect of our proprietary SmartAssist software, which differentiates our Ekso GT from other available exoskeletons.
Economic Value Proposition
Our Ekso GT allows our customers to benefit economically without modifying the reimbursement model or reimbursement codes. First, some of our customers have shown that using the Ekso GT promotes patient improvement over a longer period of time. This allows the provider to justify an extension to the length of stay for patients using Ekso GT and a commensurate increased reimbursement. Second, many of our customers have shown that they have been able to attract more patients to their facilities with our Ekso GT as part of its rehabilitation program, and this has also driven positive economics for our customers. 
Current Sales and Marketing Efforts
Our key marketing goal today is to achieve broad-based commercial adoption of our Ekso GT in the rehabilitation setting. We are focusing our go-to-market protocols and collateral on our three target audiences: medical administrators, medical directors/therapists and patients. Working closely with thought leaders, we will continue to build upon our early user-group exchanges, develop clinical education programs, and grow our medical advisory council. With the receipt of our clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, in April 2016, we introduced new strategies and tactics to increase awareness in our target audiences, including leveraging social media, public relations, tradeshows, marketing automation, and market development activities which will continue throughout 2019.
There continues to be high market interest in expanding neurosciences service lines. As such, in 2019, our sales priorities are to effectively educate both clinical and executive stakeholders on the economic and clinical value of starting an Ekso GT Robotics Stroke and SCI Rehabilitation Program. In tandem, we continue to leverage our Ekso GT customer base to educate and mentor strategic target centers that specialize in Stroke and SCI rehabilitation in key market service areas across the US and Canada. Geographically, the priorities have been North America (Canada, the U.S., and Mexico) and Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, or EMEA. Beginning late 2017, we expanded our focus to include Asia-Pacific and initiated an effort to seek a strategic partnership for the sales and manufacture of our products in China and certain other Asian markets, which resulted in the China JV we announced in January 2019. Currently, we utilize a direct sales force for the U.S., Canada and the German-speaking countries of Europe. We also have an expanding distributor network in EMEA and Central and South America.
6

The sales and marketing team is principally based in the U.S. and Germany and is structured as follows:

• | One commercial leader for the Americas and one EMEA-based manager for our distributors;


• | U.S. and EMEA sales professionals that pursue new prospects and organizes demonstrations;


• | Clinical professionals and physical therapists that provide peer-to-peer demonstrations and trainings;


• | Marketing professionals, graphic designers, and consultants to build awareness and generate demand;


• | Ambassadors with SCI that provide demonstrations and personal experiences.

The sales cycle for the Ekso GT averages approximately eight to 12 months for a first device and two to four months for subsequent devices. Our typical sale is our Ekso GT complete package, which includes the device and all relevant components, two sets of batteries for continuous run-time, training through two levels of certification, and SmartAssist software. Customers also typically purchase Ekso Care, which is our one- to four-year after-sales service package.
Clinical Services and Customer Success
We have developed leading clinical capability in robotic rehabilitation, and we provide extensive training and support to our customers to ensure they are successful. All rentals or sales include customer training. This is comprised of both on-line and in-person training of our customers’ physical therapists. We have made this a high priority as we recognize getting customers comfortable using our product is a prerequisite to them successfully implementing a robotic rehabilitation program. In addition to the training that is included with each sale or rental, we also offer additional training services for customers who are interested in more advanced uses of the product or who desire more supervised experiences.
After Sales Service
We provide service for the Ekso GT at our facility in Richmond, California or in Germany for our European customers. When maintenance or service is required, a customer schedules service by contacting us and we then arrange for the appropriate service, depending on the level of Ekso Care the customer has purchased. In some cases, we may decide it’s appropriate to have an Ekso field technician fly to the customer site to service the device. The Ekso GT is designed with Ekso Pulse, which allows us to diagnose many customer service issues remotely.
In addition to the Ekso Care service programs we provide a Fee-for-Service option. In this program Ekso GT repair is fulfilled per quote on demand of the customer and as per our repair price list.
Manufacturing and Supply Chain
We produce the Ekso GT at our facilities in Richmond, California for worldwide sales. We currently run one line for one shift per day and believe we have the capacity to eventually run up to four lines for two shifts per day should we deem it appropriate. The Ekso GT uses over 700 purchased parts, which we source globally from over 70 suppliers. Whenever possible, we seek to secure dual source suppliers for our components.
Our commitment to the philosophy of continuous improvement has continued to increase product performance and reliability over the past year. As a result, we expect our cost of field service will continue to decline over the next 12 months.
China Joint Venture
We entered into the China JV to develop and serve the exoskeleton market in China and certain other Asian markets and to create a global exoskeleton manufacturing center. The Equity Joint Venture Contract, dated January 30, 2019, between us and the Joint Venture Parties, or the JV Agreement, provides for the establishment of the China JV as a limited liability company pursuant to the Law on Sino-foreign Equity Joint Ventures and the Regulations for the Implementation of the Law on Sino-foreign Equity Joint Ventures. Zhejiang Youchuang Venture Capital Investment Co., Ltd., Shaoxing City Keqiao District Paradise Silicon Intelligent Robot Industrial Investment Partnership (Limited Partnership) and our Company will hold 41.54%, 38.46% and 20.00% of the China JV, respectively. The Joint Venture Partners will make their contributions in the form of an aggregate of RMB 624 million cash to the China JV (30% of which is to be made within 90 days of the formation of the China JV and the remainder within the 10 years thereafter), while we will transfer certain patents and patent applications in China with equivalent value of RMB 145 million and related to human exoskeletons to the China JV as our contribution. 

Pursuant to the JV Agreement, the China JV will build a manufacturing facility and will manufacture the EksoGT, EksoVest and EksoZeroG Arm units, or the JV Products, in China for sale in China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia and other countries to be mutually agreed upon by the parties, but excluding Japan, India and Australia, or the JV Territory, under our trademark and brands.

During the term of the China JV, and subject to certain conditions, we will receive a royalty fee based on a mid-single digits percentage of the net sales revenue of the products manufactured and sold by the China JV.
EksoWorks - Able-Bodied Industrial Applications
In December 2014, we introduced our first prototype of an unpowered exoskeleton intended for industrial applications. During 2015, we began investing resources to support requests for prototype demonstrations and in-depth field-testing in real world conditions with advanced prototypes.
Our feedback indicates a growing imperative among construction and manufacturing companies to drive adoption of improved safety and health practices. Furthermore, based on initial customer field-testing and market research, we believe industrial exoskeletons have the potential to help prevent workforce injuries, improve productivity and over time reduce workmen’s compensation and related costs. According to a Bureau of Labor Statistics Report (2012), direct costs related to injuries associated with overexertion in the workplace total over $21 billion per year.
In addition, human augmentation technology is being viewed by senior managers of companies that have participated in field-testing as an opportunity to extend the careers of experienced and skilled workers while also changing the work environment to attract future workers to these careers.
In 2016, we introduced a new product innovation for aerial work platforms (AWP) and scaffolding, the EksoZeroG, which is intended to significantly improve workforce productivity while dramatically reducing workplace related injuries in order to keep workers healthy, strong, and safe. EksoZeroG is a mobile arm mount that makes heavy tools feel weightless and enables workers to be more productive and safer. 
In 2017, we introduced a second commercial product for industrial applications, the EksoVest, an upper body exoskeleton that elevates and supports a worker's arms to assist them with tasks ranging from chest height to overhead. It is lightweight and low profile, making it comfortable to wear while enabling freedom of motion. The goal is for workplaces with the EksoVest to experience fewer on-site injuries while tasks are completed faster and with higher quality results, for workers to stay healthier and experience increased stamina, and for companies to gain greater productivity in factories and on construction sites.
As EksoVest represents a new manufacturing paradigm, we have taken a deliberate market development approach. After initially seeding the market upon release in 2017, we have worked with customers to help them validate the benefits of the product and how to incorporate it into their operations. In 2018, several customers advanced from initial interest to pilot deployments - in some cases at multiple sites. As a result, demand for our EksoVest accelerated through the year. While Automotive and Aerospace continue to be the markets where end customer adoption is most advanced, we have experienced strong demand from a range of other segments including construction, general manufacturing, and railcar manufacturing, among others. 
We believe there is additional mid-to-long-term potential in the industrial markets, and accordingly, we will continue our development efforts to expand our EksoWorks product offerings. While we have been successful with our initial industrial products thus far, given the fragmented nature of the industrial market we believe that the best approach in this market is work with established strategic partners that can help us target applications tailored for specific use cases. We believe leveraging our extensive exoskeleton expertise and IP portfolio with the established channel and application expertise of one or more strategic partners unlocks the highest value for Ekso. In 2018, we initiated this model with multiple potential industrial partners, and plan to continue following this approach going forward.
Engineering Services
Historically, in addition to internal product development, we operated an engineering services business segment (EksoLabs). In early 2016, we made the strategic decision to shift our engineering resources away from billable engineering services to our internal development efforts. While we may still perform billable engineering from time to time, as of 2018, it is no longer a material contributor to revenue and is no longer reported as an operating segment. 
Intellectual Property
We have established an extensive intellectual property portfolio that includes various U.S. patents and patent applications. The table below provides a summary of U.S. patents by issuing status and ownership status.

Pending applications mean a complete application has been filed with the applicable patent authority and additional action is pending. 
Many of these applications have also been filed internationally as appropriate for their respective subject matter. As of January 10, 2019, 152 applications have issued or have been allowed as patents internationally. All told, our patent portfolio contains 285 cases that have issued or are in prosecution in 23 countries.
Our patent portfolio includes product and method type claims, since the devices that we produce and the processes performed by those devices are patentable. Our patents encompass technologies relevant to our devices, including medical exoskeletons, commercial exoskeletons, actuators, and strength-enhancing exoskeletons. The earliest priority date of the portfolio reaches back to 2003, and new applications continue to be filed.
Licensors include the Regents of the University of California, or RUC, and Garrett Brown (as a result of our acquisition of technology of Equipois, LLC).
The license with RUC consists of two agreements and one amendment covering ten patent cases exclusively licensed to the Company, nine of which have issued and one of which remains in prosecution or the RUC License Agreements. Inventions covered by a further three patent applications are co-owned by the Company and RUC, with no license agreement between the Company and RUC. As a result, RUC may license its rights in these patents to a third party. With respect to two of these co-owned patent applications, RUC has licensed their rights in the U.S. to an unrelated third party. The third patent application will need to be fully prosecuted before it can be determined which claims are exclusive to us (through a previous license) and which claims RUC may license to other entities.
Pursuant to the RUC License Agreements, Ekso Bionics initially paid RUC consideration consisting of $5,000 in cash and 310,400 common shares of Ekso Bionics, and committed to pay a 1% royalty on sales, including sales generated by sublicenses. In addition, the RUC License Agreements call for minimum annual payments of $50,000. We do not pay royalties to RUC on products sold or to be resold to the U.S. government.
In some cases, as a result of government funding we receive, the patents have a government use license, granting the U.S. government a non-exclusive, non-transferable, irrevocable, paid-up license for use of the inventions for or on behalf of the U.S. government, as is typical in the case of government sponsored research.
In connection with our acquisition of assets of Equipois, we assumed the rights and obligations of Equipois under a license agreement with Garrett Brown, the developer of certain intellectual property related to mechanical balance and support arm technologies, which grants us an exclusive license with respect to the technology and patent rights for certain fields of use. Pursuant to the terms of the license agreement, we will be required to pay Mr. Brown a single-digit royalty on net receipts, subject to a $50,000 annual minimum royalty requirement.
Intellectual Property Out-Licensing
We believe that the breadth of the coverage across various bionic systems and technologies, together with our freedom to grant sub-licenses under the RUC License Agreements gives us the potential to generate licensing revenue in fields outside our present areas of commercialization. Since 2009, we have generated approximately $1.8 million in such licensing revenue from our two licensees: Lockheed Martin Corporation or Lockheed and OttoBock Healthcare Product GmbH or OttoBock.
9

We receive revenue pursuant to a Government Field Cross License Agreement dated as of July 1, 2013 between Ekso Bionics, Inc. and Lockheed and a Cross License Agreement dated as of July 1, 2013 between Ekso Bionics, Inc. and Lockheed. Pursuant to these agreements, we have licensed to Lockheed certain rights with respect to our anthropomorphic exoskeleton technology for which Lockheed is obligated to pay us a royalty on sales of products incorporating such technology. Royalty fees from Lockheed were either de minimus or nil for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
With respect to OttoBock, we received exclusivity payments pursuant to the License and Services Agreement dated October 27, 2014. The License and Services Agreement grants OttoBock exclusive rights in order to develop a semi-active prosthetic knee prototype for use in medical prosthetics and provides that OttoBock will pay us a royalty based on sales by OttoBock of products incorporating the licensed technology. Royalty fees from OttoBock were $150,000 for each of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Competition
The medical technology and industrial robotics industries are characterized by intense competition and rapid technological change. We believe a number of other companies are developing competitive technology and devices for both the able-bodied and medical fields of use and many of these competitors have significantly more financial and other resources than we possess.
In the medical field, we face competition from companies that are focused on technology for rehabilitation of patients suffering from stroke and related neurological disabilities as well as from companies that are focused on SCI. In stroke, Cyberdyne, Parker Hannafin’s Indego, and ReWalk all now offer ambulatory exoskeletons for rehabilitation use in various markets where we operate. While not functionally equivalent, Hocoma, AlterG, Aretech and Reha Technology are selling treadmill-based gait therapies. In SCI, ReWalk Robotics and Parker Hannafin also sell ambulatory exoskeletons. Other companies who have announced plans to commercialize robotic exoskeletons include: Bionik Laboratories and SuitX.
Technologies developed by competitors in the areas of stroke rehabilitation and SCI represent therapeutic interventions with utility at varying points of the continuum of care. Clinically, the Ekso GT is unique in its broad ability to mobilize pre- or even non-ambulatory patients using a full weight bearing, over ground, task-based platform. From a practice management perspective, the Ekso GT is less expensive than many other systems, has a smaller footprint, the ability to move around the hospital, and uses standard power requirements that make it easy to integrate into existing infrastructure. Other over-ground exoskeletons were initially designed for an individual to achieve ambulation reliant on the device. By contrast, the Ekso GT’s design accommodates patients with complete paraplegia and additionally includes features that are optimized to assist therapists in helping patients with some motor ability learn to walk again in a clinical setting, treating several patients and indications in a single day.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the most pressing challenges we face are not necessarily competitive technologies, but rather achieving rapid market awareness and adoption of this emerging technology while acclimating prospects to a fundamentally new paradigm in neuro-rehabilitation and mobility. In addition, it may be difficult for the rehabilitation department of a hospital or clinic to secure the funds for acquisition of an Ekso device in an environment where capital expenditures of this magnitude are not commonly incurred by those rehabilitation departments.
In the able-bodied field, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, BAE Systems, Panasonic, Honda, Daewoo, Noonee, Revision Military, SuitX, Skel-ex, Levitate and Cyberdyne - among others - are each developing or commercializing some form of exoskeleton for military and/or industrial applications.
The field of robotic exoskeleton technology remains in its infancy. As this field develops, we believe we will face increased competition on the basis of product features, clinical outcomes, price, services and other factors. Our competitive position will depend on multiple, complex factors, including our ability to achieve market acceptance for our products, develop new products, implement production and marketing plans, secure regulatory approvals for products under development and protect our intellectual property. In some instances, competitors may also offer, or may attempt to develop, alternative therapies for disease states that may be delivered without a medical device.
Governmental Regulation and Product Approval
U.S. Regulation
The U.S. government regulates the medical device industry through various agencies, including but not limited to, the FDA, which administers the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act or FDCA. The design, testing, manufacturing, storage, labeling, distribution, advertising, and marketing of medical devices are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state, and local governmental authorities 
10

in the United States, including the FDA, and by similar agencies in other countries. Any medical device product that we develop must receive all requisite regulatory approvals or clearances, as the case may be, before it may be marketed in a particular country.
Device Development, Marketing Clearance and Approval. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes (Class I, II or III) based on the degree of risk the FDA determines to be associated with a device and the extent of control deemed necessary to ensure the device’s safety and effectiveness. Devices requiring fewer controls because they are deemed to pose lower risk are placed in Class I or II. Class I devices are deemed to pose the least risk and are subject only to general controls applicable to all devices, such as requirements for device labeling, premarket notification, and adherence to the FDA’s current good manufacturing practice requirements, as reflected in its Quality System Regulation, or QSR. Class II devices are intermediate risk devices that are subject to general controls and may also be subject to special controls such as performance standards, product-specific guidance documents, special labeling requirements, patient registries or post-market surveillance. Class III devices are those for which insufficient information exists to assure safety and effectiveness solely through general or special controls, and include life- sustaining, life-supporting, or implantable devices, and devices not “substantially equivalent” to a device that is already legally marketed. Most Class I devices, and some Class II devices are exempted by regulation from the 510(k) clearance requirement and can be marketed without prior authorization from FDA. Class I and Class II devices that have not been so exempted are eligible for marketing through the 510(k) clearance pathway. By contrast, devices placed in Class III generally require premarket approval, or PMA, prior to commercial marketing.
To obtain 510(k) clearance for a medical device, an applicant must submit a premarket notification application to the FDA demonstrating that the device is “substantially equivalent” to a predicate device, which is typically a Class II device that is legally marketed in the United States. A device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device if it has the same intended use and (i) the same technological characteristics, or (ii) has different technological characteristics and the information submitted demonstrates that the device is as safe and effective as a legally marketed device and does not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness. A showing of substantial equivalence sometimes, but not always, requires clinical data. Generally, the 510(k) clearance process can exceed 90 days and may extend to a year or more. After a device has received 510(k) clearance for a specific intended use, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, such as a significant change in the design, materials, method of manufacture or intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or if the device as modified is not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed predicate device PMA. While the determination as to whether new authorization is needed is initially left to the manufacturer, the FDA may review this determination and evaluate the regulatory status of the modified product at any time and may request the manufacturer to cease marketing and recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA is obtained. The manufacturer may also be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.
The second, more comprehensive, approval process applies to a new device that is not substantially equivalent to a predicate device or that is to be used in supporting or sustaining life or preventing impairment. These devices are normally Class III devices requiring PMA. The FDA will approve the PMA application if it finds there is reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended use. The PMA process takes substantially longer than the 510(k) process, approximately one to two years or more.
In some instances, the FDA may find that a device is new and not substantially equivalent to a predicate device but is also not a high-risk device as is generally the case with Class III PMA devices. In these instances, the FDA may allow a device to be reclassified from Class III to Class I or II. The de novo reclassification option is an alternate pathway to classify novel devices of low to moderate risk that had automatically been placed in Class III after receiving a “not substantially equivalent” (NSE) determination in response to a 510(k) notification. The FDCA also allows a sponsor to submit a de novo reclassification request to the FDA for novel low to moderate risk devices without first being required to submit a 510(k) application. These types of applications are referred to as “Evaluation of Automatic Class III Designation” or “de novo.” In instances where a device is deemed not substantially equivalent to a Class II predicate device, the candidate device may be filed as a de novo application which may lead to delays in regulatory decisions by the FDA. FDA review of a de novo application may lead the FDA to identify the device as either a Class I or II device and subject to or exempt from 510(k) premarket notification.
Clinical trials are generally required to support a PMA or de novo reclassification application and are sometimes required for 510(k) clearance. Clinical trials generally require an investigational device exemption application, or IDE, approved in advance by the FDA for a specified number of patients and study sites, unless the product is deemed a non-significant risk device eligible for more abbreviated IDE requirements. Clinical trials are subject to extensive monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting requirements. Clinical trials must be conducted under the oversight of an institutional review board or an IRB, for the relevant clinical trial sites and must comply with FDA regulations, including but not limited to those relating to good clinical practices. Conducting a clinical trial, also requires obtaining the patients' informed consent in form and substance compliant with both FDA requirements and state and federal privacy and human subject protection regulations. The FDA or the IRB could suspend a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the anticipated benefits. Even if a trial is completed, the results of clinical testing may not adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the device or may

otherwise not be sufficient to obtain FDA approval to market the product in the U.S. To date, the Ekso GT has been the subject of several clinical studies, some sponsored by the Company, as well as non-Ekso-sponsored independent studies conducted by rehabilitation institutions. In addition, we are currently conducting several studies to investigate additional indications for use for the Ekso GT, as well as to evaluate clinical and non-clinical outcomes of using the device.
On April 4, 2016, we received clearance from the FDA to market our Ekso GT robotic exoskeleton for use in the treatment of individuals with hemiplegia due to stroke, individuals with SCI at levels T4 to L5, and individuals with SCI at levels of T3 to C7 (ASIA D), in accordance with the device’s labeling. On July 19, 2016, we received clearance from the FDA to expand/clarify the indications and labeling to expressly include individuals with hemiplegia due to stroke who have upper extremity function of at least four-fifths in only one arm. Our prior cleared indications for use statement required that individuals with hemiplegia due to stroke have upper extremity function of at least four-fifths in both arms.
After a device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include:

• | product listing and establishment registration, which helps facilitate FDA inspections and other regulatory action;


• | QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process;


• | labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for un-cleared, unapproved or off-label use or indication;


• | 510(k) clearance of product modifications that could significantly affect safety or efficacy or that would constitute a major change in intended use of one of our cleared devices;


• | medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers comply with FDA requirements to report if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction of the device or a similar device were to recur;


• | post-approval restrictions or conditions, including post-approval study commitments;


• | post-market surveillance regulations, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device;


• | the FDA's recall authority, whereby it can ask, or under certain conditions order, device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulations;


• | regulations pertaining to voluntary recalls; and


• | notices provision regarding corrections or removals.

Advertising and promotion of medical devices, in addition to being regulated by the FDA, are also regulated by the Federal Trade Commission and by state regulatory and enforcement authorities. Recently, promotional activities for FDA-regulated products of other companies have been the subject of enforcement action brought under healthcare reimbursement laws and consumer protection statutes. In addition, under the federal Lanham Act and similar state laws, competitors and others can initiate litigation relating to advertising claims. If the FDA determines that promotional material or training constitute related to an approved device promotion of an un-cleared or unapproved use, it could request that the training or promotional materials related to such device be modified or it could subject the manufacturer to regulatory or enforcement actions. It is also possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they consider our promotional or training materials to constitute promotion of an unapproved use, which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities, such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement. In that event, our reputation could be damaged and adoption of the products would be impaired.
The FDA has broad post-market and regulatory enforcement powers. We are subject to unannounced inspections by the FDA to determine our compliance with the QSR and other regulations.
From September 2, 2015 to September 11, 2015, the Division of Bioresearch Monitoring of the FDA’s Office of Compliance conducted an inspection of the Company’s facility in Richmond, California. At the conclusion of the inspection, the FDA issued a Form FDA 483 with observations pertaining to informed consent requirements, reporting of events to FDA, and records maintenance. These observations are inspectional and do not represent a final FDA determination of non-compliance. On October 2, 2015, we responded to the FDA describing the corrective and preventive actions that we have implemented and continue to implement to address the FDA’s observations. Due to the nature of the findings, we do not expect that the Form FDA 483 will result in a warning letter or other action that could interfere with our operations. On March 30, 2016, the FDA accepted our corrective actions for the Form 483 observations that were generated during the FDA inspection.
Since January 2018, there has been one report of an adverse event relating to our Ekso GT device that was reported to FDA under the Medical Device Reporting system. After analysis it was determined that the device did not malfunction.

Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA or other regulatory authorities, which may result in sanctions including, but not limited to:

• | untitled letters, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;


• | unanticipated expenditures to address or defend such actions


• | customer notifications for repair, replacement, refunds;


• | recall, detention or seizure of our products;


• | operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;


• | refusing or delaying our requests for 510(k) clearance or premarket approval of new products or modified products;


• | operating restrictions;


• | withdrawing 510(k) clearances that have already been granted;


• | refusal to grant export approval for our products; or


• | criminal prosecution.

Foreign Regulation
In addition to regulations in the U.S., we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products in foreign countries. Whether or not the Company obtains FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before the Company can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.
The policies of the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities may change and additional government regulations may be enacted which could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our products and could also increase the cost of regulatory compliance. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse governmental regulation that might arise from future legislative or administrative action, either in the U.S. or abroad.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had 82 employees, including 77 full time employees and five part-time employees. Ten employees reside in Europe. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Corporate Information
We were incorporated as PN Med Group Inc. in Nevada on January 30, 2012. Prior to the Merger and Split-Off (each as defined below), our business was to distribute medical supplies and equipment in Chile.
On January 15, 2014, we consummated the Merger, in which our wholly-owned subsidiary, Ekso Acquisition Corp., a corporation formed in the State of Delaware on January 3, 2014, merged with and into Ekso Bionics, Inc., a corporation incorporated in the State of Delaware on January 19, 2005. Ekso Bionics was the surviving corporation in the Merger and became our wholly-owned subsidiary. All of the outstanding Ekso Bionics' capital stock was converted into shares of our common stock in the Merger.
In connection with the Merger and pursuant to a split-off agreement and general release, we transferred our pre-Merger assets and liabilities to our pre-Merger majority stockholders, in exchange for the surrender by them and cancellation of 2,497,586 shares of our common stock or the Split-Off, after adjusting to give effect to the 1-for-7 reverse stock split, discussed in Note 13 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements, which appear under Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, under the caption Capitalization and Equity Structure – Reverse Stock Split.
As a result of the Merger and Split-Off, we discontinued our pre-Merger business and acquired the business of Ekso Bionics, and have continued the existing business operations of Ekso Bionics as a publicly-traded company under the name Ekso Bionics Holdings, Inc.
