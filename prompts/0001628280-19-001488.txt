Item 1. Business
Robert Half International Inc. (the “Company”) provides specialized staffing and risk consulting services through such divisions as Accountemps®, Robert Half® Finance & Accounting, OfficeTeam®, Robert Half® Technology, Robert Half® Management Resources, Robert Half® Legal, The Creative Group®, and Protiviti®. The Company, through its Accountemps, Robert Half Finance & Accounting, and Robert Half Management Resources divisions, is the world’s largest specialized provider of temporary, full-time, and project professionals in the fields of accounting and finance. OfficeTeam specializes in highly skilled temporary administrative support personnel. Robert Half Technology provides information technology professionals. Robert Half Legal provides temporary, project, and full-time staffing of attorneys and specialized support personnel within law firms and corporate legal departments. The Creative Group provides project staffing in the digital, marketing, and creative fields. Protiviti, which began operations in 2002, is a global business consulting and internal audit firm. Protiviti, which primarily employs professionals specializing in risk, advisory and transactional services, is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.
The Company’s business was originally founded in 1948. Prior to 1986, the Company was primarily a franchisor, under the names Accountemps and Robert Half (now called Robert Half Finance & Accounting), of offices providing temporary and full-time professionals in the fields of accounting and finance. Beginning in 1986, the Company and its current management embarked on a strategy of acquiring franchised locations. All of the franchises have been acquired. The Company believes that direct ownership of offices allows it to better monitor and protect the image of its tradenames, promotes a more consistent and higher level of quality and service throughout its network of offices and improves profitability by centralizing many of its administrative functions. Since 1986, the Company has significantly expanded operations at many of the acquired locations, opened many new locations and acquired other local or regional providers of specialized temporary service personnel. The Company has also expanded the scope of its services by launching the new product lines OfficeTeam, Robert Half Technology, Robert Half Management Resources, Robert Half Legal and The Creative Group.
In 2002, the Company hired more than 700 professionals who had been affiliated with the internal audit and business and technology risk consulting practice of Arthur Andersen LLP, including more than 50 individuals who had been partners of that firm. These professionals formed the base of the Company’s Protiviti Inc. subsidiary. Protiviti® has enabled the Company to enter the market for business consulting and internal audit services, which market the Company believes offers synergies with its traditional lines of business.
Accountemps
The Accountemps temporary services division offers customers a reliable and economical means of dealing with uneven or peak workloads for accounting, finance, and bookkeeping personnel caused by such predictable events as vacations, taking inventories, tax work, month-end activities and special projects, and such unpredictable events as illness and emergencies. Businesses view the use of temporary employees as a means of controlling personnel costs and converting such costs from fixed to variable. The cost and inconvenience to clients of hiring and firing regular employees are eliminated by the use of Accountemps temporaries. The temporary workers are employees of Accountemps and are paid by Accountemps. The customer pays a fixed rate only for hours worked.
Accountemps clients may fill their regular employment needs by using an Accountemps employee on a trial basis and, if so desired, “converting” the temporary position to a regular position. The client typically pays a one-time fee for such conversions.
OfficeTeam
The Company’s OfficeTeam division, which commenced operations in 1991, places temporary and full-time office and administrative personnel, ranging from executive and administrative assistants to receptionists and customer service representatives. OfficeTeam operates in much the same fashion as the Accountemps division.
Robert Half Finance & Accounting
Established in 1948, the Company’s first division and specialized recruitment pioneer Robert Half Finance & Accounting specializes in the placement of full-time accounting, financial, tax and accounting operations personnel. Fees for successful

placements are paid only by the employer and are generally a percentage of the new employee’s annual compensation. No fee for placement services is charged to employment candidates.
Robert Half Technology
The Company’s Robert Half Technology division, which commenced operations in 1994, specializes in providing information technology contract consultants, placing full-time employees, and offering managed services in areas ranging from multiple platform systems integration to end-user technical and desktop support, including specialists in application development (including mobile, cloud and enterprise applications), networking, systems integration and deployment, database design and administration, and security and business continuity.
Robert Half Legal
Since 1992, the Company has been placing temporary and full-time employees in attorney, paralegal, legal administrative and legal secretarial positions through its Robert Half Legal division. The legal profession’s requirements (the need for confidentiality, accuracy and reliability, a strong drive toward cost-effectiveness, and frequent peak caseload periods) are similar to the demands of the clients of the Accountemps division. Robert Half Legal offers a full suite of legal staffing and consulting services to help organizations manage constantly changing workloads and access expertise across in-demand legal practice areas.
Robert Half Management Resources
The Company’s Robert Half Management Resources division, which commenced operations in 1997, specializes in providing senior level project professionals in the accounting and finance fields, including chief financial officers, controllers, senior financial analysts, internal auditors, and business systems analysts for such tasks as financial systems conversions, expansion into new markets, business process reengineering, business systems performance improvement, and post-merger financial consolidation.

The division places freelance and project consultants in a variety of positions such as creative directors, graphics designers, web content developers, web designers, media buyers, brand managers, and public relations specialists.

Organization
Management of the Company’s staffing operations is coordinated from its headquarters facilities in Menlo Park and San Ramon, California. The Company’s headquarters provides support and centralized services to its offices in the administrative, marketing, public relations, accounting, information technology, training and legal areas, particularly as it relates to the standardization of the operating procedures of its offices. As of December 31, 2018, the Company conducted its staffing services operations through 324 offices in 42 states, the District of Columbia and 17 foreign countries. Office managers are responsible for most activities of their offices, including sales, local advertising and marketing and recruitment.
The day-to-day operations of Protiviti are managed by a chief executive officer and a senior management team with operational and administrative support provided by individuals located in San Ramon and Menlo Park, California. As of December 31, 2018, Protiviti had 62 offices in 23 states and 11 foreign countries.
Competition
The Company’s staffing services face competition in attracting clients as well as skilled specialized employment candidates. The staffing business is highly competitive, with a number of firms offering services similar to those provided by the Company on a national, regional or local basis. In many areas the local companies are the strongest competitors. The most significant competitive factors in the staffing business are price and the reliability of service, both of which are often a function of the availability and quality of personnel. The Company believes it derives a competitive advantage from its long experience with and commitment to the specialized employment market, its national presence, and its various marketing activities.
Protiviti faces competition in its efforts to attract clients and win proposal presentations. The risk consulting and internal audit businesses are highly competitive. In addition, the changing regulatory environment is increasing opportunities for non-attestation audit and risk consulting services. The principal competitors of Protiviti remain the “big four” accounting firms. Significant competitive factors include reputation, technology, tools, project methodologies, price of services and depth of skills of personnel. Protiviti believes its competitive strengths lie in its unique ability to couple the deep skills and proven methodologies of its “big four” heritage with the customer focus and attention of a smaller organization.
Employees
The Company has approximately 18,900 full-time employees, including approximately 4,000 engaged directly in Protiviti operations. In addition, the Company placed approximately 212,700 temporary employees on assignments with clients during 2018. Employees placed by the Company on assignment with clients are the Company’s employees for all purposes while they are working on assignments. The Company pays the related costs of employment, such as workers’ compensation insurance, state and federal unemployment taxes, social security and certain fringe benefits. The Company provides access to voluntary health insurance coverage to interested temporary employees.
Other Information
The Company is not dependent upon a single customer or a limited number of customers. The Company’s staffing services operations are generally more active in the first and fourth quarters of a calendar year. Protiviti is generally more active in the third and fourth quarters of a calendar year. Order backlog is not a material aspect of the Company’s staffing services business. While backlog is of greater importance to Protiviti, the Company does not believe, based upon the length of time of 
3

the average Protiviti engagement, that backlog is a material aspect of the Protiviti business. No material portion of the Company’s business is subject to government contracts.
