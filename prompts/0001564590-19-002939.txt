Corporate Structure
 NOW Inc. (“NOW” or the “Company”), headquartered in Houston, Texas, was incorporated in Delaware on November 22, 2013. On May 30, 2014, the spin-off from National Oilwell Varco, Inc. (“NOV”) was completed and NOW became an independent, publicly traded company (the “Spin-Off” or “Separation”). In accordance with a separation and distribution agreement between NOV and NOW, the two companies were separated by NOV distributing to its stockholders 107,053,031 shares of common stock of NOW Inc. with each NOV stockholder receiving one share of NOW common stock for every four shares of NOV common stock held at the close of business on the record date of May 22, 2014 and not sold prior to close of business on May 30, 2014. We filed a registration statement on Form 10, as amended through the time of its effectiveness, describing the Spin-Off, which was declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on May 13, 2014. On June 2, 2014, NOW stock began trading “regular-way” on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “DNOW”.
Overview
 We are a global distributor to the oil and gas and industrial markets with a legacy of over one-hundred and fifty years. We operate primarily under the DistributionNOW and Wilson Export brands. Through our network of approximately 265 locations and approximately 4,500 employees worldwide, we stock and sell a comprehensive offering of energy products as well as a selection of products for industrial applications. Our energy product offering is consumed throughout all sectors of the oil and gas industry – from upstream drilling and completion, exploration and production (“E&P”), midstream infrastructure development to downstream petroleum refining – as well as in other industries, such as chemical processing, mining, utilities and industrial manufacturing operations. The industrial distribution end markets include manufacturing, aerospace, automotive, refineries and engineering and construction firms. We also provide supply chain and materials management solutions to the same markets where we sell products.
 Our global product offering includes consumable maintenance, repair and operating (“MRO”) supplies, pipe, valves, fittings, flanges, gaskets, fasteners, electrical, instrumentation, artificial lift, pumping solutions, valve actuation and modular process, measurement and control equipment. We also offer warehouse and inventory management solutions as part of our supply chain and materials management offering. We have developed expertise in providing application systems, work processes, parts integration, optimization solutions and after-sales support.
 Our solutions include outsourcing portions or entire functions of our customers’ procurement, inventory and warehouse management, logistics, point of issue technology, project management, business process and performance metrics reporting. These solutions allow us to leverage the infrastructure of our SAP™ Enterprise Resource Planning (“ERP”) system and other technologies to streamline our customers’ purchasing process, from requisition to procurement to payment, by digitally managing workflow, improving approval routing and providing robust reporting functionality.

We support land and offshore operations for the major oil and gas producing regions around the world through our network of locations. Our key markets, beyond North America, include Latin America, the North Sea, the Middle East, Asia Pacific and the Former Soviet Union (“FSU”). Products sold through our locations support greenfield expansion upstream capital projects, midstream infrastructure and transmission and MRO consumables used in day-to-day production. We provide downstream energy and industrial products for petroleum refining, chemical processing, LNG terminals, power generation utilities and industrial manufacturing operations and customer on-site locations.
 We stock or sell more than 300,000 stock keeping units (“SKUs”) through our branch network. Our supplier network consists of thousands of vendors in approximately 40 co
untries. From our operations in over 20 countries, we sell to customers operating in approximately 80 countries. The supplies and equipment stocked by each of our branches are customized to meet varied and changing local customer demands. The breadth and scale of our offering enhances our value proposition to our customers, suppliers and shareholders.
 We employ advanced information technologies, including a common ERP platform across most of our business, to provide complete procurement, materials management and logistics coordination to our customers around the globe. Having a common ERP platform allows immediate visibility into our inventory assets, operations and financials worldwide, enhancing decision making and efficiency. 
 Global Operations
 
Demand for our products is driven primarily by the level of oil and gas drilling, completions, servicing, production, transmission, refining and petrochemical and industrial manufacturing activities. It is also influenced by the global supply and demand for energy, the economy in general and by geopolitics. Several factors drive spending, such as investment in energy infrastructure, the North American conventional and shale plays, market expectations of future developments in the oil, natural gas, liquids, refined products, petrochemical, plant maintenance and other industrial, manufacturing and energy sectors.
We have expanded globally, through acquisitions and organic investments, into Australia, Azerbaijan, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Egypt, England, India, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Mexico, Netherlands, Norway, Oman, the Philippines, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Scotland, Singapore, the United Arab Emirates (“UAE”) and the United States.

Summary of Reportable Segments
 We operate through three reportable segments: United States (“U.S.”), Canada and International. The segment data included in our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) are presented on a basis consistent with our internal management reporting. Segment information appearing in Note 14 “Business Segments” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K) is also presented on this basis.
United States
 We have approximately 175 locations in the U.S., which are geographically positioned to best serve the upstream, midstream and downstream energy and industrial markets.
 We offer higher value solutions in key product lines in the U.S. which broaden and deepen our customer relationships and related product line value. Examples of these include artificial lift, pumps, valves and valve actuation, process equipment, fluid transfer products, measurement and controls, along with many other products required by our customers, which enable them to focus on their core business while we manage their supply chain. We also provide additional value to our customers through the design, assembly, fabrication and optimization of products and equipment essential to the safe and efficient production, transportation and processing of oil and gas and industrial manufacturing.
Canada
 We have a network of approximately 55 locations in the Canadian oilfield, predominantly in the oil rich provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan in Western Canada. Our Canada segment primarily serves the energy exploration, production, mining and drilling business, offering customers many of the same products and value-added solutions that we perform in the U.S. In Canada, we also provide training for, and supervise the installation of, jointed and spoolable composite pipe. This product line is supported by inventory and product and installation expertise to serve our customers.
International
 We operate in approximately 20 countries and serve the needs of our international customers from approximately 35 locations outside the U.S. and Canada, which are strategically located in major oil and gas development areas. Our approach in these markets is similar to our approach in North America, as our customers turn to us to provide inventory and support closer to their drilling and exploration activities. Our long legacy of operating in many international regions, combined with significant expansion into several key markets, provides a competitive advantage as few of our competitors have a presence in most of the global energy producing regions.

Distribution Industry Overview
 The distribution industry is highly fragmented, comprised of large companies with global reach and numerous small, local and regional competitors. Distribution companies act both as supply stores and supply chain management providers for their customers. Distributors deliver value to their customers by serving as a supply chain partner by managing vendor networks and aggregating, carrying and distributing a wide range of product inventory from numerous vendors in locations close to the end user.
Our Distribution Channels
 We offer a diverse range of products across the energy and industrial markets in the U.S., Canada and internationally. There are thousands of manufacturers of the products used in the markets in which we operate and customers demand a high level of service, responsiveness and availability across a broad set of products and vendors. These market dynamics make the distributor an essential element in the value chain. Our product offering is aligned to meet the needs of our customer base.
Energy
 Energy branches are brick and mortar supply store operations that provide products to multiple upstream and midstream customers from a single location. These branches serve repeat account and walk-in retail customers. Products are inventoried in branch warehouses based on local market needs and are delivered or available for pick-up as needed. The branches serve a geographical radius and provide delivery of products and solutions.
 This distribution channel primarily serves the upstream and midstream energy, industrial and manufacturing end markets with locations worldwide. A team of sales and operations professionals is trained in the products, applications and customer service required to support customers as they drill, explore, produce, transport and refine oil and gas and other products. Products include line pipe, valves, actuated valves, fittings and flanges, pumps, OEM parts, electrical products, mill supplies, tools, safety supplies, personal protective equipment, applied products and applications, such as artificial lift systems, coatings and miscellaneous expendable items.
 Supply Chain
 Supply Chain locations serve the upstream and downstream energy, industrial and manufacturing end markets through a network of facilities staffed by skilled personnel. The primary product offering includes various grades of pipe, valves, fittings, mill supplies, machine and cutting tools, power and hand tools and safety supplies. Additionally, downstream and industrial focused locations offer safety equipment, including repair and maintenance, and also provide planning, sourcing and expediting of orders throughout the lifecycle of large capital projects. Supply Chain locations serve many oil and gas operators, drilling contractors and industrial manufacturers.
 Supply Chain customers can also outsource supply chain functions to the Company, where we provide a significant vendor network that enables the customer to benefit from on-site management of their procurement, warehouses, inventory, materials, projects, logistics and manufacturing tool cribs. We partner with customers to evaluate their current operations and make informed recommendations regarding inventory levels and mix. Supply Chain solutions can be customized to a customer’s requirements and guided by a strategic framework to reduce direct material expenditures and direct supply chain costs, improve maintenance productivity, reduce inventory-related working capital, streamline time to revenue and manage the risk of material availability affecting business continuity.
 Process Solutions
 Process Solutions has a team of distribution experts, technical professionals and licensed engineers who provide expertise related to pumps and fluid movement solutions, liquid and gas measurement systems, fabrication and valve actuation. Process Solutions distributes OEM equipment including pumps, generator sets, air and gas compressors, dryers, blowers and valves. After-market services include rental, machining and repair service from a team of field mechanics located throughout the central U.S. The team also fabricates customer Lease Automatic Custody Transfer (LACT) units, Vapor Recovery Units, Gas Meter Runs, ASME Code Vessels, PIG Launchers and Receivers and Water Transfer and Disposal Units.
 Process Solutions serves the upstream, midstream and downstream oil and gas markets as well as the municipal industrial, mining, power generation and general industries. Process Solutions also provides modular oil and gas tank battery solutions that positively impact our operator customers by enabling them to expedite revenue generations by reducing the time to complete a tank battery and getting oil and gas into the pipeline earlier. This solution saves our customers time and expense related to well hookup and tank battery commissioning and reduces field incident exposures due to a reduced labor requirement for battery construction.

Customers
 Our primary customers are companies active in the upstream, midstream and downstream sectors of the energy industry, including drilling contractors, well servicing companies, independent and national oil and gas companies, midstream operators, refineries, petrochemical, chemical, utilities and other downstream energy processors. We also serve a diverse range of industrial and manufacturing companies across a broad spectrum of industries and end markets. We partner with our customers to continually meet or exceed their expectations and add value as a supply chain partner in the locations where they operate. Our products are typically critical to our customers’ operations, yet represent only a small fraction of their total project or facility cost. As a result, our customers seek suppliers with established qualifications and an operational history to deliver high quality and reliable products that meet their requirements in a timely manner.
 As customers increasingly aggregate purchases to improve efficiency and reduce costs, they partner with large distributors who can meet their needs for products in multiple locations around the world. We believe we could benefit from consolidation among the companies we serve, as the larger resulting companies look to global distributors as their source for products and related solutions.
 No single customer represents more than 10% of our revenue. 
 Competition
 The distribution companies serving the energy and industrial end markets are both numerous and competitive. This industry is highly fragmented, comprised of large distributors, each with many locations, who aggregate and distribute several product lines, and includes numerous smaller regional and local companies, many of which operate from a single location and either aggregate and distribute several product lines or focus on a single product line. While some large distributors compete in both markets, most companies focus on either the energy or industrial end market. In the energy market, some of the larger companies against whom we compete include Ferguson Enterprises, Inc., MRC Global, Inc., Russel Metals, Inc., DXP Enterprises, Inc. and FloWorks. In the industrial market, some of the larger companies against whom we compete include Ferguson Enterprises, Inc., W.W. Grainger Inc., HD Supply, Inc., Wesco International Inc., MSC Industrial Direct Co., Inc., Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc., DXP Enterprises, Inc. and Fastenal Company.
Seasonal Nature of the Company’s Business
 A portion of our business has experienced seasonal trends, to some degree, which have varied by geographic region. In the U.S., activity has historically been higher during the summer and fall months. In Canada, certain E&P activities have declined in the spring due to seasonal thaws and regulatory restrictions limiting the ability of drilling rigs and transportation to operate effectively and safely during these periods.
Employees
 At December 31, 2018, we had approximately 4,500 employees, of which approximately 200 were temporary employees. Some of our employees in various foreign locations are subject to collective bargaining agreements. Less than one percent of our employees in the U.S. are subject to collective bargaining agreements. We offer market-competitive benefits for employees and opportunities for growth and advancement. We believe our relationship with our employees is good.
Environmental Matters
 We are subject to a variety of federal, state, local, foreign and provincial environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and permitting requirements, including those governing the discharge of pollutants or hazardous substances into the air, soil or water, the generation, handling, use, management, storage and disposal of, or exposure to, hazardous substances and wastes, the responsibility to investigate, remediate, monitor and clean up contamination and occupational health and safety. Fines and penalties may be imposed for non-compliance with applicable environmental, health and safety requirements and the failure to have or to comply with the terms and conditions of required permits. Historically, the costs to comply with environmental and health and safety requirements have not been material to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We are not aware of any pending environmental compliance or remediation matters that, in the opinion of management, are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our business, financial position or results of operations or cash flows.
