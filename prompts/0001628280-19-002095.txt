Item 1. | BUSINESS

General
Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation, doing business as Wabtec Corporation, is a Delaware corporation with headquarters at 1001 Air Brake Avenue in Wilmerding, Pennsylvania. Our telephone number is 412-825-1000, and our website is located at www.wabtec.com. All references to “we”, “our”, “us”, the “Company” and “Wabtec” refer to Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. George Westinghouse founded the original Westinghouse Air Brake Co. in 1869 when he invented the air brake. Westinghouse Air Brake Company (“WABCO”) was formed in 1990 when it acquired certain assets and operations from American Standard, Inc., now known as Trane (“Trane”). The company went public on the New York Stock Exchange in 1995. In 1999, WABCO merged with MotivePower Industries, Inc. and adopted the name Wabtec.
On May 20, 2018, the Company entered into a transaction that resulted in the merger of Wabtec and GE Transportation, a business unit of General Electric Company. The merger of Wabtec and GE Transportation was completed on February 25, 2019. To effect the transaction, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with General Electric Company (“GE”), Transportation Systems Holdings Inc. (“SpinCo”), which was a newly formed wholly owned subsidiary of GE, and Wabtec US Rail Holdings, Inc. (“Merger Sub”), which is a newly formed wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. In addition, on May 20, 2018, GE, SpinCo, the Company and Wabtec US Rail Holdings, Inc. (“Direct Sale Purchaser”), entered into the Separation, Distribution and Sale Agreement (the “Separation Agreement”). Together, the Merger Agreement and the Separation Agreement provided for the combination of the Company and GE’s realigned transportation business (“GE Transportation”). GE Transportation (www.getransportation.com) is a global technology leader and supplier of locomotives, equipment, services and digital solutions to the rail, mining, marine, stationary power and drilling industries. GE Transportation employs approximately 9,000 employees worldwide and had 2018 sales of about $3.9 billion. Wabtec expects the transactions to have the following strategic benefits:

• | Increased Scale and Diversification of Wabtec’s Product Portfolio. As a result of the Transactions, Wabtec expects the combined business to be one of the world’s largest providers of technology-enabled equipment, systems and services for the locomotive, freight and passenger rail industries with approximately $8.0 billion in revenue and 25,000 employees in 52 countries.


• | Complementary Digital Technologies. GE Transportation will contribute a comprehensive digital portfolio and leading engineering and technical intellectual property to Wabtec, providing electronics and digital technologies that position the combined company to meet growing demand for train intelligence and network optimization.


• | Enhanced Aftermarket and Services Opportunities. The combined entity will have an installed base of more than 23,000 locomotives and content on virtually all North American locomotives and freight cars, which enables significant opportunities in the high-margin aftermarket parts and services business and mitigates the combined company’s exposure to cycles.


• | Significant Operating Synergies. The consummation of the transactions is expected to generate $250 million annual run-rate operating synergies, driven by cost and revenue opportunities, within four years after closing.


• | Improved Financial Profile. The consummation of the transactions will enhance Wabtec’s margins and revenue growth opportunities with strong free cash flow generation to enable strategic deleveraging through debt reduction and earnings growth.

In 2017, Wabtec completed the acquisition of Faiveley Transport, S.A. (“Faiveley Transport”), a leading provider of value-added, integrated systems and services, primarily for the global transit rail market, for a purchase price of approximately $1.5 billion. Based in France, Faiveley Transport has roots to 1919 and became a leader in manufacturing pantographs, automatic door mechanisms and air conditioning systems. Faiveley Transport was listed on the Paris Stock Exchange in 1994 and during the next 20 years acquired a number of rail industry leaders including Sab Wabco, a specialist in railway braking systems and couplers. Wabtec believes that the acquisition of Faiveley Transport provided the following strategic benefits:

• | Increased diversity of revenues by product, geography and market. A majority of Faiveley Transport’s revenues are outside the U.S. and in the transit market, which helps to balance the cyclicality of our North American freight business. 


• | Broadened product line. Faiveley Transport provides many products that we did not previously offer, including braking and door systems for high-speed trains and air conditioning systems. 


• | Expanded international presence in the transit market. A majority of Faiveley Transport’s revenues come from transit markets outside the U.S., where we previously did not have a strong presence.

• | Increased technical and engineering expertise. Faiveley Transport strengthens Wabtec's technical capabilities and product development efforts. 

Today, we are one of the world’s largest providers of value-added, technology-based equipment, systems and services for the global passenger transit and freight rail industries. We believe we hold a leading market share for many of our core product lines globally. Our highly engineered products, which are intended to enhance safety, improve productivity and reduce maintenance costs for customers, can be found on most locomotives, freight cars, passenger transit cars and buses around the world. In 2018, the Company had sales of approximately $4.4 billion and net income attributable to our shareholders of about $294.9 million. In 2018, sales of aftermarket parts and services represented about 57% of total sales, while sales to customers outside of the U.S. accounted for about 67% of total sales.
Industry Overview
The Company primarily serves the global passenger transit and freight rail industries. As such, our operating results are largely dependent on the level of activity, financial condition and capital spending plans of passenger transit agencies and freight railroads around the world, and transportation equipment manufacturers who serve those markets. Many factors influence these industries, including general economic conditions; traffic volumes, as measured by freight carloadings and passenger ridership; government spending on public transportation; and investment in new technologies. In general, trends such as increasing urbanization and growth in developing markets, a focus on sustainability and environmental awareness, increasing investment in technology solutions, an aging equipment fleet, and growth in global trade are expected to drive continued investment in passenger transit and freight rail.
According to the 2018 bi-annual edition of a market study by UNIFE, the Association of the European Rail Industry, the accessible global market for railway products and services was more than $100 billion and was expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 2.6% through 2023. The three largest geographic markets, which represented about 80% of the total accessible market, were Europe, North America and Asia Pacific. UNIFE projected above-average growth rates in North America, Latin America and Africa/Middle East, with Asia Pacific and Europe growing at about the industry average. UNIFE said trends such as urbanization and increasing mobility, deregulation, investments in new technologies, energy and environmental issues, and increasing government support continue to drive investment. The largest product segments of the market were rolling stock, services and infrastructure, which represent almost 90% of the accessible market. UNIFE projected spending on turnkey management projects and infrastructure to grow at above-average rates. UNIFE estimated that the global installed base of locomotives was about 114,000 units, with about 33% in Asia Pacific, about 26% in North America and about 18% in Russia-CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States).  Wabtec estimates that about 2,500 new locomotives were delivered worldwide in 2018, and we expect deliveries of about 2,900 in 2019. UNIFE estimated the global installed base of freight cars was about 5.1 million, with about 33% in North America, about 26% in Asia Pacific and about 24% in Russia-CIS. Wabtec estimates that about 175,000 new freight cars were delivered worldwide in 2018, and we expect deliveries of about 174,000 in 2019.  UNIFE estimated the global installed base of passenger transit vehicles to be about 600,000 units, with about 45% in Asia Pacific, about 33% in Europe and about 12% in Russia-CIS. Wabtec estimates that about 30,000 new passenger transit vehicles were ordered worldwide in 2018, and we expect orders of about the same number in 2019.
In Europe, the majority of the rail system serves the passenger transit market, which is expected to continue growing as energy and environmental factors encourage continued investment in public mass transit. According to UNIFE, France, Germany and the United Kingdom were the largest Western European transit markets, representing almost two-thirds of industry spending in the European Union. UNIFE projected the accessible Western European rail market to grow at about 2.3% annually, led by investments in new rolling stock in France and Germany.  About 75% of freight traffic in Europe is hauled by truck, while rail accounts for about 20%. The largest freight markets in Europe are Germany, Poland and the United Kingdom. In recent years, the European Commission has adopted a series of measures designed to increase the efficiency of the European rail network by standardizing operating rules and certification requirements. UNIFE believes that adoption of these measures should have a positive effect on ridership and investment in public transportation over time.
In North America, railroads carry about 40% of intercity freight, as measured by ton-miles, which is more than any other mode of transportation. Through direct ownership and operating partnerships, U.S. railroads are part of an integrated network that includes railroads in Canada and Mexico, forming what is regarded as the world’s most-efficient and lowest-cost freight rail service. There are more than 500 railroads operating in North America, with the largest railroads, referred to as “Class I,” accounting for more than 90% of the industry’s revenues. The railroads carry a wide variety of commodities and goods, including coal, metals, minerals, chemicals, grain, and petroleum.  These commodities represent about 50% of total rail carloadings, with intermodal carloads accounting for the rest. Railroads operate in a competitive environment, especially with the trucking industry, and are always seeking ways to improve safety, cost and reliability. New technologies offered by Wabtec and others in the industry can provide some of these benefits. Demand for our freight related products and services in North America is driven by a number of factors, including rail traffic, and production of new locomotives and new freight cars.  In the U.S., the passenger transit industry is dependent largely on funding from federal, state and local governments, and from fare 
4

box revenues. Demand for North American passenger transit products is driven by a number of factors, including government funding, deliveries of new subway cars and buses, and ridership. The U.S. federal government provides money to local transit authorities, primarily to fund the purchase of new equipment and infrastructure for their transit systems. 
Growth in the Asia Pacific market has been driven mainly by the continued urbanization of China and India, and by investments in freight rail rolling stock and infrastructure in Australia to serve its mining and natural resources markets. India is making significant investments in rolling stock and infrastructure to modernize its rail system; for example, the country has awarded a 1,000-unit locomotive order to GE Transportation
Other key geographic markets include Russia-CIS and Africa-Middle East.  With about 1.2 million freight cars and about 20,000 locomotives, Russia-CIS is among the largest freight rail markets in the world, and it’s expected to invest in both freight and transit rolling stock. PRASA, the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa, is expected to continue to invest in new transit cars and new locomotives. According to UNIFE, emerging markets were expected to grow at above-average rates as global trade led to increased freight volumes and urbanization led to increased demand for efficient mass-transportation systems. As this growth occurs, Wabtec expects to have additional opportunities to provide products and services in these markets.
In its study, UNIFE also said it expected increased investment in digital tools for data and asset management, and in rail control technologies, both of which would improve efficiency in the global rail industry. UNIFE said data-driven asset management tools have the potential to reduce equipment maintenance costs and improve asset utilization, while rail control technologies have been focused on increasing track capacity, improving operational efficiency and ensuring safer railway traffic. Wabtec offers products and services to help customers make ongoing investments in these initiatives.
Business Segments and Products
We provide our products and services through two principal business segments, the Transit Segment and the Freight Segment, both of which have different market characteristics and business drivers. The acquisition of Faiveley Transport significantly strengthened our capabilities and presence in the worldwide transit market.
The Transit Segment primarily manufactures and services components for new and existing passenger transit vehicles, typically regional trains, high speed trains, subway cars, light-rail vehicles and buses; supplies rail control and infrastructure products including electronics, positive train control equipment, and signal design and engineering services; builds new commuter locomotives; and refurbishes passenger transit vehicles. Customers include public transit authorities and municipalities, leasing companies, and manufacturers of passenger transit vehicles and buses around the world. Demand in the transit market is primarily driven by general economic conditions, passenger ridership levels, government spending on public transportation, and investment in new rolling stock. In 2018, the Transit Segment accounted for 64% of our total sales, with about 22% of its sales in the U.S. Approximately two-thirds of the Transit Segment’s sales are in the aftermarket with the remainder in the original equipment market. The addition of Faiveley Transport’s key products strengthened Wabtec's presence in the following areas: high-speed braking and door systems; heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems; pantographs and power collection; information systems; platform screen doors and gates; couplers; and aftermarket services, maintenance and spare parts. Geographically, Faiveley Transport significantly strengthened Wabtec’s presence in the European and Asia Pacific transit markets. 
The Freight Segment primarily manufactures and services components for new and existing locomotives and freight cars; supplies rail control and infrastructure products including electronics, positive train control equipment, and signal design and engineering services; overhauls locomotives; and provides heat exchangers and cooling systems for rail and other industrial markets. Customers include large, publicly traded railroads, leasing companies, manufacturers of original equipment such as locomotives and freight cars, and utilities. Demand is primarily driven by general economic conditions and industrial activity; traffic volumes, as measured by freight carloadings; investment in new technologies; and deliveries of new locomotives and freight cars. In 2018, the Freight Segment accounted for 36% of our total sales, with about 54% of its sales in the U.S. In 2018, slightly more than half of the Freight Segment’s sales were in the aftermarket.

For additional information on our business segments, see Note 22 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report.
Competitive Strengths
Our key strengths include:

• | Leading market positions in core products. Dating back to 1869 and George Westinghouse’s invention of the air brake, we are an established leader in the development and manufacture of pneumatic braking equipment for freight and passenger transit vehicles. Faiveley Transport, founded 100 years ago, has a long history and is a market leader for its core products, including pantographs, automatic door mechanisms and air conditioning systems. We have leveraged our leading positions by focusing on research and engineering to expand beyond pneumatic braking components to supplying integrated parts and assemblies for the locomotive through the end of the train. We are a recognized leader in the development and production of electronic recording, measuring and communications systems, positive train control equipment, highly engineered compressors and heat exchangers for locomotives, and a leading manufacturer of freight car components, including electronic braking equipment, draft gears, trucks, brake shoes and electronic end-of-train devices. We are also a leading provider of braking equipment; heating, ventilation and air conditioning equipment; door assemblies and platform screen doors; lifts and ramps; couplers and current collection equipment, such as pantographs, for passenger transit vehicles.

• | Breadth of product offering with a stable mix of original equipment market (OEM) and aftermarket business. Our product portfolio is one of the broadest in the rail industry, as we offer a wide selection of quality parts, components and assemblies across the entire train and worldwide. We provide our products in both the original equipment market and the aftermarket. Our substantial installed base of products with end-users such as the railroads and the passenger transit authorities is a significant competitive advantage for providing products and services to the aftermarket because these customers often look to purchase safety- and performance-related replacement parts from the original equipment components supplier. In addition, as OEMs and railroad operators attempt to modernize fleets with new products designed to improve and maintain safety and efficiency, these products must be designed to be interoperable with existing equipment. On average, over the last several years, about 58% of our total net sales have come from our aftermarket products and services business.


• | Leading design and engineering capabilities. We believe a hallmark of our relationship with our customers has been our leading design and engineering practice, which has assisted in the improvement and modernization of global railway equipment. We believe both our customers and the government authorities value our technological capabilities and commitment to innovation, as we seek not only to enhance the efficiency and profitability of our customers, but also to improve the overall safety of the railways through continuous improvement of product performance. The Company has an established record of product improvements and new product development. We have assembled a wide range of patented products, which we believe provides us with a competitive advantage. Wabtec currently owns 3,333 active patents worldwide. During the last three years, we have filed for approximately 443 patents worldwide in support of our new and evolving product lines.


• | Experience with industry regulatory requirements. The freight rail and passenger transit industries are governed by various government agencies and regulators in each country and region. These groups mandate rigorous manufacturer certification, new product testing and approval processes that we believe are difficult for new entrants to meet cost-effectively and efficiently without the scale and extensive experience we possess. Certification processes are lengthy, and often require local presence and expertise. In addition, each transit agency places a high degree of importance on vehicle customization, which requires experience and technical expertise to meet ever-evolving specifications. 


• | Experienced management team and the Wabtec Excellence Program (WEP) Wabtec’s lean manufacturing and continuous improvement initiatives, known as the Wabtec Excellence Program, have been a part of the Company’s culture for more than 25 years and have enabled Wabtec to manage successfully through cycles in the rail supply market. We believe that, over time, the application of WEP initiatives has resulted in a reduced cost structure and standardized excellence in all processes. We believe that using WEP as our operational foundation will foster state-of-the-art processes and continuous improvement, promote a constant pursuit of quality, and drive practical innovations and best-in-class, modern manufacturing.

Business strategy
Using WEP, we strive to generate sufficient cash to invest in our growth strategies and to build on what we consider to be a leading position as a low-cost producer in the industry while maintaining world-class product quality, technology and customer responsiveness. Through WEP and employee-directed initiatives such as Kaizen, a Japanese-developed team concept, we continuously strive to improve quality, delivery and productivity, and to reduce costs utilizing global sourcing and supply chain management. These practices enable us to streamline processes, improve product reliability and customer satisfaction, reduce product cycle times and respond more rapidly to market developments. We also rely on functional experts within the Company across various disciplines to train, coach and share best practices throughout the corporation, while benchmarking against best-in-class competitors and peers. Over time, we believe the principles of WEP will enable us to continue to increase operating margins, improve cash flow and strengthen our ability to invest in the following growth strategies:

• | Product innovation and new technologies. We continue to emphasize innovation and development funding to create new products and capabilities, such as vehicle monitoring and data analytics. WabtecONE is a multi-year initiative to build on our existing expertise and technologies in electronics. In addition, we invest in developing enhancements and new features to existing products, such as brake discs and heat exchangers. We are focusing on technological advances, especially in the areas of electronics, braking products and other on-board equipment, as a means to deliver new product growth. We seek to provide customers with incremental technological advances that offer immediate benefits with cost-effective investments.


• | Global and market expansion. We believe that international markets represent a significant opportunity for future growth. In 2018, sales to non-U.S. customers were approximately $2.9 billion. We intend to increase international sales through direct sales of existing products to current and new customers, by developing specific new products for application in new geographic markets, by making strategic acquisitions, and through joint ventures with railway suppliers which have a strong presence in their local markets. In transit, we are focused on mature markets such as Europe and emerging markets such as India. In freight, we are targeting markets that operate significant fleets of U.S.-

7

style locomotives and freight cars, including Australia, Brazil, China, India, Russia, South Africa, and other select areas within Europe and South America. In addition, we have opportunities to increase the sale of certain products that we currently manufacture for the rail industry into other industrial markets, such as mining, off-highway and energy. These products include heat exchangers and friction materials.

• | Aftermarket products and services. Historically, aftermarket sales are less cyclical than OEM sales because a certain level of aftermarket maintenance and service work must be performed, even during an industry slowdown. In 2018, Wabtec’s aftermarket sales and services represented approximately 57% of the Company’s total sales across both of our business segments. As a long time supplier of original equipment, we have an extensive installed base of equipment in the field, which generates recurring aftermarket sales. Wabtec provides aftermarket parts and services for its components, and we seek to expand this business with customers who currently perform the work in-house. In this way, we expect to benefit as transit authorities and railroads outsource certain maintenance and overhaul functions.


• | Acquisitions, joint ventures and alliances. We continue to invest in acquisitions, joint ventures and alliances using a disciplined, selective approach and rigorous financial criteria. These transactions are expected to meet our financial criteria and contribute to growth strategies of product innovation and new technologies, global expansion, and aftermarket products and services. We believe these expansion strategies will help Wabtec to grow profitably, expand geographically, and dampen the impact from potential cycles in the North American freight rail industry.

Recent Acquisitions and Joint Ventures
See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Backlog
The Company’s backlog was about $4.5 billion at December 31, 2018. For 2018, about 57% of total sales came from aftermarket orders, which typically carry lead times of less than 30 days and are not recorded in backlog for a significant period of time.
The Company’s contracts are subject to standard industry cancellation provisions, including cancellations on short notice or upon completion of designated stages. Generally, if a customer were to cancel a contract we would have an enforceable right to payment for work completed up to the date of cancellation which would include a reasonable profit margin. Substantial scope-of-work adjustments are common. For these and other reasons, completion of the Company’s backlog may be delayed or canceled. The railroad industry, in general, has historically been subject to fluctuations due to overall economic conditions and the level of use of alternative modes of transportation.
The backlog of firm customer orders as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, and the expected year of completion are as follows:

 | Total | | Expected Delivery | | Total | | Expected Delivery
 | Backlog | | | | Other | | Backlog | | | Other
In thousands | 12/31/2018 | | 2019 | | Years | | 12/31/2017 | 2018 | | Years
Freight Segment | $ | 664,657 | | | $ | 503,528 | | $ | 161,129 | | $ | 549,188 | | $ | 423,805 | $ | 125,383 
Transit Segment | 3,816,925 | | | 1,954,573 | | | 1,862,352 | | 4,050,460 | | 1,891,079 | | 2,159,381 | 
Total | $ | 4,481,582 | | | $ | 2,458,101 | | $ | 2,023,481 | | $ | 4,599,648 | | $ | 2,314,884 | $ | 2,284,764

Engineering and Development
To execute our strategy to develop new products, we invest in a variety of engineering and development activities. For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we invested about $87.5 million, $95.2 million and $71.4 million, respectively, on product development and improvement activities. The engineering resources of the Company are allocated between research and development activities and the execution of original equipment customer contracts. Across the corporation we have established multiple Centers of Competence, which have specialized, technical expertise in various disciplines and product areas.
 Our engineering and development program includes investments in data analytics, train control and other new technologies, with an emphasis on developing products that enhance safety, productivity and efficiency for our customers. For example, we have developed advanced cooling systems that enable lower emissions from diesel engines used in rail and other industrial markets.  Sometimes we conduct specific research projects in conjunction with universities, customers and other industry suppliers.
We use our Product Development System to develop and monitor new product programs. The system requires the product development team to follow consistent steps throughout the development process, from concept to launch, to ensure the product will meet customer expectations and internal profitability targets.

Positive Train Control ("PTC")
 PTC is a collision-avoidance system that uses GPS to monitor and control the movement of passenger and freight trains. In 2008, the U.S. mandated the use of PTC on a majority of the locomotives and track in the U.S. The Federal Railroad Administration (the "FRA") eventually approved the use of Wabtec’s Electronic Train Management System® as the on-board locomotive standard for the deployment of this technology. Our system includes an on-board locomotive computer and related software. The deadline to implement this technology was December 31, 2018, and we worked with the U.S. Class I railroads, commuter rail authorities and other industry suppliers to meet this deadline. Under certain conditions, the deadline could be extended through 2019 and 2020. In 2018, Wabtec recorded about $395 million of revenue from freight and transit train control and signaling projects, which includes PTC. 
Intellectual Property
We have 3,333 active patents worldwide and on average file for approximately 150 new patents each year. We also rely on a combination of trade secrets and other intellectual property laws, nondisclosure agreements and other protective measures to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our intellectual property. We also follow the product development practices of our competitors to monitor any possible patent infringement by them, and to evaluate their strategies and plans. 
Certain trademarks, among them the name WABCO®, were acquired or licensed from American Standard Inc., now known as Trane, in 1990 at the time of our acquisition of the North American operations of the Railway Products Group of Trane. Other trademarks have been developed through the normal course of business or acquired as a part of our ongoing merger and acquisition program.
We have entered into a variety of license agreements as licensor and licensee. We do not believe that any single license agreement is of material importance to our business or either of our business segments as a whole.
We have issued licenses to the two sole suppliers of railway air brakes and related products in Japan, Nabtesco and Mitsubishi Electric Company. The licensees pay annual license fees to us and also assist us by acting as liaisons with key Japanese passenger transit vehicle builders for projects in North America. We believe that our relationships with these licensees are beneficial to our core transit business and customer relationships in North America.
Customers
We provide products and services for more than 500 customers worldwide. Our customers include passenger transit authorities and railroads throughout North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, South Africa and South America; manufacturers of transportation equipment, such as locomotives, freight cars, passenger transit vehicles and buses; and companies that lease and maintain such equipment.
Top customers can change from year to year. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, our top five customers accounted for approximately 15% of net sales: Bombardier, Inc., Alstom, the Greenbrier Companies, Indian Railways and Trinity Industries. No one customer represents 10% or more of consolidated sales. We believe that we have strong relationships with all of our key customers.
Competition
We believe we hold a leading market share for many of our core product lines globally, although market shares vary by product lines and geographies. We operate in a highly competitive marketplace. Price competition is strong because we have a relatively small number of customers and they are very cost-conscious. In addition to price, competition is based on product performance and technological leadership, quality, reliability of delivery, and customer service and support.
Our principal competitors vary across product lines and geographies. Within North America, New York Air Brake Company, a subsidiary of the German air brake producer Knorr-Bremse AG (“Knorr”) and Amsted Rail Company, Inc., a subsidiary of Amsted Industries Corporation, are our principal overall OEM competitors. Our competition for locomotive, freight and passenger transit service and repair is mostly from the railroads’ and passenger transit authorities’ in-house operations, Electro-Motive Diesel, a division of Caterpillar, and New York Air Brake/Knorr. We believe our key strengths, which include leading market positions in core products, breadth of product offering with a stable mix of OEM and aftermarket business, leading design and engineering capabilities, significant barriers to entry and an experienced management team, enable us to compete effectively in this marketplace. Outside of North America, Knorr is our main competitor, although not in every product line or geography. In addition, our competitors often include smaller, local suppliers in most international markets. Depending on the product line and geography, we can also compete with our customers, such as CRRC Corporation Limited, a China-based manufacturer of rolling stock.

Employees
At December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 18,000 full-time employees around the world. This figure includes employees subject to collective bargaining agreements, most of which are outside of North America. We consider our relations with employees and union representatives to be good but cannot assure that future contract negotiations and labor relations will be so.
Regulation
 In the course of our operations, we are subject to various regulations and standards of governments and other agencies in the U.S. and around the world. These entities typically govern equipment, safety and interoperability standards for passenger transit and freight rail rolling stock, oversee a wide variety of rules and regulations governing safety and design of equipment, and evaluate certification and qualification requirements for suppliers.  New products generally must undergo testing and approval processes that are rigorous and lengthy. As a result of these regulations and requirements, we must usually obtain and maintain certifications in a variety of jurisdictions and countries.  The governing bodies include the FRA and the Association of American Railroads ("AAR") in the U.S., and the International Union of Railways (“UIC”) and the European Railway Agencies in Europe. Also, in Europe, the European Committees for Standardization continually draft new European standards which cover, for example, the Reliability, Availability, Maintainability and Safety of railways systems. To guarantee interoperability in Europe, the European Union for Railway Agencies is responsible for defining and implementing Technical Standards of Interoperability, which covers areas such as infrastructure, energy, rolling stock, telematic applications, traffic operation and management subsystems, noise pollution and waste generation, protection against fire and smoke, and system safety.
Most countries and regions in which Wabtec does business have similar rule-making bodies. In Russia, a GOST-R certificate of conformity is mandatory for all products related to the safety of individuals in Russian territory. In China, any product or system sold on the Chinese market must have been certified in accordance with national standards. In the local Indian market, most products are covered by regulations patterned after AAR and UIC standards.
Effects of Seasonality
Our business is not typically seasonal.
