 Overview of Lending Business
 Trustmark categorizes loans on its balance sheet into three categories.  These categories are described in more detail in Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies included in Part II. Item 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.

• | Loans Held for Investment (LHFI) – Loans originally underwritten by Trustmark that do not constitute loans held for sale or acquired loans.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Loans Held for Sale (LHFS) – Mortgage loans purchased from wholesale customers or originated in Trustmark’s General Banking Segment, other than mortgage loans that are retained in the LHFI portfolio based on banking relationships or certain investment strategies.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Acquired Loans – Loans acquired by Trustmark, either pursuant to the acquisition of another bank or pursuant to an acquisition of some or all of another bank’s loan portfolio as well as loans acquired by Trustmark in a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)-assisted transaction and that are covered under a loss-share agreement with the FDIC.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The following discussion briefly summarizes Trustmark’s lending business by focusing on LHFI and LHFS, and includes a discussion of the risks inherent in these loans, Trustmark’s underwriting policies for its loans and the characteristics of the real estate loan component of these loans.  Acquired loans and covered loans are excluded from this summary, as Trustmark did not underwrite those loans at inception.  Discussion of Trustmark’s acquired loans, including covered loans, is contained elsewhere in this report.
 As a general matter, extending credit to businesses and consumers exposes Trustmark to credit risk, which is the risk that the principal balance and any related interest may not be collected according to the original terms due to the inability or unwillingness of the borrower to repay the loan.  Trustmark mitigates credit risk through a set of internal controls, which includes adherence to 
 5

conservative lending practices and underwriting guidelines, collateral monitoring, and oversight of its borrower’s financial performance and collateral.  The risks inherent in specific subsets of lending are discussed below.
 LHFI Secured by Construction, Land Development, and Other Land – Construction and land development loans include loans for both commercial and residential properties to builders/developers and to consumers.  This category also includes loans secured by vacant land, except land known to be used or usable for agricultural purposes, such as crop and livestock production.  Repayment is normally derived from the sale of the underlying property or from permanent financing, which refinances Trustmark’s initial loan.  Trustmark’s engagement in this type of lending is generally extended to those builders and developers exhibiting the highest credit quality with significant equity invested in the project and is primarily restricted to projects within Trustmark’s geographic markets.  The underwriting process for these loans includes analysis of the financial position and strength of both the borrower and guarantor, experience with similar projects in the past, market demand and prospects for successful completion of the proposed project within the established budget and schedule, values of underlying collateral and availability of permanent financing.  Risk within this portfolio is mitigated through adherence to policies and lending limits, periodic target credit reviews of the different segments of this portfolio, inspection of projects throughout the life of the loan and routine monitoring of financial information and collateral values as they are updated.
 Inherent in real estate construction lending is the risk that the full value of the collateral does not exist at the time the loan is granted.  Construction lending also inherently includes the risk associated with a borrower’s ability to successfully complete a proposed project on time and within budget.  Further, adverse changes in the market occurring between the start of construction and completion of the projects can result in slower sales or rental rates and lower sales prices than originally anticipated which could impact the underlying real estate collateral values and timely and full repayment of these loans.  Rising interest rates can adversely affect the cost of construction and the financial viability of real estate projects.  Higher interest rates may also result in higher capitalization rates, thereby reducing a property’s value.  As a result of this risk profile, LHFI secured by construction, land development and other land are considered to be higher risks than other real estate loans.
 LHFI and LHFS Secured by Residential Properties – Residential real estate loans consist of first and junior liens on residential properties that are extended in the geographic markets in which Trustmark operates as well as mortgage products, originated and purchased, that are underwritten to secondary market standards.  Credit underwriting standards include evaluation of the borrower’s credit history and repayment capacity, including verification of income and valuation of collateral.  Portfolio performance is continuously evaluated through updated credit bureau scores and monitoring of repayment performance.
 Credit performance of consumer residential real estate loans is highly dependent on housing values and household income which, in turn are highly dependent on national, regional and local economic factors.  Rising interest rates, rising unemployment rates and other adverse changes in these economies may have a negative effect on the ability of Trustmark’s borrowers to repay these loans and negatively affect value of the underlying residential real estate collateral.
 LHFI Secured by Nonfarm, Nonresidential Properties – Trustmark provides financing for both owner-occupied commercial real estate as well as income-producing commercial real estate.  Trustmark seeks to maintain a balance of owner-occupied and income-producing real estate loans that moderates its risk to the specific risks of each type of loan.  Commercial real estate term loans are typically collateralized by liens on real property.  Both types of commercial real estate loans are underwritten to lending policies that include maximum loan-to-value ratios, minimum equity requirements, acceptable amortization periods and minimum debt service coverage requirements, based on property type.  Income-producing commercial real estate loans also generally require substantial equity and are subject to exposure limits for a single project.  All exceptions to established guidelines are subject to stringent internal review and require specific approval.  As with commercial loans, the borrower’s financial strength and capacity to repay their obligations remain the primary focus of underwriting.  Financial strength is evaluated based upon analytical tools that consider historical and projected cash flows and performance in addition to analysis of the proposed project for income-producing properties.  Additional support offered by guarantors is also considered.
 Risk for owner-occupied commercial real estate is driven by the creditworthiness of the underlying borrowers, particularly cash flow from the borrowers’ business operations as well as the risk of a shortfall in collateral.  Credit performance of loans secured by commercial income-producing real estate can be negatively affected by national, regional and local economic conditions, which may result in deteriorating tenant credit profiles, tenant losses, reduced rental/lease rates and higher than anticipated vacancy rates, all contributing to declines in value or liquidity of the underlying real estate collateral.  Other factors, such as increasing interest rates, may result in higher capitalization rates, thereby reducing a property’s value.
 Commercial and Industrial LHFI – Commercial loans (other than commercial loans related to real estate assets, which are summarized above) are made to many types of businesses for various purposes, such as short-term working capital loans that are usually secured by accounts receivable and inventory, equipment and fixed asset purchases that are secured by those assets and term financing for those within Trustmark’s geographic markets.  Trustmark’s credit underwriting process for commercial loans includes analysis of historical and projected cash flows and performance, evaluation of financial strength of both borrowers and guarantors as 
 6

reflected in current and detailed financial information and evaluation of underlying collateral to support the credit.  Credit risk within the commercial loan portfolio is managed through adherence to specific commercial lending policies and internally established lending authorities, diversification within the portfolio and monitoring of the portfolio on a continuing basis.
 Credit risk in commercial and industrial loans can arise due to fluctuations in borrowers’ financial condition, deterioration in collateral values and changes in market conditions.  The credit risk inherent in these loans depends on, to a significant degree, the general economic conditions of these areas.  Further, credit risk can increase if Trustmark’s loans are concentrated to borrowers engaged in the same or similar activities, or to groups of borrowers who may be uniquely or disproportionately affected by market or economic conditions.
 Consumer LHFI – Consumer credit includes loans to individuals for household and personal items, automobile purchases, unsecured loans, personal lines of credit and credit cards.  All consumer loans are subject to a standardized underwriting process through Trustmark’s consumer loan center, which uses a custom credit scoring model with emphasis placed upon the borrower’s credit evaluation and historical performance, income evaluation and valuation of collateral (where applicable).  Updated credit bureau scores are obtained on all existing consumer loans/lines on a periodic basis in order to monitor portfolio credit quality changes and mitigate risk.
 Similar to residential real estate loan portfolios, an inherent risk factor in consumer loans is that they are dependent on national, regional and local economic factors that affect employment in the markets where these loans are originated.  Generally, consumer loan portfolios consist of a large number of relatively small-balance loans, some of which are originated as unsecured credit (credit cards and some personal lines of credit), and as such, do not have collateral as a secondary source of repayment.  Consumer loans generally pose heightened risks of collectability and loss when compared to other loan types.
 Other LHFI – Other loans primarily consist of loans to non-depository financial institutions, such as mortgage companies, finance companies and other financial intermediaries, loans to state and political subdivisions, and loans to non-profit and charitable organizations.  These loans are underwritten based on the specific nature or purpose of the loan and underlying collateral with special consideration given to the specific source of repayment for the loan.
 Similar to commercial and industrial loans, inherent risk in other loans can arise due to fluctuations in borrowers’ financial condition, deterioration in collateral values and changes in market and economic conditions.  Loans to state and political subdivisions have the added inherent risk of being somewhat dependent on the ability and capacity of those entities to generate tax and other revenue to repay the loans.  Loans to non-profit and charitable organizations are dependent on those organizations’ ability to generate revenue through their fundraising efforts and other forms of financial support, which can be susceptible to economic downturns.
 Recent Economic and Industry Developments
 The economy continued to show moderate signs of improvement during 2018; however, economic concerns remain as a result of the cumulative weight of volatility in crude oil prices and uncertain growth prospects in Russia and other emerging markets, combined with uncertainty regarding the possibility of further tightening of the monetary policy by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB) and the potential market impact of efforts by the FRB to reduce the size of its balance sheet, the consequences of the decision of the United Kingdom to exit the European Union, the potential impact on the economy of the current presidential administration’s policies, United States trade relations and the recent shut-down of the United States Government.  Doubts surrounding the near-term direction of global markets, and the potential impact of these trends on the United States economy, are expected to persist for the near term.  While Trustmark’s customer base is wholly domestic, international economic conditions affect domestic conditions, and thus may have an impact upon Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.
 In the January 2019 “Summary of Commentary on Current Economic Conditions by Federal Reserve Districts,” the twelve Federal Reserve Districts’ reports suggested national economic activity continued to expand at a modest to moderate pace during the reporting period.  Reports by the twelve Federal Reserve Districts noted retail sales grew modestly, manufacturing activity expanded but at a slower rate, particularly in the auto and energy sectors, little change in both residential and commercial real estate activity, modest to moderate growth in the nonfinancial services sector, activity in the energy sector expanded at a slower pace with lower energy prices cited as contributing to a pullback in capital spending expectations and lending volumes increased modestly.  Reports by the twelve Federal Reserve Districts also noted employment increased modestly with moderate gains in wages and modest to moderate increases in prices citing rising materials and freight costs as well as higher tariffs as contributing factors.  Reports by the twelve Federal Reserve Districts also suggested that outlooks for the near-term remained positive although less optimistic among concerns regarding increased financial market volatility, rising short-term interest rates, falling energy prices and elevated trade and political uncertainty.  The Federal Reserve’s Sixth District, Atlanta (which includes Trustmark’s Alabama, Florida and Mississippi market regions), reported that economic activity expanded at a moderate pace, labor markets remained tight and wages increased, non-labor input costs increased while the ability to pass these increases to customers varied, retail and auto sales improved, residential real estate activity slowed while commercial real estate activity remained stable, manufacturing activity decreased and banking conditions were stable.  
 7

The Federal Reserve’s Sixth District also reported that while expectations for steady economic growth remain for the near-term, levels of uncertainty for 2019 increased to include concerns over politics and trade.  The Federal Reserve’s Eighth District, St. Louis (which includes Trustmark’s Tennessee market region), reported that economic conditions improved slightly, labor markets remained tight with moderate growth in wages, consumer spending improved modestly, slight improvements in both residential and commercial real estate activity and manufacturing activity and loan volumes increased although at a slower rate.  The Federal Reserve’s Eleventh District, Dallas (which includes Trustmark’s Texas market region), reported economic activity expanded at a modest pace, noting decelerated growth across the manufacturing, services, retail and energy sectors, a slight decline in loan volumes, new home sells declined modestly, employment expanded at a slightly slower pace and wage growth remained elevated.  The Federal Reserve’s Eleventh District also reported that outlooks for the near-term were less optimistic among concerns regarding declining oil prices, political and trade uncertainty, higher interest rates and stock market volatility.
 During December 2018, the FRB increased the target range for the federal funds rate for the fourth time in 2018 as anticipated.  The FRB also continues to reduce the size of its balance sheet.  It is not possible to predict the impact, if any, on market interest rates (or on markets generally) of efforts by the FRB to continue to reduce the size of its balance sheet.  Notwithstanding recent increases in the target rate for federal funds by the FRB, interest rates remain within a low range that, when combined with the extended period of historically low interest rates in recent years, continue to place pressure on net interest margins for Trustmark (as well as its competitors).  The FRB has indicated that further increases in rates in 2019 will depend on market conditions.  Further increases in interest rates will place competitive pressures on the deposit cost of funds.  It is not possible to predict the pace and magnitude of rising interest rates, or the impact rising rates will have on Trustmark’s results of operations.
 For additional discussion of the impact of the current economic environment on the financial condition and results of operations of Trustmark and its subsidiaries, see Part II. Item 7. – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this report.
 Competition
 There is significant competition within the banking and financial services industry in the markets in which Trustmark operates.  Changes in regulation, technology and product delivery systems have resulted in an increasingly competitive environment.  Trustmark expects to continue to face increasing competition from online and traditional financial institutions seeking to attract customers by providing access to similar services and products.
 Trustmark and its subsidiaries compete with national and state chartered banking institutions of comparable or larger size and resources and with smaller community banking organizations.  Trustmark has numerous local, regional and national nonbank competitors, including savings and loan associations, credit unions, mortgage companies, insurance companies, finance companies, financial service operations of major retailers, investment brokerage and financial advisory firms and mutual fund companies.  Because nonbank financial institutions are not subject to the same regulatory restrictions as banks and bank holding companies, they can often operate with greater flexibility and lower cost structures.  Currently, Trustmark does not face meaningful competition from international banks in its markets, although that could change in the future.
 At June 30, 2018, Trustmark’s deposit market share ranked within the top three positions in 57% of the 56 counties served and within the top five positions in 71% of the counties served.  The table below presents FDIC deposit data regarding TNB’s deposit market share by state as of June 30, 2018.  The FDIC deposit market share data presented below does not align with Trustmark’s reported geographic market regions, which in some instances cross state lines, and Trustmark’s geographic coverage within certain states presented below is not statewide (see the section captioned “Description of Business” above). 

 
 
State | Deposit Market Share
------------+---------------------
Alabama | 1.63% 
Florida | 0.13% 
Mississippi | 14.13% 
Tennessee | 0.39% 
Texas | 0.05% 

 
Services provided by the Wealth Management Segment face competition from many national, regional and local financial institutions.  Companies that offer broad services similar to those provided by Trustmark, such as other banks, trust companies and full service brokerage firms, as well as companies that specialize in particular services offered by Trustmark, such as investment advisors and mutual fund providers, all compete with Trustmark’s Wealth Management Segment.
 Trustmark’s insurance subsidiary faces competition from local, regional and national insurance companies, independent insurance agencies as well as from other financial institutions offering insurance products.
 8

Trustmark’s ability to compete effectively is a result of providing customers with desired products and services in a convenient and cost effective manner.  Customers for commercial, consumer and mortgage banking as well as wealth management and insurance services are influenced by convenience, quality of service, personal contacts, availability of products and services and competitive pricing.  Trustmark continually reviews its products, locations, alternative delivery channels, and pricing strategies to maintain and enhance its competitive position.  While Trustmark’s position varies by market, Management believes it can compete effectively as a result of the quality of Trustmark’s products and services, local market knowledge and awareness of customer needs.
 Supervision and Regulation
 The following discussion sets forth material elements of the regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies and their subsidiaries and provides specific information relevant to Trustmark.  The discussion is a summary of detailed statutes, regulations and policies.  The descriptions are not intended to be complete summaries of the statutes, regulations and policies referenced therein.  Such statutes, regulations and policies are continually under the review of the United States Congress and state legislatures as well as federal and state regulatory agencies.  A change in statutes, regulations or policies could have a material impact on the business of Trustmark and its subsidiaries.
Regulation of Trustmark
 Trustmark is a registered bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (BHC Act).  Trustmark and its nonbank subsidiaries are therefore subject to the supervision, examination, enforcement and reporting requirements of the BHC Act, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI Act), the regulations of the FRB and certain of the requirements imposed by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), as amended by the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (EGRRCPA).
Federal Oversight Over Mergers and Acquisitions, Investments and Branching
 The BHC Act requires every bank holding company to obtain the prior approval of the FRB before: (i) it may acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank if, after such acquisition, the bank holding company will directly or indirectly own or control 5.0% or more of the voting shares of the bank; (ii) it or any of its subsidiaries, other than a bank, may acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any bank; or (iii) it may merge or consolidate with any other bank holding company.  The BHC Act further provides that the FRB may not approve any such transaction that would result in a monopoly or would be in furtherance of any combination or conspiracy to monopolize or attempt to monopolize the business of banking in any section of the United States, or the effect of which may be substantially to lessen competition or to tend to create a monopoly in any section of the country, or that in any other manner would be in restraint of trade, unless the anticompetitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed by the public interest in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served.  The FRB is also required to consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the bank holding companies and banks concerned and the convenience and needs of the community to be served.  The FRB is also required to take into account in evaluating such a transaction the effectiveness of the parties in combatting money laundering activities.  Consideration of financial resources generally focuses on capital adequacy, and consideration of convenience and needs issues includes the parties’ performance under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (CRA).  Provisions of the FDI Act known as the Bank Merger Act impose similar approval standards for an insured depository institution to merge with another insured depository institution.
 The BHC Act also generally requires FRB approval for a bank holding company’s acquisition of a company that is not an insured depository institution.  Bank holding companies generally may engage, directly or indirectly, only in banking and such other activities as are determined by the FRB to be closely related to banking.  The FRB must generally consider whether performance of the activity by a bank holding company can reasonably be expected to produce benefits to the public, such as greater convenience, increased competition, or gains in efficiency, that outweigh possible adverse effects, such as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest, or unsound banking practices.  The FRB has express statutory authority to also consider the “risk to the stability of the United States banking or financial system” when reviewing the acquisition of such a company by a bank holding company.
 The BHC Act, as amended by the interstate banking provisions of the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 (Riegle-Neal Act), permits Trustmark to acquire a bank located in any other state, regardless of state law to the contrary, subject to certain deposit-percentage, aging requirements, and other restrictions.  The Riegle-Neal Act also generally permits national and state-chartered banks to branch interstate through acquisitions of banks in other states.  Bank holding companies must be well-capitalized and well-managed to obtain federal bank regulatory approval of an interstate acquisition without regard to state law prohibiting the transaction.
 Under provisions of the BHC Act referred to as the “Volcker Rule,” limitations are placed on the ability of certain insured depository institutions, insured depository institution holding companies and their affiliates (“banking entities”), including Trustmark and TNB, 
 9

to acquire or retain ownership interests in, or act as sponsor to, certain investment funds, including hedge funds and private equity funds.  The Volcker Rule also places restrictions on proprietary trading by a banking entity.  In June 2018, five federal financial agencies released a proposal that would simplify and tailor compliance requirements relating to the Volker Rule.  The proposal would replace compliance program requirements for a banking entity with trading assets and liabilities of less than $1 billion, including Trustmark and TNB, with a rebuttable presumption of the entity’s compliance with the Volker Rule, and would simplify compliance requirements associated with exempt market making, underwriting and risk-mitigating hedging activities for such an entity.  The proposal would also change the Volker Rule’s definition of “trading account” by replacing the definition’s prong addressing the “purpose” of a trade with a new prong that is based on the accounting treatment of a position.  Finally, the proposal considers the adoption of an exclusion for loan-related swaps from the proprietary trading restrictions of the Volker Rule.  Management is reviewing the potential impact of the proposal on Trustmark and TNB.
 The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) has the authority to approve applications by national banks to establish de novo branches, including, under the Riegle-Neal Act, in states other than the bank’s home state if the law of the State in which the branch is located, or is to be located, would permit establishment of the branch if the bank were a State bank chartered by such State.
 Certain acquisitions of Trustmark’s voting stock may be subject to regulatory approval or notice under federal law.  Investors are responsible for ensuring that they do not, directly or indirectly, acquire shares of Trustmark’s stock in excess of the amount that can be acquired without regulatory approval under the Change in Bank Control Act and the BHC Act, which prohibit any person or company from acquiring control of Trustmark without, in most cases, the prior written approval of the FRB.
 Source of Strength
 Under the FDI Act, Trustmark is expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to TNB.  Under this policy, a bank holding company is expected to commit resources to support its bank subsidiary, including at times when the holding company may not be inclined or in a financial position to provide it.
Capital Adequacy
 Bank holding companies and banks are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by state and federal bank regulatory agencies.  Capital adequacy regulations and, additionally for banks, prompt corrective action regulations, involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices.  Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components, risk weighting and other factors.  The FRB and the OCC, the primary regulators of Trustmark and TNB, respectively, have substantially similar risk-based capital ratio and leverage ratio requirements. 
 Under capital requirements applicable to Trustmark and TNB, Trustmark and TNB are required to meet a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 7.0% (a minimum of 4.5% plus a capital conservation buffer of 2.5%), a Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 8.5% (a minimum of 6.0% plus a capital conservation buffer of 2.5%), a total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 10.5% (a minimum of 8.0% plus a capital conservation buffer of 2.5%), and a leverage ratio of Tier 1 capital to total consolidated assets of 4.0%.   In addition, for an insured depository institution to be “well-capitalized” under the banking agencies’ prompt corrective action framework, it must have a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.5%, Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.0%, a total capital ratio of 10.0%, and a leverage ratio of 5.0%, and must not be subject to any written agreement, order or capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive issued by its primary federal regulator to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure.  Certain capital requirements, such as the capital conservation buffer, became fully phased in on January 1, 2019.
 For purposes of calculating the denominator of the risk-based capital ratios, a banking institution’s assets and some of its specified off-balance sheet commitments and obligations are assigned to various risk categories.  For purposes of calculating the numerator of the capital ratios, capital, at both the holding company and bank level, is classified in one of three tiers depending on the “quality” and loss-absorbing features of the capital instrument.  Common equity Tier 1 capital is predominantly comprised of common stock instruments (including related surplus) and retained earnings, net of treasury stock, and after making necessary capital deductions and adjustments.  Tier 1 capital is comprised of common equity Tier 1 capital and additional Tier 1 capital, which includes non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock and similar instruments meeting specified eligibility criteria (including related surplus) and “TARP” preferred stock and other instruments issued under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008.  Newly issued trust preferred securities and cumulative perpetual preferred stock may not be included in Tier 1 capital.  Smaller depository institution holding companies (those with assets less than $15 billion as of year-end 2009) and most mutual holding companies are allowed to continue to count as Tier 1 capital most outstanding trust preferred securities and other non-qualifying securities that were issued prior to May 19, 2010 (up to a limit of 25% of Tier 1 capital, excluding non-qualifying capital instruments) rather than phasing such securities out of regulatory capital.  However, a depository institution holding company with less than $15 billion in assets that grows to $15 billion or more in assets as a result of an acquisition of another depository institution holding company generally is no longer allowed to count outstanding non-qualifying capital instruments toward its Tier 1 capital.  Trustmark currently has outstanding trust preferred securities 
 10

that are permitted to continue to count as Tier 1 capital up to the regulatory limit.  Total capital is comprised of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital, which includes certain subordinated debt with a minimum original maturity of five years (including related surplus) and a limited amount of allowance for loan losses.  Newly issued trust preferred securities and cumulative perpetual preferred stock generally may be included in Tier 2 capital, provided they do not include features that are disallowed by the capital rules, such as the acceleration of principal other than in the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency, or receivership of the issuer.
 Failure to meet minimum capital requirements could subject a bank to a variety of enforcement remedies.  The FDI Act identifies five capital categories for insured depository institutions: well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized.  An insured depository institution is subject to differential regulation corresponding to the capital category within which the institution falls.  The FDI Act requires banking regulators to take prompt corrective action whenever financial institutions do not meet minimum capital requirements.  Failure to meet the capital guidelines could also subject an insured depository institution to capital raising requirements. In addition, an insured depository institution is generally prohibited from making capital distributions, including paying dividends, or paying management fees to a holding company, if the institution would thereafter be undercapitalized.  In addition, the FDI Act requires the various regulatory agencies to prescribe certain noncapital standards for safety and soundness relating generally to operations and management, asset quality and executive compensation, and permits regulatory action against an insured depository institution that does not meet such standards.  
 An institution’s failure to exceed the capital conservation buffer with common equity Tier 1 capital would result in limitations on an institution’s ability to make capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments.
 At December 31, 2018, Trustmark exceeded its minimum capital requirements with common equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital equal to 11.77%, 12.33% and 13.07% of its total risk-weighted assets, respectively.  At December 31, 2018, TNB also exceeded these requirements with common equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital equal to 12.14%, 12.14% and 12.89% of its total risk-weighted assets, respectively.  At December 31, 2018, the leverage ratios for Trustmark and TNB were 10.26% and 10.13%, respectively.  As of December 31, 2018, the most recent notification from the OCC categorized TNB as well-capitalized based on the ratios and guidelines described above.
 In December 2018, the federal banking agencies issued a final rule to revise their regulatory capital rules to address the Current Expected Credit Losses (CECL) accounting standard, and provide an option to phase in the day-one regulatory capital effects of the adoption of the CECL accounting standard over three years.  Under the final rule, an institution that is required to adopt the CECL accounting standard beginning the first quarter of 2020, such as Trustmark, can make a one-time election to phase in the effects of the accounting standard on its regulatory capital calculations, such that the effects of adopting the CECL accounting standard on regulatory capital are fully phased in as of the first quarter of 2023.  For additional information regarding Trustmark’s implementation of the CECL accounting standard, see the section captioned “Pending Accounting Pronouncements – ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments” included in Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies – Accounting Policies Recently Adopted and Pending Accounting Pronouncements in Part II. Item 8. – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.
 Payment of Dividends and Stock Repurchases
 Trustmark is limited in its ability to pay dividends or repurchase its stock by the FRB, including if doing so would be an unsafe or unsound banking practice.  Where a bank holding company intends to declare or pay a dividend that could raise safety and soundness concerns, it generally will be required to inform and consult with the FRB in advance.  It is the policy of the FRB that a bank holding company should generally pay dividends on common stock only out of earnings, and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the company’s capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition.
 According to guidance from the FRB, a bank holding company’s dividend policies will be assessed against, among other things, its ability to achieve applicable capital ratio requirements.  If a bank holding company does not achieve applicable capital ratio requirements, it may not be able to pay dividends.  Although Trustmark currently meets applicable capital ratio requirements, inclusive of the phased-in capital conservation buffer, Trustmark cannot be sure that it will continue to meet those requirements or that even if it does, it will be able to pay dividends.
 Trustmark also is required to obtain the approval of the FRB in advance of redeeming or repurchasing its stock.  In evaluating the appropriateness of a proposed redemption or repurchase of stock, the FRB will consider, among other things, the potential loss that a bank holding company may suffer from the prospective need to increase reserves and write down assets as a result of continued asset deterioration, and its ability to raise additional common equity and other capital to replace the stock that will be redeemed or repurchased.  The FRB also will consider the potential negative effects on the bank holding company’s capital structure of replacing common stock with any lower-tier form of regulatory capital issued.

Anti-Money Laundering Initiatives and Sanctions Compliance
 Trustmark and TNB are subject to extensive regulations aimed at combatting money laundering and terrorist financing.  The USA Patriot Act of 2001 (USA Patriot Act) substantially broadened the scope of United States anti-money laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant compliance and due diligence obligations, creating new crimes and penalties and expanding the extra-territorial jurisdiction of the United States.  United States Department of the Treasury regulations implementing the USA Patriot Act impose obligations on financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies, procedures and controls to detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the identity of their customers and of beneficial owners of their legal entity customers.  Failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, or to comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations, could have serious legal and financial consequences for the institution.
 The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is responsible for helping to insure that U.S. entities do not engage in transactions with certain prohibited parties, as defined by various Executive Orders and Acts of Congress.  OFAC publishes lists of persons, organizations, and countries suspected of aiding, harboring or engaging in terrorist acts, known as Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons.  OFAC administers and enforces applicable economic and trade sanctions programs.  These sanctions are usually targeted against foreign countries, terrorists, international narcotics traffickers and those believed to be involved in the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.  These regulations generally require either the blocking of accounts or other property of specified entities or individuals, but they may also require the rejection of certain transactions involving specified entities or individuals.  Trustmark maintains policies, procedures and other internal controls designed to comply with these sanctions programs.
 Other Federal Regulation of Trustmark
 In addition to being regulated as a bank holding company, Trustmark is subject to regulation by the State of Mississippi under its general business corporation laws.  Trustmark is also subject to the disclosure and other regulatory requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as administered by the SEC.
 Regulation of TNB
 TNB is a national bank and, as such, is subject to extensive regulation by the OCC and, to a lesser extent, by the FDIC.  In addition, as a large provider of consumer financial services, TNB is subject to regulation, supervision, enforcement and examination by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).  Almost every area of the operations and financial condition of TNB is subject to extensive regulation and supervision and to various requirements and restrictions under federal and state law including loans, reserves, investments, issuance of securities, establishment of branches, capital adequacy, liquidity, earnings, dividends, management practices and the provision of services.  TNB is subject to supervision, examination, enforcement and reporting requirements under the National Bank Act, the Federal Reserve Act, the FDI Act, regulations of the OCC and certain of the requirements imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act.  Trustmark and TNB are also subject to a wide range of consumer protection laws and regulations.
 Restrictions on Lending, Insider Transactions and Affiliate Transactions
 National banks are limited in the amounts they may lend to one borrower and the amount they may lend to insiders.  These single counterparty and insider lending limits extend to loans, derivative transactions, repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements and securities lending or borrowing transactions.  In addition, the FDI Act imposes restrictions on insured depository institutions’ purchases of assets from insiders.
 Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act establish parameters for an insured bank to conduct “covered transactions” with its affiliates, generally (i) limiting the extent to which the bank or its subsidiaries may engage in “covered transactions” with any one affiliate to an amount equal to 10 percent of the bank’s capital stock and surplus, and limiting the aggregate of all such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to 20 percent of the bank’s capital stock and surplus, and (ii) requiring that all such transactions be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable, to the bank or subsidiary as those that would be provided to a non-affiliate.  In addition, an insured bank’s loans to affiliates must be fully collateralized.  The term “covered transaction” includes the making of loans to the affiliate, purchase of assets from the affiliate, issuance of a guarantee on behalf of the affiliate and several other types of transactions.
 Payment of Dividends
 The principal source of Trustmark’s cash revenue is dividends from TNB.  There are various legal and regulatory provisions that limit the amount of dividends TNB can pay to Trustmark without regulatory approval.  Under the National Bank Act, approval of the OCC is required if the total of all dividends declared in any calendar year exceeds the total of TNB’s net income for that year combined 
 12

with its retained net income from the preceding two years.  Also under the National Bank Act, TNB may not pay any dividends in excess of undivided profits (retained earnings).  In addition, subsidiary banks of a bank holding company are subject to certain restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve Act on extensions of credit to the bank holding company or any of its subsidiaries.  Further, subsidiary banks of a bank holding company are prohibited from engaging in certain tie-in arrangements in connection with any extension of credit, lease or sale of property or furnishing of any services to the bank holding company.  Moreover, an institution’s failure to exceed the capital conservation buffer set forth in the capital rules with common equity Tier 1 capital would result in limitations on an institution’s ability to make capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments.
 CFPB
 The Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB within the Federal Reserve System as an independent bureau with responsibility for consumer financial protection.  The CFPB is responsible for issuing rules, orders and guidance implementing federal consumer financial laws.  The CFPB has primary enforcement authority over “very large” insured depository institutions or insured credit unions and their affiliates.  An insured depository institution is deemed “very large” if it reports assets of more than $10 billion in its quarterly Call Report for four consecutive quarters.  The CFPB has near exclusive supervision authority, including examination authority, over these “very large” institutions and their affiliates to assess compliance with federal consumer financial laws, to obtain information about the institutions’ activities and compliance systems and procedures, and to detect and assess risks to consumers and markets.   The CFPB has broad authority to prevent “unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices” and ensure consistent enforcement of laws so that all consumers have access to markets for consumer financial products and services that are fair, transparent and competitive.  The CFPB has rulemaking and interpretive authority under the Dodd-Frank Act and other federal consumer financial services laws, as well as broad supervisory, examination and enforcement authority over large providers of consumer financial products and services, such as TNB.  TNB’s total assets exceeded $10 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017, and therefore, TNB is subject to CFPB supervision.
 In October 2017, the CFPB issued a final rule generally requiring lenders that make certain covered short-term loans, longer-term balloon-payment loans, or longer-term loans with certain costs and features, to reasonably determine that a borrower of a covered loan has the ability to repay such a loan, make certain disclosures to the borrower before attempting to withdraw payment from the borrower’s account, forego from making three consecutive attempts to withdraw payments and report covered loans to registered information systems.  Most of the requirements of the final rule will take effect in the third quarter of 2019.  Based on TNB’s current credit portfolio, any covered loans made by TNB are considered exempt “accommodation loans” under the CFPB’s final rule, and accordingly, Trustmark does not expect that the final rule will have a material impact on its operations.
 Other Federal and State Laws
 Banking organizations are subject to numerous laws and regulations intended to protect consumers in addition to those discussed above. These laws include, among others: the Truth in Lending Act (TILA); Truth in Savings Act; Electronic Funds Transfer Act (EFTA); Expedited Funds Availability Act; Equal Credit Opportunity Act; Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act; Fair Housing Act; Fair Credit Reporting Act; Fair Debt Collection Act; Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act; Home Mortgage Disclosure Act; Right to Financial Privacy Act; Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act; laws regarding unfair and deceptive acts and practices; and usury laws.
 Many states and local jurisdictions have consumer protection laws analogous, and in addition to, those listed above.  While TNB’s activities are governed primarily by federal law, the Dodd-Frank Act potentially narrowed National Bank Act preemption of state consumer financial laws, thereby making TNB and other national banks potentially subject to increased state regulation.  The Dodd-Frank Act also codified the Supreme Court’s decision in Cuomo v. Clearing House Association.  As a result, State Attorneys General may enforce in a court action “an applicable law” against federally-chartered depository institutions like TNB.  In addition, under the Dodd-Frank Act, State Attorneys General are authorized to bring civil actions against federally-chartered institutions, like TNB, to enforce regulations prescribed by the CFPB or to secure other remedies.
 Finally, the Dodd-Frank Act potentially expanded state regulation over banks by eliminating National Bank Act preemption for national bank operating subsidiaries, including operating subsidiaries of TNB.
 Mortgage Regulation
 The Dodd-Frank Act imposed new standards for mortgage loan originations on lenders.  The statute amended TILA to restrict the payment of fees to real-estate mortgage originators.  Furthermore, the statute amended TILA to impose minimum underwriting standards on real-estate mortgage creditors (including nonbanks as well as bank creditors) and verifications to check borrowers’ income and their ability to repay.

Financial Privacy Laws
 The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999 (GLB Act) imposed requirements related to the privacy of customer financial information. In accordance with the GLB Act, federal bank regulators adopted rules that limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties.  The GLB Act also requires disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allows consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to a nonaffiliated third party.  The privacy provisions of the GLB Act affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors.  Trustmark recognizes the need to comply with legal and regulatory requirements that affect its customers’ privacy.
Debit Interchange Regulation
 The FRB has issued rules under the EFTA, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, to limit interchange fees that an issuer may receive or charge for an electronic debit card transaction.  Under the FRB’s rules, the maximum permissible interchange fee that an issuer may receive for an electronic debit transaction is the sum of 21 cents per transaction and five basis points multiplied by the value of the transaction.  In addition, the FRB’s rules allow for an upward adjustment of no more than one cent to an issuer’s debit card interchange fee if the issuer develops and implements policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve the fraud-prevention standards set out in the rule.  
 Issuers that, together with their affiliates, have assets of less than $10.0 billion on the annual measurement date (December 31) are exempt from the debit card interchange fee standards.  Since the December 31, 2013 annual measurement date, Trustmark has had assets greater than $10.0 billion; and, therefore, is required to comply with the debit card interchange fee standards.
 FDIC Deposit Insurance Assessments
 The deposits of TNB are insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF), as administered by the FDIC, and, accordingly, are subject to deposit insurance assessments to maintain the DIF at minimum levels required by statute.  The Dodd-Frank Act increased the minimum reserve ratio requirement for the DIF to 1.35 percent of total estimated insured deposits or the comparable percentage of the deposit assessment base.
 The FDIC uses a risk based assessment system that imposes insurance premiums as determined by multiplying an insured bank’s assessment base by its assessment rate.  The Dodd-Frank Act revised the deposit insurance assessment base to be equal to a bank’s total assets minus the sum of (1) its average tangible equity during the assessment period, and (2) any additional amount the FDIC determines is warranted for custodial and banker’s banks.
 The FDIC determines a bank’s assessment rate within a range of base assessment rates using a risk scorecard that takes into account the bank’s financial ratios and supervisory rating (the CAMELS composite rating), among other factors.  The CAMELS rating system is a supervisory rating system developed to classify a bank’s overall condition by taking into account capital adequacy, assets, management capability, earnings, liquidity and sensitivity to market and interest rate risk.
 In the third quarter of 2018, the DIF reserve ratio reached the statutorily required minimum level of 1.35 percent, which ended surcharges on institutions with $10.0 billion or more in assets, such as Trustmark, that had been in effect.
 TNB’s FDIC assessment expenses declined during 2018 as the lower regular assessment rates and the allowable adjustments more than offset the surcharge of 4.5 cents per $100 of assessment base that had been in effect.  In 2018, TNB’s expenses related to deposit insurance premiums totaled $9.0 million.  
 TNB also paid approximately $479 thousand in Financing Corporation (FICO) assessments related to outstanding FICO bonds for which the FDIC serves as collection agent.  The bonds issued by FICO are due to mature in 2019.  For the quarter ended December 31, 2018, the FICO assessment rate was equal to 0.14 basis points.
 The Dodd-Frank Act permanently increased the deposit insurance level to $250 thousand per depositor for each insured depository institution.
 TNB Subsidiaries
 TNB’s nonbanking subsidiaries are subject to a variety of state and federal laws and regulations.  TIA, a registered investment adviser, is subject to regulation by the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and by the State of Mississippi.  FBBI is subject to the insurance laws and regulations of the states in which it is active.  SCC is subject to the supervision and regulation of the CDFI Fund and the State of Mississippi.

In April 2018, the SEC proposed a rule relating to the standards of conduct for financial professionals.  The SEC’s proposed rule would require broker-dealers to act in the best interest of their retail customers when recommending securities and to provide additional disclosure about the scope and terms of the relationship.  The proposed rule would clarify the fiduciary duty that an investment advisor owes to its clients and would specify that investment advisors have an affirmative duty of utmost good faith and full and fair disclosure of all material facts to their investors.  It is not clear when or if a final rule or guidance will be adopted and how the comments received might alter the proposed provisions.  Management is engaged in a review of the potential impact the SEC’s proposed rule may have on the results of operations or financial condition of Trustmark or TNB.
 The GLB Act authorizes national banks to own or control a “financial subsidiary” that engages in activities that are not permissible for national banks to engage in directly.  The GLB Act contains a number of provisions dealing with insurance activities by bank subsidiaries.  Generally, the GLB Act affirms the role of the states in regulating insurance activities, including the insurance activities of financial subsidiaries of banks, but the GLB Act also preempts certain state laws.  As a result of the GLB Act, TNB elected for predecessor subsidiaries that now constitute FBBI to become financial subsidiaries.  This enables FBBI to engage in insurance agency activities at any location.
