Item 1. Business
Overview
We are an independent provider of hydraulic fracturing services to onshore oil and natural gas exploration and production (“E&P”) companies in North America. We provide our services primarily in the Permian Basin, the Eagle Ford Shale, the Denver-Julesburg Basin (the “DJ Basin”), the Williston Basin and the Powder River Basin. 
Initial Public Offering and Corporate Reorganization Transaction
Liberty Inc. was incorporated as a Delaware corporation on December 21, 2016, to become a holding corporation for Liberty LLC and its subsidiaries upon completion of a corporate reorganization (as detailed below, the “Corporate Reorganization”) and planned initial public offering of the Company (“IPO”). The Company has no material assets other than its ownership in Liberty LLC.
On January 17, 2018, we completed our IPO of 14,640,755 shares of our Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “Class A Common Stock”) at a public offering price of $17.00 per share, of which 14,340,214 shares were offered by us and 300,541 shares were offered by the selling shareholder. We received approximately $220.0 million in net proceeds after deducting approximately $23.8 million of underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering costs. We did not receive any proceeds from the sale of the shares of Class A Common Stock by the selling shareholder. We used approximately $25.9 million of net proceeds from the IPO to redeem ownership in us from certain Legacy Owners (as defined below) and contributed the remaining proceeds to Liberty LLC in exchange for units in Liberty LLC (the “Liberty LLC Units”). Liberty LLC used a portion of the net proceeds (i) to fully repay our outstanding borrowings and accrued interest under our ABL Facility (as defined herein), totaling approximately $30.1 million, (ii) to repay 35% of our outstanding borrowings, accrued interest and prepayment premium under our Term Loan Facility (as defined herein), totaling approximately $62.5 million and (iii) for general corporate purposes, including repayment of additional indebtedness and funding capital expenditures.
We are a holding company with no direct operations. In connection with the IPO, we completed the Corporate Reorganization, including the following series of transactions:

• | Liberty Holdings contributed all of its assets to Liberty LLC in exchange for Liberty LLC Units;


• | Liberty Holdings liquidated and distributed to its then-existing owners (the “Legacy Owners”) Liberty LLC Units pursuant to the terms of the limited liability company agreement of Liberty Holdings and the Master Reorganization Agreement dated as of January 11, 2018, by and among the Company, Liberty Holdings, Liberty LLC, and the other parties named therein (the “Master Reorganization Agreement”);


• | Certain of the Legacy Owners directly or indirectly contributed all or a portion of their Liberty LLC Units to Liberty Inc. in exchange for 55,685,027 shares of our Class A Common Stock, and 1,258,514 shares of restricted stock. Subsequent to the initial exchange, 1,609,122 shares of Class A Common Stock were redeemed for an aggregate purchase price of $25.9 million upon the exercise of the underwriters' overallotment option;


• | Liberty Inc. issued the Legacy Owners that continued to own Liberty LLC Units (the “Liberty Unit Holders”) an aggregate amount of 48,207,372 shares of our Class B common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “Class B Common Stock” and, together with the Class A Common Stock, the “Common Stock”); and


• | Liberty Inc. contributed the net proceeds it received from the IPO to Liberty LLC in exchange for additional Liberty LLC Units such that Liberty Inc. held a total number of Liberty LLC Units equal to the number of shares of Class A Common Stock outstanding immediately following the IPO.

The below structure chart shows our organization upon the completion of our IPO. This chart is provided for illustrative purposes only and, does not represent all legal entities affiliated with us.
Each share of Class B Common Stock has no economic rights but entitles its holder to one vote on all matters to be voted on by shareholders generally. Holders of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock will vote together as a single class on all matters presented to our shareholders for their vote or approval, except as otherwise required by applicable law or by our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. We do not intend to list our Class B Common Stock on any exchange. 
Under the Second Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of Liberty LLC (the “Liberty LLC Agreement”), each Liberty Unit Holder has, subject to certain limitations, the right (the “Redemption Right”) to cause Liberty LLC to acquire all or a portion of its Liberty LLC Units for, at Liberty LLC’s election, (i) shares of our Class A Common Stock at a redemption ratio of one share of Class A Common Stock for each Liberty LLC Unit redeemed, subject to conversion rate adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends and reclassification and other similar transactions or (ii) an equivalent amount of cash. Alternatively, upon the exercise of the Redemption Right, Liberty Inc. (instead of Liberty LLC) will have the right (the “Call Right”) to, for administrative convenience, acquire each tendered Liberty LLC Unit directly from the redeeming Liberty Unit Holder for, at its election, (x) one share of Class A Common Stock or (y) an equivalent amount of cash. In addition, upon a change of control of Liberty Inc., Liberty Inc. has the right to require each holder of Liberty LLC Units (other than Liberty Inc.) to exercise its Redemption Right with respect to some or all of such unit holder’s Liberty LLC Units. In connection with any redemption of Liberty LLC Units pursuant to the Redemption Right or the Call Right, the corresponding number of shares of Class B Common Stock will be canceled.
In connection with the IPO, Liberty Inc. entered into two tax receivable agreements, (the “TRAs”) with the Liberty Unit Holders and the selling shareholder (each such person and any permitted transferee, a “TRA Holder” and together, the “TRA Holders”). 
The first of the TRAs, which Liberty Inc. entered into with the Liberty Unit Holders, generally provides for the payment by Liberty Inc. to such TRA Holders of 85% of the net cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income and franchise tax (computed using simplifying assumptions to address the impact of state and local taxes) that Liberty Inc. actually realizes (or is deemed to realize in certain circumstances) in periods after the IPO as a result of, as applicable to each such TRA 
2

Holder, (i) certain increases in tax basis that occur as a result of Liberty Inc.’s acquisition (or deemed acquisition for U.S. federal income tax purposes) of all or a portion of such TRA Holder’s Liberty LLC Units in connection with the IPO or pursuant to the exercise of the Redemption Right or Liberty Inc.’s Call Right and (ii) imputed interest deemed to be paid by Liberty Inc. as a result of, and additional tax basis arising from, any payments Liberty Inc. makes under such TRAs. 
The second of the TRAs, which Liberty Inc. entered into with the selling shareholder, generally provides for the payment by Liberty Inc. to such TRA Holder of 85% of the net cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income and franchise tax (computed using simplifying assumptions to address the impact of state and local taxes) that Liberty Inc. actually realizes (or is deemed to realize in certain circumstances) in periods after the IPO as a result of, as applicable to such TRA Holder, (i) any net operating losses available to Liberty Inc. as a result of the Corporate Reorganization and (ii) imputed interest deemed to be paid by Liberty Inc. as a result of any payments Liberty Inc. makes under such TRAs. For further discussion regarding the potential acceleration of payments under the TRAs and its potential impact, please read “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Class A Common Stock.”
Because Liberty Inc. is a holding company with no operations of its own, Liberty Inc.’s ability to make payments under the TRAs is dependent on the ability of Liberty LLC to make distributions to Liberty Inc. in an amount sufficient to cover its obligations under the TRAs. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Class A Common Stock—Liberty Inc. is a holding company. Liberty Inc.’s only material asset is its equity interest in Liberty LLC, and Liberty Inc. is accordingly dependent upon distributions from Liberty LLC to pay taxes, make payments under the TRAs and cover its corporate and other overhead expenses.” If Liberty Inc. experiences a change of control (as defined under the TRAs, which includes certain mergers, asset sales and other forms of business combinations) or the TRAs terminate early (at Liberty Inc.’s election or as a result of its breach), Liberty Inc. would be required to make a substantial, immediate lump-sum payment.
Our Company
We are an independent provider of hydraulic fracturing services to onshore oil and natural gas E&P companies in the United States. We have grown organically from one active hydraulic fracturing fleet in December 2011 to 22 active fleets in February 2019. We expect to take delivery of additional equipment in 2019. However, decisions whether or not to deploy these additional fleets in 2019 will be made considering customer demand, long term return profile and market conditions. We provide our services primarily in the Permian Basin, the Eagle Ford Shale, the DJ Basin, the Williston Basin and the Powder River Basin.
Our founders and existing management were pioneers in the development of data-driven hydraulic fracturing technologies for application in shale plays. Prior to founding Liberty Holdings, the majority of our management team founded and built Pinnacle Technologies, Inc. (“Pinnacle Technologies”) into a leading fracturing technology company. In 1992, Pinnacle Technologies developed the first commercial hydraulic fracture mapping technologies, analytical tools that played a major role in launching the shale revolution. Our extensive experience with fracture technologies and customized fracture design has enabled us to develop new technologies and processes that provide our customers with real time solutions that significantly enhance their completions. These technologies include hydraulic fracture propagation models, reservoir engineering tools, large, proprietary shale production databases and multi-variable statistical analysis techniques. Taken together, these technologies have enabled us to be a leader in hydraulic fracture design innovation and application.
We believe the following characteristics distinguish us from our competitors and are the foundations of our business: forming ongoing partnerships of trust and innovation with our customers; developing and utilizing technology to maximize well performance; and promoting a people-centered culture focused on our employees, customers and suppliers. We have developed strong relationships with our customers by investing significant time in fracture design collaboration, which substantially enhances their production economics. Our technological innovations have become even more critical as E&P companies have increased the completion complexity and fracture intensity of horizontal wells. We are proactive in developing innovative solutions to industry challenges, including developing: (i) our proprietary databases of U.S. unconventional wells to which we apply our proprietary multi-variable statistical analysis technologies to provide differential insight into fracture design optimization; (ii) our Liberty Quiet Fleet® design which significantly reduces noise levels compared to conventional hydraulic fracturing fleets; and (iii) hydraulic fracturing fluid systems tailored to the specific reservoir properties in the basins in which we operate. We foster a people-centered culture built around honoring our commitments to customers, partnering with our suppliers and hiring, training and retaining people that we believe to be the best talent in our field, enabling us to be one of the safest and most efficient hydraulic fracturing companies in the United States.
Recent Developments
On January 22, 2019, our board of directors (the “Board”) authorized a share repurchase plan to repurchase shares of our Class A Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, in an amount not to exceed $100 million through January 31, 2021. This 
3

program is in addition to the $100 million share repurchase program we previously announced on September 10, 2018, which has been substantially completed. We expect to fund repurchases made under this plan from existing cash on hand and future operating cash flow. The share repurchase program was approved by the Board who believe that a share repurchase program at this time is in the best interests of us and our shareholders and will not impact our ability to execute our growth plans.
We also announced on January 22, 2019 that the Board approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per share of Class A Common Stock, to be paid on March 20, 2019 to holders of record as of March 6, 2019. A distribution of $0.05 per unit has been approved for holders of units in Liberty LLC, which will use the same record and payment date.
Future declarations of dividends are subject to approval by the Board and to the Board’s continuing determination that the declarations of dividends are in the best interests of us and our stockholders. Future dividends may be adjusted at the Board’s discretion based on market conditions and capital availability.
Cyclical Nature of Industry
We operate in a highly cyclical industry. The key factor driving demand for our services is the level of drilling activity by E&P companies, which in turn depends largely on the current and anticipated economics of new well completions. Global supply and demand for oil and the domestic supply and demand for natural gas are critical in assessing industry outlook. Demand for oil and natural gas is cyclical and subject to large, rapid fluctuations. E&P companies tend to increase capital expenditures in response to increases in oil and natural gas prices, which generally results in greater revenues and profits for oilfield service companies such as ours. Increased capital expenditures also ultimately lead to greater production, which historically has resulted in increased supplies and reduced prices which in turn tend to reduce demand for oilfield services. For these reasons, the results of our operations may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and from year to year, and these fluctuations may distort comparisons of results across periods.
Seasonality
Our results of operations have historically reflected seasonal tendencies relating to holiday seasons, inclement weather and the conclusion of our customers’ annual drilling and completion capital expenditure budgets. Our most notable declines typically occur in the first and fourth quarters of the year for the reasons described above. Additionally, some of the areas in which we have operations, including the DJ Basin, Powder River Basin and Williston Basin, are adversely affected by seasonal weather conditions, primarily in the winter and spring. During periods of heavy snow, ice or rain and frost law enforcement, we may be unable to move our equipment between locations, thereby reducing our ability to provide services and generate revenues. The exploration activities of our customers may also be affected during such periods of adverse weather conditions. Additionally, extended drought conditions in our operating regions could impact our ability or our customers’ ability to source sufficient water or increase the cost for such water.
Intellectual Property
Over the last several years we have significantly invested in our research and technology capabilities. Our efforts to date have been focused on developing innovative, fit-for-purpose solutions designed to enhance our core service offerings, increase completion efficiencies, provide cost savings to our operations and add value for our customers.
As a result of these efforts, we introduced several new products and progressed on differentiating technologies that we believe will provide a competitive advantage as our customers focus on extracting oil and natural gas in the most economical and efficient ways possible, including, for example, our Liberty Quiet Fleet®, which materially reduces noise levels compared to conventional fracturing fleets. These investments are delivering value added products and services that support our customers and create increasing demand for our services.
We seek patent and trademark protections for our technology when we deem it prudent, and we aggressively pursue protection of these rights when warranted. We believe our patents, trademarks, and other protections for our proprietary technologies are adequate for the conduct of our business and that no single patent or trademark is critical to our business. In addition, we rely, to a great extent, on the technical expertise and know-how of our personnel to maintain our competitive position, and we take commercially reasonable measures to protect trade secrets and other confidential and/or proprietary information relating to the technologies we develop.
Risk Management and Insurance
Our operations are subject to significant hazards often found in the oil and natural gas industry, such as, but not limited to, accidents, blowouts, explosions, craterings, fires, natural gas leaks, oil and produced water spills and releases of hydraulic fracturing fluids or other well fluids into the environment. These conditions can cause:
4


• | disruption in operations;


• | substantial repair or remediation costs;


• | personal injury or loss of human life;


• | significant damage to or destruction of property and equipment;


• | environmental pollution, including groundwater contamination;


• | unusual or unexpected geological formations or pressures and industrial accidents;


• | impairment or suspension of operations; and


• | substantial revenue loss.

In addition, our operations are subject to, and exposed to, employee/employer liabilities and risks such as wrongful termination, discrimination, labor organizing, retaliation claims and general human resource related matters.
Claims for loss of oil and natural gas production and damage to formations can occur in the well services industry. Litigation arising from a catastrophic occurrence at a location where our equipment and services are being used may result in our being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting large claims.
We do not have insurance against all foreseeable risks, either because insurance is not available or because of the high premium costs. The occurrence of an event not fully insured against or the failure of an insurer to meet its insurance obligations could result in substantial losses. In addition, we may not be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable. Insurance may not be available to cover any or all of the risks to which we are subject, or, even if available, it may be inadequate, or insurance premiums or other costs could rise significantly in the future so as to make such insurance prohibitively expensive.
We enter into Master Service Agreements (“MSAs”) with substantially all of our customers. Our MSAs delineate our and our customer’s respective indemnification obligations with respect to the services we provide. Generally, under our MSAs, including those relating to our hydraulic fracturing services, we assume responsibility for pollution or contamination originating above the surface from our equipment or handling. However, our customers assume responsibility for all other pollution or contamination that may occur during operations, including that which may result from seepage or any other uncontrolled flow of drilling and completion fluids. The assumed responsibilities include the control, removal and clean-up of any pollution or contamination. In such cases, we may be exposed to additional liability if we are grossly negligent or commit willful acts causing the pollution or contamination. Generally, our customers also agree to indemnify us against claims arising from their employees’ personal injury or death, in the case of our hydraulic fracturing operations, to the extent that their employees are injured by such operations, unless the loss is a result of our gross negligence or willful misconduct. Similarly, we generally agree to indemnify our customers for liabilities arising from personal injury to or death of any of our employees, unless resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of our customer. The same principles apply to mutual indemnification for loss or destruction of customer-owned property or equipment. Losses due to catastrophic events, such as blowouts, are generally the responsibility of the customer. However, despite this general allocation of risk, we may be unsuccessful in enforcing contractual terms, incur an unforeseen liability that is not addressed by the scope of the contractual provisions or be required to enter into an MSA with terms that vary from our standard allocations of risk, as described above. Consequently, we may incur substantial losses that could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had 2,437 employees and no unionized labor. We believe we have good relations with our employees.
Our Services
We provide hydraulic fracturing services to E&P companies, particularly to those operating in unconventional oil and natural gas reservoirs and requiring technically and operationally advanced services. Hydraulic fracturing services are performed to enhance production of oil and natural gas from formations with low permeability and restricted flow of hydrocarbons. Our customers benefit from our expertise in fracturing horizontal wells in shales and other unconventional geological formations.
The process of hydraulic fracturing involves pumping a pressurized stream of fracturing fluid—typically a mixture of water, chemicals and proppant—into a well casing or tubing in order to cause the underground formation to fracture or crack. These fractures release trapped hydrocarbon particles and provide a conductive channel for the oil or natural gas to flow freely 
5

to the wellbore for collection. The propping agent, or proppant,—typically sand—becomes lodged in the cracks created by the hydraulic fracturing process, “propping” them open to facilitate the flow of hydrocarbons from the reservoir to the well. The fracturing fluid is engineered to lose viscosity, or “break,” and is subsequently flowed back from the formation, leaving the proppant suspended in the mineral fractures. Once our customer has flushed the fracturing fluids from the well using a controlled flow-back process, the customer manages fluid and water recycling or disposal.
Our hydraulic fracturing fleets consist of mobile hydraulic fracturing units and other auxiliary heavy equipment to perform fracturing services. Our hydraulic fracturing units consist primarily of high-pressure hydraulic pumps, diesel engines, transmissions, radiators and other supporting equipment that are typically mounted on trailers. We refer to the group of units and other equipment, such as blenders, data vans, sand storage, tractors, manifolds and high pressure fracturing iron, which are necessary to perform a typical hydraulic fracturing job, as a “fleet,” and the personnel assigned to each fleet as a “crew.” As of February 2019, we had 22 active fleets. 
An important element of our hydraulic fracturing services is our focus on providing custom-tailored completions solutions to our customers to maximize their well results. Our technologically innovative approach involves our review of a series of continually updated, proprietary databases of U.S. unconventional wells to which we apply our multi-variable data analysis, allowing us to gain differential insight into fracture design. The innovative completions solutions we provide to our customers help them complete more productive and cost efficient wells in shorter times with less environmental impact on their surroundings while increasing the useful lives of our equipment.
In addition to custom-tailored completions solutions, we also develop custom fluid systems, proppant logistics solutions, perforating strategies and pressure analysis techniques for our customers. An example of this is a hydraulic fracturing fluid that we developed for use in our DJ Basin operations called Liberty Spirit™, a specifically designed fracturing fluid system that enables material reductions in completion costs in the DJ Basin without compromising job execution or well results. 
We provide our services in several of the most active basins in the United States, including the Permian Basin, the Eagle Ford Shale, the DJ Basin, the Williston Basin and the Powder River Basin. The map below represents our current areas of operations:

Properties and Equipment
Properties
Our corporate headquarters are located at 950 17th Street, Suite 2400, Denver, Colorado 80202. We lease our general office space at our corporate headquarters. The lease expires in December 2024. We currently own or lease the following additional principal properties:
District Facility Location | Size | Leased or Owned | Expiration of Lease
Odessa, TX | 77,500 sq. ft on 47 acres | Owned | N/A 
Henderson, CO | 50,000 sq. ft on 13 acres | Leased | December 31, 2034 
Williston, ND | 30,000 sq. ft on 15 acres | Owned | N/A 
Gillette, WY | 32,757 sq. ft on 15 acres | Leased | December 31, 2034 
Cibolo, TX | 90,000 sq. ft on 34 acres | Owned | N/A 
Sedalia, CO | 11,805 sq. ft on 112 acres | Owned | N/A 

We also lease several smaller facilities, which leases generally have terms of one to three years. We believe that our existing facilities are adequate for our operations and their locations allow us to efficiently serve our customers. We do not believe that any single facility is material to our operations and, if necessary, we could readily obtain a replacement facility.
Equipment
We currently have 22 hydraulic fracturing fleets, and expect to take delivery of additional equipment in 2019. However, decisions whether or not to deploy these additional fleets in 2019 will be made considering customer demand, long term return profile and market conditions. Eight of our fleets currently utilize our Liberty Quiet Fleet® technology and approximately 40% of our capacity has dual fuel capability.
Our hydraulic fracturing fleets are comprised of high-quality, heavy-duty equipment designed to reduce operational downtime and maintenance costs, while enhancing our ability to provide reliable, consistent service. Each hydraulic fracturing fleet includes the necessary blending units, manifolds, data vans and other ancillary equipment needed to provide a high level of service to our customers.
Our newbuild fleets are manufactured to a custom Liberty specification that identifies the input components, including such key parts as engines, transmissions and pumps and control systems. These components have been selected with our lowest total cost of ownership philosophy in mind. We have built a strong partnership with each of the key component suppliers that we believe will help ensure timely access to necessary components, early opportunities to adopt the latest technology, and high-level technical support. For example, our close partnership with Caterpillar Inc. enabled us to have ready access to their technical team as we worked through the development of the Liberty Quiet Fleet® technology. This relationship ensured that the end product was delivered without compromise to engine performance, reliability or maintainability. We have also a built a strong relationship with the assembler of the core equipment for our fracturing fleets. We believe the collaborative partnerships we have developed with our vendors should give us ready access to sufficient fabrication capacity for our growth.
Our Acquisitions
On June 13, 2016, we acquired certain inventories and long-lived field service assets related to hydraulic fracturing from Sanjel Corporation for $69.0 million in cash (the “Sanjel Acquisition”). These assets were acquired from Sanjel Corporation as part of its bankruptcy proceeding. On February 22, 2017, we acquired all the membership interests of Titan Frac Services LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of TPIH Group Inc., for $65.0 million in cash. 
Marketing and Customers
Our sales and marketing activities typically are performed through our local sales representatives in each geographic region, and are supported by our corporate headquarters. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, our top five customers collectively accounted for approximately 42%, 53% and 59% of our revenues, respectively. Extraction Oil & Gas, Inc. accounted for more than 10% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2017, Extraction Oil & Gas, Inc. and SM Energy Company each accounted for more than 10% of our revenues. Extraction Oil & Gas, Inc., SM Energy Company and Noble Energy, Inc. each accounted for more than 10% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016.
7

Suppliers
We have a dedicated supply chain team that manages sourcing and logistics to ensure flexibility and continuity of supply in a cost effective manner across our areas of operation. We have built long-term relationships with multiple industry leading suppliers of proppant, chemicals and hydraulic fracturing equipment. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 none of our suppliers accounted for more than 10% of overall costs. For 2019, we do not expect any single proppant supplier to account for more than 20% of our total supply. In addition, we have built a strong relationship with the assembler of our custom-designed hydraulic fracturing fleets and believe we will continue to have timely access to new, high capability fleets as we continue to grow. Our purchases from that assembler accounted for more than 10% of our total capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2018.
We purchase a wide variety of raw materials, parts and components that are manufactured and supplied for our operations. We are not dependent on any single source of supply for those parts, supplies or materials. To date, we have generally been able to obtain the equipment, parts and supplies necessary to support our operations on a timely basis. While we believe that we will be able to make satisfactory alternative arrangements in the event of any interruption in the supply of these materials and/or products by one of our suppliers, we may not always be able to do so. In addition, certain materials for which we do not currently have long-term supply agreements could experience shortages and significant price increases in the future. As a result, we may be unable to mitigate any future supply shortages and our results of operations, prospects and financial condition could be adversely affected.
Competition
The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. We provide services in various geographic regions across the United States, and our competitors include many large and small oilfield service providers, including some of the largest integrated service companies. Our hydraulic fracturing services compete with large, integrated companies such as Halliburton Company and Schlumberger Limited as well as other companies including Basic Energy Services, Inc., BJ Services Company, C&J Energy Services, Inc., Calfrac Well Services Ltd., FTS International, Inc., Keane Group, Inc., Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc., ProPetro Services, Inc., RPC, Inc., Superior Energy Services, Inc. and U.S. Well Services, Inc. In addition, our industry is highly fragmented and we compete regionally with a significant number of smaller service providers.
We believe that the principal competitive factors in the markets we serve are technical expertise, equipment capacity, work force competency, efficiency, safety record, reputation, experience and price. Additionally, projects are often awarded on a bid basis, which tends to create a highly competitive environment. We seek to differentiate ourselves from our competitors by delivering the highest-quality services and equipment possible, coupled with superior execution and operating efficiency in a safe working environment.
Our operations are organized into a single business segment, which consists of hydraulic fracturing services, and we have one reportable geographical business segment, the United States. Operating segments are defined under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) as components of an enterprise that engage in activities (i) from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses and (ii) for which separate operational financial information is available and is regularly evaluated by the chief operating decision maker for the purpose of allocating resources and assessing performance.

Environmental and Occupational Safety and Health Matters
Our operations in support of oil and natural gas exploration, development and production activities pursued by our customers are subject to stringent federal, tribal, regional, state and local laws and regulations governing occupational safety and health, the discharge of materials into the environment and environmental protection. Numerous governmental entities, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”), and analogous state agencies have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them, often requiring difficult and costly actions, including the incurrence of potentially significant capital or operating expenditures to mitigate or prevent the releases of materials from our equipment, facilities or from customer locations where we provide our services. These laws and regulations may, among other things (i) require the acquisition of permits or other authorizations for conducting regulated activities, (ii) limit or prohibit our operations on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas; (iii) require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former and ongoing operations; (iv) impose restrictions on the types, quantities and concentrations of various substances that can be released into the environment or injected in formations in connection with oil and natural gas drilling and production activities; (v) impose specific safety and health criteria addressing worker protection; and (vi) impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations. Any failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties; the imposition of investigatory, remedial or corrective action obligations or the incurrence of capital expenditures; the occurrence of restrictions, delays or cancellations in the permitting, performance or development of projects or operations; and the issuance of orders enjoining performance of some or all of our operations in a particular area.
The trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may adversely affect the environment, and thus any new laws and regulations, amendment of existing laws and regulations, reinterpretation of legal requirements or increased government enforcement with respect to environmental matters that result in more stringent and costly completion activities, pollution control equipment, waste handling, storage transport, disposal, or remediation requirements could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. We may be unable to pass on such increased compliance costs to our customers. Moreover, accidental releases or spills may occur in the course of our operations, and we cannot assure you that we will not incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of such releases or spills, including any third-party claims for injuries to persons or damages to properties or natural resources. Our customers may also incur increased costs, or restrictions, delays or cancellations in permitting or operating activities as a result of more stringent environmental laws and regulations, which may result in a curtailment of exploration, development or production activities that would reduce the demand for our services. Historically, our worker health and safety as well as our environmental compliance costs have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations; however, there can be no assurance that such costs will not be material in the future or that such future compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.
The following is a summary of the more significant existing environmental and occupational safety and health laws, as amended from time to time, to which our business is subject and for which compliance may have a material adverse impact on our capital expenditures, results of operations or financial position.
Worker Health and Safety
We are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of the federal Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act and comparable state statutes require that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and the public. These worker health and safety laws and regulations are subject to amendment including, for example, rulemaking adopted by OSHA in 2016 imposing more stringent permissible exposure limits for worker exposure to respirable crystalline silica, and any failure to comply with these laws could lead to the assertion of third-party claims against us, civil or criminal fines and changes in the way we operate our facilities, any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial position.

Motor Carrier Operations
In connection with the services we provide, we operate as a motor carrier and therefore are subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”) and analogous state agencies. These regulatory authorities exercise broad powers, governing activities such as the authorization to engage in motor carrier operations; regulatory safety; hazardous materials labeling, placarding and marking; financial reporting; and certain mergers, consolidations and acquisitions. There are additional regulations specifically relating to the trucking industry, including testing and specification of equipment and product handling requirements. The trucking industry is subject to possible regulatory and legislative changes that may increase our costs as well as affect the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or by changing the demand for common or contract carrier services or the cost of providing truckload services. Some of these possible changes include increasingly stringent environmental regulations, changes in the hours of service regulations that govern the amount of time a driver may drive in any specific period and requiring onboard electronic logging devices or limits on vehicle weight and size.
Interstate motor carrier operations are subject to safety requirements prescribed by DOT. Intrastate motor carrier operations are subject to state safety regulations that often mirror federal regulations but may be more stringent. Such matters as weight and dimension of motor carrier-related equipment are also subject to federal and state regulations. DOT regulations also mandate drug testing of drivers. From time to time, various legislative proposals are introduced, including proposals to increase federal, state or local taxes, such as, for example, taxes on motor fuels, which may increase our costs or adversely impact the recruitment of drivers. We cannot predict whether, or in what form, any increase in such taxes applicable to us would be enacted.
Radioactive Materials
Certain of our operations utilize equipment that contains sealed, low-grade radioactive sources. Our activities involving the use of radioactive materials are regulated by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (“NRC”) and state regulatory agencies under agreement with the NRC. Standards implemented by these regulatory agencies require us to obtain licenses or other approvals for the use of such radioactive materials. Additionally, these regulatory agencies impose certain requirements concerning worker protection with respect to radioactive sources and may otherwise issue regulations regarding the handling and storage of this equipment that may result in increased costs. The violation of these laws and regulations may result in the denial or revocation of licenses or other approvals, issuance of corrective action orders, injunctions prohibiting some or all of our operations in a particular area, and assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties.
Hazardous Substances and Wastes and Naturally Occurring Radioactive Materials
The federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”), and comparable state statutes, regulate the generation, treatment, storage, transportation, disposal and clean-up of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. Pursuant to rules issued by the EPA, individual states administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more stringent requirements. Drilling fluids, produced waters, and most of the other wastes associated with the exploration, development, and production of oil or natural gas, if properly handled, are currently exempt from regulation as hazardous waste under RCRA and, instead, are regulated under RCRA’s less stringent non-hazardous waste provisions, state laws or other federal laws. However, it is possible that certain oil and gas drilling and production wastes now classified as non-hazardous could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future. For example, pursuant to a consent decree issued by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in 2016 the EPA is required to propose, no later than March 15, 2019, a rulemaking for revision of certain Subtitle D criteria regulations that could result in oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes being regulated as hazardous wastes, or sign a determination that revision of the regulations is unnecessary. If the EPA proposes a rulemaking for revised oil and natural gas waste regulations, the consent decree requires that the EPA take final action following notice and comment rulemaking no later than July 15, 2021. A loss of the RCRA exclusion for drilling fluids, produced waters and related wastes could result in an increase in our and the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry’s costs to manage and dispose of generated hazardous wastes, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. Additionally, other wastes handled at exploration and production sites or generated in the course of providing well services may not fall within this exclusion. In the course of our operations, we generate some amounts of ordinary industrial wastes that may be regulated as hazardous wastes.
Moreover, there have been public concerns expressed about naturally occurring radioactive materials (“NORM”) being detected in flow back water resulting from hydraulic fracturing that may contaminate extraction and processing equipment used in the oil and natural gas industry. NORM is subject primarily to individual state radiation control regulations while NORM handling and management activities are governed by regulations promulgated by OSHA. These state and federal regulations impose certain requirements concerning worker protection with respect to NORM as well as the treatment, storage, and disposal of NORM and NORM waste, management of NORM-contaminated waste piles, containers and tanks, and limitations on the relinquishment of NORM contaminated land for unrestricted use under RCRA and state laws. Concern over NORM in 
10

general, or NORM in groundwater in particular, could result in further regulation in the treatment, storage, handling and discharge of flow back water generated from oil and natural gas activities, including hydraulic fracturing, or handling of NORM-impacted equipment that, if implemented, could increase our or our customers’ costs or liabilities associated with elevated levels of NORM as well as limit drilling by our customers, which developments may reduce demand for our services.
The federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), also known as the “Superfund” law, and comparable state statutes impose liability, without regard to fault or legality of the original conduct, on classes of persons that are considered to have contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. Such classes of persons include the current and past owners or operators of sites where a hazardous substance was released, and anyone who disposed or arranged for the disposal of a hazardous substance released at the site. Under CERCLA, these persons may be subject to joint and several, strict liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment and for damages to natural resources even if the liability results from conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or is due to the conduct, or conditions caused by, prior operators or third parties. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. We own, lease, or operate numerous properties and facilities that for many years have been used for industrial activities, including oil and natural gas-related operations. Hazardous substances, wastes, or hydrocarbons may have been released on or under the properties owned or leased by us, or on or under other locations where such substances have been taken for recycling or disposal. In addition, some of these properties have been operated by third parties or by previous owners whose treatment and disposal or release of hazardous substances, wastes, or hydrocarbons, was not under our control. These properties and the substances disposed or released on them may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under such laws, we could be required to remove previously disposed substances and wastes and remediate contaminated property (including groundwater contamination), including instances where the prior owner or operator caused the contamination, or perform remedial plugging of disposal wells or waste pit closure operations to prevent future contamination.
Water Discharges and Discharges into Belowground Formations
The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, also known as the Clean Water Act (“CWA”) and analogous state laws, impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of oil and hazardous substances, into state waters and waters of the United States. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or an analogous state agency. Spill prevention, control and countermeasure plan requirements imposed under the CWA require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters in the event of a petroleum hydrocarbon tank spill, rupture or leak. In addition, the CWA and analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities. The CWA also prohibits the discharge of dredge and fill material in regulated waters, including wetlands, unless authorized by a permit issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (“Corps”). The CWA and analogous state laws also may impose substantial civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance including spills and other non-authorized discharges.
In 2015, the EPA and the Corps published a final rule outlining their position on federal jurisdictional reach over waters of the United States, including wetlands, but legal challenges to this rule followed. Beginning in the first quarter of 2017, the EPA and the Corps agreed to reconsider the 2015 rule and, thereafter, the agencies (i) published a proposed rule in 2017 to rescind the 2015 rule and recodify the regulatory text that governed waters of the United States prior to promulgation of the 2015 rule, (ii) published a final rule in February 2018 adding a February 6, 2020 applicable date to the 2015 rule, and (iii) published a proposed rule in December 2018 re-defining the CWA’s jurisdiction over waters of the United States for which the agencies will seek public comment. The 2015 and February 2018 final rules are being challenged by various factions in the federal district court and implementation of the 2018 rule has been enjoined to twenty-eight states pending resolution of various federal district court challenges. As a result of these legal developments, future implementation of the 2015 rule is uncertain at this time. Any expansion of the CWA’s jurisdiction in areas where we or our customers operate, could impose additional permitting obligations on us and our customers.
The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA”) amends the CWA and sets minimum standards for prevention, containment and cleanup of oil spills. OPA applies to vessels, offshore facilities, and onshore facilities, including exploration and production facilities that may affect waters of the United States. Under OPA, responsible parties including owners and operators of onshore facilities may be held strictly liable for oil cleanup costs and natural resource damages as well as a variety of public and private damages that may result from oil spills. The OPA also requires owners or operators of certain onshore facilities to prepare facility response plans for responding to a worst-case discharge of oil into waters of the United States.
Our oil and natural gas producing customers dispose of flowback and produced water or certain other oilfield fluids gathered from oil and natural gas producing operations in accordance with permits issued by government authorities overseeing 
11

such disposal activities. While these permits are issued pursuant to existing laws and regulations, these legal requirements are subject to change based on concerns of the public or governmental authorities regarding such disposal activities. One such concern relates to seismic events near underground disposal wells used for the disposal by injection of flowback and produced water or certain other oilfield fluids resulting from oil and natural gas activities. In 2016, the United States Geological Survey identified six states with the most significant hazards from seismicity events suspected of having been induced by injection of oilfield fluids into underground disposal wells, including Oklahoma, Kansas, Texas, Colorado, New Mexico, and Arkansas. In response to concerns between use of underground disposal wells and the occurrence of seismic events, regulators in some states have imposed, or are considering imposing, additional requirements in the permitting of produced water disposal wells or otherwise to assess any relationship between seismicity and the use of such wells. For example, Texas and Oklahoma have issued rules for produced water disposal wells that impose certain permitting restrictions, operating restrictions and/or reporting requirements on disposal wells in proximity to faults. Additionally, from time to time, states may develop and implement plans directing certain wells where seismic incidents have occurred to restrict or suspend disposal well operations, as has occurred in Oklahoma. For example, in late 2016, the Oil and Gas Conservation Division of the Oklahoma Corporation Commission (“OCC”) and the Oklahoma Geological Survey released well completion seismicity guidance, which requires operators to take certain prescriptive actions, including an operator’s planned mitigation practices, following certain unusual seismic activity within 1.25 miles of hydraulic fracturing operations. In recent years, including during 2018, the OCC’s Oil and Gas Conservation Division has issued orders limiting future increases in the volume of oil and natural gas produced water injected belowground into the Arbuckle formation in an effort to reduce the number of earthquakes in the state. Another consequence of seismic events may be lawsuits alleging that disposal well operations have caused damage to neighboring properties or otherwise violated state and federal rules regulating waste disposal. These developments could result in additional regulation and restrictions on the use of injection wells by our customers to dispose of flowback and produced water and certain other oilfield fluids. Increased regulation and attention given to seismicity events suspected of having been induced by injection of oilfield fluids into underground disposal wells also could lead to greater opposition to, and litigation concerning, oil and natural gas activities utilizing injection wells for waste disposal. Any of these developments may result in our customers having to limit disposal well volumes, disposal rates or locations, or require our customers or third party disposal well operators that are used to dispose of customer produced water to shut down disposal wells, which developments could adversely affect our customers’ business and result in a corresponding decrease in the need for our services, which would could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Air Emissions
Certain of our operations also result in emissions of regulated air pollutants. The federal Clean Air Act (“CAA”) and analogous state laws require permits for certain facilities that have the potential to emit substances into the atmosphere that could adversely affect environmental quality. These laws and their implementing regulations also impose generally applicable limitations on air emissions and require adherence to maintenance, work practice, reporting and record keeping, and other requirements. Failure to obtain a permit or to comply with permit or other regulatory requirements could result in the imposition of sanctions, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties. In addition, we or our customers could be required to shut down or retrofit existing equipment, leading to additional expenses and operational delays.
Many of these regulatory requirements, including New Source Performance Standards (“NSPS”) and Maximum Achievable Control Technology (“MACT”) standards, are expected to be made more stringent over time as a result of stricter ambient air quality standards and other air quality protection goals adopted by the EPA. Compliance with these or other new or amended regulations could, among other things, require installation of new emission controls on some of our equipment, result in longer permitting timelines, and significantly increase our capital expenditures and operating costs, which could adversely impact on our business. For example, in 2015, the EPA lowered the National Ambient Air Quality Standard, (“NAAQS”) for ozone from 75 to 70 parts per billion for both the 8-hour primary and secondary standards. In 2017 and 2018, the EPA issued area designations with respect to ground-level ozone as either “attainment/unclassifiable,” “unclassifiable” or “nonattainment.” Additionally, in November 2018, the EPA issued final requirements that apply to state, local, and tribal air agencies for implementing the 2015 NAAQS for ground-level ozone. Reclassification of areas or imposition of more stringent standards may make it more difficult to construct new or modified sources of air pollution in newly designated non-attainment areas. Additionally, states are expected to implement more stringent requirements as a result of the revised NAAQS for ozone, which could result in stricter permitting requirements, delay or prohibit our ability to obtain such permits, and result in increased expenditures for pollution control equipment, the costs of which could be significant. Compliance with this and other air pollution control and permitting requirements has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects and increase costs for us and our customers. Moreover, our business could be materially affected if our customers’ operations are significantly affected by these or other similar requirements. These requirements could increase the cost of doing business for us and our customers, reduce the demand for the oil and natural gas our customers produce, and thus have an adverse effect on the demand for our services.

Climate Change
Climate change continues to attract considerable public, governmental and scientific attention. As a result, numerous proposals have been made and are likely to continue to be made at the international, national, regional and state levels of government to monitor and limit emissions of greenhouse gases (“GHGs”). These efforts have included consideration of cap-and-trade programs, carbon taxes, GHG reporting and tracking programs and regulations that directly limit GHG emissions from certain sources. In the absence of federal GHG-limiting legislations, the EPA has determined that GHG emissions present a danger to public health and the environment and has adopted regulations that, among other things, restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the CAA and may require the installation of “best available control technology” to limit emissions of GHGs from any new or significantly modified facilities that we may seek to construct in the future if they would otherwise emit large volumes of GHGs together with other criteria pollutants. Also, the EPA has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from oil and natural gas production, processing, transmission and storage facilities in the United States. In 2015, the EPA amended and expanded the GHG reporting requirements to all segments of the oil and natural gas industry, including gathering and boosting stations as well as completions and workovers from hydraulically fractured oil wells. 
The EPA has also taken steps to limit methane emissions, a GHG, from certain new modified or reconstructed facilities in the oil and natural gas sector through the adoption of a final rule in 2016 establishing NSPS Subpart OOOOa standards for methane emissions. However, in June 2017, the EPA published a proposed rule to stay certain portions of these Subpart OOOOa standards for two years but the rule was not finalized. Rather, in February 2018, the EPA finalized amendments to certain requirements of the 2016 final rule, and in September 2018 the EPA proposed additional amendments, including rescission of certain requirements and revisions to other requirements, such as fugitive emission monitoring frequency. Further more, in late 2016, the federal Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) published a final rule that established, among other things, requirements to reduce methane emissions by regulating venting, flaring and leaks from oil and natural gas production activities on onshore federal and Native American lands. However, in September 2018, the BLM published a final rule that rescinds most of the new requirements of the 2016 final rule and codifies the BLM's prior approach to venting and flaring but the rule rescinding the 2016 final rule has been challenged in federal court and remains pending. In the event that the EPA’s 2016 or the BLM’s 2016 rules should remain or be placed in effect, or should any other new methane emission standards be imposed on the oil and natural gas sector, such requirements could result in increased costs to our or our customers’ operations as well as result in restrictions, delays or cancellations in such operations, which costs, restrictions delays or cancellations could adversely affect our business.
Internationally, in April 2016, the United States joined other countries in entering into a United Nations-sponsored non-binding agreement negotiated in Paris, France (the “Paris Agreement”) for nations to limit their GHG emissions through individually determined reduction goals every five years beginning in 2020. However, in August 2017, the U.S. State Department informed the United Nations of the intent of the United States to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement provides for a four-year exit process beginning when it took effect in November 2016. The United States’ adherence to the exit process and/or the terms on which the United States may reenter the Paris Agreement or a separately negotiated agreement are unclear at this time. Substantial limitations on GHG emissions could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas our customers produce and lower the value of their reserves, which developments could reduce demand for our services and have a corresponding material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.
Notwithstanding potential risks related to climate change, the International Energy Agency estimates that oil and natural gas will continue to represent a major share of global energy use through 2040, and other studies by the private sector project continued growth in demand for the next two decades. However, recent activism directed at shifting funding away from companies with energy-related assets could result in limitations or restrictions on certain sources of funding for the energy sector. Ultimately this could make it more difficult to secure funding for exploration and production or midstream activities. Finally, increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth’s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods and other climatic events. If any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our operations.
Endangered Species
The federal Endangered Species Act (“ESA”) restricts activities that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act (“MBTA”). Customer oil and natural gas operations may be adversely affected by seasonal or permanent restrictions on drilling activities designed to protect various wildlife, which may limit their ability to operate in protected areas. Permanent restrictions imposed to protect endangered and threatened species could prohibit drilling in certain areas or require the implementation of expensive mitigation measures. Moreover, as a result of one or more settlements entered into by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (“FWS”), that agency is required to consider listing numerous species as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act by 
13

specified timelines. Current ESA listings and the designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas where we or our customers operate could cause us or our customers to incur increased costs arising from species protection or mitigation measures and could result in restrictions, delays or cancellations in our or our customers’ performance of operations, which could adversely affect or reduce demand for our services.
Hydraulic Fracturing
We perform hydraulic fracturing services for our customers. Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations. The hydraulic fracturing process involves the injection of water, proppant and chemical additives under pressure into the formation to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production.
Hydraulic fracturing typically is regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions or similar agencies, but the EPA has conducted investigations or asserted federal regulatory authority pursuant to the federal Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”) Underground Injection Control (“UIC”) program over certain aspects of the process. For example, in late 2016, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources, concluding that “water cycle” activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources under certain circumstances. Additionally, the EPA has asserted regulatory authority under the SDWA UIC program over hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel fuel and issued permitting guidance covering such activities, as well as published an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking regarding Toxic Substances Control Act reporting of the chemical substances and mixtures used in hydraulic fracturing. The EPA also published final CAA regulations in 2012 and 2016 governing performance standards, including standards for the capture of emissions released during oil and natural gas hydraulic fracturing. Moreover, in 2016, the EPA published an effluent limit guideline final rule prohibiting the discharge of produced water from onshore unconventional oil and natural gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants. The BLM published a final rule in 2015 that imposed new or more stringent standards for performing hydraulic fracturing on federal and Native American lands but the BLM rescinded the 2015 rule in later 2017; however, litigation challenging the BLM’s decisions to rescind the 2015 rule is pending in federal district court.
Additionally, various state and local governments have implemented, or are considering, increased regulatory oversight of hydraulic fracturing through additional permit requirements, operational restrictions, disclosure requirements, well construction and temporary or permanent bans on hydraulic fracturing in certain areas. For example, Texas, Colorado and North Dakota, among others, have adopted regulations that impose new or more stringent permitting, disclosure, disposal, and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations. States could also elect to prohibit high volume hydraulic fracturing altogether, following the approach taken by the State of New York. Local land use restrictions, such as city ordinances, may restrict drilling in general and/or hydraulic fracturing in particular. Also, non-governmental organizations may seek to restrict hydraulic fracturing, as has been the case in Colorado in recent years, when certain interest groups therein have unsuccessfully pursued ballot initiatives in recent general election cycles that, had they been successful, would have revised the state constitution or state statutes in a manner that would have made exploration and production activities in the state more difficult or costly in the future, for example, by increasing mandatory setback distances of oil and natural gas operations, including hydraulic fracturing, from specific occupied structures and/or certain environmentally sensitive or recreational areas.
If new federal, state or local laws, regulations or ballot initiatives that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted, such legal requirements could result in delays, eliminate certain drilling and injection activities and make it more difficult or costly to perform hydraulic fracturing. Any such laws, regulations or ballot initiatives limiting or prohibiting hydraulic fracturing could result in decreased oil and natural gas exploration and production activities and, therefore, adversely affect demand for our services and our business. Such laws, regulations or ballot initiatives could also materially increase our costs of compliance and doing business.
