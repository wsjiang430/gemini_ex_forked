 Item 1. Business
 Organization
 Sotherly Hotels Inc. (the “Company”) is a self-managed and self-administered lodging real estate investment trust, or REIT, that was formed in August 2004 to own, acquire, renovate and reposition full-service, primarily upscale and upper-upscale hotel properties located in primary markets in the mid-Atlantic and southern United States. On December 21, 2004, the Company successfully completed its initial public offering and elected to be treated as a self-advised REIT for federal income tax purposes. The Company conducts its business through Sotherly Hotels LP, its operating partnership (the “Operating Partnership”), of which the Company is the general partner. The Company owns approximately 88.9% of the partnership units in the Operating Partnership. Limited partners (including certain of the Company’s officers and directors) own the remaining Operating Partnership units.
 As of December 31, 2018, our portfolio consisted of twelve full-service, primarily upscale and upper-upscale hotels located in eight states with an aggregate total of 3,156 rooms and the hotel commercial condominium unit of the Hyde Resort & Residences condominium hotel, with approximately 157,000 square feet of total meeting space.  All of our hotels are wholly-owned by subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership, and all are managed on a day to day basis by either MHI Hotels Services, LLC, which does business as Chesapeake Hospitality (“Chesapeake Hospitality”), or Highgate Hotels, L.P. (“Highgate Hotels”). 
 In order for the Company to qualify as a REIT, it cannot directly manage or operate our wholly-owned hotels. Therefore, we lease our wholly-owned hotel properties to entities that we refer to as our TRS Lessees, which in turn have engaged Chesapeake Hospitality and Highgate Hotels, each of which is an eligible independent management company, to manage our hotels. Our TRS Lessees are wholly-owned subsidiaries of MHI Hospitality TRS Holding, Inc. (“MHI Holding”, and collectively, “MHI TRS”). MHI TRS is a taxable REIT subsidiary for federal income tax purposes.
 Our corporate office is located at 410 West Francis Street, Williamsburg, Virginia 23185. Our telephone number is (757) 229-5648.
 Our Properties
 As of December 31, 2018, our hotels were located in Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Texas.  Nine of these hotels operate under franchise agreements with major hotel brands, and three are independent hotels.  We also own the hotel commercial condominium unit of the Hyde Resort & Residences condominium hotel.  Developments at our properties for the five years ended December 31, 2018 included the following:

• | In 2014, we acquired the Georgian Terrace located in Atlanta, Georgia at an aggregate cost of approximately $61.1 million, including certain closing costs. We also, after extensive renovations, re-branded and renamed the Hilton Philadelphia Airport to the DoubleTree by Hilton Philadelphia Airport. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In 2015, we acquired the remaining 75.0% interest in (i) the entity that owns the DoubleTree Resort by Hilton Hollywood Beach (formerly known as the Crowne Plaza Hollywood Beach Resort), and (ii) the entity that leases the DoubleTree Resort by Hilton Hollywood Beach. As a result, the Operating Partnership now has a 100% indirect ownership interest in the entities that own the DoubleTree Resort by Hilton Hollywood Beach. We also, after extensive renovations, re-branded and renamed the Crowne Plaza Jacksonville Riverfront to the DoubleTree by Hilton Jacksonville Riverfront, and re-branded and renamed the Holiday Inn Laurel West to the DoubleTree by Hilton Laurel. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In 2016, after extensive renovations, we re-branded and renamed the Crowne Plaza Houston Downtown in Houston, Texas to The Whitehall.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In 2017, we acquired the Hyde Resort & Residences hotel commercial condominium unit at an aggregate cost of approximately $4.8 million, including inventory, other assets and certain closing costs and initiated a rental program for residential condominium unit owners. We sold the Crowne Plaza Hampton Marina property for approximately $5.6 million. We also re-branded and renamed the Hilton Savannah DeSoto to The DeSoto, after extensive renovations, and re-branded and renamed the Crowne Plaza Hollywood Beach to the DoubleTree Resort by Hilton Hollywood Beach. We entered into contracts to purchase a commercial unit in the Hyde Beach House Resort & Residences condominium hotel under development in Hollywood Beach, Florida, and to acquire the Hyatt Centric Arlington hotel in Arlington, Virginia.

Our Strategy and Investment Criteria
 Our strategy is to grow through acquisitions of full-service, upscale and upper-upscale hotel properties located in the primary markets of the southern United States. We intend to grow our portfolio through disciplined acquisitions of hotel properties and believe that we will be able to source significant external growth opportunities through our management team’s extensive network of industry, corporate and institutional relationships.
 Our investment criteria are further detailed below:
  
• | Geographic Growth Markets: We are focusing our growth strategy on the major markets in the Southern region of the United States. Our management team remains confident in the long-term growth potential associated with this part of the United States. We believe these markets have, during the Company’s and our predecessors’ existence, been characterized by population growth, economic expansion, growth in new businesses and growth in the resort, recreation and leisure segments. We will continue to focus on these markets, including coastal locations, and will investigate other markets for acquisitions only if we believe these new markets will provide similar long-term growth prospects.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Full-Service Hotels: We focus our acquisition strategy on the full-service hotel segment. Our full-service hotels fall primarily under the upscale to upper-upscale categories and include such brands as Hilton, Doubletree by Hilton, Sheraton, Hyatt and Crowne Plaza, as well as independent hotels affiliated with Preferred Hotels & Resorts. We may also acquire commercial unit(s) within upscale to upper-upscale condominium hotel projects, allowing us to establish and operate unit rental programs. We do not own economy hotels. We believe that full-service hotels, in the upscale to upper-upscale categories, will outperform the broader U.S. hotel industry, and thus offer the highest returns on invested capital. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Significant Barriers to Entry: We intend to execute a strategy that entails the acquisition of hotels in prime locations with significant barriers to entry.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Proximity to Demand Generators: We seek to acquire hotel properties located in central business districts for both leisure and business travelers within the respective markets, including large state universities, airports, convention centers, corporate headquarters, sports venues and office buildings. We seek to be in walking locations that are proximate to the markets’ major demand generators.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We generally have a bias toward acquiring underperforming hotels, which we typically define as those that are poorly managed, suffer from significant deferred maintenance and capital investment and that are not properly positioned in their respective markets. In pursuing these opportunities, we hope to improve revenue and cash flow and increase the long-term value of the underperforming hotels we acquire. Our ultimate goal is to achieve a total investment that is substantially less than replacement cost of a hotel or the acquisition cost of a market performing hotel. In analyzing a potential investment in an underperforming hotel property, we typically characterize the investment opportunity as one of the following:
  
• | Branding Opportunity: The acquisition of properties that includes a repositioning of the property through a change in brand affiliation, which may include positioning the property as an independent hotel. Branding opportunities typically include physical upgrades and enhanced efficiencies brought about by changes in operations. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Shallow-Turn Opportunity: The acquisition of an underperforming but structurally sound hotel that requires moderate renovation to re-establish the hotel in its market.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Deep-Turn Opportunity: The acquisition of a hotel that is closed or functionally obsolete and requires a restructuring of both the business components of the operations as well as the physical plant of the hotel, including extensive renovation of the building, furniture, fixtures and equipment.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Typically, in our experience, a deep turn opportunity takes a total of approximately four years from the initial acquisition of a property to achieving full post-renovation stabilization. Therefore, when evaluating future opportunities in underperforming hotels, we intend to focus on up-branding and shallow-turn opportunities, and to pursue deep-turn opportunities on a more limited basis and in joint venture partnerships, if possible.
 Investment Vehicles. In pursuit of our investment strategy, we may employ various traditional and non-traditional investment vehicles:
  
• | Direct Purchase Opportunity: Our traditional investment strategy is to acquire direct ownership interests via our Operating Partnership in properties that meet our investment criteria, including opportunities that involve full-service, upscale and upper-upscale properties in identified geographic growth markets that have significant barriers to entry for new product delivery. Such properties, or portfolio of properties, may or may not be acquired subject to a mortgage, or other financing or lending instruments, by the seller or third-party.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 6

 
• | Joint Venture/Mezzanine Lending Opportunities: We may, from time to time, undertake a significant renovation and rehabilitation project that we characterize as a deep-turn opportunity. In such cases, we may acquire a functionally obsolete hotel whose renovation may be very lengthy and require significant capital. In these projects, we may choose to structure such acquisitions as a joint venture, or mezzanine lending program, in order to avoid severe short-term dilution and loss of current income commonly referred to as the “negative carry” associated with such extensive renovation programs. We will not pursue joint venture or mezzanine programs in which we would become a “de facto” lender to the real estate community.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Portfolio and Asset Management Strategy
 We intend to ensure that the management of our hotel properties maximizes market share, as evidenced by revenue per available room (“RevPAR”) penetration indices, and that our market share yields the optimum level of revenues for our hotels in their respective markets. Our strategy is designed to actively monitor our hotels’ operating expenses in an effort to maximize hotel earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“Hotel EBITDA”).
 Over our long history in the lodging industry we have refined many portfolio and asset management techniques that we believe provide for exceptional cash returns at our hotels. We undertake extensive budgeting due diligence wherein we examine market trends, one-time or exceptional revenue opportunities, and/or changes in the regulatory climate that may impact costs. We review daily revenue results and revenue management strategies at the hotels, and we focus on our managers’ ability to produce high quality revenues that translate to higher profit margins. We look for ancillary forms of revenues, such as leasing roof-top space for cellular towers and other communication devices and also look to lease space to third parties in our hotels, which may include, but are not limited to, gift shops or restaurants. We have and will continue to engage parking management companies to maximize parking revenue. Our efforts further include periodic review of property insurance costs and coverage, and the cost of real and personal property taxes. We generally appeal tax increases in an effort to secure lower tax payments and routinely pursue strategies that allow for lower overall insurance costs, such as purchasing re-insurance.
 We also require detailed and refined reporting data from our hotel managers, which includes detailed accounts of revenues, revenue segments, expenses and forecasts based on current and historic booking patterns. We also believe we optimize and successfully manage capital costs at our hotels while ensuring that adequate product standards are maintained to provide a positive guest experience.
 None of our hotels are managed by a major national or global hotel franchise company. Through our long history in the lodging industry, we have found that management of our hotels by management companies other than franchisors is preferable to and more profitable than management services provided by the major franchise companies, specifically with respect to optimization of operating expenses and the delivery of guest service.
 Our portfolio management strategy includes efforts to optimize labor costs. Our third-party hotel managers are responsible for hiring and maintaining the labor force at each of our hotels. Although we do not directly employ or manage employees at our hotels, we monitor our hotel managers and make recommendations regarding the operation of our hotels.  The labor force in our hotels is predominately non-unionized, with only one property, the DoubleTree by Hilton Jacksonville Riverfront, having approximately 22 employees electing to participate under a collective bargaining arrangement. Further, the labor force at our hotels that are managed by Chesapeake Hospitality is eligible to receive health and other insurance coverage through Chesapeake Hospitality, which self-insures. Self-insuring has, in our opinion and experience, provided significant savings over traditional insurance company sponsored plans.
 Asset Disposition Strategy. When a property no longer fits with our investment objectives, we will pursue a direct sale of the property for cash so that our investment capital can be redeployed according to the investment strategies outlined above. Where possible, we will seek to subsequently purchase a hotel in connection with the requirements of a tax-free exchange. Such a strategy may be deployed in order to mitigate the tax consequence that a direct sale may cause.
Our Principal Agreements
 Management Agreements
 Chesapeake Hospitality is the management company for eleven of our twelve wholly-owned hotels, as well as the Hyde Resort & Residences.  Andrew M. Sims, our chairman and chief executive officer owns an equity interest in Chesapeake Hospitality.
 On December 15, 2014, we entered into a master agreement (the “Master Agreement”) and a series of individual hotel management agreements (each a “Hotel Management Agreement” and, together, the “Hotel Management Agreements”) between the Company, the Operating Partnership, and MHI Hospitality TRS, LLC (and other TRS Lessees) on the one hand and Chesapeake 
 7

Hospitality on the other hand.  The Master Agreement and Hotel Management Agreements provide for ongoing management of the Company’s hotels other than the Hyatt Centric Arlington, which is managed by Highgate Hotels.
 The Master Agreement:
  
• | expires on December 31, 2019, or earlier if all of the Hotel Management Agreements expire or are terminated prior to that date. The Master Agreement will be extended beyond 2019 for such additional periods as a Hotel Management Agreement remains in effect; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | caused the Hotel Management Agreements to come into effect on December 31, 2014;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | requires Chesapeake Hospitality to provide dedicated executive level support for our managed hotels pursuant to certain criteria;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | provides a mechanism and established conditions on which the Company will offer Chesapeake Hospitality the opportunity to manage hotels acquired by the Company in the future, pursuant to a negotiated form of single facility management agreement, with the caveat that the Company is not required to offer the management of future hotels to Chesapeake Hospitality; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | sets an incentive management fee for each of the hotels to be managed by Chesapeake Hospitality equal to 10% of the amount by which gross operating profit, as defined in the Hotel Management Agreement, for a given year exceeds the budgeted gross operating profit for such year; provided, however, that the incentive management fee payable in respect of any such year shall not exceed 0.25% of the gross revenues of the hotel included in such calculation.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Each of the Hotel Management Agreements has a term of five years commencing January 1, 2015, with the exception of the Hotel Management Agreement for the management of the DoubleTree Resort by Hilton Hollywood Beach, which has a term of five years commencing July 31, 2015.  Each of the Hotel Management Agreements may be extended for up to two additional periods of five years subject to the approval of both parties with respect to any such extension.  The agreements provide that Chesapeake Hospitality will be the sole and exclusive manager of the hotels as the agent of the respective TRS Lessee and at the sole cost and expense of the TRS Lessee and subject to certain operating standards.  Each agreement may be terminated in connection with a sale of the related hotel.  In connection with a termination upon the sale of the hotel, Chesapeake Hospitality will be entitled to receive a termination fee equal to the lesser of the management fee paid with respect to the prior twelve months or the management fees paid for that number of months prior to the closing date of the hotel sale equal to the number of months remaining on the current term of the Hotel Management Agreement.  No sale termination fee will be payable in the event the Company elects to provide Chesapeake Hospitality with the opportunity to manage another comparable hotel and Chesapeake Hospitality is not precluded from accepting such opportunity.  Chesapeake Hospitality is required to qualify as an eligible independent contractor in order to permit the Company to continue to operate as a real estate investment trust.
 On February 3, 2017, we entered into a Condominium Hotel Management Agreement (the “Hyde Management Agreement”) with Chesapeake Hospitality for the management of the Hyde Resort & Residences condominium hotel.  In accordance with the Master Agreement, the Hyde Management Agreement has an initial term of five years commencing January 30, 2017 and mirrors the material terms of the other Hotel Management Agreements.  The terms of the Hyde Management Agreement provide for a base management fee equal to a percentage of gross revenues of the rental of condominium units participating in our rental program in the amount of 2.00% through January 2018, 2.25% through January 2019, and 2.50% thereafter.  Pursuant to the Hyde Management Agreement, Chesapeake Hospitality will manage for us the rental of individually owned condominium units pursuant to rental agreements entered into with individual condominium unit owners.  We also entered into an Association Sub Management and Assignment Agreement with Chesapeake Hospitality for the management and operation of the condominium association responsible for the operation of the Hyde Resort & Residences, and a Rental Management Agreement pursuant to which Chesapeake Hospitality agreed to manage the marketing and negotiation of rental agreements with individual condominium unit owners.
 We have also entered into a 20-year Association Management Agreement with the condominium association, whereby we have been engaged to manage the condominium association and to operate the Hyde Resort & Residences as a condominium hotel.  Individual condominium unit owners may elect for their condominium units to be rented to condominium hotel guests pursuant to a rental management program managed for us by Chesapeake Hospitality pursuant to the Hyde Management Agreement, described above.  As part of the rental management program, we have entered into individual rental agreements with condominium unit owners who have chosen to participate in our rental program, and may enter into rental agreements with unit owners in the future.  We expect the number of individual condominium unit owners who elect to participate in our rental program to vary, and the number of units available for rental to condominium hotel guests at any given time will fluctuate pursuant to that participation and due to owner occupation of the condominium hotel units.
 Amounts Payable under the Management Agreements. Each of our management companies receives a base management fee, and, if a hotel exceeds certain financial thresholds, an additional incentive management fee for the management of our hotels.

Currently, the base management fee for each of our hotels and for the Hyde Resort & Residences is 2.5% of the gross revenues of each respective hotel and is due monthly.

Franchise Agreements
 As of December 31, 2018, all but three of our wholly-owned hotels operate under franchise licenses from national hotel companies. On March 27, 2014, we purchased an independent full-service hotel in Atlanta, Georgia, which does not operate under a franchise license.  On April 12, 2016, we allowed the Crowne Plaza Houston Downtown’s franchise agreement to expire and rebranded it as The Whitehall, an independent full-service hotel.  On July 31, 2017, we allowed the Hilton Savannah DeSoto’s franchise agreement to expire and rebranded it as The DeSoto.  As our franchise agreements expire, we will continue to evaluate each hotel on a case-by-case basis and decide whether to renew or terminate the agreement.  We also periodically review our independent hotels to determine whether they would be better served by operating under a franchise license.
 Our TRS Lessees hold the franchise licenses for our wholly-owned hotels. Our hotel managers must operate each of our hotels they manage in accordance with and pursuant to the terms of the franchise agreement for the hotel.
 The franchise licenses generally specify certain management, operational, record keeping, accounting, reporting and marketing standards and procedures with which the franchisee must comply. Under the franchise licenses, the franchisee must comply with the franchisors’ standards and requirements with respect to:
  
• | training of operational personnel;
--+-----------------------------------


• | safety;
--+--------


• | maintaining specified insurance;
--+---------------------------------


• | the types of services and products ancillary to guest room services that may be provided;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | display of signage;
--+--------------------


• | marketing standards including print media, billboards, and promotions standards; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the type, quality and age of furniture, fixtures and equipment included in guest rooms, lobbies and other common areas.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 As the franchisee, our TRS Lessees are required to pay franchise/royalty fees, as well as certain other fees for marketing and reservations services in amounts that range from approximately 3.0% to 4.0% of gross revenues.  The following table sets forth certain information for the franchise licenses of our wholly-owned hotel properties as of December 31, 2018:

 Lease Agreements
 TRS Leases
 In order for the Company to maintain qualification as a REIT, neither the Company nor the Operating Partnership or its subsidiaries can operate our hotels directly. Our wholly-owned hotels are leased to our TRS Lessees, which have engaged a third-party management company to manage the hotels. Each lease has a non-cancelable term of four to thirty years, subject to earlier termination upon the occurrence of certain contingencies described in the lease.
 During the term of each lease, our TRS Lessees are obligated to pay a fixed annual base rent plus a percentage rent and certain other additional charges. Base rent accrues and is paid monthly. Percentage rent is calculated by multiplying fixed percentages by gross room revenues, in excess of certain threshold amounts and is paid monthly or quarterly, according to the terms of the agreement.
 Other Leases
 We have entered into several agreements related to the Hyde Resort & Residences, which is zoned and operated as a condominium hotel with individual condominium units owned by third parties.  In addition to our ownership of the commercial condominium unit, consisting of the designated lobby and front desk areas, we entered into a 20-year lease agreement with the condominium association responsible for the operation of the condominium, whereby we lease other common areas, including meeting rooms, office spaces, and 400 parking spaces, and also manage the parking garage.
 We lease the land underlying the Hyatt Centric Arlington hotel pursuant to a ground lease.  The ground lease requires us to make rental payments of $50,000 per year in base rent and percentage rent equal to 3.5% of gross room revenue in excess of certain thresholds, as defined in the ground lease agreement.  The initial term of the ground lease expires in 2025 and may be extended by us for five additional renewal periods of 10 years each. Rent expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 was $524,490.  The ground lease requires us to obtain the consent of the third-party lessor in order to sell the Hyatt Centric Arlington hotel or to assign our leasehold interest in the ground lease.
 Tax Status
 The Company elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), commencing with its taxable year ended December 31, 2004. In order to maintain its qualification as a REIT, the Company must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that it currently distribute, as “qualifying distributions,” at least 90.0% of its taxable income (determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and by 
 10

excluding its net capital gains and reduced by certain non-cash items) to its stockholders. The Company has adhered to these requirements each taxable year since its formation in 2004 and intends to continue to adhere to these requirements and maintain its qualification for taxation as a REIT. As a REIT, the Company generally will not be subject to federal corporate income tax on that portion of its taxable income (including its net capital gain) that is distributed to its stockholders. If the Company fails to qualify for taxation as a REIT in any taxable year, and no relief provision applies, it will be subject to federal income taxes at regular corporate rates and it would be disqualified from re-electing treatment as a REIT until the fifth taxable year after the year in which it failed to qualify as a REIT. Even if the Company qualifies for taxation as a REIT, it may be subject to certain state and local taxes on its income and property, and to federal income and excise taxes on its undistributed taxable income. In addition, taxable income from non-REIT activities managed through taxable REIT subsidiaries is subject to federal, state and local income taxes.
 While the Operating Partnership is generally not subject to federal and state income taxes, the unit holders of the Operating Partnership, including the Company, are subject to tax on their respective allocable shares of the Operating Partnership’s taxable income.
 The Company has one taxable REIT subsidiary, MHI Holding, in which it owns an interest through the Operating Partnership. MHI Holding is subject to federal, state and local income taxes. MHI Holding has operated at a cumulative taxable loss, through December 31, 2018, of approximately $17.1 million and deferred timing differences of approximately $2.8 million attributable to accrued, but not deductible, vacation and sick pay amounts and other depreciation and amortizable timing differences. The Company has not incurred federal income taxes since its formation. The cumulative taxable loss and combined timing differences result in a net deferred tax asset of approximately $5.1 million for these cumulative deferred tax loss carryforwards.
 Environmental Matters
 In connection with the ownership and operation of the hotels, we are subject to various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations relating to environmental protection. Under these laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances on, under, or in such property. Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances. In addition, the presence of contamination from hazardous or toxic substances, or the failure to remediate such contaminated property properly, may adversely affect the owner’s ability to borrow using such property as collateral. Furthermore, a person who arranges for the disposal or treatment of a hazardous or toxic substance at a property owned by another, or who transports such substance to or from such property, may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of such substance released into the environment at the disposal or treatment facility. The costs of remediation or removal of such substances may be substantial, and the presence of such substances may adversely affect the owner’s ability to sell such real estate or to borrow using such real estate as collateral. In connection with the ownership and operation of the hotels, we may be potentially liable for such costs.
 We believe that our hotels are in compliance, in all material respects, with all federal, state and local environmental ordinances and regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances and other environmental matters, the violation of which would have a material adverse effect on us. We have not received written notice from any governmental authority of any material noncompliance, liability or claim relating to hazardous or toxic substances or other environmental matters in connection with any of our present hotel properties.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, we employed thirteen full-time persons, all of whom work at our corporate office in Williamsburg, Virginia. All persons employed in the day-to-day operations of each of our hotels are employees of our third-party hotel managers engaged by our TRS Lessees to operate such hotels.
Other Commitments
 On June 1, 2017, we entered into an agreement to purchase the commercial unit of the planned Hyde Beach House Resort & Residences, a condominium hotel under development in Hollywood, Florida, for a price of $5.1 million from 4000 South Ocean Property Owner, LLLP.  In connection with the agreement, we also entered into a pre-opening services agreement whereby the seller has agreed to pay the Company approximately $0.8 million in connection with certain pre-opening activities to be undertaken prior to the closing.  The Company has agreed to purchase inventories at closing consistent with the management and operation of the planned hotel and the related condominium association for an additional amount and has further agreed to enter into a lease agreement for the parking garage and poolside cabanas associated with the planned hotel; and to enter into a management agreement relating to the operation and management of the planned hotel’s condominium association.  The Company anticipates that the closing of the transaction and the execution of related agreements will take place by the end of 2019, once construction of the planned hotel has been substantially completed.  The closing of the transaction is subject to various closing conditions as described in the purchase agreement.
