ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing novel technologies and therapeutics for the treatment of central nervous system, respiratory and other disorders.  Merger On January 24, 2019, Apricus Biosciences, Inc. completed a reverse merger transaction (the "Merger") with Seelos Therapeutics, Inc., a Delaware corporation (now known as Seelos Corporation) ("STI"). Upon completion of the Merger, we changed our name to Seelos Therapeutics, Inc. and will focus on the development and commercialization of CNS therapeutics with known mechanisms of action in areas with a highly unmet medical need. Shares of our common stock commenced trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the ticker symbol "SEEL" as of market open on January 24, 2019. Also, on January 23, 2019, in connection with, and prior to the completion of, the Merger, we effected a reverse stock split of our common stock at a ratio of 1-for-30 (the "Reverse Stock Split"). Accordingly, all share and per share information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K has been restated to retroactively show the effect of the Reverse Stock Split. Our previous ticker symbol was "APRI". Following the completion of the Merger, our business became primarily the business conducted by STI, which is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and advancement of novel therapeutics to address unmet medical needs for the benefit of patients with central nervous system disorders. See note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the Merger. New Pipeline We are planning on developing our clinical and regulatory strategy with our internal research and development team with a view toward prioritizing market introduction as quickly as possible. Our lead programs are SLS-002, SLS-005 and SLS-006.  SLS-002 is intranasal racemic ketamine with two investigational new drug applications ("INDs"), for the treatment of suicidality in post-traumatic stress disorder ("PTSD"), and in major depressive disorder. SLS-002 was originally derived from a Javelin Pharmaceuticals, Inc./Hospira, Inc. program with 16 clinical studies involving approximately 500 subjects. SLS-002 addresses an unmet need for an efficacious drug to treat suicidality in the U.S. Traditionally, anti-depressants have been used in this setting but many of the existing treatments are known to contribute to an increased risk of suicidal thoughts in some  1    circumstances. The clinical development program for SLS-002 includes two parallel healthy volunteer studies (Phase I), expected to be rapidly followed by pivotal registration studies after an end-of-phase II meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA"). We believe there is a large opportunity in the U.S. and European markets for products in this space. Based on information gathered from the databases of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, there were more than 500,000 visits to emergency rooms for suicide attempts in 2013 in the U.S. alone. Furthermore, the 12-month prevalence of attempted suicide in individuals with PTSD is approximately 400,000 in the U.S. based on the published literature. Experimental studies suggest ketamine to be a rapid, effective treatment for refractory depression and suicidality. SLS-005, is Trehalose, a protein stabilizer that also activates autophagy and crosses the blood-brain-barrier. Based on the pre-clinical and in-vitro studies, there is a sound scientific rationale for developing Trehalose for the treatment of Sanfilippo syndrome. Trehalose is a low molecular weight disaccharide (.342 kDa) that protects against pathological processes in cells. It has been shown to penetrate muscle and cross the blood brain barrier. In animal models of several diseases associated with abnormal cellular-protein aggregation, it has been shown to reduce pathological aggregation of misfolded proteins as well as to activate autophagy pathways through the activation of Transcription Factor EB ("TFEB"), a key factor in lysosomal and autophagy gene expression. Activation of TFEB is an emerging therapeutic target for a number of diseases with pathologic accumulation of storage material. Trehalose 90 mg/mL IV solution has demonstrated promising clinical potential in prior phase 2 clinical development for oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) and spinocerebellar ataxia type 3, also known as Machado Joseph disease, with encouraging safety and efficacy results thus far. These pathological proteins aggregate within cells, eventually leading to cell death. Prior preclinical studies indicate that this platform has the potential to prevent mutant protein aggregation in other devastating PolyA/PolyQ diseases. Two U.S. patents for parental administration of trehalose exist for patients with OPMD and SCA3; both are expected to expire in 2033. In addition, Orphan Drug Designation for OPMD and SCA3 has been secured in the U.S. and in the EU. In February 2019, we assumed a collaborative agreement with Team Sanfilippo Foundation (TSF), a nonprofit medical research foundation founded by parents of children with Sanfilippo syndrome. TSF, upon approval by the FDA, plans to begin an open label, Phase 2(b) clinical trial in up to 20 patients with Sanfilippo syndrome and we will provide the clinical supply of Trehalose. The terms of our agreement with TSF entitle us access to all clinical data from this trial.  SLS-006 is a true partial dopamine agonist, originally developed by Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, Inc., with previous clinical studies on 340 subjects in various Phase I and Phase II studies. It is a potent D2/D3 agonist/antagonist that has shown promising efficacy with statistical significance in Phase II studies in early stage Parkinson's disease patients and an attractive safety profile. Moreover, it has also shown synergistic effect with reduced doses of L-DOPA. We are planning to advance the product candidate into late stage trials as a monotherapy in early stage Parkinson's disease patients and as an adjunctive therapy with reduced doses of L-DOPA in late stage Parkinson's disease patients after consultation with and approval from the FDA and the European Medicines Agency ("EMA"). We believe that this Phase III-ready candidate is well-positioned to advance in development with a goal of providing relief to an estimated 1.5 million Parkinson's disease patients worldwide.  Additionally, we are developing several preclinical programs, most of which have well-defined mechanisms of action, including:  SLS-007, a peptide-based approach, targeting the NACore (nonamyloid component core). Recent in-vitro and cell culture research have shown the ability to stop the propagation and seeding of α-synuclein aggregates against increased monomeric alpha-synuclein expression, fibril preparations of seeded alpha-synuclein, and alpha-synuclein seeds derived from patients diagnosed with Parkinson's disease or Lewy Body Dementia. We will evaluate the potential for in-vivo delivery of SLS-007 in a Parkinson's disease transgenic mice model. The goal will be to establish in-vivo PK/PD and target engagement parameters of SLS-007, a family of anti-alpha-synuclein peptidic inhibitors.  SLS-008, an orally available antagonist for Chemoattractant Receptor-homologous molecule expressed on TH2 cells ("CRTh2"), targeted at chronic inflammation in asthma and orphan indications such as pediatric esophagitis. We have a "family" of compounds under its SLS-008 program. We intend to file an IND upon completing the IND-enabling studies in an undisclosed pediatric orphan indication where there is a high unmet need for an effective oral therapy.  SLS-010, an oral histamine H3A receptor antagonist that shows promising activity in narcolepsy and related disorders.  SLS-012, an injectable therapy for post-operative pain management. We intend to become a leading biopharmaceutical company focused on neurological and psychiatric disorders, including orphan indications. Our business strategy includes: 
Advancing SLS-002 in suicidality in PTSD and in major depressive disorder;
Advancing SLS-006 in early stage and late stage Parkinson's disease as a monotherapy and adjunctive therapy, respectively;
Filing an IND for SLS-008 in pediatric esophagitis and another undisclosed indication;
Forming strategic collaborations in the European Union and Asian markets; and
Acquiring synergistic assets in the central nervous system therapy space through licensing and partnerships.  2  
Bioblast Asset Purchase On February 15, 2019, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the "Bioblast Asset Purchase Agreement") with Bioblast Pharma Ltd. ("Bioblast"). Pursuant to the Bioblast Asset Purchase Agreement, we acquired all of the assets of Bioblast relating to a therapeutic platform known as Trehalose (the " Bioblast Asset Purchase"). At the closing of the Bioblast Asset Purchase (the "Bioblast Closing"), we paid to Bioblast $1.5 million in cash, and we agreed to pay to Bioblast an additional $2.0 million in cash by the one-year anniversary of the Bioblast Closing. Under the terms of the Bioblast Asset Purchase Agreement, we agreed to pay additional consideration to Bioblast upon the achievement of certain milestones in the future, as follows: (1) within 15 days following the completion of our or our affiliate's first Phase 2(b) clinical trial of Trehalose satisfying certain criteria, we will pay to Bioblast $8.5 million in cash; and (2) within 15 days following the approval for commercialization by the United States Food and Drug Administration or the Health Products and Food Branch of Health Canada of the first new drug application ("NDA") or New Drug Submission, respectively, of Trehalose filed by us or our affiliates, we will pay to Bioblast $8.5 million in cash. In addition, we agreed to pay Bioblast a cash royalty equal to 1% of the net sales of Trehalose. Under the terms of the Bioblast Asset Purchase, we assumed a collaborative agreement with Team Sanfilippo Foundation ("TSF"), a nonprofit medical research foundation founded by parents of children with Sanfilippo syndrome. TSF, upon approval by the FDA, plans to begin an open label, Phase 2(b) clinical trial in up to 20 patients with Sanfilippo syndrome, which is now known under the study name SLS-005. Seelos will provide the clinical supply of Trehalose. The terms of the Bioblast Asset Purchase Agreement entitle Seelos access to all clinical data from this trial.  Asset Purchase Agreement with Vyera Pharmaceuticals AG On March 6, 2018, STI entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Vyera Pharmaceuticals AG ("Vyera"), as amended by an amendment thereto entered into on May 18, 2018 (the "First Vyera Amendment") and an amendment thereto entered into on December 31, 2018 (the "Second Vyera Amendment" such agreement, as amended by the First Vyera Amendment and the Second Vyera Amendment, the "Vyera Asset Purchase Agreement"). Pursuant to the Vyera Asset Purchase Agreement, STI agreed to acquire the assets (the "Vyera Assets"), and liabilities (the "Vyera Assumed Liabilities"), of Vyera related to a product candidate known as TUR-002 (intranasal ketamine), which is now known as SLS-002. STI is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to seek regulatory approval in the United States for and commercialize SLS-002. STI agreed that if it receives regulatory approval to commence a Phase III clinical trial for SLS-002 and no third party has alleged any claim of conflict, infringement, invalidity or other violation of any rights of others with regard to the Vyera Assets, then STI must commence a Phase III clinical trial for SLS-002 by the date 18 months from the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Vyera Asset Purchase Agreement (the "Vyera Closing"), and if STI fails to do so, the Vyera Asset Purchase Agreement will terminate immediately and become null and void and all of the Vyera Assets and the Vyera Assumed Liabilities will automatically be returned to Vyera. In the event that, prior to the fourth anniversary of the Vyera Closing, STI sells, directly or indirectly, all or substantially all of the Vyera Assets to a third party, then STI must pay Vyera an amount equal to 4% of the net proceeds actually received by STI as an upfront payment in such sale. As partial consideration for the Vyera Assets, upon execution of the First Vyera Amendment, STI paid to Vyera a non-refundable cash payment of $150,000. As further partial consideration for the Vyera Assets, upon public announcement of the entry by us and STI into the Merger Agreement, STI paid to Vyera a non-refundable cash payment of $150,000. As further partial consideration for the Vyera Assets, upon the Vyera Closing, STI issued to Vyera 248,615 shares of STI's common stock and on January 25, 2019, we paid to Vyera cash consideration of $1.0 million. As further partial consideration for the Vyera Assets, STI agreed to pay to Vyera certain one-time, non-refundable milestone payments consisting of (i) $3.5 million upon dosing of the first patient in a Phase III clinical trial for SLS-002, (ii) $10.0 million upon approval by the FDA of an NDA, with respect to SLS-002, (iii) $5.0 million upon approval by the EMA of the foreign equivalent to an NDA with respect to SLS-002 in a Major Market, (iv) $2.5 million upon approval by the EMA of the foreign equivalent to an NDA with respect to SLS-002 in a second Major Market, (v) $5.0 million upon the achievement of $250.0 million in net sales of SLS-002, (vi) $10.0 million upon the achievement of $500.0 million in net sales of SLS-002, (vii) $15.0 million upon the achievement of $1.0 billion in net sales of SLS-002, (viii) $20.0 million upon the achievement of $1.5 billion in net sales of SLS-002 and (ix) $25.0 million upon the achievement of $2.0 billion in net sales of SLS-002. STI will also pay to Vyera royalty percentage in the mid-teens on aggregate annual net sales of SLS-002.  3   
License Agreement with Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated On September 21, 2016, STI entered into a License Agreement (the "License Agreement") with Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated ("Ligand"), Neurogen Corporation and CyDex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (collectively, the "Licensors"), pursuant to which, among other things, the Licensors granted to STI an exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-bearing, nontransferable right and license under (i) patents related to a product known as Aplindore, which is now known as SLS-006, acetaminophen (as it may have been or may be modified for use in a product to be administered by any method in any form including, without limitation injection and intravenously, the sole active pharmaceutical ingredient of which is acetaminophen), which is now known as SLS-012, an H3 receptor antagonist, which is now known as SLS-010, and either or both of the Licensors' two proprietary CRTh2 antagonists, which are now known collectively as SLS-008 (collectively, the "Licensed Products"), and (ii) copyrights, trade secrets, moral rights and all other intellectual and proprietary rights related thereto.

STI will also pay to Ligand middle single-digit royalties on aggregate annual net sales of Licensed Products other than in connection with Aplindore for the indication of Parkinson's disease or Restless Leg Syndrome in a country where such Licensed Products are covered under a licensed patent and a tiered incremental royalty in the upper single digit to lower double digit range on aggregate annual net sales of Licensed Products in connection with Aplindore for the indication of Parkinson's disease or Restless Leg Syndrome in a country where such Licensed Products are covered under a licensed patent. Additionally, STI will pay to Ligand low single digit royalties on aggregate annual net sales of Licensed Products other than in connection with Aplindore for the indication of Parkinson's disease or Restless Leg Syndrome in a country where such Licensed Products are not covered under a licensed patent and a tiered incremental royalty in the lower single digit to middle single digit range on aggregate annual net sales of Licensed Products in connection with Aplindore for the indication of Parkinson's disease or Restless Leg Syndrome in a country where such Licensed Products are not covered under a licensed patent.  UCLA Exclusive License We acquired an exclusive license to intellectual property owned by The Regents of the University of California relating to a family of rationally-designed peptide inhibitors that target the aggregation of alpha-synuclein (α-synuclein). Seelos plans to study this initial approach in Parkinson's disease and will further evaluate the potential clinical approach in other disorders affecting the central nervous system. Pursuant to the terms of the license, we paid an up-front license fee and agreed to pay certain annual fees, as well as a low single-digit royalty on net sales of licensed products. Legacy Pre-Merger Programs Prior to the closing of the Merger, in addition to strategic efforts, we had been historically focused on the development of innovative product candidates in the areas of urology and rheumatology. We have two product candidates: Vitaros, a product candidate in the United States for the treatment of erectile dysfunction ("ED"), which we in-licensed from Warner Chilcott Company, Inc., now a subsidiary of Allergan plc ("Allergan"); and RayVa, a product candidate which has completed a Phase 2a clinical trial for the treatment of Raynaud's Phenomenon, secondary to scleroderma, for which we own worldwide rights. Vitaros (alprostadil) is a topically-applied cream formulation of alprostadil, which is designed to dilate blood vessels. This combined with NexACT, our proprietary permeation enhancer, increases blood flow to the penis, causing an erection.  5   On February 15, 2018, the FDA, issued a complete response letter (a "CRL" and such CRL, the "2018 CRL") for the NDA for Vitaros. A CRL is a communication from the FDA that informs companies that an application cannot be approved in its present form. In April 2018, we met with the FDA and confirmed that two new Phase 3 clinical efficacy trials would be necessary at a lower formulation concentration in order to potentially reach approval. We have initiated discussions with parties for the U.S. Vitaros rights to enable Vitaros' continued development and potential approval in exchange for financial terms commensurate with a development stage asset.  On March 8, 2017, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Ferring (the "Ferring Asset Purchase Agreement"), pursuant to which we sold to Ferring our assets and rights related to Vitaros outside of the United States for approximately $12.7 million, which consisted of an upfront payment of $11.5 million, approximately $0.7 million for the delivery of certain product-related inventory, and an aggregate of $0.5 million related to transition services.  In 2009, Warner Chilcott Company, Inc., now a subsidiary of Allergan, acquired the commercial rights to Vitaros in the United States. In September 2015, we entered into a license agreement and amendment to the original agreement with Warner Chilcott Company, Inc., granting us exclusive rights to develop and commercialize Vitaros in the United States. If the NDA is approved by the FDA, Allergan has a one-time opt-in right to assume all future commercialization activities for Vitaros in the United States. If Allergan exercises its opt-in right, we may receive up to a total of $25 million in upfront and potential launch milestone payments, plus a double-digit royalty on net sales of Vitaros. If Allergan elects not to exercise its opt-in right, we may commercialize the product, and in return, pay Allergan a high double-digit royalty on our net sales of the product. In 2008, the FDA issued a CRL (the "2008 CRL") for the Vitaros NDA, identifying certain deficiencies in the application. Based on our subsequent interactions with the FDA and after completion of further drug-device engineering and other activities intended to address issues previously raised in the 2008 CRL, which included human factor testing as well as new non-clinical studies, we resubmitted the Vitaros NDA in August 2017. The 2018 CRL indicated that the modest treatment effect did not outweigh certain safety concerns specific to the 2.5% concentration of our permeation enhancer NexACT (DDAIP.HCl) contained in the current formulation and identified deficiencies related to chemistry, manufacturing and controls ("CMC"). In April 2018, at our end-of-review meeting with the FDA, the FDA confirmed that we should develop a new Vitaros formulation that reduces the concentration of DDAIP.HCl from 2.5% to 0.5% in order to address the tumor promotion and partner transference safety concerns noted in the 2018 CRL. The FDA also confirmed that two new Phase 3 clinical efficacy trials with the reformulated product should be conducted prior to resubmitting the NDA and that the trials should include an assessment of the potential risk of enhanced sexually transmitted infections with the new formulation. In addition, the FDA requested certain pharmacokinetic assessments that we expect can be completed as part of the requested Phase 3 program and any additional clinical or commercial safety data generated prior to a resubmission. Lastly, the FDA stated that the CMC section in the resubmission will need to be updated with data generated during development of the new formulation.  RayVa is our product candidate for the treatment of Raynaud's Phenomenon associated with scleroderma (systemic sclerosis). Raynaud's Phenomenon is characterized by the constriction of the blood vessels in response to cold or stress of the hands and feet, resulting in reduced blood flow and the sensation of pain, which can be severe. RayVa is a topically-applied cream formulation of alprostadil designed to dilate blood vessels, which is combined with our proprietary permeation enhancer NexACT, and applied on-demand to the affected extremities. RayVa received authorization in May 2014 from the FDA to begin clinical studies. We reported results from our Phase 2a clinical trial of RayVa for the treatment of Raynaud's Phenomenon secondary to scleroderma in September 2015. We are still assessing whether the safety concerns raised in the FDA's 2018 CRL specific to the 2.5% concentration of DDAIP.HCl contained in the current formulation of Vitaros will affect RayVa's future development path since the underlying NexACT technology is utilized in both. We will not initiate any future clinical studies without a collaboration partner. NexACT Drug Delivery Technology The NexACT drug delivery technology consists of a proprietary small molecule permeation enhancer called Dodecyl 2-(N,N dimethylamino)-propionate ("DDAIP") that enables the rapid absorption of high concentrations of an active pharmaceutical ingredient directly at the target site, which is designed to enhance the delivery of an active drug to the patient. We are still assessing how the safety concerns specific to the 2.5% concentration of DDAIP.HCl contained in the current formulation of Vitaros raised in the 2018 CRL may impact future development activities for other product candidates utilizing NexACT  6    technology. The safety concerns raised were specific to Vitaros for the treatment of ED and are not necessarily transferable to other product candidates. As part of the Ferring Asset Purchase Agreement, we transferred the non-U.S. patents related to DDAIP and DDAIP in combination with alprostadil and received a perpetual, exclusive (even as to Ferring), fully transferable, fully sublicensable, royalty-free, fully paid-up license to such patents in certain fields other than sexual dysfunction.  Ferring Asset Purchase Agreement On March 8, 2017, we entered into the Ferring Asset Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which, and on the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, among other things, we agreed to sell to Ferring our assets and rights (the "Purchased Assets") related to the business of developing, marketing, distributing, and commercializing, outside the United States, our products currently marketed or in development, intended for the topical treatment of sexual dysfunction (the "Product Business"), including products sold under the name Vitaros (the "Products"). The Purchased Assets include, among other things, certain pending and registered patents and trademarks, contracts, manufacturing equipment and regulatory approvals relating to the Products outside of the United States. We are retaining the U.S. development and commercialization rights for Vitaros and will receive a license from Ferring (the "Ferring License") for intellectual property rights for Vitaros and other products which relate to development both within the United States and internationally.  Pursuant to the terms of the Ferring Asset Purchase Agreement, we sold to Ferring our assets and rights related to Vitaros outside of the United States for approximately $12.7 million, which consisted of an upfront payment of $11.5 million, approximately $0.7 million for the delivery of certain product-related inventory, and an aggregate of $0.5 million related to transition services.  As of the closing, which occurred on March 8, 2017, Ferring assumed responsibility for our obligations under the purchased contracts and regulatory approvals, as well as other liabilities associated with the Purchased Assets arising after the closing date. We retained all liabilities associated with the Purchased Assets arising prior to the closing date. Under the Ferring Asset Purchase Agreement, we have also agreed to indemnify Ferring for, among other things, breaches of our representations, warranties and covenants, any liability for which we remain responsible and our failure to pay certain taxes or comply with certain laws, subject to a specified deductible in certain cases. Our aggregate liability under such indemnification claims is generally limited to $2.0 million.  At the closing of the Ferring Asset Purchase Agreement, we entered into the Ferring License with respect to certain intellectual property rights necessary to or useful for our exploitation of the Purchased Assets within the United States and for our exploitation of the Purchased Assets in certain fields outside of sexual dysfunction, including for the treatment of Raynaud's Phenomenon, outside the United States. The parties granted one another a royalty-free, perpetual and non-exclusive license to product know-how in their respective territories and Ferring granted us a royalty-free, perpetual and exclusive license to certain patents in the field of sexual dysfunction in the United States and in certain fields other than sexual dysfunction outside of the United States. Patent Portfolio As of March 14, 2019, we owned or in-licensed approximately 148 issued patents, which will expire from 2019 through 2032, approximately. Also, as of that same date, we owned or in-licensed approximately 30 patent applications, which if ultimately issued would expire as late as approximately 2032, based upon the potential expiration date of the last to expire of those patent applications. As to the in-licensed patents and patent applications, they include 129 issued patents and 18 patent applications from Ferring pursuant to the Ferring License.  To further strengthen our global patent position on our proprietary products under development and to expand the patent protection to other markets, we have filed foreign patent applications, many of which correspond to our issued United States patents and pending United States patent applications. These foreign filings have resulted in numerous issued patents and currently pending patent applications.  7   While we have obtained patents and have patent applications pending, the extent of effective patent protection in the United States and other countries is highly uncertain. No consistent policy addresses the breadth of claims allowed in or the degree of protection afforded under patents of medical and pharmaceutical companies. Patents we currently own or may obtain might not be sufficiently broad to protect us against competitors with similar technology. Any of our patents could be invalidated or circumvented. The holders of competing patents could determine to commence a lawsuit against us and may even prevail in any such lawsuit. Litigation could result in substantial cost to and diversion of effort by us, which may harm our business. In addition, our efforts to protect or defend our proprietary rights may not be successful or, even if successful, may result in substantial cost to us. Trademark Portfolio As of March 14, 2019, we owned approximately 5 registered trademarks and 2 pending trademark applications worldwide. We have common law trademark rights in the unregistered marks "Seelos Therapeutics, Inc.," "Seelos," the Seelos logo, "Vitaros," and "RayVa" in certain jurisdictions. Vitaros is a registered trademark of Ferring in certain countries outside of the United States.  While we have obtained registered trademarks, have trademark applications pending and may have common law trademark rights where applicable, the extent of effective trademark protection in the United States and other countries is highly uncertain. Trademarks we currently own or may obtain might not be sufficiently broad to protect us against competitors. Any of our trademarks could be invalidated or circumvented. Even where we have registered trademarks, competitors could seek to invalidate these registrations. Any such litigation could result in substantial cost to and diversion of effort by us, which may harm our business. In addition, our efforts to protect or defend our proprietary rights may not be successful or, even if successful, may result in substantial cost to us.  Governmental Regulation Government authorities in the United States (including federal, state and local authorities) and in other countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the manufacturing, research and clinical development, marketing, labeling and packaging, storage, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, advertising and promotion, pricing and export and import of pharmaceutical products, such as our products and product candidates. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Moreover, failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may result in, among other things, warning letters, clinical holds, civil or criminal penalties, recall or seizure of products, injunction, disbarment, partial or total suspension of production or withdrawal of the product from the market. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. United States Government Regulation In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs and medical devices under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, ("FDCA"), and its implementing regulations. Drugs and devices are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. Our product candidates are subject to regulation as combination products, which means that they are composed of both a drug product and device product. If marketed individually, each component would be subject to different regulatory pathways and reviewed by different Centers within the FDA. A combination product, however, is assigned to a Center that will have primary jurisdiction over its regulation based on a determination of the combination product's primary mode of action, which is the single mode of action that provides the most important therapeutic action. In the case of our product candidates, we believe the primary mode of action is attributable to the drug component of the product, which means that the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research would have primary jurisdiction over the premarket development, review and approval of our product  8    candidates. Accordingly, we have and plan to continue to investigate our products through the IND framework and seek approval through the NDA pathway. Based on our discussions with the FDA to date, we do not anticipate that the FDA will require a separate medical device authorization for the unit-dose dispenser to be marketed together with our product candidates, though the device component will need to comply with certain requirements applicable to devices. The process required by the FDA before our product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
submission to the FDA of an IND which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually; 
completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests and preclinical animal studies, all performed in accordance with the FDA's Good Laboratory Practice regulations; 
performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for each proposed indication in accordance with good clinical
practices (" GCPs");
submission to the FDA of an NDA after completion of all pivotal clinical trials; 
a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to file the NDA for review; 
satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the active pharmaceutical ingredient, ("API"), and finished drug product are
produced and tested to assess compliance with good manufacturing Practices ("cGMP") regulations; and 
FDA review and approval of an NDA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States.  An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for human studies. The IND also includes results of animal studies or other human studies, as appropriate, as well as manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature to support the use of the investigational new drug. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. An IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to the proposed clinical trials. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before clinical trials can begin. Accordingly, submission of an IND may or may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Additionally, approval must also be obtained from each clinical trial site's institutional review board ("IRB") before the trials may be initiated, and the IRB must monitor the study until completed. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and clinical trial results to public registries. The clinical investigation of a drug is generally divided into three phases. Although the phases are usually conducted sequentially, they may overlap or be combined. The three phases of an investigation are as follows: 
Phase 1. Phase 1 includes the initial introduction of an investigational new drug into humans. Phase 1 clinical trials are typically closely monitored and may be conducted in patients with
the target disease or condition or in healthy volunteers. These studies are designed to evaluate the safety, dosage tolerance, metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the investigational drug
in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. During Phase 1 clinical trials, sufficient information about the
investigational drug's pharmacokinetics and pharmacological effects may be obtained to permit the design of well-controlled and scientifically valid Phase 2 clinical trials. The total number of
participants included in Phase 1 clinical trials varies, but is generally in the range of 20 to 80. 
Phase 2. Phase 2 includes controlled clinical trials conducted to preliminarily or further evaluate the effectiveness of the investigational drug for a particular indication(s) in patients with the
disease or condition under study, to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks associated with the drug. Phase 2 clinical
trials are typically well-controlled, closely monitored, and conducted in a limited patient population, usually involving no more than several hundred participants. 
  9   
Phase 3. Phase 3 clinical trials are generally controlled clinical trials conducted in an expanded patient population generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. They are
performed after preliminary evidence suggesting effectiveness of the drug has been obtained, and are intended to further evaluate dosage, clinical effectiveness and safety, to establish the
overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational drug product, and to provide an adequate basis for product approval. Phase 3 clinical trials usually involve several hundred to several
thousand participants.  A pivotal study is a clinical study which adequately meets regulatory agency requirements for the evaluation of a drug candidate's efficacy and safety such that it can be used to justify the approval of the product. Generally, pivotal studies are also Phase 3 studies but may be Phase 2 studies if the trial design provides a well-controlled and reliable assessment of clinical benefit, particularly in situations where there is an unmet medical need. The FDA, the IRB or the clinical trial sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study. We may also suspend or terminate a clinical trial based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate. Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, detailed investigational drug product information is submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The application includes all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product's chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and effectiveness of the investigational drug product to the satisfaction of the FDA. Once the NDA submission has been accepted for filing, within 60 days following submission, the FDA's goal is to review applications for new molecular entities within ten months of the filing date or, if the application relates to a serious or life-threatening indication and demonstrates the potential to provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness over currently marketed therapies, six months from the filing date. The review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it typically follows such recommendations. After the FDA evaluates the NDA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the drug product and/or its API will be produced, it may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A complete response letter may require additional clinical data and/or an additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s), and/or other significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. Even if such additional information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. The FDA could also approve the NDA with a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy to mitigate risks, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct one or more post-market studies or clinical trials. Such post-market testing may include Phase 4 clinical trials and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product's safety and effectiveness after commercialization. Regulatory approval of oncology products often requires that patients in clinical trials be followed for long periods to determine the overall survival benefit of the drug.  10   After regulatory approval of a drug product is obtained, manufacturers are required to comply with a number of post-approval requirements. The holder of an approved NDA must report, among other things, certain adverse reactions and production problems to the FDA, to provide updated safety and efficacy information, and to comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for the approved product. Also, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMP after approval to ensure and preserve the long-term stability of the drug product and compliance with relevant manufacturing requirements applicable to the device component. The FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP, which imposes extensive procedural, substantive and record keeping requirements. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our product candidates. Future FDA and state inspections may identify compliance issues at our facilities or at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct. In addition, discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable requirements may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA, including withdrawal or recall of the product from the market or other voluntary, FDA-initiated or judicial action that could delay or prohibit further marketing. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product's approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA's policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments ANDA Approval Process The Hatch-Waxman Act, established abbreviated FDA approval procedures for drugs that are shown to be equivalent to proprietary drugs previously approved by the FDA through its NDA process. Approval to market and distribute these drugs is obtained by filing an ANDA with the FDA. An ANDA is a comprehensive submission that contains, among other things, data and information pertaining to the active pharmaceutical ingredient, drug product formulation, specifications and stability of the generic drug, as well as analytical methods, manufacturing process validation data and quality control procedures. Premarket applications for generic drugs are termed abbreviated because they generally do not include preclinical and clinical data to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Instead, a generic applicant must demonstrate that its product is bioequivalent to the innovator drug. In certain situations, an applicant may obtain ANDA approval of a generic product with a strength or dosage form that differs from a referenced innovator drug pursuant to the filing and approval of an ANDA Suitability Petition. The FDA will approve the generic product as suitable for an ANDA application if it finds that the generic product does not raise new questions of safety and effectiveness as compared to the innovator product. A product is not eligible for ANDA approval if the FDA determines that it is not equivalent to the referenced innovator drug, if it is intended for a different use, or if it is not subject to an approved Suitability Petition. However, such a product might be approved under an NDA, with supportive data from clinical trials.  505(b)(2) NDAs As an alternative path to FDA approval for modifications to formulations or uses of products previously approved by the FDA, an applicant may submit an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. Section 505(b)(2) was enacted as part of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments and permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes  11    from studies not conducted by, or for, the applicant or for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. If the 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on FDA's previous findings of safety and effectiveness is scientifically appropriate, it may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical studies of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements, including clinical trials, to support the change from the approved branded reference drug. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all, or some, of the label indications for which the branded reference drug has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the 505(b)(2) applicant. We anticipate filing 505(b)(2) NDAs for our lead product candidates, which would rely, in part, on the FDA's previous findings of safety and efficacy of the active ingredient.  Orange Book Listing In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, including a 505(b)(2) NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA certain patents whose claims cover the applicant's product. Upon approval of an NDA, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the Orange Book. Any applicant who files an ANDA seeking approval of a generic equivalent version of a drug listed in the Orange Book or a 505(b)(2) NDA referencing a drug listed in the Orange Book must certify to the FDA that (1) no patent information on the drug product that is the subject of the application has been submitted to the FDA; (2) such patent has expired; (3) the date on which such patent expires; or (4) such patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. This last certification is known as a paragraph IV certification. A notice of the paragraph IV certification must be provided to each owner of the patent that is the subject of the certification and to the holder of the approved NDA to which the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application refers. The applicant may also elect to submit a ``section viii'' statement certifying that its proposed label does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent. If the reference NDA holder and patent owners assert a patent challenge directed to one of the Orange Book listed patents within 45 days of the receipt of the paragraph IV certification notice, the FDA is prohibited from approving the application until the earlier of 30 months from the receipt of the paragraph IV certification expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the applicant. The ANDA or 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the branded reference drug has expired as described in further detail below.  Non-Patent Exclusivity In addition to patent exclusivity, the holder of the NDA for the listed drug may be entitled to a period of non-patent exclusivity, during which the FDA cannot approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application that relies on the listed drug. For example, a pharmaceutical manufacturer may obtain five years of non-patent exclusivity upon NDA approval of a new chemical entity, ("NCE"), which is a drug that contains an active moiety that has not been approved by FDA in any other NDA. An ``active moiety'' is defined as the molecule or ion responsible for the drug substance's physiological or pharmacologic action. During the five-year exclusivity period, the FDA cannot accept for filing any ANDA seeking approval of a generic version of that drug or any 505(b)(2) NDA for the same active moiety and that relies on the FDA's findings regarding that drug, except that FDA may accept an application for filing after four years if the follow-on applicant makes a paragraph IV certification. A drug, including one approved under Section 505(b)(2), may obtain a three-year period of exclusivity for a particular condition of approval, or change to a marketed product, such as a new formulation for a previously approved product, if one or more new clinical studies (other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies) was essential to the approval of the application and was conducted/sponsored by the applicant. Should this occur, the FDA would be precluded from approving any ANDA or 505(b)(2) application for the protected modification until after that three-year exclusivity period has run. However, unlike NCE exclusivity, the FDA can accept an application and begin the review process during the exclusivity period.  Europe/Rest of World Government Regulation In addition to regulations in the United States, we may be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our product candidates.  12   Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In Europe, for example, a clinical trial application, ("CTA"), must be submitted to each country's national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country's requirements, clinical trial development may proceed. The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with cGCPs and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational drug under European Union regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application. The application used to file the NDA in the United States is similar to that required in Europe, with the exception of, among other things, country-specific document requirements. For other countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with cGCPs and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.  Authorization Procedures in the European Union Medicines can be authorized in the European Union ("EU") by using either the centralized authorization procedure or national authorization procedures. 
Centralized Procedure. Under the Centralized Procedure a so-called Community Marketing Authorization is issued by the European Commission, based on the opinion of the Committee
for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the EMA. The Community Marketing Authorization is valid throughout the entire territory of the European Economic Area ("EEA") (which
includes the 28 Member States of the EU plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland). The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal
products, orphan medicinal products, and medicinal products indicated for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and viral diseases. The
Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical
innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU. 
For medicines that do not fall within these categories, an applicant has the option of submitting an application for a centralized marketing authorization to the EMA, as long as the medicine
concerned is a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or if its authorization would be in the interest of public health. 
National Authorization Procedures. There are also two other possible routes to authorize medicinal products in several countries, which are available for investigational drug products that
fall outside the scope of the centralized procedure: 

Decentralized Procedure. Using the Decentralized Procedure, an applicant may apply for simultaneous authorization in more than one European Union country of medicinal products that
have not yet been authorized in any European Union country and that do not fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. Under the Decentralized Procedure the applicant
chooses one country as Reference Member State. The regulatory authority of the Reference Member State will then be in charge of leading the assessment of the marketing authorization
application.
Mutual Recognition Procedure. In the Mutual Recognition Procedure, a medicine is first authorized in one European Union Member State, in accordance with the national procedures of
that country. Following this, further marketing authorizations can be sought from other European Union countries in a procedure whereby the countries concerned agree to recognize the validity
of the original, national marketing authorization.

  13   In the EU, upon receiving marketing authorization, new chemical entities generally receive eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity. If granted, data exclusivity prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovator's data to assess a generic application. During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator's data may be referenced, but no generic product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity. However, there is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the European Union's regulatory authorities to be a new chemical entity, and products may not qualify for data exclusivity.  Other Health Care Laws We may also be subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments where we may market our product candidates, if approved.  These laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, physician sunshine and privacy and security laws and regulations. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly and willfully offering, soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, for an item or service or the purchasing or ordering of a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs.  The Anti-Kickback Statute is subject to evolving interpretations. In the past, the government has enforced the Anti-Kickback Statute to reach large settlements with healthcare companies based on sham consulting and other financial arrangements with physicians. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti- Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act. The majority of states also have anti-kickback laws which establish similar prohibitions and in some cases may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers. Additionally, the civil False Claims Act prohibits knowingly presenting or causing the presentation of a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to the United States government. Actions under the False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Violations of the False Claims Act can result in very significant monetary penalties and treble damages. The federal government is using the False Claims Act, and the accompanying threat of significant liability, in its investigation and prosecution of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies throughout the United States, for example, in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses and other sales and marketing practices.  The government has obtained multi-million and multi-billion dollar settlements under the False Claims Act in addition to individual criminal convictions under applicable criminal statutes. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that the government will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers' and manufacturers' compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws. The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, ("HIPAA"), also created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. There has also been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and other healthcare providers. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, (collectively, "the Affordable Care Act"), among other things, imposed new reporting requirements on drug manufacturers for  14    payments made by them to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.  Failure to submit timely, accurately and completely the required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of approximately $0.2 million per year (or up to an aggregate of $1.1 million per year for "knowing failures"), for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately and completely reported in an annual submission.  Drug manufacturers are required to submit reports to the government by the 90th day of each calendar year.  Certain states also mandate implementation of compliance programs, impose restrictions on drug manufacturer marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of marketing expenditures and pricing information as well as gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians. We may also be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act, ("HITECH"), and their respective implementing regulations, including the final omnibus rule published on January 25, 2013, imposes specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA's privacy and security standards directly applicable to "business associates," defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney's fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts.  Coverage and Reimbursement Sales of our product candidates, once approved, will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, private health insurers and managed care organizations. Third-party payors generally decide which drugs they will cover and establish certain reimbursement levels for such drugs. In particular, in the United States, private health insurers and other third-party payors often provide reimbursement for products and services based on the level at which the government (through the Medicare or Medicaid programs) provides reimbursement for such treatments. Patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products. Sales of our products and product candidates, if approved, will therefore depend substantially on the extent to which the costs of products and our product candidates will be paid by third-party payors. Additionally, the market for our products and product candidates will depend significantly on access to third-party payors' formularies without prior authorization, step therapy, or other limitations such as approved lists of treatments for which third-party payors provide coverage and reimbursement. Additionally, coverage and reimbursement for therapeutic products can differ significantly from payor to payor. One third-party payor's decision to cover a particular medical product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical product or service, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. As a result, the coverage determination process will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately and will be a time-consuming process. In addition, the United States government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our future net revenue and results. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our products and product candidates or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover our products or product candidates could reduce physician usage of our products and product candidates, if approved, and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition.  15   
Health Care Reform In the United States and foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect our future results of operations. There have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the United States federal and state levels that seek to reduce healthcare costs. In particular, in the United States, the Affordable Care Act has had, and is expected to continue to have, a significant impact on the healthcare industry. The Affordable Care Act was designed to expand coverage for the uninsured while at the same time containing overall healthcare costs. The Affordable Care Act, among other things, addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extended the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, established annual fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs, and established a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts, which, through subsequent legislative amendments, was increased to 70%, off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer's outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D. Substantial new provisions affecting compliance were also enacted, which may require us to modify our business practices with healthcare providers and entities. Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. We expect that the current presidential administration and U.S. Congress will likely continue to seek to modify, repeal, or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of, the Affordable Care Act. Most recently, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted, which, among other things, removes penalties for not complying with Affordable Care Act's individual mandate to carry health insurance. There is still uncertainty with respect to the impact President Trump's administration and the U.S. Congress may have, if any, and any changes will likely take time to unfold, and could have an impact on coverage and reimbursement for healthcare items and services covered by plans that were authorized by the Affordable Care Act. In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. These changes include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will stay in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Additionally, in January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Recently there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, reform government program reimbursement methodologies. Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing pressures. Employees As of March 14, 2019, we had 5 full time employees in the United States. Our organization will rely primarily on outsourcing research, development and clinical trial activities, and manufacturing operations, as well as other functions critical to our business. We believe this approach enhances our ability to focus on our core product opportunities, allocate resources efficiently to different projects and allocate internal resources more effectively. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that we have a good relationship with our employees.
