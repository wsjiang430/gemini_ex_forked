GENERAL

We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on April 16, 2018. We intend to engage in the business of selling beauty sample subscriptions. We intend to implement a monthly subscription (approximately $15 with free shipping) for a box full of beauty samples. This samples will be cosmetics, hair care, body care, face care, fragrances, nail polish, skin care, bath and body, treatments products, and other similar items. We will mail this box to subscribers once per month. These samples will range from actual beauty products to protein bars. This box will include cosmetics, nail polish, skin care, bath and body treatments products and other similar items that will vary from month to month.

While no assurances can be provided, we anticipate that we will receive revenue from the sale of these monthly subscriptions, as well as the sale of full sized products we will be offering on our future website. Our monthly subscription service will introduce customers to try products they may not be aware of or have difficulty finding. Our main target market will be a woman in Europe and North America.

We may also earn a commission on some of the transactions by acting as an agent between buyer and seller.

Our supplier benefits

Our company will offer new effective marketing tool to promote the supplier beauty products. We will help the supplier brand to stand out from the large variety of beauty products available on the market, when customers are searching for suitable product. We are hoping to ensure high audience reach and engagement into their brand. We will provide supplier sample with additional booklet containing full information on points of sales, prices, product description and „how to use” info. We provide the links for customers to buy the full-sized supplier products on our website. Our service will introduce the supplier product to large audience without supplier’s significant investment into advertising. We will help to organize the supplier product sampling wisely, by sending samples directly to potential customers.

Our subscribers benefits.

Most consumers want to try a product before committing to a full-size purchase. The monthly subscription service will help subscriber to try products they may not otherwise find themselves. If someone has very little access to high-end brands then our subscription service would be a good way to try new beauty products out before buying. Our subscribers will discover new products and buy with confidence.
