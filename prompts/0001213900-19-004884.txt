Our Industry
 
Advances in technology and communications architectures as well as the robust demand outlook of the telecommunication industry is generating remarkable spending trends at top tier carriers and enterprise customers. Innovative new technologies, rising network utilization and dwindling broadband capacity are fueling the fundamental need for infrastructure expansion. The adoption of next generation technologies, quality of service and network availability will be key drivers in enabling service providers to enjoy continued subscriber growth and market competitiveness.
 
Wireless infrastructure which has been in place since the 1980’s includes towers, buildings, telephone poles and other facilities to place critical antennas and associated electronics to support a wind range of wireless protocols including WiMax, LTE and soon 5G technologies. These wireless trends combined with the wireline transition from copper to fiber, and its corresponding order of magnitude change in bandwidth, are occurring to satisfy the world’s ever increasing demand for data, which are significant long term drivers of our business model and continued success. According to iSuppli, 4G Long Term Evolution (LTE) will garner the largest share of wireless infrastructure capital spending through 2018 with 5G enhanced mobile technologies trials commencing in the United States in 2017. This important transition will accelerate migration to the next generation standard that allows for higher capacity, lower latency, and the architecture required to support new applications. The roll-out of enhanced mobile broadband, small cell architectures, 5G services and billions of new Internet of Things (IoT) connected devices greatly increases the need to modernize networks to accommodate this new breed of connectivity. This long-term trend is a significant enduring opportunity for companies like ours. The transition from trial based deployments of 5G to a full nationwide implementations is expected to continue beyond 2025. Necessary investments in supporting infrastructure such as fiber optic backhaul is expected by Deloitte Consulting LLP to require $130-$150 Billion over the next 5-7 years to adequately support the consumer demand for broadband and wireless densification projects in the United States alone. . It is mission-critical for these providers to deliver broadband capacity, reliably, securely and cost-effectively in a solution that supports the massive for data consumption of emerging applications such as: augmented reality/virtual reality, video streaming, mobile advertising, IoT, self-driving cars, personalized health monitoring and much more. The explosion of devices harnessing distributed mobility will require, innovative approaches like small cell deployments to handle the increased demands on both the wireline and wireless delivery networks.


The outlook indicator and anticipated growth in the telecommunications sector is at a faster rate over the next five (5) years to 2021 than experienced in the previous five (5) year period. Industry revenue is forecasted for the next five (5) years is to grow at an annual rate between 5%-7%. As a result, major carriers and enterprises are increasingly requiring rapid deployment of broadband solutions and network infrastructure upgrades to support an evolving array of communication technologies that attempt to cope with the mounting demand for higher mobile traffic capacity and coverage.

Competitors
 
We provide, professional and infrastructure services to carriers, service provider, utilities and enterprise clients on a national and international basis. Our primary business market is somewhat consolidated and the business is characterized by several large companies, however the market servicing the telecommunications sector is fragmented with a large number of small, privately-held, local competitors.
 
Our current and potential larger competitors include MasTec, Dycom Industries, Inc., Goodman Networks, Inc., Ericsson, and Black and Veatch. A significant portion of our services revenue is currently derived from MSAs and price is often an important factor in awarding such agreements. Accordingly, our competitors may underbid us if they elect to price their services aggressively to procure such business. It must be recognized that while these companies are competitors, under the right circumstance they are also our clients or potential clients. Our competitors may also develop the expertise, experience and resources to provide services that are equal or superior in both price to our services, and we may not be able to maintain or enhance our competitive position based on thresholds for margin and profitability that has been established as benchmarks within our Telecommunications division. The principal competitive factors for our professional services include; agility to respond, geographic presence, breadth of service offerings, technical skills “in-house” professional licenses, price, quality of service, safety record, proven performance and industry reputation. We believe we compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of all of these factors.
 
Our Competitive Strengths
 
On the telecommunication sector we believe our market advantage is the long-term relationships, MSA’s, industry leading provider of wireless and wireline solutions and a reputations and track record of our ability to perform with agility, quality on a seamless and flawless manner for our clients is key in our success to date. AW Solutions ability to provide a wide range of services in a turn-key integrated solution is critical to our clients. Our highly experienced and professional team provide such services as: RF, civil, electrical, architectural engineering and design, value engineering, network engineering services, network planning, site acquisition, land use planning, feasibility/environmental studies, lease/contract negotiations, Build-To-Suit (BTS) services, audits functions, program planning, product development, technical services, warehouse and logistics.

While organic growth will be a continued main focus in our telecommunications division to drive our business forward, acquisitions will play a strategic role in augmenting existing product and service lines, expanding geographic reach, diversifying customers and cross-selling opportunities. We are pursuing several strategies, including:
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Expand Engineering and Telecom Offerings. We are building a company that can manage the existing network infrastructures of the largest domestic and international service providers, utilities, aggregators, Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM’s) and Project Management Organizations (PMO’s) while delivering a broad range of professional services to meet accelerated demand for these services. We believe the ability to provide such solutions and services is a critical differentiator as we already have relationships for these professional services in place today. Each of our three operating units within AW Solutions intends to continue to expand into additional service offerings.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Grow Revenues and Market Share through Selective Acquisitions. We plan to continue to acquire private companies that enhance our earnings and offer complementary services plus expand our geographic reach and client base. We believe such acquisitions will help us to accelerate our revenue growth, leverage our existing strengths, and capture and retain more work “in-house” from our clients, thereby contributing to our profitability. We also believe that increased scale will enable us to bid and take on larger project and contracts. We believe there are potential acquisition candidates in the somewhat fragmented professional services market and infrastructure arena which would be likely candidates for consolidation opportunities.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Aggressively Expand Our Organic Growth Initiatives. Our customers include leading wireless and wireline telecommunications providers, cable broadband MSOs, OEMs, Utility Entities and enterprise customers. As we have expanded the breadth of our service offerings through both organic growth and selective acquisitions, we believe we have opportunities to expand revenues with our existing clients.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Expand Our Relationships with New Service Providers. We plan to capture and expand new relationships with cable broadband providers, competitive local exchange carriers (CLECs), Fortune 1000 enterprise clients, institutional clients, competitive access providers (CAPs), etc. We believe that the business model for the expansion of these relationships, leveraging our core strengths, experience and broad array of service solutions, will support our business model for organic growth.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Increase Operating Margins by Leveraging Operating Efficiencies. We believe that by centralizing administrative functions, consolidating insurance coverage and eliminating redundancies across our newly-acquired businesses, we will be positioned to offer more integrated end-to-end solutions and increase operating margins.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Cross Selling and Marketing. We believe that through our acquisitions we will be able to effectively cross sell between business units and enhanced services offerings and gain even greater traction through coordinated and branded marketing indicatives.

Customers
 
Our customers include many Fortune 1000 enterprises, wireless and wireline service providers, cable broadband MSOs and telecommunications OEMs. Our current service provider and OEM customers include leading telecommunications companies, such as Ericsson, Inc., Verizon Communications, Sprint Nextel Corporation and AT&T.
 
During 2018, our top four customers, SAC Wireless, AT&T, Ericsson, Inc and Crown Castle accounted for approximately 59% of our total revenues, as compared to our top four customers in the seven months ended December 31, 2017, Crown Castle, High Performance Services LLC, Betacom, Inc, and USAC which accounted for approximately 64% of our total revenues from continuing telecommunications operations.
 
A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from work performed under multi-year master service agreements and multi-year service contracts. We have entered into master service agreements, or MSAs, with numerous service providers and OEMs, and generally have multiple agreements with each of our customers. MSAs are generally the contracting vehicle with work awarded primarily through a competitive bidding process based on the depth of our service offerings, experience, price, geographic coverage and capacity. MSAs generally contain customer-specified service requirements, such as discrete pricing for individual tasks, but do not require our customers to purchase a minimum amount of services. To the extent that such contracts specify exclusivity, there are often a number of exceptions, including the ability of the customer to issue work orders valued above a specified dollar amount to other service providers, perform work with the customer’s own employees and use other service providers. Most of our MSAs may be cancelled by our customers upon minimum notice (typically 60 days), regardless of whether we are or are not in default. In addition, many of these contracts permit cancellation of particular purchase orders or statements of work without any prior notice but do allow for payment for services performed up to the point of hold or cancellation.
 
Suppliers and Vendors
 
We have supply agreements with major technology vendors and material supply houses. However, for a majority of the professional services we perform, our customers supply the necessary major equipment and materials. We expect to continue to further develop our relationships with our technology vendors and to broaden our scope of work with each of our partners. In many cases, our relationships with our partners have extended for over a decade, which we attribute to our commitment to excellence. It is our objective to selectively expand our partnerships moving forward in order to expand our service offerings.
Competitors
 
We provide, professional and infrastructure services to carriers, service provider, utilities and enterprise client on a national and international basis. Our primary business market is somewhat consolidated and the business is characterized by several large companies, as for the service providers to the telecommunication sector is somewhat fragmented with a significant number of small, privately-held, local competitors.
 
Our current and potential larger competitors include MasTec, Dycom Industries, Inc., Goodman Networks, Inc., Ericsson, and Black and Veatch. A significant portion of our services revenue is currently derived from MSAs and price is often an important factor in awarding such agreements. Accordingly, our competitors may underbid us if they elect to price their services aggressively to procure such business. It must be recognized that while these companies are competitors, under the right circumstance they are also our clients or potential clients. Our competitors may also develop the expertise, experience and resources to provide services that are equal or superior in both price to our services, and we may not be able to maintain or enhance our competitive position based on threshold for margin and profitability thresholds established as benchmarks within our Telecommunications division. The principal competitive factors for our professional services include; agility to respond, geographic presence, breadth of service offerings, technical skills “in-house” professional licenses, price, quality of service, safety record, proven performance and industry reputation. We believe we compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of all of these factors.

Safety and Risk Management
 
We require our employees to participate in internal training and service programs from time to time relevant to their employment and to complete any training programs required by law. The telecommunications division has not had any OSHA recordable incidents, lost work days or fatalities since inception which includes: 2006 through 2018. Our policy is to review accidents and claims from our operations, examine trends and implement changes in procedures to address safety issues. We have no Claims in our business related to: workers’ compensation claims, general liability and damage claims, or claims related to vehicle accidents, including personal injury and property damage. We insure against the risk of loss arising from our operations up to certain deductible limits in all of the states in which we operate. In addition, we retain risk of loss, up to certain limits, under our employee group health plan. We evaluate our insurance requirements on an ongoing basis to help ensure we maintain adequate levels of coverage internally and externally for our clients.
 
Our internal policy is to carefully monitor claims and actively participate with our insurers in determining claims estimates and adjustments. The estimated costs of claims are accrued as liabilities and include estimates for claims incurred but not reported. If we experience future insurance claims in excess of our umbrella coverage limit, our business could be materially and adversely affected.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had 250 full-time employees and 2 part-time employees, of whom 28 were in administration and corporate management, 6 were accounting personnel, 3 were sales personnel and 215 are engaged in professional engineering, operations, project managerial and technical roles.
 
We maintain a core of professional, technical and managerial personnel and add employees as deemed appropriate to address operational and scale requirement related to growth. Additionally, we will “flex” our work force through the use of temporary or agency staff and through subcontractors.
 
Environmental Matters
 
A portion of the work related to the telecommunication division which is work associated with above ground and underground networks of our customers. As a result, we are potentially subject to material liabilities related to encountering underground objects that may cause the release of hazardous materials or substances. We are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those regarding the removal and remediation of hazardous substances and waste. These laws and regulations can impose significant fines and criminal sanctions for violations. Costs associated with the discharge of hazardous substances may include clean-up costs and related damages or liabilities. These costs could be significant and could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.
