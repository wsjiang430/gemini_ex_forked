Corporate History and Business Developments
Cooper-Standard Holdings Inc. was established in 2004 as a Delaware corporation and began operating on December 23, 2004 when it acquired the automotive segment of Cooper Tire & Rubber Company (the “2004 Acquisition”). Cooper-Standard Holdings Inc. operates the business primarily through its principal operating subsidiary, Cooper-Standard Automotive Inc. (“CSA U.S.”). Since the 2004 Acquisition, the Company has expanded and diversified its customer base through a combination of organic growth and strategic acquisitions.
From 2006 to 2013, the Company accelerated its growth through a number of strategic acquisitions including the Fluid Handling Systems Operations in North America, Europe and China (collectively, “FHS”) from ITT Industries, Inc.; Metzeler Automotive Profile Systems; a hose manufacturing operation in Mexico from the Gates Corporation; USi, Inc.; the sealing business of Sigit S.p.A.; a joint venture with Fonds de Modernisation des Equipementiers Automobiles (“FMEA”); and Jyco Sealing Technology.
In 2014 and 2015, the Company divested its thermal and emissions product line and hard coat plastic exterior trim business, respectively, to focus on the product lines where Cooper Standard holds leading market positions. 
We continued strategic acquisitions and partnerships in 2014 and 2015 with the acquisition of Cikautxo Borja, S.L.U. in Spain, a manufacturer of heating and cooling hoses; the purchase of an additional 47.5% of Huayu-Cooper Standard Sealing Systems Co. (“Shenya”), increasing our equity ownership to 95% and positioning the Company as a leader in sealing systems in the Chinese automotive market; the formation of a joint venture with Polyrub Extrusions (India) Private Limited to grow the Company’s fluid transfer systems business in Asia; and a joint venture with INOAC Corporation of Japan accelerating our fluid transfer systems strategy in Asia, which we later purchased the remaining 49% equity interest in 2018 and now own 100% of the equity interests of Cooper-Standard INOAC Pte. Ltd. In 2016, we acquired the North American fuel and brake business of AMI Industries to expand the Company’s fuel and brake business. We also gained a controlling interest of our China-based joint venture, Shenya Sealing (Guangzhou) Company Limited. In 2017, the Company agreed to purchase the China fuel and brake business of AMI Industries, which was finalized in the first quarter of 2018. 
In the third quarter of 2018, we acquired the assets and liabilities of Lauren Manufacturing and Lauren Plastics, extruders and molders of organic, silicone, thermoplastic and engineered polymer products with expertise in sealing solutions, to further expand our Industrial and Specialty Group and non-automotive and adjacent markets. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we acquired 
3

80.1% of LS Mtron Ltd.’s automotive parts business. Through the acquisition of the injection molding system and automotive parts supplier, we further expanded our core product offerings and strategic footprint in the Asia Pacific segment. Also in the fourth quarter of 2018, we acquired Hutchings Automotive Products, LLC, a North American supplier of high quality fluid carrying products for automotive powertrain and coolant systems applications. 
In the fourth quarter of 2018, we entered into a definitive agreement to divest the AVS product line within our North America, Europe and Asia Pacific segments. The planned divestiture is expected to close in the first half of 2019, subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory and third-party approvals. 
Business Strategy
In 2013, we set a clear vision for achieving profitable growth with a long-term mission to become a Top 30 automotive supplier in terms of sales and Top 5 in return on invested capital (“ROIC”). 
In 2016, our global leadership team refined this vision - Driving Value Through Culture, Innovation and Results - to more closely represent the evolution of the Company’s innovation culture providing the basis for delivering even greater value. The global leadership team also reshaped the Company’s strategic pillars to align with the progress of the Company. These pillars are:

These councils have allowed Cooper Standard to better leverage the scale of the Company, identify best practices and transfer them around the world, and develop the foundation for a global organization structure aimed at further optimizing the Company’s scale and create global collaboration opportunities.
Leverage Technology and Materials Science for Innovative Solutions
We utilize our technical and materials science expertise to provide customers with innovative solutions. Our engineers combine product design with a broad understanding of materials science for enhanced vehicle performance. We believe our reputation for successful innovation in product design and materials is the reason our customers consult us early in their vehicle development and design process of their next generation vehicles.
Cooper Standard has evolved and further energized its approach to innovation with its i3 Innovation Process (Imagine, Initiate, Innovate). This approach is used as a mechanism to capture ideas from across our Company and supply partners while promoting a culture of innovation. Ideas are carefully evaluated by a global technology council, and those that are selected are put on an accelerated development cycle with a dedicated innovation team focused on breakthrough ideas. This team is developing innovative technologies based on materials expertise, process know-how, and application vision, which may drive future product direction. These breakthrough innovations have resulted in over $750 million in sales awards in the last three years. With a continuous stream of new ideas flowing through our pipeline, we believe that we have the ability to bring breakthrough innovations to market which we believe will provide a clear and sustainable advantage and drive value for our stakeholders.
Among recently introduced technologies is Cooper Standard’s artificial intelligence-enhanced development cycle for polymer compounds that has shortened material development times while realizing rapid discovery of new compounds that offer superior performance properties, which yield superior products. In addition, Fortrex™, the Company’s revolutionary material platform, offers reduced weight while delivering superior material performance and aesthetics. Several other significant technologies, especially related to advanced materials, processing and weight reduction, have recently been realized. These include: MagAlloy™, a new processing technology for brake lines that increases long term durability through superior corrosion resistance; and ArmorHose™, a breakthrough technology which results in significantly more durable coolant hoses and eliminates the need for separate abrasion sleeves on under-hood hose assemblies.
Our innovations are receiving industry recognition. Cooper Standard’s artificial intelligence-enhanced development cycle for polymer compound development was named a finalist for the 2019 Automotive News PACE Awards, with final judging expected to conclude in April of 2019. In addition, Fortrex™ was named a 2018 PACE Award winner and a 2018 Society of Plastics Engineers Innovation Award finalist.
Pursue Acquisitions and Alliances to Enhance Capabilities and Accelerate Growth
Our strong financial position allows us to continue to selectively pursue complementary acquisitions and joint ventures to enhance our customer base, geographic penetration, scale and technology. Consolidation is an industry trend which has been encouraged by the OEMs’ desire for global automotive suppliers. We believe we have a strong platform for growth through acquisitions based on our past integration successes, experienced management team, global presence and operational excellence. Further, our operations currently include several successful joint ventures.

Industry
The automotive industry is one of the world’s largest and most competitive. Consumer demand for new vehicles largely determines sales and production volumes of global OEMs. The business and commercial environment in each region also plays a role in vehicle demand as it relates to fleet vehicle sales and industrial use vehicles such as light and heavy trucks.
OEMs compete for market share in a variety of ways including pricing and incentives, the development of new, more attractive models, branding and advertising, and the ability to customize vehicle features and options to meet specific customer needs or demands. They rely heavily on thousands of specialized suppliers to provide the many distinct components and systems that comprise the modern vehicle. They also rely on these automotive suppliers to develop technological innovations that will help them meet consumer demands as well as regulatory requirements. 
The automotive supplier industry is a highly competitive industry generally characterized by high barriers to entry, significant start-up costs and long-standing customer relationships. The criteria by which OEMs judge automotive suppliers include quality, price, service, performance, design and engineering capabilities, innovation, timely delivery, financial stability and global footprint. Over the last decade, suppliers that have been able to achieve manufacturing scale globally, reduce structural costs, diversify their customer base and provide innovative, value-added technologies have been the most successful.
The technology of today’s vehicles is evolving rapidly. The evolution is being driven by many factors including consumer preferences and social behaviors, a competitive drive for differentiation, regulatory requirements and safety. Cooper Standard supports these trends by providing innovations that reduce weight, increase life-cycle and durability, reduce interior noise, enhance exterior appearance and simplify the manufacturing and assembly process. These are innovations that can be applicable and valuable to virtually any vehicle or vehicle manufacturer and, in many cases, can also be transferred to non-automotive applications in adjacent markets. 
Markets Served
Our automotive business is focused on the passenger car and light truck market, up to and including Class 3 full-size, full-frame trucks, better known as the global light vehicle market. This is our largest market and accounts for approximately 94% of our global sales. 
Adjacent and Non-Automotive Markets
In addition to the global light vehicle market, we also have teams dedicated to leveraging core product technology into near adjacent markets to profitably grow Cooper Standard through our Advanced Technology Group (“ATG”) which includes our Industrial and Specialty Group (“ISG”) and Applied Materials Science (“AMS”) Group. 
ISG focuses on industry segments such as commercial trucks, agricultural equipment and construction. With an addressable market of over $3.2 billion, this represents an opportunity to further diversify our revenue and profit base. Some of our traditional products as well as our innovative technologies, are well-suited to these markets. We believe these market segments represent near-term opportunities for high margin growth.
Further, our AMS team has implemented a strategy to leverage some of our materials science in non-automotive markets through licensing agreements or the sale of material compounds. The initial focus of this business model is our Fortrex™ material technology. Fortrex™ is highly adaptable, and we believe it has the potential to add significant value in many product categories and industries beyond the automotive industry. To date, the Company has licensing agreements of its proprietary Fortrex™ material platform with INOAC and PolyOne Corp.

Joint Ventures and Strategic Alliances
Joint ventures represent an important part of our business, both operationally and strategically. We have utilized joint ventures to enter into and expand in geographic markets such as China, India and Thailand, to acquire new customers and to develop new technologies. When entering new geographic markets, teaming with a local partner can reduce capital investment by leveraging pre-existing infrastructure. In addition, local partners in these markets can provide knowledge and insight into local practices and access to local suppliers of raw materials and components.
The following table shows our significant unconsolidated joint ventures:

Country | Name | Ownership Percentage
India | Sujan Cooper Standard AVS Private Limited | 50% 
United States | Nishikawa Cooper LLC | 40% 
India | Polyrub Cooper Standard FTS Private Limited | 35% 
Thailand | Nishikawa Tachaplalert Cooper Ltd. | 20% 

Research and Development 
We have a dedicated team of technical and engineering resources in each region, some of which are located at our customers’ facilities. We utilize Design for Six Sigma and other methodologies that emphasize manufacturability and quality. Our development teams work closely with our customers to design and deliver innovative solutions. Amounts spent on engineering, research and development were as follows:

Year | Amount | | Percentage of Sales
(Dollar amounts in thousands)
2016 | $ | 117,791 | | 3.4 | %
2017 | $ | 127,974 | | 3.5 | %
2018 | $ | 122,529 | | 3.4 | %

Intellectual Property
We believe that one of our key competitive advantages is our ability to translate customer needs and our game-changing ideas into innovation through the development of intellectual property. We hold a significant number of patents and trademarks worldwide.
Our patents are grouped into two major categories: (1) specific product invention claims and (2) specific manufacturing processes that are used for producing products. The vast majority of our patents fall within the product invention category. We consider these patents to be of value and seek to protect our rights throughout the world against infringement. While in the aggregate these patents are important to our business, we do not believe that the loss or expiration of any one patent would materially affect our Company. We continue to seek patent protection for our new products and have an incentive program to recognize employees whose inventions are patented. Additionally, we develop significant technologies that we treat as trade secrets and choose not to disclose to the public through the patent process. These technologies nonetheless provide significant competitive advantages and contribute to our global leadership position in various markets. We believe that our trademarks, including ArmorHose™, MagAlloy™ and Fortrex™, help differentiate us and lead customers to seek our partnership.
We also have technology sharing and licensing agreements with various third parties, including Nishikawa Rubber Company, one of our joint venture partners in sealing products. We have mutual agreements with Nishikawa Rubber Company for sales, marketing and engineering services on certain sealing products. Under those agreements, each party pays for services provided by the other and royalties on certain products for which the other party provides design or development services.
As of December 2018, the Company has signed licensing agreements to supply Fortrex™ material technology to two entities in non-automotive industries. We expect to develop significant additional opportunities for licensing of Fortrex™ and other materials-related innovations beyond our core automotive product lines.

Supplies and Raw Materials
Cooper Standard is committed to building strong relationships with our supply partners. We recognize the importance of engaging with suppliers to create value for our customers.
The principal raw materials for our business include synthetic and natural rubber, components manufactured from carbon steel, plastic resins and components, carbon black, process oils, and components manufactured from aluminum. We manage the procurement of our raw materials to assure supply and to obtain the most favorable total cost. Procurement arrangements include short-term and long-term supply agreements that may contain formula-based pricing, based on commodity indices. These arrangements provide quantities needed to satisfy normal manufacturing demands. We believe we have adequate sources for the supply of raw materials and components for our products with suppliers located around the world. We often use offshore suppliers for machined components, die castings and other labor-intensive, economically freighted products in our North American and European facilities.
Raw material prices are susceptible to fluctuations which may place operational and profitability burdens on the entire supply chain. As such, we have implemented strategies with both our suppliers and our customers to help manage these fluctuations. These actions include material substitutions and leveraging global purchases. Our global supply chain optimization efforts include using benchmarks and selective sourcing from strategic suppliers. We have also made process improvements to ensure the efficient use of materials through scrap reduction, as well as standardization of material specifications to maximize leverage over higher volume purchases. With some customers, on certain raw materials, we have implemented indices that allow price changes as underlying material costs fluctuate. The current domestic and international political environment, including existing and potential changes to U.S. and China policies related to global trade and tariffs, have resulted in uncertainty surrounding the future state of the global economy. While we continue to monitor the potential impacts of previously-announced tariffs, we anticipate these and other tariffs will negatively impact material costs.
Seasonality
Our principal operations are directly related to the automotive industry. Sales to OEMs are lowest during the months prior to model changeovers or during assembly plant shutdowns. Automotive production is traditionally reduced during July, August and year-end holidays, and our quarterly results may reflect these trends. However, economic conditions and consumer demand may change the traditional seasonality of the industry.
Backlog
Our OEM sales are generally based upon purchase orders issued by the OEMs, with updated releases for volume adjustments. As such, we typically do not have a backlog of orders at any point in time. Once selected to supply products for a particular platform, we typically supply those products for the platform life, which is normally three to five years, although there is no guarantee that this will occur. In addition, when we are the incumbent supplier to a given platform, we believe we have a competitive advantage in winning the redesign or replacement platform, although there is no guarantee that this will occur.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 32,000 employees, including over 4,500 contingent workers. We maintain good relations with both our union and non-union employees and, in the past ten years, have not experienced any major work stoppages. We renegotiated some of our domestic and non-domestic union agreements in 2018, and have several contracts set to expire in the next twelve months. 
Community Involvement
Supported by the Cooper Standard Foundation, our employees are highly engaged in their local communities. The Foundation’s mission is to strengthen the communities where Cooper Standard employees work and live through the passionate support of children’s charities, education, health and wellness, and community revitalization. The Cooper Standard Foundation is a 501(c)(3) organization with oversight by our Philanthropic Committee and Board of Trustees. For more information on the Company’s community involvement, please visit our Corporate Responsibility Report located on the Cooper Standard website. 
Environmental
Cooper Standard considers itself a steward of the environment, and we monitor the environmental impact of our business and products. We prioritize our environmental management as a means of driving and sustaining excellence. We are subject to a broad range of federal, state, and local environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations in the United States and other countries, including regulations governing: emissions to air, discharges to water, noise and odor emissions; the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment, reclamation and disposal of chemicals and waste materials; the cleanup of contaminated properties; and human health and safety. We have made, and will continue to make, expenditures to comply 
10

with environmental requirements. While our costs to defend and settle known claims arising under environmental laws have not been material in the past and are not currently estimated to be material, such costs may be material in the future. Further details regarding our commitments and contingencies are provided in Note 23. “Contingent Liabilities” to the consolidated financial statements.
