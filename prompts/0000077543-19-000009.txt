 ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 ﻿
 General
 ﻿
 Tutor Perini Corporation, formerly known as Perini Corporation, was incorporated in 1918 as a successor to businesses that had been engaged in providing construction services since 1894. Tutor Perini Corporation (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, “Tutor Perini,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our,” unless the context indicates otherwise) is a leading construction company, based on revenue as ranked by Engineering News-Record (“ENR”), offering diversified general contracting, construction management and design-build services to private customers and public agencies throughout the world. Our corporate headquarters are in Los Angeles (Sylmar), California, and we have various other principal offices throughout the United States and its territories (see Item 2. Properties for a listing of our major facilities). Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “TPC.” We are incorporated in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
 ﻿
 We have established a strong reputation within our markets for executing large, complex projects on time and within budget while adhering to strict quality control measures. We offer general contracting, pre-construction planning and comprehensive project management services, including the planning and scheduling of the manpower, equipment, materials and subcontractors required for a project. We also offer self-performed construction services including site work; concrete forming and placement; steel erection; electrical, mechanical, plumbing, heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC), and fire protection. During 2018, we performed work on approximately 1,400 construction projects.
 ﻿
 In 2018, ENR ranked Tutor Perini as the tenth largest domestic contractor. We are recognized as one of the leading civil contractors in the United States, as evidenced by our performance on several of the country’s largest mass-transit and transportation projects, such as Newark Liberty International Airport Terminal One (“Newark Airport Terminal One”), the East Side Access project in New York City, the California High-Speed Rail System, the Alaskan Way Viaduct Replacement (SR 99) project in Seattle, major portions of the Red Line and Purple Line segments of the Los Angeles subway system, and the San Francisco Central Subway extension to Chinatown. We are also recognized as one of the leading building contractors in the United States, as evidenced by our performance on several of the country’s largest building development projects, including CityCenter and the Cosmopolitan Resort and Casino in Las Vegas and Hudson Yards in New York City.
 ﻿
 Since the 2008 merger between our predecessor companies, Tutor-Saliba Corporation (“Tutor-Saliba”) and Perini Corporation, we have experienced significant growth supported by our increased size, scale, bonding capacity, access to broader geographic regions, expanded management capabilities, complementary assets and particular expertise in large, complex projects. In 2010 and 2011, we expanded vertically and geographically through the strategic acquisitions of seven companies with demonstrated success in their respective markets. These acquisitions further strengthened our geographic presence in our Building and Civil segments and also significantly increased our specialty contracting capabilities.
 ﻿
 Our acquisitions have enabled us to provide customers with a vertically integrated service offering. This vertical integration is a unique capability and competitive advantage that allows us to self-perform a greater amount of work than our competitors. Our vertical integration increases our competitiveness in bidding and our efficiency in managing and executing large, complex projects. It also provides us with significant cross-selling opportunities across a broad geographic footprint.

Business Segment Overview
 ﻿
 Our business is conducted through three segments: Civil, Building and Specialty Contractors.
 ﻿
 Civil Segment
 ﻿
 Our Civil segment specializes in public works construction and the replacement and reconstruction of infrastructure across most of the major geographic regions of the United States. Our civil contracting services include construction and rehabilitation of highways, bridges, tunnels, mass-transit systems, and water management and wastewater treatment facilities.
 ﻿
 The Civil segment is comprised of the Company’s legacy heavy civil construction operations (civil operations of our predecessors, Tutor-Saliba, its subsidiary Black Construction, and Perini Corporation), as well as our acquired companies, Frontier-Kemper, Lunda Construction and Becho. The Company’s legacy heavy civil units operate primarily on the West and East Coasts of the United States and are engaged in a variety of large mass-transit, transportation, bridge and highway projects. Frontier-Kemper is a heavy civil contractor engaged in the construction of tunnels for highways, railroads, subways and rapid transit systems; the construction of shafts and other facilities for water supply, wastewater transport and hydroelectric projects; and the development and equipping of mines with innovative hoisting, elevator and vertical conveyance systems. Lunda Construction is a heavy civil contractor specializing in the construction, rehabilitation and maintenance of bridges, railroads and other civil structures throughout the United States. Becho is engaged in drilling, foundation and excavation support for shoring, bridges, piers, roads and highway projects, primarily in the southwestern United States. We believe that the Company has benefitted from these acquisitions by an expanded geographic presence, enhanced civil construction capabilities and the addition of experienced management with proven, successful track records.
 ﻿
 Our Civil segment’s customers primarily award contracts through one of two methods: the traditional public “competitive bid” method, in which price is the major determining factor, or through a request for proposal, where contracts are awarded based on a combination of technical qualifications, proposed project team, schedule, past performance on similar projects and price.
 ﻿
 Traditionally, our Civil segment’s customers require each contractor to pre-qualify for construction business by meeting criteria that include technical capabilities and financial strength. Our financial strength and outstanding record of performance on challenging civil works projects often enable us to pre-qualify for projects in situations where smaller, less diversified contractors are unable to meet the qualification requirements. We believe this is a competitive advantage that makes us an attractive partner on the largest, most complex infrastructure projects and on prestigious design-build, DBOM (design-build-operate-maintain) and P3 (public-private partnership) projects. 
 ﻿
 In its 2018 rankings, ENR ranked us as the nation’s second largest contractor in the transportation market and third largest domestic heavy contractor.
 ﻿
 We believe the Civil segment provides us with significant opportunities for growth due to the age and condition of existing infrastructure coupled with large government funding sources dedicated to the replacement and reconstruction of aging U.S. infrastructure. In addition, infrastructure improvement programs frequently enjoy popular, bipartisan support from the public and elected officials. Funding for major civil infrastructure projects is typically provided through a combination of one or more of the following: local, regional, state and federal loans and grants; other direct allocations sourced through tax revenue; bonds; user fees; and, for certain projects, private capital. 
 ﻿
 We have been active in civil construction since 1894 and believe we have a particular expertise in large, complex civil construction projects. We have completed, or are currently working on, some of the most significant civil construction projects in the United States. For example, we are currently working on Newark Airport Terminal One, various portions of the East Side Access project in New York City, the first phase of the California High-Speed Rail project, the Purple Line Segments 2 and 3 expansion projects in Los Angeles, and the San Francisco Central Subway extension to Chinatown. We have also completed major projects such as the Alaskan Way Viaduct Replacement (SR 99) in Seattle; the platform over the eastern rail yard at Hudson Yards in New York City; the rehabilitation of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge in New York; and multiple runway reconstruction projects, including the John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, Los Angeles International Airport, and Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport.
 ﻿
 Building Segment
 ﻿
 Our Building segment has significant experience providing services to a number of specialized building markets for private and public works customers, including hospitality and gaming, transportation, health care, commercial offices, government facilities, sports and entertainment, education, correctional facilities, biotech, pharmaceutical, industrial and high-tech. We believe the success of the Building segment results from our proven ability to manage and perform large, complex projects with aggressive fast-track schedules, elaborate designs, and advanced mechanical, electrical and life safety systems, while providing accurate budgeting and strict quality control. Although price is a key competitive factor, we believe our strong reputation, long-standing customer relationships and significant level of repeat and referral business have enabled us to achieve a leading position in the marketplace.

﻿
 In its 2018 rankings, ENR ranked us as the 11th largest domestic building contractor. We are a recognized leader in the hospitality and gaming market, specializing in the construction of high-end resorts and casinos. We work with hotel operators, Native American tribal councils, developers and architectural firms to provide diversified construction services to meet the challenges of new construction and renovation of hotel and resort properties. We believe that our reputation for completing projects on time is a significant competitive advantage in this market, as any delay in project completion could result in significant loss of revenue for the customer.
 ﻿
 The Building segment is comprised of several operating units that provide general contracting, design-build, preconstruction and construction services in various regions of the United States. Tutor Perini Building Corp. focuses on large, complex building projects nationwide, including significant projects in the hospitality and gaming, commercial office, education, government facilities, and multi-unit residential markets. Rudolph and Sletten focuses on large, complex projects in California in the health care, commercial office, technology, industrial, education, and government facilities markets. Roy Anderson Corp. provides general contracting services, including major disaster response support, to public and private customers primarily throughout the southeastern United States. Perini Management Services provides diversified construction and design-build services internationally to U.S. government agencies, as well as to surety companies and multi-national corporations.
 ﻿
 We have recently completed, or are currently working on, large private and public building projects across a wide array of building end markets, including commercial offices, multi-unit residential, health care, hospitality and gaming, transportation, education and entertainment. Specific projects include Newark Airport Terminal One in Newark, New Jersey; two large corporate office buildings in northern California for different confidential technology customers; a commercial office tower at 10 Hudson Yards and a multi-unit residential tower at 15 Hudson Yards in New York City; the Washington Hospital expansion in Fremont, California; the Graton Rancheria Resort and Casino in Rohnert Park, California; the Pechanga Resort and Casino expansion in Temecula, California; the Maryland Live! Casino expansion in Hanover, Maryland; Kaiser Hospital Buildings in San Leandro and Redwood City, California; and courthouses in San Bernardino and San Diego, California and Broward County, Florida. As a result of our reputation and track record, we were previously awarded and completed contracts for several marquee projects in the hospitality and gaming market, including the Resorts World New York Casino in Jamaica, New York, as well as CityCenter, the Cosmopolitan Resort and Casino, the Wynn Encore Hotel, Trump International Hotel and Tower, Paris Las Vegas and Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas. These projects span a wide array of building end markets and illustrate our Building segment’s résumé of successfully completed large-scale public and private projects.
 ﻿
 Specialty Contractors Segment
 ﻿
 Our Specialty Contractors segment specializes in electrical, mechanical, plumbing, HVAC, fire protection systems and pneumatically placed concrete for a full range of civil and building construction projects in the industrial, commercial, hospitality and gaming, and mass-transit end markets. This segment provides unique strengths and capabilities that position us as a full-service contractor with greater control over project bids and costs, scheduled work, project delivery and risk management. The majority of work performed by the Specialty Contractors segment is contracted directly with state and local municipal agencies, real estate developers, school districts and other commercial and industrial customers. A growing portion of its work is expected to be performed for our Civil and Building segments in future years.
 ﻿
 The Specialty Contractors segment is comprised of several operating units that provide unique services in various regions of the United States. Five Star Electric has established itself as an industry leader and is one of the largest electrical contractors in New York City. Five Star Electric provides construction services in the electrical sector, including power, lighting, fire alarm, security, telecommunications, low voltage and wireless systems to both the public and private sectors. These services are provided across end markets that include multi-unit residential, hotels, commercial offices, industrial, mass transit, education, retail, sports and entertainment, health care and water treatment. Fisk Electric (“Fisk”) covers many of the major commercial, transportation and industrial electrical construction markets in California and the southern United States, with the ability to cover other attractive markets nationwide. Fisk’s expertise is in technology design and the development of electrical and technology systems for major projects spanning a broad variety of project types, including commercial office buildings, sports arenas, hospitals, research laboratories, hotels and casinos, convention centers, manufacturing plants, refineries, and water and wastewater treatment facilities. WDF, Nagelbush and Desert Mechanical each provide mechanical, plumbing, HVAC and fire protection services to a range of customers in a wide variety of markets, including transportation, commercial/industrial, schools and universities and residential. WDF is one of the largest mechanical contractors servicing the New York City metropolitan region. Nagelbush operates primarily in Florida and Desert Mechanical operates primarily in the western United States. Superior Gunite specializes in pneumatically placed structural concrete utilized in infrastructure projects nationwide, such as bridges, dams, tunnels and retaining walls.
 ﻿
 In its 2018 rankings, ENR ranked us as the fifth largest electrical contractor1, 14th largest mechanical contractor1 and 14th largest specialty contractor1 in the United States. Through Five Star Electric and WDF, collectively, we are also the largest specialty contractor in the New York City metropolitan area.
 ﻿

Our Specialty Contractors business units have completed, or are currently working on, various portions of the East Side Access project in New York City, various projects at the World Trade Center and at Hudson Yards in New York City, and electrical work for the new hospital at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. The Specialty Contractors segment has also supported, or is currently supporting, several large projects in our Civil and Building segments, including the Alaskan Way Viaduct Replacement (SR 99) project in Seattle; the San Francisco Central Subway extension to Chinatown; the Purple Line Segment 2 expansion project in Los Angeles; Newark Airport Terminal One in Newark, New Jersey; McCarran International Airport Terminal 3 in Las Vegas; and several marquee projects in the hospitality and gaming market, including CityCenter, the Cosmopolitan Resort and Casino, and the Wynn Encore Hotel in Las Vegas.
 ﻿
 Backlog
 ﻿
 Backlog in our industry is a measure of the total value of work that is remaining to be performed on projects that have been awarded. We include a construction project in our backlog when a contract is awarded or when we have otherwise received written definitive notice that the project has been awarded to us and there are no remaining major uncertainties that the project will proceed (e.g., adequate funding is in place). As a result, we believe our backlog is firm, and although cancellations or scope adjustments may occur, historically they have not been material. We estimate that approximately $4 billion, or 45%, of our backlog as of December 31, 2018 will be recognized as revenue in 2019. Our backlog by segment, end market and customer type is presented in the following tables:

 ﻿
 Competition
 ﻿
 While the construction markets include numerous competitors, especially for small to mid-sized projects, much of the work that we target is for larger, more complex projects where there are typically fewer active market participants due to the greater capabilities and resources required to perform the work. In addition to domestic competitors, we have seen certain foreign competitors attempting to grow their presence in the United States over the past several years, particularly through the pursuit of large civil projects. More recently, however, the number of these foreign competitors appears to be diminishing for many of the larger U.S. projects. We believe price, experience, reputation, responsiveness, customer relationships, project completion track record, schedule control, risk management and quality of work are key factors customers consider when awarding contracts.
 ﻿
 In our Civil segment, we compete principally with large civil construction firms, including (alphabetically) Dragados USA; Fluor Corporation; Granite Construction; Kiewit Corporation; Skanska USA; Traylor Bros., Inc.; and The Walsh Group. In our Building segment, we compete with a variety of national and regional contractors, including (alphabetically) AECOM (through its acquisitions of Tishman Construction and Hunt Construction Group); Balfour Beatty Construction; Clark Construction Group; DPR Construction; Gilbane, Inc.; Hensel Phelps Construction Co.; McCarthy Building Companies, Inc.; Skanska USA; Suffolk Construction; and Turner Construction Company. In our Specialty Contractors segment, we compete principally with various regional and local electrical, mechanical and plumbing subcontractors.
 ﻿
 Construction Costs
 ﻿
 If prices for materials, labor or equipment increase excessively, provisions in certain types of contracts often shift all or a major portion of any adverse impact to the customer. In our fixed price contracts, we attempt to insulate ourselves from the unfavorable effects of inflation, when possible, by incorporating escalating wage and price assumptions into our construction cost estimates, by

obtaining firm fixed price quotes from major subcontractors and material suppliers, and by entering into purchase commitments for materials early in the project schedule. Construction and other materials used in our construction activities are generally available locally from multiple sources and have been in adequate supply during recent years. Labor resources for our domestic projects are largely obtained through various labor unions. We have not experienced significant labor shortages in recent years, nor do we expect to in the near future, although a significant, rapid growth in our backlog may lead to situations in which labor resources become constrained. We employ expatriate and local labor in selected overseas areas.
 ﻿
 Environmental Matters
 ﻿
 Our properties and operations are subject to federal, state and municipal laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including requirements for water discharges; air emissions; the use, management and disposal of solid or hazardous materials or wastes; and the cleanup of contamination. In certain circumstances, we may also be required to hire subcontractors to dispose of hazardous materials encountered on a project in accordance with a plan approved in advance by the owner. We continually evaluate our compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations, and believe that we are in substantial compliance with those laws and regulations. However, future requirements or amendments to current laws or regulations imposing more stringent requirements could require us to incur additional costs to maintain or achieve compliance.
 ﻿
 In addition, some environmental laws, such as the U.S. federal “Superfund” law and similar state statutes, can impose liability for the entire cost of cleanup of contaminated sites upon any of the current or former owners or operators or upon parties who generated waste at, or sent waste to, these sites, regardless of who owned the site at the time of the release or the lawfulness of the original disposal activity. Contaminants have been detected at some of the sites that we own and where we have worked as a contractor in the past, and we have incurred costs for the investigation and remediation of hazardous substances. We believe that our liabilities for these sites are not material, either individually or in the aggregate. We have pollution liability insurance coverage for such matters, and if applicable, we seek indemnification from customers to cover the risks associated with environmental remediation.
 ﻿
 Insurance and Bonding
 ﻿
 All of our properties and equipment, as well as those of our joint ventures, are covered by insurance in amounts that we believe are consistent with our risk of loss and industry practice. Our wholly owned subsidiary, PCR Insurance Company, issues policies for default insurance for our subcontractors, auto liability, general liability and workers’ compensation insurance, allowing us to centralize our claims and risk management functions to reduce our insurance-related costs. 
 ﻿
 As a normal part of the construction business, we are often required to provide various types of surety bonds as an additional level of security for our performance. We also require many of our higher-risk subcontractors to provide surety bonds as security for payment of subcontractors and suppliers and to guarantee their performance. As an alternative to traditional surety bonds, we also have purchased subcontractor default insurance for certain construction projects to insure against the risk of subcontractor default.
 ﻿
 Employees
 ﻿
 The number of our employees varies based on the number of active projects, the type and magnitude of those projects, as well as our position within the lifecycle of those projects. Our total number of employees as of December 31, 2018 was approximately 8,200. 
 ﻿
 We are signatory to numerous local and regional collective bargaining agreements, both directly and through trade associations, as a union contractor. These agreements cover all necessary union crafts and are subject to various renewal dates. Estimated amounts for wage escalation related to the expiration of union contracts are included in our bids on various projects; accordingly, the expiration of any union contract in the next year is not expected to have any material impact on us. During the past several years, we have not experienced any significant work stoppages caused by our union employees.
