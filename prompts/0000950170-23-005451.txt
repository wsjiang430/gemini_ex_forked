ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
 Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (“we,” “our,” “us” or the “Company”) is a leading sporting goods retailer in the western United States, operating 432 stores and an e-commerce platform under the “Big 5 Sporting Goods” name as of January 1, 2023. Throughout this section, our fiscal years ended January 1, 2023, January 2, 2022 and January 3, 2021 are referred to as fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We provide a full-line product offering in a traditional sporting goods store format that averages approximately 12,000 square feet. Our product mix includes athletic shoes, apparel and accessories, as well as a broad selection of outdoor and athletic equipment for team sports, fitness, camping, hunting, fishing, home recreation, tennis, golf, and winter and summer recreation. We supplement our traditional sports merchandise mix with an assortment of other products that we purchase through opportunistic buys of vendor over-stock or close-out merchandise.
 We believe that over our 68-year history we have developed a reputation with the competitive and recreational sporting goods customer as a convenient neighborhood sporting goods retailer that consistently delivers value on quality merchandise. Our stores carry a wide range of products at competitive prices from well-known brand name manufacturers, including adidas, Coleman, Columbia, Everlast, New Balance, Nike, Rawlings, Skechers, Spalding, Under Armour and Wilson. We also offer brand name merchandise produced exclusively for us, private label merchandise and specials on quality items we purchase through opportunistic buys of vendor over-stock and close-out merchandise. We reinforce our value reputation through digital marketing programs, print advertising in major and local newspapers, and direct mailers designed to generate customer traffic, drive net sales and maintain brand awareness. We also maintain social media sites to enhance distribution capabilities for our promotional offers and to enable communication with our customers.
 Robert W. Miller co-founded our company in 1955 with the establishment of five retail locations in California. We sold World War II surplus items until 1963, when we began focusing exclusively on sporting goods and changed our trade name to “Big 5 Sporting Goods.” In 1971, we were acquired by Thrifty Corporation, which was subsequently purchased by Pacific Enterprises. In 1992, management bought our company in conjunction with Green Equity Investors, L.P., an affiliate of Leonard Green & Partners, L.P. In 1997, Robert W. Miller, Steven G. Miller and Green Equity Investors, L.P. recapitalized our company so that the majority of our common stock would be owned by our management and employees. In 2002, we completed an initial public offering of our common stock and became a publicly-traded company.
 Our accumulated management experience and expertise in sporting goods merchandising, advertising, operations, store development and overall cost management have enabled us to produce profitable results. We believe our historical success can be attributed to a value-based and execution-driven operating philosophy, a controlled growth strategy and a proven business model. Additional information regarding our management experience is available in Item 1, Business, under the sub-heading “Management Experience,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
We are a holding company incorporated in Delaware on October 31, 1997. We conduct our business through Big 5 Corp., a 100%-owned subsidiary incorporated in Delaware on October 27, 1997. We conduct our gift card operations through Big 5 Services Corp., a 100%-owned subsidiary of Big 5 Corp. incorporated in Virginia on December 19, 2003.
 Our corporate headquarters are located at 2525 East El Segundo Boulevard, El Segundo, California 90245. Our Internet address is www.big5sportinggoods.com. Our Annual Report on Form 10-K, our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, our Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments, if any, to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act, are available on our website, free of charge, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Impact of Global Events
 Recent global events, including the novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) and the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, have adversely affected global economies, disrupted global supply chains and contributed to increased inflation, impacting the cost of products and services.
Disruptions related to COVID-19 negatively impacted our financial results in the first half of fiscal 2020 when we temporarily closed more than one-half of our retail store locations in response to state and local shelter orders related to the COVID-19 outbreak. As our stores reopened and COVID-19 restrictions began easing, we experienced unprecedented consumer demand for our products and our financial results improved during the second half of fiscal 2020 and throughout fiscal 2021. In response to COVID-19 during fiscal 2020, measures we took to reduce expense, preserve capital and enhance our liquidity benefited our financial performance in the second half of fiscal 2020 and throughout fiscal 2021. Certain of those measures, such as reductions to advertising expense in comparison with historical levels, continued to benefit fiscal 2022 and we expect to maintain our advertising expense below pre-pandemic levels in the foreseeable future.
Disruptions related to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine contributed to higher fuel prices and consequently higher product costs. The ongoing conflict in Ukraine may continue to lead to disruptions in the global supply chain, rising fuel costs, or cybersecurity risks, and economic instability generally, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. As long as this conflict continues, we expect these challenges to remain into fiscal 2023.
We will continue to monitor these events and take appropriate actions to mitigate the risk of these global events, or any other global events that arise, as necessary.
Expansion and Store Development
 Throughout our operating history, we have sought to expand our business with the addition of new stores through a disciplined strategy of controlled growth. Our expansion within the western United States has typically been systematic and designed to capitalize on our name recognition, economical store format and economies of scale related to distribution. Over the past five fiscal years, we have opened 15 stores including relocations, of which 67% were in California. Our store openings over the past five fiscal years reflect our cautious approach toward store expansion in the current retail environment, which includes increasing ecommerce competition and the COVID-19 pandemic in fiscal 2020 and 2021. The following table reflects our store opening, closing and relocation activity during the periods indicated:

 | Stores Opened | | Stores | | Stores | Number of Stores
Year | California | | Other Markets | | Total | Relocated | Closed | | | at Period End
2018 | | 4 | | — | | 4 | | (1 | ) | | (2 | ) | 436
2019 | | 2 | | 1 | | 3 | | (1 | ) | | (4 | ) | 434
2020 | | — | | — | | — | | — | | | (4 | ) | 430
2021 | | | | | | 5 | | (2 | ) | | (2 | ) | 431
2022 | | 2 | | 1 | | 3 | | (1 | ) | | (1 | ) | 432

 Our store format enables us to have substantial flexibility regarding new store locations. We have successfully operated stores in major metropolitan areas and in areas with as few as 30,000 people. Our 12,000 average square foot store format differentiates us from superstores that typically average over 35,000 square feet, require larger target markets, are more expensive to operate and require higher net sales per store for profitability.
 New store openings typically represent attractive investment opportunities due to the relatively low investment required and the relatively short time necessary before our stores typically become profitable. While the required investment has been relatively low, we have recently experienced inflationary pressures that have led to increasing costs to open a store. Our store format normally requires investments of approximately $0.8 million in fixtures, equipment and leasehold improvements, net of landlord allowances, and approximately $0.3 million in net working capital with limited pre-opening and real estate expense related to leased locations that are built to our specifications. We seek to maximize new store performance by staffing new store management with experienced personnel from our existing stores.
 Our in-house store development and real estate personnel seek new store locations which are analyzed with the assistance of real estate firms that specialize in retail properties. Historically, we look for expansion opportunities to further penetrate our established markets, develop recently entered markets and expand into new, contiguous markets with attractive demographic, competitive and economic profiles.
Merchandising
 We target the competitive and recreational sporting goods customer with a full-line product offering at a wide variety of price points. We offer a product mix that includes athletic shoes, apparel and accessories, as well as a broad selection of outdoor and athletic equipment for team sports, fitness, camping, hunting, fishing, home recreation, tennis, golf, and winter and summer recreation. We believe we deliver consistent value to consumers by offering a distinctive merchandise mix that includes a combination of well-known brand name merchandise, merchandise produced exclusively for us under a manufacturer’s brand name, private label merchandise and specials on quality items we purchase through opportunistic buys of vendor over-stock and close-out merchandise.
 Through our 68 years of experience across different demographic, competitive and economic markets, we have refined our merchandising strategy in an effort to offer a selection of products that meets customer demand. Specifically, we continue to strategically refine our merchandise and marketing strategies in order to better align our product mix and promotional efforts with today’s consumer.
The following table illustrates our mix of soft goods, which are non-durable items such as shirts and shoes, and hard goods, which are durable items such as exercise equipment and baseball gloves, as a percentage of net sales. The change in sales mix for fiscal 2020 reflects the change in consumer demand resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, including higher sales related to fitness and outdoor recreational activities and reduced sales for team sports and back to school products:

 | Fiscal Year | 
 | 2022 | | | 2021 | | 2020 | 2019 | | 2018 | 
Hard goods | | 54.1 | % | | 55.0 | % | 60.2 | % | | 49.7 | % | 50.4 | %
Soft goods | | | | | | | | | | 
Athletic and sport footwear | | 24.8 | | | 24.1 | | 22.0 | | | 28.2 | | 28.6 | 
Athletic and sport apparel | | 21.1 | | | 20.9 | | 17.8 | | | 22.1 | | 21.0 | 
Total soft goods | | 45.9 | | | 45.0 | | 39.8 | | | 50.3 | | 49.6 | 
Total | | 100.0 | % | | 100.0 | % | 100.0 | % | | 100.0 | % | 100.0 | %

 
We sell our popular branded merchandise from an extensive list of major sporting goods equipment, athletic footwear and apparel manufacturers. Below is a selection of some of the brands we carry:
 

adidas | Coleman | Footjoy | Impex | Nike | Skechers 
Asics | Columbia | Franklin | JanSport | Rawlings | Spalding 
Bearpaw | Crosman | Gildan | Lifetime | Razor | Speedo 
Bushnell | Daisy | Head | McDavid | Remington | Timex 
Callaway | Dickies | Heelys | Mizuno | Rollerblade | Titleist 
Camp Chef | Easton | Hillerich & Bradsby | Mossberg | Russell Athletic | Under Armour
Carhartt | Everlast | iFit (Proform) | Mueller Sports Medicine | Saucony | Wilson 
Casio | Fila | Igloo | New Balance | Shimano | Winchester 

 
We believe we enjoy significant advantages in making opportunistic buys of vendor over-stock and close-out merchandise because of our strong vendor relationships, purchasing volume and rapid decision-making process. Our strong vendor relationships and purchasing volume also enable us to purchase merchandise produced exclusively for us under a manufacturer’s brand name which allows us to differentiate our product selection from competition, obtain volume pricing discounts from vendors and offer unique value to our customers. Our advertising highlights our opportunistic buys together with merchandise produced exclusively for us in order to reinforce our reputation as a retailer that offers attractive values to our customers.
 In order to complement our branded product offerings, we offer a variety of private label merchandise, which has historically represented approximately 2% of our net sales. Our sale of private label merchandise enables us to provide our customers with a broader selection of quality merchandise at a wider range of price points and allows us the potential to achieve higher margins than on sales of comparable name brand products. Our private label items include shoes, apparel, camping equipment, fishing supplies and snowsport equipment.
Seasonality influences our buying patterns and we purchase merchandise for seasonal activities in advance of a season and supplement our merchandise assortment as necessary and when possible during the season. We tailor our merchandise selection on a store-by-store basis in an effort to satisfy each region’s specific needs and seasonal buying habits. In the fourth fiscal quarter we normally experience higher inventory purchase volumes in anticipation of the winter and holiday selling season.
 Our buyers, who average 16 years of experience with us, work in collaboration with senior management to determine and enhance product selection, promotion and pricing of our merchandise mix. Management utilizes integrated merchandising, business intelligence analytics, distribution, point-of-sale and financial information systems to continuously refine our merchandise mix, pricing strategy, advertising effectiveness and inventory levels to best serve the needs of our customers.

Advertising and Marketing
 Through years of targeted advertising, we have solidified our reputation for offering quality products at attractive prices through convenient store locations. We market our products through the effective use of both digital communications as well as print media.
We built our value-based brand through weekly print advertisements beginning in 1955, and we provide print advertisements and other targeted promotional offers through carrier delivery and direct mail. Over the last several years we have been reducing our overall advertising spend. In fiscal 2020, we accelerated the reduction of print advertising in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and our print advertising remained substantially reduced (from pre-pandemic levels) in fiscal 2021 and 2022 as we continued to evaluate our advertising programs. Digital advertising represents a growing percentage of our overall advertising spend.
 We promote our products through digital marketing programs that include sending regular digital communications to our customers (e-mail marketing to our “E-Team”), search engine marketing, social media including Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, mobile programs and other website initiatives.
Our digital promotional strategy is designed to provide opportunities to connect with potential customers and enable us to promote the Big 5 brand. Our e-mail marketing program invites our customers to subscribe to our E-Team for daily special deals, weekly advertisements and product information disseminated on a regular basis. We use search engine marketing methods as a means to reach those customers searching the Internet to gather information about our products. Within our social media program, our customers have the opportunity to engage in conversations with other sports-minded people and receive exclusive information about new products and unique weekly offers. All of these marketing methods are intended to simplify the shopping experience for our customers and further demonstrate our commitment to provide great brands at great values.
 Our website features a broad representation of our product assortment and provides visibility of store inventory to our customers, thereby enabling them to determine if items featured on our website are in-stock in one or more of our store locations. Our e-commerce platform delivers an online shopping experience to our customers, and we continue to develop our online capabilities to meet customer expectations of being able to shop at their convenience.
 We have developed a strong cause marketing platform through our support of the American Red Cross annual fundraising campaign and numerous other charities and organizations throughout our marketplace. We also build brand awareness by providing sponsorship support of established, high-profile events that benefit our customers’ active lifestyles, such as the “LA Marathon” in Los Angeles, California, and the “Duke City Marathon” in Albuquerque, New Mexico, for which we are the title sponsor.
Vendor Relationships
 We have developed strong vendor relationships over the past 68 years. We currently purchase merchandise from nearly 700 vendors. In fiscal 2022, no vendor represented greater than 5% of total purchases in fiscal 2022. Early in fiscal 2021, we were informed of an expansion of Nike’s direct-to-consumer initiatives that impacted certain multi-branded retailers, including us, and which led to a significant reduction in our supply chain relative to this vendor. While Nike no longer represents a significant percentage of our merchandise purchases, this transition did not impact our ability to continue to purchase certain Nike branded products from authorized licensees. We believe current relationships with our vendors are good. We benefit from the long-term working relationships with vendors that our senior management and our buyers have carefully nurtured throughout our history.
Information Technology Systems
 We have fully integrated information technology (“IT”) systems that support critical business functions, such as sales reporting, inventory management and distribution functions and provide pertinent information for financial reporting, as well as robust business intelligence and retail analytics tools. We manage IT solutions for e-commerce, email and networks that connect our employees to appropriate technology solutions and tools. This includes connecting our stores via a managed wide area network connection for purchasing card (i.e., credit and debit card) encryption, tokenization, authorization and processing, as well as providing access to valuable tools such as collaboration, online training, workforce management, online hiring, Company website functions and corporate communications. Our cloud-based disaster recovery solution provides redundancy and availability-redundant networks and applications to be used in the event of an emergency or unplanned outage. We believe our IT systems are effectively supporting our current operations and provide a foundation for future growth and new business initiatives.

The protection of our customer, employee and business data is critical to us. Our business, like that of most retailers, involves the receipt, storage and transmission of customers’ personal information, consumer preferences and payment card information, as well as confidential information about our employees, our suppliers and our Company. We rely on commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmission and storage of all such data, including confidential information. Despite the security measures we have in place, our facilities and systems, and those of our third-party service providers, may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, data theft, misplaced or lost data, programming or human errors, or other similar events. Unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to our systems or information through fraud or other means, including deceiving our employees or third-party service providers. The methods used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems are also constantly changing and evolving, and may be difficult to anticipate or detect for long periods of time. We have implemented and regularly review and update our control systems, processes and procedures to protect against unauthorized access to or use of secured data and to prevent data loss.
 Distribution
 We operate a distribution center located in Riverside, California, that services all of our stores. The facility has 953,000 square feet of storage and office space, along with an additional 172,000 square-foot distribution space adjacent to our distribution center that enables us to more efficiently fulfill our expanding distribution requirements. The distribution center warehouse management system is fully integrated with our enterprise-level IT systems and provides comprehensive warehousing and distribution capabilities. We regularly distribute merchandise from our distribution center to our stores using our fleet of leased tractors, as well as contract carriers.
Industry and Competition
 The retail market for sporting goods is highly competitive. In general, competition tends to fall into the following six basic categories:
 Sporting Goods Superstores. Stores in this category typically are larger than 35,000 square feet and tend to be free-standing locations. These stores emphasize high volume sales and a large number of stock-keeping units. Examples include Academy Sports & Outdoors and Dick’s Sporting Goods.
 Traditional Sporting Goods Stores. This category consists of traditional sporting goods chains, including us. These stores range in size from 5,000 to 20,000 square feet and are frequently located in regional malls and multi-store shopping centers. The traditional chains typically carry a varied assortment of merchandise and attempt to position themselves as convenient neighborhood stores. Sporting goods retailers operating stores within this category include Hibbett.
 Specialty Sporting Goods Stores. Specialty sporting goods retailers are stores that typically carry a wide assortment of one specific product category or brand, such as athletic shoes, golf, or outdoor equipment. Examples of these retailers include Bass Pro Shops, Cabela’s, Foot Locker, Sportsman’s Warehouse and REI. This category also includes pro shops that often are single-store operations.
 Mass Merchandisers. This category includes discount retailers such as Walmart and Target and department stores such as JC Penney and Kohl’s. These stores range in size from 50,000 to 200,000 square feet and are primarily located in regional malls, shopping centers or on free-standing sites. Sporting goods merchandise and apparel represent a small portion of the total merchandise in these stores and the selection is often more limited than in other sporting goods retailers.
 E-commerce Retailers. This category consists of many retailers that sell a broad array of new and used sporting goods products via e-commerce, including Amazon.com. The types of retailers mentioned above may also sell their products through e-commerce. E-commerce has been a rapidly growing sales channel, particularly with younger consumers, and an increasing source of competition in the sporting goods retail industry.
 Athletic and Sporting Goods Brands. This category consists of athletic and sporting goods brands that engage in direct-to-consumer sales through traditional retail channels, e-commerce or a combination of both. These brands may also sell their products to us and other competitors. Examples of brands that sell directly to consumers include Nike, adidas and Under Armour.
 In competing with the retailers discussed above, we focus on what we believe are the primary factors of competition in the sporting goods retail industry, including breadth, depth, price and quality of merchandise offered; advertising; purchasing and pricing policies; experienced and knowledgeable personnel; customer service; effective sales techniques; direct involvement of senior officers in monitoring store operations; enterprise-level IT systems; and convenience of store location and format.

Human Capital
 We believe the experience and tenure of our professional staff in the retail industry contributes to enhanced performance and gives us a competitive advantage. The table below indicates the tenure of our professional staff in some of our key functional areas as of January 1, 2023:

 | Number ofEmployees | | AverageNumber ofYears With Us
Executive Management | | 7 | | 36
Vice Presidents | | 25 | | 22
Buyers | | 19 | | 16
Store District / Regional Supervisors | | 51 | | 25
Store Managers | | 429 | | 12

 As of January 1, 2023, we had approximately 8,700 active employees, of which approximately 2,500 were full-time. The General Teamsters, Airline, Aerospace and Allied Employees, Warehousemen, Drivers, Construction, Rock and Sand; Airline Employees, Local Union No. 986, affiliated with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (“Local 986”) represents approximately 440 hourly employees in our distribution center and select stores. In December 2022, we negotiated a five-year contract with Local 986 for the covered distribution center employees, and we are currently negotiating a five-year contract with Local 986 for the covered store employees. Both contracts were retroactive to September 1, 2022, and expire on August 31, 2027. We have not had a strike or work stoppage in over 40 years, although such a disruption could have a significant negative impact on our business operations and financial results. We believe we provide working conditions and wages that are comparable to those offered by other retailers in the sporting goods industry and that employee relations are good.
 We utilize an automated Learning Management System (“LMS”) and have developed comprehensive training that can be expressly tailored for store and corporate positions. Our LMS allows us to rapidly convey and track the dissemination of important information as it develops, such as product merchandising strategies, policy changes, safety rules, cash handling procedures, systems resolution and utilization, loss prevention updates and inventory control guidelines. All new store employees are assigned introductory LMS learning material as well as provided with a live orientation highlighting basic policies and responsibilities and our expectation that each employee strives to deliver excellence in customer service, product knowledge and salesmanship. New full-time store salespeople, cashiers and manager trainees receive supplementary training and evaluations specific to their job responsibilities and their ongoing development. The versatility of the LMS provides us with the ability to track and monitor many different types of training and the flexibility we need to deliver our message to widely dispersed personnel within the structure of our on-the-go work environment. Our employee training programs include self-directed online courses, live webinars, production of soft and hard copy reference materials, one-on-one training, hands-on training and progressive developmental training. In the stores, manager trainees are expected to complete a progressive series of outlines and evaluations in order to be considered for each successive level of advancement. Experienced store management training includes advanced merchandising, delegation, personnel management, scheduling, payroll control, harassment and discrimination prevention and loss prevention. On a yearly basis, we require all employees to complete workplace anti-discrimination and harassment training in order to foster a heightened awareness and help eliminate biases that may adversely impact the corporate, distribution center and store spaces. Our overall training strategy and LMS enable us to efficiently manage, monitor, assign and report employee training results online and in real time.
 During the COVID-19 pandemic, to provide for the safety of our employees and customers, we have taken many actions in our stores, corporate office and distribution center spaces based on the needs, risks, and regulations present in each community and facility. Measures we have taken include cleaning facilities professionally on a regular basis, equipping facilities with hand sanitizer stations and signage illustrating how to socially distance, requiring face coverings, limiting the number of people admitted to a facility at one time, installing protective shields at cash registers and other countertops and providing free masks and hand sanitizer. We continue to monitor the rapidly evolving situation and expect to continue to adapt our operations to address federal, state, and local requirements, as well as to implement standards or processes that we determine to be in the best interest of our employees and customers.
 Description of Service Marks and Trademarks
 We use the “Big 5” and “Big 5 Sporting Goods” names as service marks in connection with our business operations and have registered these names as federal service marks. The renewal dates for these service mark registrations are in 2025 and 2023, respectively. We have also registered the names Golden Bear, Harsh, Pacifica and Rugged Exposure as federal trademarks under which we sell a variety of merchandise. The renewal dates for these trademark registrations range from 2026 to 2028. We intend to renew these service mark and trademark registrations if we are still using the marks in commerce and they continue to provide value to us at the time of renewal.
