ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 Andrea Electronics Corporation (“Andrea,” “us,” “we,” “our”) designs, develops and manufactures state-of-the-art digital microphone products and noise reduction software that facilitate natural language, human/machine interfaces. Our technologies eliminate unwanted background noise to enable the optimum performance of various speech-based and audio applications. We are incorporated under the laws of the State of New York and have been engaged in the electronic communications industry since 1934.
 Andrea’s products and technologies optimize the performance of speech-based applications and audio applications primarily in the following markets:
 
● | Speech recognition applications;
--+---------------------------------
● | Communications; and 
● | Audio and video recording. 

 Andrea Digital Signal Processing (“DSP”) Microphone and Audio Software Business – Our patented and patent-pending digital noise canceling technologies enable a speaker to be at a distance from the microphone (we refer to this capability as “far-field” microphone use) and free the speaker from having to use a close talking microphone. Our Digital Super Directional Array (“DSDA”) and PureAudio microphone products convert sound received by an array of microphones into digital signals that are then processed to cancel background noise from the signal to be transmitted. These two adaptive technologies represent the core technologies within our portfolio of far-field technologies. In addition to DSDA and PureAudio, Andrea has developed and commercialized several other digital, far-field noise canceling technologies, including, among others, Andrea EchoStop, a high-quality acoustic echo canceller which enables speaker phone functionality with technology for canceling speaker feedback.
 All of our digital, far-field microphone technologies are software-based and operate using either a dedicated DSP or a general purpose processor (for example, the Intel Pentium). The software, which may encompass one or all of our far-field noise canceling technologies, can be applied to improve the performance of a single microphone or multiple microphones. In addition, our digital, far-field, noise canceling technologies can be tailored to be used individually or combined depending on particular customer requirements.
 We are currently marketing our far-field technologies at Original Equipment Manufacturers (“OEMs”) that have new sophisticated voice applications that require new digital microphone performance. Our far-field, digital noise canceling technologies and related products comprise our Andrea DSP Microphone and Audio Software line of business. Net revenues from such technologies and products during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were approximately 100% and 14%, respectively, of our total revenues. We dedicate a significant amount of our marketing and research and development resources to this business segment, as we believe that voice interface products will increasingly require high performance, untethered (hands-free and headset-free) microphone technology.
 Patent Monetization, Intellectual Property and Licensing – Our products and technologies are developed in part using our proprietary intellectual property, and we believe that the strength of our intellectual property rights will be important to the success of our business. We utilize patent and trade secret protection, confidentiality agreements with customers and partners, disclosure and invention assignment agreements with employees and consultants and other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary information. We plan to license specific, custom designs to our customers, charging royalties at a fixed amount per product or a percentage of sales. More generally, we intend to vigorously defend and monetize our intellectual property through licensing arrangements and, where necessary, enforcement actions against those entities using our patented solutions in their products. Royalties resulting from these patent monetization efforts can be structured in a variety of ways, including but not limited to one-time paid up licenses or on-going royalty arrangements. We expect to generate a portion of our revenues with these types of licensing arrangements. As part of our plan to aggressively pursue patent monetization, we entered into a Revenue Sharing and Note Purchase Agreement with AND34 Funding LLC (“AND34”), and on December 24, 2014, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Revenue Sharing and Note Purchase Agreement (the “Revenue Sharing Agreement”) with AND34, which was retroactively effective as of February 14, 2014. Under the Revenue Sharing Agreement, the Company granted AND34 a perpetual predetermined share in the rights of the Company’s specified future revenues from currently owned patents. Under the terms of the Revenue Sharing Agreement with AND34, Andrea issued and sold to AND34 Notes of $10,800,000 which were repaid as of December 31, 2016. On August 10, 2016, Andrea and AND34 executed a Rider to the Revenue Sharing Agreement (“Rider”) pursuant to which the parties agreed that Andrea would issue and sell to AND34 additional Notes up to an aggregate amount of $7,000,000. The Rider was subsequently amended to issue $500,000 of additional Notes, collectively an aggregate amount of $7,500,000 (the “Additional Notes”), or such greater amount as AND34 may agree to in its sole discretion, during the four-year period beginning on the date of execution of the Rider. The Additional Notes have a maturity date of August 31, 2020. The proceeds of the Additional Notes will be used to pay patent monetization expenses. As of December 31, 2018, there was $1,484,422 in Additional Notes outstanding. Total revenues from this segment during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was approximately 0% and 86%, respectively, of our total revenues.

 Industry Background
 Our primary mission is to provide the emerging “voice interface” markets with state-of-the-art digital microphone solutions. The idea underlying these markets is that natural language spoken by the human voice will become an important means by which to communicate and control many types of computing devices and other appliances and equipment that contain microprocessors. We are designing and marketing our products and technologies so they can be used for “natural language, human/machine” interfaces including:

● | Siri® 
--+-------------------
● | Amazon Alexa™ 
● | Google Now™ 
● | Microsoft Cortana™
● | IBM Watson® 

 End users of these applications and interfaces will require high quality microphone and speakerphone products that enhance voice transmission, particularly in noisy office and mobile environments. We also believe that these applications will increasingly require microphones that are located at a distance from the person speaking, or far-field microphone technology. We believe that there will be significant growth in this marketplace during the next several years.

Our Technologies
 We design our Andrea DSP Microphone and Audio Software to transmit voice signals with the high level of quality, intelligibility and reliability required by the broad range of voice-based applications in computing and telecommunications. We achieve this through the use of several audio technologies that employ software processes that are proprietary to us. Software processes of this type are commonly referred to as algorithms.
Andrea DSP Microphone and Audio Software Technology
 This set of technologies is generally based on the use of an array of microphones from which the analog signals are converted to digital form and then processed using digital electronic circuitry and software to eliminate unwanted noise in the speaker’s environment. Our Andrea DSP Microphone and Audio Software Products provide clear acoustic and audio input performance where the desired audio signal is at a distance from the microphone. Our technology is portable and can be embedded into new platforms such as micro DSP’s, mobile OS and wireless chipsets. We believe that our Andrea DSP Microphone and Audio Software technology achieve far-field microphone performance previously unattainable through microphones based on mechanical acoustic designs and microphones based on analog signal processing.
 Our Andrea DSP Microphone and Audio Software Products include the use of the following technologies, among other technologies and techniques:
 Digital Super Directional Array (“DSDA”®). Andrea’s patented DSDA adaptive beam forming system enables more intelligible audio by forming a beam toward the speaker and eliminating background noises that are outside of the beam. DSDA microphone technology enables high quality far-field communications by centering microphone sensitivity on a user’s voice and canceling noise outside of that signal. DSDA continuously samples the ever changing acoustic parameters within an environment and adaptively identifies interfering noises that are extraneous to the voice signal, resulting in increased intelligibility of the array microphone’s output.
 PureAudio®. Andrea’s patented PureAudio and award winning noise reduction speech enhancement algorithm significantly improves intelligibility of voice audio and accuracy in speech driven applications used in noisy environments. PureAudio is a noise canceling algorithm that enhances speech by sampling the ambient noise in an environment and attenuating the noise from sources near or around the desired speech signals, thus delivering a clear audio signal. Designed specifically to improve the signal-to-noise ratio, PureAudio is effective in canceling stationary noises such as computer and ventilation fans, tires and engines.
 EchoStop®. Andrea’s patented full duplex acoustic echo cancellation algorithm enables both loudspeakers to broadcast and microphones to transmit simultaneously providing a high quality speakerphone function. EchoStop is an advanced acoustic echo canceller (stereo version available) developed for use with conferencing systems such as group audio and videoconferencing systems and cellular car phone kits. EchoStop allows true two-way communication (often referred to as full duplex) over a conferencing system, even when the system is used in large spatial environments that may be vulnerable to extensive reverberation. EchoStop incorporates noise reduction to reduce the background noise of both the microphone input and the loudspeaker output, thus preventing the accumulation of interfering noise over conferencing systems that facilitate communication among multiple sites.
 Direction Finding and Tracking Array (“DFTA”®). Andrea’s patented DFTA technology utilizes an array of microphones and a unique algorithm to detect the presence of a user’s voice, determine the direction of the voice and follow and track it when it moves. In a videoconferencing setting, this unique technology can provide direction to a videoconferencing camera and allow the system to steer and concentrate on the speaker, thus providing a “video-follow-audio” capability.
 Our Products and their Markets and Applications
 Our Andrea DSP Microphone and Audio Software Products have been designed for applications that are controlled by or depend on speech across a broad range of hardware and software platforms. These products incorporate our DSP microphone technologies and are designed to cancel background noise in a range of noisy environments, such as homes, offices, factories and automobiles. We also manufacture a line of accessories for these products. For commercial markets, we have designed our Andrea DSP Microphone and Audio Software Products for the following applications:
 
● | Mass transit and automotive communication systems;
--+---------------------------------------------------
● | Automated teller machines; 
● | Information kiosks; 
● | Home automation;

● | Internet of Things (“IoT”) digital assistants;
--+-----------------------------------------------
● | TV set top box; 
● | Audio and Video recording; 
● | Robotics; and 
● | Video surveillance. 

Andrea DSP Microphone and Audio Noise Reduction Software Products
 We develop our Andrea DSP Microphone and Audio Noise Reduction Software Products primarily through customer-specific integration efforts, and we either license our related algorithms, sell a product incorporating our related algorithms, or both. In addition, we have developed stand-alone products for specific customers who then sell such products to end users. As a result, such products are not available from us directly. However, as part of our strategy to increase sales to prospective customers desiring high-quality microphone performance for certain customer-specific environments, we have developed the following products that may be purchased directly from Andrea:
 DA-350 Auto Array Microphone (“DA-350”). The DA-350 is a linear four element array microphone with Digital Signal Processing (“DSP”) circuitry contained within a single microphone housing. The product also has integrated adaptive beam forming and noise reduction digital filtering software. A model with Acoustic Echo Cancellation is also available. The DA-350 is ideal for achieving superior far-field voice intelligibility and accuracy of Automatic Speech Recognition (“ASR”) in high noise environments.
 DA-250 OEM Array Microphone (“DA-250”). The DA-250 is a small compact Stereo Array Microphone and DSP circuit board platform that can easily be integrated into many different OEM devices that would greatly benefit from directional noise canceling microphone performance, but in the past has been unattainable with an embedded microphone configuration. Requiring only two tiny holes in the faceplate of a device, the DA-250 Stereo Array Microphone can deliver directional microphone sensitivity without the need for acoustic baffling, as found in large parabolic waveguides or long shotgun tube type microphones.
 USB-SA Array Microphone. The USB-SA Array Microphone provides a USB digital audio adapter to bypass a computer’s standard integrated sound system, providing a high fidelity/low noise digital audio platform that is isolated from the computer’s motherboard. This external digital audio system utilizes the computer’s central processor to run Andrea’s AudioCommander™ adaptive beam forming directional microphone and noise reduction software.
 PureAudio™ VST3 Plug-in (“PureAudio”). A Noise Reduction & Center Channel Focus VST3 Plug-in for Audio/Video Editing Post-Processing. PureAudio’s Adaptive Digital Noise Reduction Filter reduces up to -40dB of repetitive noises, while supporting wide frequency bandwidth sample rates of up to 48Khz. The variable control allows the user to select the level of noise cancellation for the desired amount to be applied to the embedded noisy segment. Center Channel Focus is a new feature for the broadcast industry. This is an adaptive audio algorithm that cancels the stereo ambient sound mixed into the broadcast main audio stream. This feature focuses and highlights the center channel voice audio for better intelligibility and listening to the speech content of the recording. The software functions are perfect for editing mobile journalism interviews that take place in real world noisy environments.
 Andrea AudioCommander™. Andrea’s PC Audio Control Panel, AudioCommander, includes a speaker volume adjustment with received PureAudio noise reduction control and a 10-band graphic equalizer with 18 built-in presets to customize sound for a user’s listening preference.

Our Collaborative Arrangements
 An important element of our strategy is to promote widespread adoption of our products and technologies by collaborating with large enterprises and market and technology leaders in security systems and services, industrial system integrators, voice activated services, communications, computer manufacturing, and software publishing. In addition to the arrangements we are involved in, we are currently discussing additional arrangements with other companies, but we cannot assure you that any of these discussions will result in any definitive agreements.
Patents, Trademarks, and Other Intellectual Property Rights
 Our products and technologies are developed in part using our proprietary intellectual property, and we believe that the strength of our intellectual property rights will be important to the success of our business. We utilize patent and trade secret protection, confidentiality agreements with customers and partners, disclosure and invention assignment agreements with employees and consultants and other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary information. We plan to license specific, custom designs to our customers, charging royalties at a fixed amount per product or a percentage of sales. More generally, we intend to vigorously defend and monetize our intellectual property through licensing arrangements and, where necessary, enforcement actions against those entities using our patented solutions in their products. Royalties resulting from these patent monetization efforts can be structured in a variety of ways, including but not limited to one-time paid up licenses or on-going royalty arrangements. We expect to generate a portion of our revenues with these types of licensing arrangements.
 Andrea maintains a number of patents in the United States covering claims to certain of its products and technology, which expire at various dates ranging from 2019 to 2033. We also have other patent applications currently pending; however, we cannot assure you that patents will be issued with respect to these currently pending or future applications which we may file, nor can we assure you that the strength or scope of our existing patents, or any new patents, will be of sufficient scope or strength or provide meaningful protection or commercial advantage to us.
 Research and Development
 We consider our technology to be of substantial importance to our competitiveness. To maintain this competitiveness, we have organized our research and development efforts using a “market and applications” approach for meeting the requirements of new and existing customers. Consistent with this approach, our engineering staff interacts closely with our sales and marketing personnel and directly with customers. The engineering staff is responsible for the research and development of new products and the improvement and support of existing products. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, total research and development expenses were $601,349 and $813,051, respectively. For fiscal 2019, we currently expect research and development expenses to remain at approximately the same level when compared to 2018. However, no assurance can be given that our research and development efforts will succeed. See Part II “Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Form 10-K.
Sales and Marketing
 We employ a sales staff as well as outside sales representatives and sales organizations to market our Andrea DSP Microphone and Audio Software Products. Andrea DSP Microphone and Audio Software Products are marketed to computer OEMs, distributors of personal computers and communications equipment, software publishers, and industrial system integrators. Under our existing collaborative agreements, our collaborators have various marketing and sales rights to our Andrea DSP Microphone and Audio Software. We are seeking to enter into additional collaborative arrangements for the marketing and sale of our Andrea DSP Microphone and Audio Software Products, but we cannot assure you that we will be successful in these efforts. Market acceptance of the Andrea DSP Microphone and Audio Software Products and achievement of patent monetization is critical to our success.
Production Operations
 In 2018 and 2017, all of our assembly operations were performed with subcontractors in Asia or in the United States. Most of the components for the Andrea DSP Microphone and Audio Software Products are available from several sources and are not characteristically in short supply. However, certain specialized components, such as microphones and DSP boards, are available from a limited number of suppliers and subject to long lead times. To date, we have been able to obtain sufficient supplies of these more specialized components, but we cannot assure you that we will continue to be able to do so. Shortages of, or interruptions in, the supply of these more specialized components could have a material adverse effect on our sales of Andrea DSP Microphone Products.

Competition
 The markets for our Andrea DSP Microphone and Audio Software Products are highly competitive. Competition in these markets is based on varying combinations of product features, quality and reliability of performance, price, sales, marketing and technical support, ease of use, compatibility with evolving industry standards and other systems and equipment, name recognition, and development of new products and enhancements. Most of our current and potential competitors in these markets have significantly greater financial, marketing, technical, and other resources than us. Consequently, these competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, or to devote greater resources to the development, marketing, and sale of their products than we can.
 We believe that our ability to compete successfully will depend upon our ability to develop and maintain advanced technology, develop proprietary products, attract and retain qualified personnel, obtain patent or other proprietary protection for our products and technologies and manufacture, assemble and market products, either alone or through third parties, in a profitable manner.
 Employees
 At December 31, 2018, we had eight employees, of whom one was engaged in production and related operations, three were engaged in research and development, and five were engaged in management, administration, sales and customer support duties. None of our employees are unionized or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that we generally enjoy good relations with our employees. In addition to our regular employees, we utilize eleven independent consultants (three are sales representatives, two are engaged for administration purposes and six are engaged in research and development activities).
