  We began our operations in Beaumont and surrounding counties and expanded into the Houston market. Our loan portfolio at December 31, 2018 was 73.9% in the Houston market and 26.1% in the Beaumont market. In November 2018, we opened a branch and deposit production office in Dallas, which became a full branch in January 2019. We believe that there are significant ongoing growth opportunities for us in our markets.

 We are primarily a business bank and focus on providing commercial banking solutions to small and mid‑sized businesses and professionals including attorneys, accountants and other professional service providers with operations in our markets. We offer a broad range of banking products, including commercial and industrial loans, commercial real estate loans, construction and development loans, 1‑4 family residential mortgage loans, multi-family residential loans consumer loans, agricultural loans, treasury services, traditional retail deposits and a full suite of online banking services.  At December 31, 2018, 83.7% of our loans were commercial loans. We have a relationship-based approach and at December 31, 2018, 81.0% of our loan customers had a deposit relationship with us.
 The banking and financial services industry is highly competitive and we compete with a wide range of financial institutions within our markets, including local, regional and national commercial banks and credit unions. We also compete with mortgage companies, brokerage firms, consumer finance companies, mutual funds, securities firms, insurance companies, third‑party payment processors, financial technology, or fintech companies and other financial intermediaries for certain of our products and services. Some of our competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions and level of regulatory supervision applicable to us. 
 Interest rates on loans and deposits, as well as prices on fee‑based services, are typically significant competitive factors within the banking and financial services industry. Many of our competitors are much larger financial institutions that have greater financial resources than we do and compete aggressively for market share. These competitors attempt to gain market share through their financial product mix, pricing strategies and banking center locations. Other important competitive factors in our industry and markets include office locations and hours, quality of customer service, community reputation, continuity of personnel and services, capacity and willingness to extend credit and ability to offer sophisticated banking products and services. 
 We seek to remain competitive with respect to fees charged, interest rates and pricing and we believe that our broad and sophisticated suite of financial solutions, our high‑quality customer service culture, our positive reputation and our long‑standing community relationships will enable us to compete successfully within our markets and enhance our ability to attract and retain customers.
 Our Strategy
 Organic Growth. We aim to continuously enhance our customer base, increase loans and deposits and expand our overall market share. Through our relationship‑driven, community banking strategy, a significant portion of our organic growth has been through referral business from our existing customers and professionals in our markets including attorneys, accountants and other professional service providers. By understanding our customers’ businesses, appropriately structuring our loans and applying a solution‑minded approach and attitude to our customers’ needs, we believe that we will continue to attract customers who value our approach of being their financial partners. Our team of seasoned bankers has been and will continue to be, an important driver of our organic growth by further developing banking relationships with existing and potential customers. 
 Maintain Strong Credit Culture. We intend to continue to employ prudent underwriting and proactive credit administration to manage risk in our loan portfolio. In the past, these practices have resulted in low amounts of nonperforming and impaired loans and low charge-offs in relation to the size of our loan portfolio. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Financial Condition—Credit Policies and Risk Management” for further discussion.
  Diversified Loan Portfolio. We intend to maintain or increase the diversity in our loan portfolio as a means of managing risk associated with fluctuations in economic conditions. Our focus on lending to small to medium‑sized businesses and professionals in our market areas has resulted in a diverse loan portfolio comprised primarily of core relationships. We carefully monitor exposure to certain asset classes to minimize the impact of a downturn in the value of such assets. 
 Strategic Acquisitions. We intend to continue to supplement our organic growth through strategic acquisitions. We expect our markets will afford us opportunities to identify and execute acquisitions designed to strengthen our franchise, increase shareholder value and contribute meaningful strategic enhancements, including talented bankers and complementary branch footprints.

 Increased Operational Efficiency. We intend to continue to focus on improving our operational efficiency. We have upgraded our operating capabilities and created a platform for continued efficiencies in the areas of risk management, technology, data processing, regulatory compliance and human resources, which we believe is capable of handling our continued growth. Our efficiency ratio has improved from 64.2% for the year ended December 31, 2014, to 59.0% for the year ended December 31, 2018.

Supervision and Regulation 
 The U.S. banking industry is highly regulated under federal and state law. Consequently, our growth and earnings performance will be affected not only by management decisions and general and local economic conditions, but also by the statutes administered by, and the regulations and policies of, various governmental regulatory authorities. These authorities include the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, or Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, or OCC, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB, Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, and state taxing authorities. The effect of these statutes, regulations and policies, and any changes to such statutes, regulations and policies, can be significant and cannot be predicted.
 The primary goals of the bank regulatory scheme are to maintain a safe and sound banking system, facilitate the conduct of sound monetary policy and promote fairness and transparency for financial products and services. The system of supervision and regulation applicable to us and our subsidiaries establishes a comprehensive framework for their respective operations and is intended primarily for the protection of the FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund, the Bank’s depositors and the public, rather than our shareholders or creditors. The description below summarizes certain elements of the applicable bank regulatory framework. This description is not intended to describe all laws and regulations applicable to us and our subsidiaries, and the description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes, regulations, policies, interpretive letters and other written guidance that are described herein.
 Financial Services Industry Reform. On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or Dodd‑Frank Act, was enacted.  The Dodd-Frank Act has had a broad impact on the financial services industry, including significant regulatory and compliance changes such as, among many other things, (i) enhanced resolution authority of troubled and failing banks and their holding companies; (ii) increased regulatory examination fees; (iii) creation of the CFPB, an independent organization dedicated to promulgating and enforcing consumer protection laws applicable to all entities offering consumer financial products or services; and (iv) numerous other provisions designed to improve supervision and oversight of, and strengthen safety and soundness for, the financial services sector.  Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act established a new framework for systemic risk oversight within the financial system to be distributed among new and existing federal regulatory agencies, including the Financial Stability Oversight Council, the Federal Reserve, the OCC and the FDIC.
 On May 24, 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, or the Regulatory Relief Act, was enacted. The Regulatory Relief Act repealed or modified several provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and included a number of burden reduction measures for community banks, including, among other things, directing the federal banking regulators to develop a community bank leverage ratio for banks that have less than $10.0 billion in total assets and have certain risk profiles, exempting community banks with less than $10.0 billion in total assets from the Volcker Rule (discussed below), narrowing and simplifying the definition of high volatility commercial real estate, and requiring the federal banking regulators to raise the asset threshold under the Small Bank Holding Company and Savings and Loan Holding Company Policy Statement from $1.0 billion to $3.0 billion. 
 The Regulatory Relief Act also expands the eligibility for certain small banks to undergo 18-month examination cycles, rather than annual cycles, raising the consolidated asset threshold from $1.0 billion to $3.0 billion for eligible

banks.  In addition, the Regulatory Relief Act added certain protections for consumers, including veterans and active duty military personnel and student borrowers, expanded credit freezes and created an identity theft protection database. The Regulatory Relief Act requires the enactment of a number of implementing regulations, the details of which may have a material effect on the ultimate impact of the law. 
 Regulatory Capital Rules. The Company and the Bank are each required to comply with applicable capital adequacy standards established by the Federal Reserve and the OCC. The current risk-based capital standards applicable to the Company and the Bank are based on the December 2010 final capital framework for strengthening international capital standards, known as Basel III, of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, or Basel Committee. In July 2013, the federal bank regulators approved final rules, the Basel III Capital Rules, implementing the Basel III framework as well as certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Basel III Capital Rules became effective for the Company and the Bank on January 1, 2015 (subject to a phase-in period for certain provisions). The Basel III Capital Rules require banks and bank holding companies, including the Company and the Bank, to maintain four minimum capital standards: (1) a Tier 1 capital‑to‑adjusted total assets ratio, or leverage capital ratio, of at least 4.0%; (2) a Tier 1 capital to risk‑weighted assets ratio, or Tier 1 risk‑based capital ratio, of at least 6.0%; (3) a total risk‑based capital (Tier 1 plus Tier 2) to risk‑weighted assets ratio, or total risk‑based capital ratio, of at least 8.0%; and (4) a Common Equity Tier 1, or CET1, capital ratio of at least 4.5%. 
 The Basel III Capital Rules also call for bank holding companies and banks to maintain a “capital conservation buffer” on top of the minimum risk‑based capital requirements. The buffer must be composed of common equity Tier 1 capital. This buffer is intended to help to ensure that banking organizations conserve capital when it is most needed, allowing them to better weather periods of economic stress. The buffer, which became fully phased in on January 1, 2019, is 2.5% of risk‑weighted assets.
 The Basel III Capital Rules also attempt to improve the quality of capital by implementing changes to the definition of capital. Among the most important changes are stricter eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments that would disallow the inclusion of certain instruments, such as trust preferred securities (other than grandfathered trust preferred securities), in Tier 1 capital going forward and new constraints on the inclusion of minority interests, mortgage‑servicing assets, deferred tax assets and certain investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions. In addition, the Basel III Capital Rules require that most regulatory capital deductions be made from CET1 capital.
 The Federal Reserve and the OCC may also set higher capital requirements for individual institutions whose circumstances warrant it. For example, institutions experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions are expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels, without significant reliance on intangible assets. At this time, the bank regulatory agencies are more inclined to impose higher capital requirements to meet well capitalized standards and future regulatory change could impose higher capital standards as a routine matter. The Company’s regulatory capital ratios and those of the Bank are in excess of the levels established for “well capitalized” institutions under the rules.
 These rules also set forth certain changes in the methods of calculating certain risk‑weighted assets, which in turn will affect the calculation of risk‑based ratios. Under the Basel III Capital Rules, higher or more sensitive risk weights have been assigned to various categories of assets, including certain credit facilities that finance the acquisition, development or construction of real property, certain exposures or credits that are 90 days past due or on nonaccrual status, foreign exposures and certain corporate exposures. In addition, these rules include greater recognition of collateral and guarantees, and revised capital treatment for derivatives and repo‑style transactions.
 In September 2017, the federal bank regulators proposed to revise and simplify the capital treatment for certain deferred tax assets, mortgage servicing assets, investments in non-consolidated financial entities and minority interests for banking organizations, such as the Company and the Bank, that are not subject to the advanced approaches requirements. In November 2017, the federal banking regulators revised the Basel III Capital Rules to extend the transitional treatment of these items for non-advanced approaches banking organizations until the September 2017 proposal is finalized. The September 2017 proposal would also change the capital treatment of certain commercial real estate loans under the standardized approach, which we use to calculate our capital ratios.
 In December 2017, the Basel Committee published standards that it described as the finalization of the Basel III post-crisis regulatory reforms (commonly referred to as Basel IV). Among other things, these standards revise the Basel

Committee’s standardized approach for credit risk (including by recalibrating risk weights and introducing new capital requirements for certain “unconditionally cancellable commitments,” such as unused credit card lines of credit) and provides a new standardized approach for operational risk capital. Under the Basel framework, these standards will generally be effective on January 1, 2022, with an aggregate output floor phasing in through January 1, 2027. Under the current U.S. capital rules, operational risk capital requirements and a capital floor apply only to advanced approaches institutions, and not to the Company or the Bank. The impact of Basel IV on us will depend on the manner in which it is implemented by the federal bank regulators.
 Pursuant to the Regulatory Relief Act, the Federal Reserve, the OCC and the FDIC issued proposed rules implementing the community bank leverage ratio in November 2018. Under the proposed rules, a depository institution would be eligible to elect the community bank leverage ratio framework if it has less than $10.0 billion in total consolidated assets, meets certain risk-based qualifying criteria, and has a community bank leverage ratio greater than 9 percent.  Under the proposed rules, a qualifying community banking organization that has elected to utilize the community bank leverage ratio would not be required to calculate the existing risk-based and leverage capital requirements otherwise required.  Such a community banking organization would be considered to have met the capital ratio requirements to be “well capitalized” for the purpose of its primary federal regulator’s prompt corrective action rules, discussed below, provided it has a community bank leverage ratio greater than 9 percent.
 Imposition of Liability for Undercapitalized Subsidiaries. Bank regulators are required to take prompt corrective action to resolve problems associated with insured depository institutions whose capital declines below certain levels as further described below. In the event an institution becomes undercapitalized, it must submit a capital restoration plan. The capital restoration plan will not be accepted by the regulators unless each company having control of the undercapitalized institution guarantees the subsidiary’s compliance with the capital restoration plan up to a certain specified amount. Any such guarantee from a depository institution’s holding company is entitled to a priority of payment in bankruptcy.
 The aggregate liability of the holding company of an undercapitalized bank is limited to the lesser of 5.0% of the institution’s assets at the time it became undercapitalized and the amount necessary to cause the institution to become adequately capitalized. The bank regulators have greater power in situations where an institution becomes significantly or critically undercapitalized or fails to submit a capital restoration plan. For example, a bank holding company controlling such an institution can be required to obtain prior Federal Reserve approval of proposed dividends, or might be required to consent to a consolidation or to divest the troubled institution or other affiliates.
 Volcker Rule. As mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act, in December 2013, the OCC, Federal Reserve, FDIC, SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission issued a final rule implementing certain prohibitions and restrictions on the ability of a banking entity and non-bank financial company supervised by the Federal Reserve to engage in proprietary trading and have certain ownership interests in, or relationships with, a “covered fund” (commonly referred to as the “Volcker Rule”). As mentioned above, the Regulatory Relief Act included a provision exempting banking organizations with $10.0 billion or less in total consolidation assets, and total trading assets and trading liabilities that are 5% or less of total consolidated assets, from the Volcker Rule. Thus, the Company and the Bank are not currently subject to the Volcker Rule.
 CBTX, Inc.
 As a bank holding company, we are subject to regulation under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, or BHC Act, and to supervision, examination and enforcement by the Federal Reserve. The BHC Act and other federal laws subject bank holding companies to particular restrictions on the types of activities in which they may engage, and to a range of supervisory requirements and activities, including regulatory enforcement actions for violations of laws and regulations. The Federal Reserve’s jurisdiction also extends to any company that we directly or indirectly control, such as any nonbank subsidiaries and other companies in which we own a controlling investment.
 Acquisitions by Bank Holding Companies. The BHC Act requires every bank holding company to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve before it acquires all or substantially all of the assets of any bank, or ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank or bank holding company if after such acquisition it would own or control, directly or indirectly, more than 5.0% of the voting shares of such bank or bank holding company. In approving bank holding company acquisitions by bank holding companies, the Federal Reserve is required to consider, among other things, the effect of the acquisition on competition, the financial condition, managerial resources and future prospects of the bank

holding company and the banks concerned, the convenience and needs of the communities to be serve, including the record of performance under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, or CRA, the effectiveness of the applicant in combating money laundering activities and the extent to which the proposed acquisition would result in greater or more concentrated risks to the stability of the U.S. banking or financial system. Our ability to make future acquisitions will depend on our ability to obtain approval for such acquisitions from the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve could deny our application based on the above criteria or other considerations. For example, we could be required to sell banking centers as a condition to receiving regulatory approval, which condition may not be acceptable to us or, if acceptable to us, may reduce the benefit of a proposed acquisition.
 Under the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act, or the Riegle-Neal Act, a bank holding company may acquire banks in states other than its home state, subject to any state requirement that the bank has been organized and operating for a minimum period of time, not to exceed five years, and to certain deposit market-share limitations. Bank holding companies must be well capitalized and well managed, not merely adequately capitalized and adequately managed, in order to acquire a bank located outside of the bank holding company’s home state.
 Control Acquisitions. Under the BHC Act, a company may not acquire “control” of a bank holding company or a bank without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve. The statute defines control as ownership or control of 25% or more of any class of voting securities, control of the election of a majority of the board of directors, or any other circumstances in which the Federal Reserve determines that a company directly or indirectly exercises a controlling influence over the management or policies of the bank holding company or bank. The Federal Reserve regulations include a presumption that control does not exist only when a company owns or controls 5% or less of the outstanding shares of any class of voting securities. Companies that propose to acquire between 5% and 25% of any class of voting securities usually consult with the Federal Reserve in advance and often must make written commitments not to exercise control. As a matter of policy, the Federal Reserve has in a number of cases required a company to take certain actions to avoid control if it proposes to acquire 25% or more but less than 33% of the total equity of a bank or bank holding company through the acquisition of both voting and non‑voting shares, even if the voting shares are less than 25% of a class. The Federal Reserve deems the acquisition of 33% or more of the total equity of a bank or bank holding company to represent control.
 The BHC Act does not apply to acquisitions by individuals or certain trusts, but if an individual, trust, or company proposes to acquire control of a bank or bank holding company, the Change in Bank Control Act, or CIBC Act, requires prior notice to the bank’s primary federal regulator or to the Federal Reserve in the case of a bank holding company. The CIBC Act uses the same definition of control as the BHC Act, but agency regulations under the CIBC Act presume in many cases that a change in control occurs when an individual, trust, or company acquires 10% or more of any class of voting securities. The notice is not required for a company required to file an application under the BHC Act for the same transaction.
 The requirements of the BHC Act and the CIBC Act could limit our access to capital and could limit parties who could acquire shares of our common stock.
 Regulatory Restrictions on Dividends; Source of Strength. We are regarded as a legal entity separate and distinct from CommunityBank of Texas, N.A. The principal source of our revenues is dividends received from the Bank. Federal law currently imposes limitations upon certain capital distributions by national banks, such as certain cash dividends, payments to repurchase or otherwise acquire its shares, payments to shareholders of another institution in a cash‑out merger and other distributions charged against capital. The Federal Reserve and OCC regulate all capital distributions by the Bank directly or indirectly to the Company, including dividend payments. The Federal Reserve regulates capital dividends paid by the Company. The Federal Reserve has issued a policy statement that provides that a bank holding company should not pay dividends unless (1) its net income over the last four quarters (net of dividends paid) has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends, (2) the prospective rate of earnings retention appears to be consistent with the capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition of the bank holding company and its subsidiaries and (3) the bank holding company will continue to meet minimum required capital adequacy ratios. Accordingly, we should not pay cash dividends that exceed our net income in any year or that can only be funded in ways that weaken our financial strength, including by borrowing money to pay dividends.
 Under Federal Reserve policy, bank holding companies have historically been required to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to each of their banking subsidiaries, and the Dodd‑Frank Act codified this policy as a statutory requirement. Under this requirement, we are expected to commit resources to support the Bank, including at times when we may not be in a financial position to provide such resources. Any capital loans by a bank holding company 

 
  8

 
to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary banks. As discussed above, a bank holding company, in certain circumstances, could be required to guarantee the capital restoration plan of an undercapitalized banking subsidiary. If the capital of the Bank were to become impaired, the Federal Reserve could assess us for the deficiency. If we failed to pay the assessment within three months, the Federal Reserve could order the sale of our stock in the Bank to cover the deficiency.
 In the event of a bank holding company’s bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the trustee will be deemed to have assumed and will be required to cure immediately any deficit under any commitment by the debtor holding company to any of the federal banking agencies to maintain the capital of an insured depository institution, and any claim for breach of such obligation will generally have priority over most other unsecured claims.
 Scope of Permissible Activities. Under the BHC Act, we may engage or acquire a company engaged solely in certain types of activities. Permissible activities include banking, managing or controlling banks or furnishing services to or performing services for the Bank, and certain activities found by the Federal Reserve to be so closely related to banking or managing and controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. These activities include, among others, operating a mortgage, finance, credit card or factoring company; performing certain data processing operations; providing investment and financial advice; acting as an insurance agent for certain types of credit‑related insurance; leasing personal property on a full‑payout, nonoperating basis; and providing certain stock brokerage and investment advisory services. The BHC Act also permits certain other specific activities. To engage in such activities, we would in many cases be required to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve. In its review of applications, the Federal Reserve considers, among other things, whether the acquisition or the additional activities can reasonably be expected to produce benefits to the public, such as greater convenience, increased competition, or gains in efficiency, that outweigh such possible adverse effects as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest or unsound banking practices.
 The Gramm‑Leach‑Bliley Act, also known as the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999, effective March 11, 2000, or the GLB Act, amended the BHC Act to expand the scope of activities available to a bank holding company. The amendments allow a qualifying bank holding company to elect “financial holding company” status. A financial holding company may affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in other activities that are “financial in nature.” Such activities include, among other things, securities underwriting, dealing and market making; sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies; insurance underwriting and agency; merchant banking activities; and activities that the Federal Reserve has determined to be closely related to banking. No regulatory approval is required for a financial holding company to acquire a company, other than a bank or savings association, engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature, as determined by the Federal Reserve. We qualify for financial holding company status, but we have not made such an election. We would make such an election in the future if we plan to engage in any lines of business that are impermissible for bank holding companies but permissible for financial holding companies.
 Safety and Soundness. Bank holding companies are not permitted to engage in unsafe or unsound practices. The Federal Reserve’s Regulation Y, for example, generally requires a bank holding company to provide the Federal Reserve with prior notice of any redemption or repurchase of its own equity securities, if the consideration to be paid, together with the consideration paid for any repurchases or redemptions in the preceding year, is equal to 10.0% or more of the bank holding company’s consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve may oppose the transaction if it believes that the transaction would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or would violate any law or regulation. In certain circumstances, the Federal Reserve could take the position that paying a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice.
 The Federal Reserve has broad authority to prohibit activities of bank holding companies and their nonbanking subsidiaries which represent unsafe and unsound practices, result in breaches of fiduciary duty or which constitute violations of laws or regulations, and to assess civil money penalties or impose enforcement action for such activities. The penalties can be as high as $1.0 million for each day the activity continues.
 Anti‑tying Restrictions. Bank holding companies and their affiliates are prohibited from tying the provision of certain services, such as extensions of credit, to other nonbanking services offered by a bank holding company or its affiliates.

 CommunityBank of Texas, N.A.
 The Bank is subject to various requirements and restrictions under the laws of the United States, and to regulation, supervision and examination by the OCC. The Bank is also an insured depository institution and, therefore, subject to regulation by the FDIC, although the OCC is the Bank’s primary federal regulator. The OCC and the FDIC have the power to enforce compliance with applicable banking statutes and regulations. Such requirements and restrictions include requirements to maintain reserves against deposits, restrictions on the nature and amount of loans that may be made and the interest that may be charged thereon and restrictions relating to investments and other activities of the Bank.
 Capital Adequacy Requirements. Under the Basel III Capital Rules, discussed above, the OCC monitors the capital adequacy of the Bank by using a combination of risk‑based guidelines and leverage ratios. The OCC considers the Bank’s capital levels when taking action on various types of applications and when conducting supervisory activities related to the safety and soundness of the Bank and the banking system. Higher capital levels may be required if warranted by the circumstances or risk profiles of individual institutions, or if required by the banking regulators due to the economic conditions impacting our markets. For example, OCC regulations provide that higher capital may be required to take adequate account of, among other things, interest rate risk and the risks posed by concentrations of credit, nontraditional activities or securities trading activities.
 Corrective Measures for Capital Deficiencies. The federal banking regulators are required by the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, or FDI Act, to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to capital‑deficient institutions that are FDIC‑insured. Agency regulations define, for each capital category, the levels at which institutions are “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized.” Under the current capital rules, which became effective on January 1, 2015, a “well capitalized” bank has a total risk‑based capital ratio of 10.0% or higher, a Tier 1 risk‑based capital ratio of 8.0% or higher, a leverage ratio of 5.0% or higher, a CET1 capital ratio of 6.5% or higher and is not subject to any written agreement, order or directive requiring it to maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. An “adequately capitalized” bank has a total risk‑based capital ratio of 8.0% or higher, a Tier 1 risk‑based capital ratio of 6.0% or higher, a leverage ratio of 4.0% or higher (3.0% or higher if the bank was rated a composite 1 in its most recent examination report and is not experiencing significant growth), a CET1 capital ratio of 4.5% or higher and does not meet the criteria for a well capitalized bank. A bank is “undercapitalized” if it fails to meet any one of the ratios required to be adequately capitalized.
 In addition to requiring undercapitalized institutions to submit a capital restoration plan, agency regulations contain broad restrictions on certain activities of undercapitalized institutions including asset growth, acquisitions, branch establishment and expansion into new lines of business. With certain exceptions, an insured depository institution is prohibited from making capital distributions, including dividends, and is prohibited from paying management fees to control persons if the institution would be undercapitalized after any such distribution or payment.
 As a national bank’s capital decreases, restrictions on the OCC’s enforcement powers become more severe. A significantly undercapitalized national bank is subject to mandated capital raising activities, restrictions on interest rates paid and transactions with affiliates, removal of management and other restrictions. The OCC has very limited discretion in dealing with a critically undercapitalized national bank and is virtually required to appoint a receiver or conservator.
 Banks with risk‑based capital and leverage ratios below the required minimums may also be subject to certain administrative actions, including the termination of deposit insurance upon notice and hearing, or a temporary suspension of insurance without a hearing in the event the institution has no tangible capital.
 Standards for Safety and Soundness. Federal law requires each federal banking agency to prescribe certain standards for all insured depository institutions. These standards relate to, among other things, internal controls, information systems and audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, compensation and other operational and managerial standards as the agency deems appropriate.  Interagency guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired.  If the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, the agency may require the institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard.  Failure to implement such a plan can result in further enforcement action, including the issuance of a cease and desist order or the imposition of civil money penalties.

 Branching. National banks are required by the National Bank Act to adhere to branching laws applicable to state banks in the states in which they are located. Under the Dodd‑Frank Act, de novo interstate branching by national banks is permitted if, under the laws of the state where the branch is to be located, a state bank chartered in that state would have been permitted to establish a branch. Under current Texas law, state banks are permitted to establish branch offices throughout Texas with prior regulatory approval. In addition, with prior regulatory approval, state banks are permitted to acquire branches of existing banks located in Texas. State banks located in Texas may also branch across state lines by merging with banks or by purchasing a branch of another bank in other states if allowed by the applicable states’ laws.
 Restrictions on Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders. Transactions between the Bank and its nonbanking subsidiaries and/or affiliates, including the Company, are subject to Section 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation W promulgated under such Sections. In general, Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act imposes limits on the amount of such transactions and requires certain levels of collateral for loans to affiliated parties. It also limits the amount of advances to third parties which are collateralized by the securities or obligations of the Company or its subsidiaries. Covered transactions with any single affiliate may not exceed 10.0% of the capital stock and surplus of the Bank, and covered transactions with all affiliates may not exceed, in the aggregate, 20.0% of the Bank’s capital and surplus. For a bank, capital stock and surplus refers to the bank’s Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital, as calculated under the risk‑based capital guidelines, plus the balance of the allowance for credit losses excluded from Tier 2 capital. The Bank’s transactions with all of its affiliates in the aggregate are limited to 20.0% of the foregoing capital. “Covered transactions” are defined by statute to include a loan or extension of credit to an affiliate, as well as a purchase of securities issued by an affiliate, a purchase of assets (unless otherwise exempted by the Federal Reserve) from the affiliate, the acceptance of securities issued by the affiliate as collateral for a loan and the issuance of a guarantee, acceptance or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate. In addition, in connection with covered transactions that are extensions of credit, the Bank may be required to hold collateral to provide added security to the Bank, and the types of permissible collateral may be limited. The Dodd‑Frank Act generally enhances the restrictions on transactions with affiliates, including an expansion of what types of transactions are covered transactions to include credit exposures related to derivatives, repurchase agreement and securities lending arrangements and an increase in the amount of time for which collateral requirements regarding covered transactions must be satisfied. Affiliate transactions are also subject to Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act which generally requires that certain transactions between the Bank and its affiliates be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the Bank, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with or involving other nonaffiliated persons.
 The restrictions on loans to directors, executive officers, principal shareholders and their related interests (collectively referred to herein as “insiders”) contained in Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and in Regulation O promulgated by the Federal Reserve apply to all insured institutions and their subsidiaries and bank holding companies. These restrictions include limits on loans to one borrower and conditions that must be met before such a loan can be made. There is also an aggregate limitation on all loans to insiders and their related interests. Generally, the aggregate of these loans cannot exceed the institution’s total unimpaired capital and surplus, although a bank’s regulators may determine that a more stringent limit is appropriate. Loans to senior executive officers of a bank are even further restricted. Insiders are subject to monetary penalties for knowingly accepting loans in violation of applicable restrictions.
 Restrictions on Distribution of Bank Dividends and Assets. Dividends paid by the Bank have provided a substantial part of our operating funds and for the foreseeable future it is anticipated that dividends paid by the Bank to us will continue to be our principal source of operating funds. Earnings and capital adequacy requirements serve to limit the amount of dividends that may be paid by the Bank. In general terms, federal law provides that the Bank’s Board of Directors may, from time to time and as it deems expedient, declare a dividend out of its net profits. Generally, the total of all dividends declared in a year shall not, unless approved by the OCC, exceed the net profits of that year combined with its net profits of the past two years. 
 In addition, under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991, or FDICIA, the Bank may not pay any dividend if it is undercapitalized or the payment of the dividend would cause it to become undercapitalized. The OCC may further restrict the payment of dividends by requiring that the Bank maintain a higher level of capital than otherwise required for it to be adequately capitalized for regulatory purposes. Moreover, if, in the opinion of the OCC, the Bank is engaged in an unsound practice (which could include the payment of dividends), it may require, generally after notice and hearing, that the Bank cease such practice. The OCC has indicated that paying dividends that deplete a depository institution’s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe banking practice. The OCC has also issued policy statements providing that insured depository institutions generally should pay dividends only out of current operating earnings.

 Depositor Preference. In the event of the “liquidation or other resolution” of an insured depository institution, the claims of depositors of the institution, including the claims of the FDIC as subrogee of insured depositors, and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as a receiver, will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution. If an insured depository institution fails, insured and uninsured depositors, along with the FDIC, will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured, non-deposit creditors, including the parent bank holding company, with respect to any extensions of credit they have made to such insured depository institution.
 Incentive Compensation Guidance. The federal banking agencies have issued comprehensive guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to help ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of those organizations by encouraging excessive risk‑taking. The incentive compensation guidance sets expectations for banking organizations concerning their incentive compensation arrangements and related risk management, control and governance processes. The incentive compensation guidance, which covers all employees that can materially affect the risk profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon three primary principles: (1) balanced risk‑taking incentives, (2) compatibility with effective controls and risk management and (3) strong corporate governance. Any deficiencies in compensation practices that are identified may be incorporated into the organization’s supervisory ratings, which can affect its ability to make acquisitions or take other actions. In addition, under the incentive compensation guidance, a banking organization’s federal supervisor may initiate enforcement action if the organization’s incentive compensation arrangements pose a risk to the safety and soundness of the organization. Further, a provision of the Basel III capital standards described above would limit discretionary bonus payments to bank executives if the institution’s regulatory capital ratios fail to exceed certain thresholds. A number of federal regulatory agencies proposed rules that would require enhanced disclosure of incentive‑based compensation arrangements initially in April 2011 and again in April and May 2016. The scope and content of the U.S. banking regulators’ policies on executive compensation are continuing to develop and are likely to continue evolving in the near future.
 Audits. For insured institutions with total assets of $500 million or more, financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., or GAAP, as well as management’s certifications signed by our and the Bank’s chief executive officer and chief accounting or financial officer concerning management’s responsibility for the financial statements, must be submitted to the FDIC. If the insured institution has consolidated total assets of more than $1.0 billion, it must additionally submit an attestation by the auditors regarding the institution’s internal controls. Insured institutions with total assets of $500 million or more must also have an audit committee consisting exclusively of outside directors (the majority of whom must be independent of management), and insured institutions with total assets of $1.0 billion or more must have an audit committee that is entirely independent. The committees of institutions with total assets of more than $3.0 billion must include members with experience in banking or financial management, must have access to outside counsel and must not include representatives of large customers. The Bank’s audit committee consists entirely of independent directors and includes members with experience in banking or related financial management.
 Deposit Insurance Assessments. The FDIC insures the deposits of federally insured banks up to prescribed statutory limits for each depositor through the Deposit Insurance Fund and safeguards the safety and soundness of the banking and thrift industries. The maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks and savings institutions is $250,000 per depositor, per ownership category. The amount of FDIC assessments paid by each insured depository institution is based on its relative risk of default as measured by regulatory capital ratios and other supervisory factors and is calculated based on an institution’s average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity.
 We are generally unable to control the amount of premiums that we are required to pay for FDIC insurance. At least semi‑annually, the FDIC will update its loss and income projections for the Deposit Insurance Fund and, if needed, will increase or decrease assessment rates, following notice‑and‑comment rulemaking, if required. If there are additional bank or financial institution failures or if the FDIC otherwise determines to increase assessment rates, the Bank may be required to pay higher FDIC insurance premiums. Any future increases in FDIC insurance premiums may have a material and adverse effect on our earnings.
 In addition, all FDIC‑insured institutions are required to pay assessments to the FDIC to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation, or FICO, an agency of the federal government established to recapitalize the predecessor to the Deposit Insurance Fund. These assessments, which are included in Deposit Insurance Premiums on the Consolidated Statements of Income, will continue until the FICO bonds mature.

 Financial Subsidiaries. Under the GLB Act, banks may establish financial subsidiaries and engage, subject to limitations on investment, in activities that are financial in nature, other than insurance underwriting as principal, insurance company portfolio investment, real estate development, real estate investment, annuity issuance and merchant banking activities. To do so, a bank must be well capitalized, well managed and have a CRA rating from its primary federal regulator of satisfactory or better.  Banks with financial subsidiaries, as well as subsidiary banks of financial holding companies, must remain well capitalized and well managed to continue to engage in activities that are financial in nature without regulatory actions or restrictions. Such actions or restrictions could include divestiture of the “financial in nature” subsidiary or subsidiaries. 
 Brokered Deposit Restrictions. Insured depository institutions that are categorized as adequately capitalized institutions under the FDI Act and corresponding federal regulations cannot accept, renew or roll over brokered deposits without receiving a waiver from the FDIC and are subject to restrictions on the interest rates that can be paid on any deposits. Insured depository institutions that are categorized as undercapitalized institutions under the FDI Act and corresponding federal regulations may not accept, renew or roll over brokered deposits. The Bank is not currently subject to such restrictions.
 Concentrated Commercial Real Estate Lending Regulations. The federal banking regulatory agencies have promulgated guidance governing financial institutions with concentrations in commercial real estate lending. The guidance provides that a bank has a concentration in commercial real estate lending if (1) total reported loans for acquisition, construction, land development and other land represent 100.0% or more of total capital or (2) total reported loans secured by multi‑family and nonfarm nonresidential properties and loans for acquisition, construction, land development and other land represent 300.0% or more of total capital and the bank’s commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased 50% or more during the prior 36 months. Owner‑occupied loans are excluded from this second category. If a concentration is present, management must employ heightened risk management practices that address, among other things, board and management oversight and strategic planning, portfolio management, development of underwriting standards, risk assessment and monitoring through market analysis and stress testing and maintenance of increased capital levels as needed to support the level of commercial real estate lending.
 Community Reinvestment Act. The CRA and the regulations issued thereunder are intended to encourage banks to help meet the credit needs of their entire assessment area, including low and moderate income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operations of such banks. These regulations also provide for regulatory assessment of a bank’s record in meeting the needs of its assessment area when considering applications to establish branches, merger applications and applications to acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of another bank. The Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 requires federal banking agencies to make public a rating of a bank’s performance under the CRA. In the case of a bank holding company, the CRA performance record of the banks involved in the transaction are reviewed in connection with the filing of an application to acquire ownership or control of shares or assets of a bank or to merge with any other bank holding company. An unsatisfactory CRA record could substantially delay approval or result in denial of an application. The Bank received a “satisfactory” rating in its most recent CRA examination.
 Consumer Laws and Regulations. The Bank is subject to numerous federal laws and regulations intended to protect consumers in transactions with the Bank, including but not limited to the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Real Estate Procedures Act of 1974, the S.A.F.E. Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008, the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act and laws prohibiting unfair, deceptive or abusive acts and practices in connection with consumer financial products and services. Many states and local jurisdictions have consumer protection laws analogous, and in addition, to those enacted under federal law. These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with customers when taking deposits, making loans and conducting other types of transactions. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could give rise to regulatory sanctions, customer rescission and registration rights, action by state and local attorneys general and civil or criminal liability. 
 The authority to supervise and examine depository institutions with $10.0 billion or less in assets for compliance with federal consumer laws remains largely with those institutions’ primary regulators (the OCC, in the case of the Bank). However, the CFPB may participate in examinations of these smaller institutions on a “sampling basis” and may refer potential enforcement actions against such institutions to their primary regulators. Accordingly, the CFPB may participate in examinations of the Bank, which currently has assets of less than $10.0 billion, and could supervise and examine our other direct or indirect subsidiaries that offer consumer financial products or services.

 Mortgage Lending Rules. CFPB regulations that require lenders to determine whether a consumer has the ability to repay a mortgage loan became effective on January 10, 2014. These regulations established certain minimum requirements for creditors when making ability-to-repay determinations and provide certain safe harbors from liability for mortgages that are “qualified mortgages” and are not “higher-priced.” Generally, these CFPB regulations apply to all consumer, closed-end loans secured by a dwelling, including home-purchase loans, refinancing and home equity loans (whether first or subordinate lien). Qualified mortgages must generally satisfy detailed requirements related to product features, underwriting standards, and requirements where the total points and fees on a mortgage loan cannot exceed specified amounts or percentages of the total loan amount. Qualified mortgages must: (1) have a term not exceeding 30 years; (2) provide for regular periodic payments that do not result in negative amortization, deferral of principal repayment, or a balloon payment; (3) and be supported with documentation of the borrower and his or her credit worthiness. 
 The Regulatory Relief Act included a provision that provides for certain residential mortgages held in portfolio by banks with less than $10.0 billion in consolidated assets to automatically be deemed “qualified mortgages.” This relieves such institutions from many of the requirements to satisfy the criteria listed above for “qualified mortgages.” Mortgages meeting the “qualified mortgage” safe harbor may not have negative amortization, must follow prepayment penalty limitations included in the Truth in Lending Act, and may not have fees greater than three percent of the total value of the loan.
 Anti‑Money Laundering and OFAC. Under federal law, including the Bank Secrecy Act, or BSA, and the USA PATRIOT Act, certain financial institutions, such as the Bank, must maintain anti‑money laundering programs that include established internal policies, procedures and controls; a designated BSA officer; an ongoing employee training program; and testing of the program by an independent audit function. Financial institutions are also prohibited from entering into specified financial transactions and account relationships and must meet enhanced standards for due diligence and customer identification especially in their dealings with foreign financial institutions and foreign customers. Financial institutions must take reasonable steps to conduct enhanced scrutiny of account relationships to guard against money laundering and to report any suspicious transactions, and law enforcement authorities have been granted increased access to financial information maintained by financial institutions. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN, issued final rules under the BSA in 2016, with a compliance deadline of May 2018, that clarified and strengthened the due diligence requirements for banks with regard to their customers. The final rules included a new requirement for banks to identify and verify the identity of beneficial owners of legal entity customers, subject to certain exclusions and exemptions.  
 The Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, administers laws and Executive Orders that prohibit U.S. entities from engaging in transactions with certain prohibited parties. OFAC publishes lists of persons and organizations suspected of aiding, harboring or engaging in terrorist acts, known as Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons. Generally, if a bank identifies a transaction, account or wire transfer relating to a person or entity on an OFAC list, it must freeze the account or block the transaction, file a suspicious activity report and notify the appropriate authorities.
 Bank regulators routinely examine institutions for compliance with these obligations and they must consider an institution’s compliance in connection with the regulatory review of applications, including applications for bank mergers and acquisitions. In addition, other government agencies have the authority to conduct investigations of an institution’s compliance with these obligations. Failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing and comply with OFAC sanctions, or to comply with relevant laws and regulations, could have serious legal, reputational and financial consequences for the institution.
 Privacy. The federal banking regulators have adopted rules that limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose non‑public information about consumers to non‑affiliated third parties. These limitations require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to a non‑affiliated third-party. These regulations affect how consumer information is transmitted through financial services companies and conveyed to outside vendors. In addition, consumers may also prevent disclosure of certain information among affiliated companies that is assembled or used to determine eligibility for a product or service, such as that shown on consumer credit reports and asset and income information from applications. Consumers also have the option to direct banks and other financial institutions not to share information about transactions and experiences with affiliated companies for the purpose of marketing products or services. In addition to applicable federal privacy regulations, the Bank is subject to certain state privacy laws.
 Federal Home Loan Bank System. The Federal Home Loan Bank System, of which the Bank is a member, is composed of 11 regional Federal Home Loan Banks, or FHLBs, more than 7,300 member financial institutions, and a 

 
  14

 
fiscal agent.  The FHLBs provide long- and short-term advances (i.e., loans) to member institutions within their assigned regions in accordance with policies and procedures established by the boards of directors of each regional FHLB. Such advances are primarily collateralized by residential mortgage loans, as well as government and agency securities, and are priced at a small spread over comparable U.S. Department of the Treasury obligations.
 As a member of the Dallas FHLB, the Bank is entitled to borrow from the Dallas FHLB, provided it posts acceptable collateral. The Bank is also required to own a certain amount of capital stock in the Dallas FHLB. The Bank is in compliance with the stock ownership rules with respect to such advances, commitments and letters of credit and collateral requirements with respect to home mortgage loans and similar obligations. All loans, advances and other extensions of credit made by the Dallas FHLB to the Bank are secured by a portion of the respective mortgage loan portfolio, certain other investments and the capital stock of the Dallas FHLB held by the Bank.
 Enforcement Powers. The federal banking agencies, including our primary federal regulator, the OCC, have broad enforcement powers, including the power to terminate deposit insurance, impose substantial fines and other civil and criminal penalties and appoint a conservator or receiver. Failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations and supervisory agreements, breaches of fiduciary duty or the maintenance of unsafe and unsound conditions or practices could subject the Company or the Bank and their subsidiaries, as well as their respective officers, directors and other institution‑affiliated parties, to administrative sanctions and potentially substantial civil money penalties. For example, the regulatory authorities may appoint the FDIC as conservator or receiver for a banking institution (or the FDIC may appoint itself, under certain circumstances) if any one or more of a number of circumstances exist, including, without limitation, the fact that the banking institution is undercapitalized and has no reasonable prospect of becoming adequately capitalized, fails to become adequately capitalized when required to do so, fails to submit a timely and acceptable capital restoration plan or materially fails to implement an accepted capital restoration plan.
 Effect of Governmental Monetary Policies
 The commercial banking business is affected not only by general economic conditions but also by U.S. fiscal policy and the monetary policies of the Federal Reserve. Some of the instruments of monetary policy available to the Federal Reserve include changes in the discount rate on member bank borrowings, the fluctuating availability of borrowings at the “discount window,” open market operations, the imposition of and changes in reserve requirements against member banks’ deposits and certain borrowings by banks and their affiliates and assets of foreign branches. These policies influence to a significant extent the overall growth of bank loans, investments, deposits and the interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits. We cannot predict the nature of future fiscal and monetary policies or the effect of these policies on our operations and activities, financial condition, results of operations, growth plans or future prospects. Impact of Current Laws and Regulations
 The cumulative effect of these laws and regulations, while providing certain benefits, adds significantly to the cost of our operations and thus may have a negative impact on our profitability. There has also been a notable expansion in recent years of financial service providers that are not subject to the examination, oversight and other rules and regulations to which we are subject. Those providers, because they are not so highly regulated, may have a competitive advantage over us and may continue to draw large amounts of funds away from traditional banking institutions, with a continuing adverse effect on the banking industry in general. Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company
 As a company with less than $1.07 billion in revenues during our last fiscal year, we qualify as an “emerging growth company” under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act.  An emerging growth company may take advantage of reduced reporting and other requirements that are otherwise generally applicable to public companies.  As an emerging growth company:
· | we may present less than five years of selected historical financial data;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | we are exempt from the requirement to obtain an attestation and report from our auditors on management’s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | we are permitted to have an extended transition period for adopting any new or revised accounting standards that may be issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, or by the SEC;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  15

 


· | we are permitted to provide less extensive disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | we are not required to give our shareholders nonbinding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  We have elected to take advantage of the scaled disclosures and other relief described above in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and we may take advantage of these exemptions until December 31, 2022 or such earlier time that we are no longer an “emerging growth company.”  In general, we would cease to be an “emerging growth company” if we have $1.07 billion or more in annual revenues, we have more than $700 million in market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates on any June 30 more than one year after our initial public offering, or we issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period.  As a result, we could cease to be an “emerging growth company” as soon as the end of the 2019 fiscal year.  For so long as we may choose to take advantage of some or all of these reduced burdens, the level of information that we provide stockholders may be different than you might get from other public companies in which you hold stock.  In addition, when these exemptions cease to apply, we expect to incur additional expenses and devote increased management effort toward ensuring compliance with them, which we may not be able to predict or estimate. 

Future Legislation and Regulatory Reform

In recent years, regulators have increased their focus on the regulation of financial institutions. From time to time, various legislative and regulatory initiatives are introduced in Congress and state legislatures. New regulations and statutes are regularly proposed that contain wide‑ranging proposals for altering the structures, regulations and competitive relationships of financial institutions operating in the United States. We cannot predict whether or in what form any proposed regulation or statute will be adopted or the extent to which our business may be affected by any new regulation or statute. Future legislation, regulation and policies and the effects of such legislation, regulation and policies, may have a significant influence on our operations and activities, financial condition, results of operations, growth plans or future prospects and the overall growth and distribution of loans, investments and deposits. Such legislation, regulation and policies have had a significant effect on the operations and activities, financial condition, results of operations, growth plans and future prospects of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so.
