Item 1. Business.
 
Unless the context otherwise requires, all references in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to “P.A.M.,” the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us” mean P.A.M. Transportation Services, Inc. and its subsidiaries.
 
We are a truckload dry van carrier transporting general commodities throughout the continental United States, as well as in certain Canadian provinces. We also provide transportation services in Mexico under agreements with Mexican carriers. Our freight consists primarily of automotive parts, expedited goods, consumer goods, such as general retail store merchandise, and manufactured goods, such as heating and air conditioning units.
 
P.A.M. Transportation Services, Inc. is a holding company incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in June 1986. We conduct operations principally through the following wholly owned subsidiaries: P.A.M. Transport, Inc., T.T.X., LLC, P.A.M. Cartage Carriers, LLC, Overdrive Leasing, LLC, P.A.M. Logistics Services, Inc., Choctaw Express, LLC, Choctaw Brokerage, Inc., Transcend Logistics, Inc., Decker Transport Co., LLC, East Coast Transport and Logistics, LLC, S & L Logistics, Inc., and P.A.M. International, Inc. Our operating authorities are held by P.A.M. Transport, Inc., P.A.M. Cartage Carriers, LLC, Choctaw Express, LLC, Choctaw Brokerage, Inc., T.T.X., LLC, Decker Transport Co., LLC, and East Coast Transport and Logistics, LLC. Effective on January 1, 2010, the operations of most of the Company’s operating subsidiaries were consolidated under the P.A.M. Transport, Inc. name in an effort to more clearly reflect the Company’s scope and available service offerings.
 
We are headquartered and maintain our primary terminal, maintenance facilities, and our corporate and administrative offices in Tontitown, Arkansas, which is located in northwest Arkansas, a major center for the trucking industry and where the support services (including warranty repair services) for most major truck and trailer equipment manufacturers are readily available.
 
Segment Financial Information
 
The Company's operations are all in the motor carrier segment and are aggregated into a single reporting segment in accordance with the aggregation criteria under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”).
Operations
 
Our operations can generally be classified into truckload services or brokerage and logistics services. This designation is based primarily on the ownership of the asset that performed the freight transportation service. Truckload services are performed by Company divisions that generally utilize Company owned trucks, long-term contractors, or single-trip contractors to transport loads of freight for customers, while brokerage and logistics services coordinate or facilitate the transport of loads of freight for customers and generally involve the utilization of single-trip contractors. Both our truckload operations and our brokerage and logistics operations have similar economic characteristics and are impacted by virtually the same economic factors as discussed elsewhere in this Report. Truckload services operating revenues, before fuel surcharges, represented 80.0%, 86.3% and 88.4% of total operating revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The remaining operating revenues, before fuel surcharge for the same periods were generated by brokerage and logistics services, representing 20.0%, 13.7% and 11.6%, respectively.
 
Approximately 57% of the Company's revenues are derived from domestic shipments while approximately 43% of our revenues are derived from freight originating from or destined to locations in Mexico or Canada.

Business and Growth Strategy
 
Our strategy focuses on the following elements:
 
Providing a Full Suite of Complimentary Truckload Transportation Solutions. Our objective is to provide our customers with a comprehensive solution to their truckload transportation needs. Our array of asset-based service offerings consist of dedicated, expedited, automotive, local, regional, and long-haul truckload services. Our brokerage and logistics solutions offer similar services, but utilize third party equipment to expand available capacity. Our area of service includes the continental United States, Mexico and to a lesser degree Canada.
Developing Customer Relationships within High Density Traffic Lanes. We strive to maximize utilization and increase revenue per truck while minimizing our time and empty miles between loads. In this regard, we seek to provide equipment to our customers in defined regions and disciplined traffic lanes. This strategy enables us to:

• | maintain more consistent equipment capacity;
--+---------------------------------------------


• | provide a high level of service to our customers, including time-sensitive delivery schedules;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | attract and retain drivers; and
--+--------------------------------


• | maintain a sound safety record as drivers travel familiar routes.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------

Providing Superior and Flexible Customer Service. We strive to provide a very high level of service to our customers, thus creating a level of satisfaction, value and loyalty within our customer base. We closely monitor each shipment for compliance regarding scheduled pickup, delivery and transit times, service levels and customer specific expectations. We provide verbal and electronic updates through various forums to customers to allow visibility of their products as they progress through the transport process.
 
Many of our customers depend on us to deliver shipments on a time-definite basis, meaning that parts or raw materials are scheduled for delivery as they are needed on a manufacturer’s production line. The need for this service is a product of modern manufacturing and assembly methods that are designed to decrease inventory levels and handling costs. Such requirements place a premium on our delivery performance and reliability.
 
Employing Stringent Cost Controls. Throughout our organization, emphasis is placed on gaining efficiency in our processes with the primary goals of decreasing costs and improving customer satisfaction. Maintaining a high level of efficiency and prioritizing our focus on improvements allows us to minimize the number of non-driving personnel we employ and positively influence other overhead costs. Expenses are intensely scrutinized for opportunities for elimination, reduction or to further leverage our purchasing power to achieve more favorable pricing.
Industry
 
According to the American Trucking Association’s “American Trucking Trends 2018” report, the trucking industry transported approximately 70% of the total volume of freight transported in the United States during 2017, which equates to 10.8 billion tons and over $700 billion in revenue. The truckload industry is highly fragmented and is impacted by several economic and business factors, many of which are beyond the control of individual carriers. The state of the economy, coupled with equipment capacity levels, can impact freight rates. Volatility of various operating expenses, such as fuel and insurance, make the predictability of profit levels uncertain. Availability, attraction, retention and compensation of drivers also affect operating costs, as well as equipment utilization. In addition, the capital requirements for equipment, coupled with potential uncertainty of used equipment values, impact the ability of many carriers to expand their operations.

The current operating environment is characterized by the following:
 

• | Competition for drivers;
--+-------------------------


• | Competition for freight;
--+-------------------------


• | Price increases by truck and trailer equipment manufacturers;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


• | Volatile fuel costs; and
--+-------------------------


• | Pressure on less profitable or undercapitalized carriers to consolidate or exit the industry.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Competition 
 
The trucking industry is highly competitive and includes thousands of carriers, none of which dominates the market in which the Company operates. The Company's market share is less than 1%, and we compete primarily with other route medium- to long-haul truckload carriers, with private carriage conducted by our existing and potential customers, and, to a lesser extent, with the railroads. We compete on the basis of quality of service and delivery performance, as well as price. Many of the long-haul truckload carriers have substantially greater financial resources, own more equipment or carry a larger total volume of freight as compared to the Company.
Marketing and Significant Customers
 
Our marketing emphasis is directed to that portion of the truckload market which is generally service-sensitive, as opposed to being solely price driven. We seek to become a “core carrier” for our customers in order to maintain high utilization and capitalize on recurring revenue opportunities. Our marketing efforts are diversified and designed to gain access to dedicated, expedited, regional, automotive, and long-haul opportunities (including those in Mexico and Canada) and to expand brokerage and logistics offerings.
 
Our sales efforts are conducted by a staff of ten employees who are located in our major markets and supervised from our headquarters. These individuals work to improve profitability by maintaining an even flow of freight traffic (taking into account the balance between originations and destinations in a given geographical area), high utilization, and minimizing movement of empty equipment.
 
Our five largest customers, for which we provide carrier services covering a number of geographic locations, accounted for approximately 42%, 41% and 43% of our total revenues in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles accounted for approximately 16%, 10% and 9% of our revenues in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. General Motors Company accounted for approximately 13%, 18% and 18% of our revenues in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Ford Motor Company accounted for approximately 8%, 9% and 10% of our revenues in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
 
We also provide transportation services to other manufacturers who are suppliers for automobile manufacturers. Approximately 46%, 46% and 45% of our revenues were derived from transportation services provided to the automobile industry during 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
 
Revenue Equipment
 
At December 31, 2018, we operated a fleet of 2,031 trucks, which included 597 independent contractor trucks. At December 31, 2018, our trailer fleet consisted of 6,397 trailers. Our company-owned trucks and leased trucks are late model, well-maintained, premium trucks, which we believe help to attract and retain drivers, maximize fuel efficiency, promote safe operations, minimize maintenance and repair costs, and improve customer service by minimizing service interruptions caused by breakdowns. The average age of our trucks and trailers as of December 31, 2018 was 1.20 years and 3.54 years respectively. We evaluate our equipment purchasing decisions based on factors such as initial cost, useful life, warranty terms, expected maintenance costs, fuel economy, driver comfort, customer needs, manufacturer support, and resale value.

We contract with independent contractors to provide greater flexibility in responding to fluctuations in consumer demand. Independent contractors provide their own trucks and are contractually responsible for all associated expenses, including financing costs, fuel, maintenance, insurance, and taxes, among other things. They are also responsible for maintaining compliance with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration regulations.
 
Technology
 
Our trucks are equipped with cellular-based global positioning and communications systems that allows fleet managers to communicate directly with drivers. Drivers provide location, status, and informational updates directly to our computer system which increases productivity, convenience, and customer visibility. This system provides information that allows us to calculate accurate estimated time of arrival information, which helps to optimize planning and customer service levels.
 
Our information systems manage the data provided by our on-board devices to update system information regarding the location and load status of our trucks, which permits us to better manage customer delivery schedules, respond to customer inquiries, and perform optimized equipment to load matching, among various other planning and support functions. In many instances, our systems also directly provide real-time information electronically to our customers regarding the status of freight shipments and anticipated arrival times, adding flexibility and convenience by extending supply chain visibility.
 
Maintenance
 
We have a strictly-enforced, comprehensive preventive maintenance program for our trucks and trailers. Inspections and various levels of preventive maintenance are performed at set intervals on both trucks and trailers. A maintenance and safety inspection is performed on all vehicles each time they return to a terminal.
 
Our trucks carry full warranty coverage for at least three years or 375,000 miles. Extended truck warranties are often negotiated with the truck manufacturers and manufacturers of major components, such as engine, transmission, and differential manufacturers, for up to five years or 575,000 miles. Our trailers carry full warranties by the manufacturer for up to seven years with certain components covered for up to ten years.
 
Employees
 
At December 31, 2018, we employed 2,748 persons, of whom 2,067 were drivers, 159 were employed in maintenance, 282 were employed in operations, 45 were employed in marketing, 132 were employed in safety and personnel, and 63 were employed in general administration and accounting. A total of 2,730 of our employees were employed on a full-time basis as of December 31, 2018. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining unit, and we believe that our employee relations are good.
Drivers
 
At December 31, 2018, we utilized 2,067 company drivers in our operations. We also had 677 drivers for independent contractors under contract who were compensated on a per mile basis. Our drivers are compensated on the basis of calculated miles driven, loading and unloading, extra stops, and layovers in transit. Drivers can earn bonuses by recruiting other qualified drivers who become employed by us, and both cash and non-cash prizes are awarded for achieving certain safety and miles-per-gallon goals. All of our drivers are recruited, screened, and drug tested and participate in our driver training program. Our driver training program stresses the importance of safety and reliable, on-time delivery. Drivers are required to report to their driver managers daily and at the earliest possible moment when any condition occurs en route that might delay their scheduled delivery time.
 
We contract with independent contractors to supply one or more trucks and drivers for our use. Independent contractors must pay their own truck expenses, fuel, maintenance, insurance, and driver costs. They must meet and operate within our guidelines with respect to safety. We have a lease-purchase program whereby we offer independent contractors the opportunity to lease a truck, with the option to purchase the truck at the end of the lease term. We believe our lease-purchase program has contributed to our ability to attract and retain independent contractors. At December 31, 2018, approximately 359 independent contractors were leasing 475 trucks in this program.

In addition to strict application screening and drug testing, before being permitted to operate a vehicle, our drivers must undergo classroom instruction on our policies and procedures, safety techniques as taught by the Smith System of Defensive Driving, and the proper operation of equipment, and must pass both written and road tests. Instruction in defensive driving and safety techniques continues after hiring, with seminars at several of our terminals. At December 31, 2018, we employed 110 persons on a full-time basis in our driver recruiting, training and safety instruction programs.
 
Intense competition in the trucking industry for qualified drivers has resulted in additional expense to recruit and retain an adequate supply of drivers, and has had a negative impact on the industry. Our operations have also been impacted and from time to time we have experienced under-utilization and increased expenses due to a shortage of qualified drivers. We place a high priority on the recruitment and retention of an adequate supply of qualified drivers.
 
Available Information
 
The Company maintains a website where additional information concerning its business can be found. The address of that website is www.pamtransport.com. The Company makes available free of charge on its website its Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) as soon as reasonably practicable after it electronically files or furnishes such materials to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Seasonality
 
Generally, our revenues do not exhibit a significant seasonal pattern; however, revenue is affected by adverse weather conditions, holidays and the number of business days that occur during a given period because revenue is directly related to the available work days of shippers. Operating expenses are typically higher in the winter months primarily due to decreased fuel efficiency and increased maintenance costs associated with inclement weather. In addition, automobile plants for which we transport a large amount of freight typically undergo scheduled shutdowns in July and December and the volume of automotive freight we ship is reduced during such scheduled plant shutdowns.
Regulation

We are a common and contract motor carrier regulated by various United States federal and state, Canadian provincial, and Mexican federal agencies. These regulatory agencies have broad powers, generally governing matters such as authority to engage in motor carrier operations, motor carrier registration, driver hours-of-service (“HOS”), drug and alcohol testing of drivers, and safety, size, and weight of transportation equipment. The primary regulatory agencies affecting the Company’s operations include the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (“FMCSA”), the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Agency, and the Surface Transportation Board, which are all agencies within the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”). We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable regulatory requirements relating to our business and operate with a “satisfactory” rating (the highest of three rating categories) from the DOT. In addition, we are subject to compliance with cargo-security and transportation regulations issued by the Transportation Security Administration, a component department within the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. To the extent that we conduct operations outside the United States, we are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which generally prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from offering bribes to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining favorable treatment.

In December 2011, the FMCSA released new rules regulating HOS that became effective in July 2013. These rules reduced the maximum hours that could be worked in a consecutive seven day period from 82 to 70, required that a driver take a mandatory thirty minute break during each consecutive eight hour driving period, and required that a driver take a 34 hour rest period, or restart, that included two periods between 1:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m. that could only be used one time every seven calendar days.
 
In December 2014, the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2015 suspended enforcement of the requirements for use of the 34 hour restart that became effective in July 2013 and replaced them with the previous restart rules that were in effect on June 30, 2013 pending the completion of the Commercial Vehicle Driver Restart Study which is designed to measure and compare the fatigue and safety performance of truck drivers using the two different versions of the HOS restart provisions. As of December 31, 2018, the study has been completed, but the findings have not been publicly disclosed.
 
In July 2012, Congress passed legislation renewing the mandate for electronic logging devices and designated authority to the FMCSA to propose a new rule. In December 2015, the FMCSA amended the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations to establish minimum performance and design standards for HOS electronic logging devices (“ELDs”), requirements for the mandatory use of these devices by drivers currently required to prepare HOS records of duty status, requirements concerning HOS supporting documents, and measures to address concerns about harassment resulting from the mandatory use of ELDs. In May 2018 the FMCSA released a notice that they would allow a motor carrier that installed and required its drivers to use an Automatic on Board Recording Device (“AOBRD”) before December 18, 2017 and who uses registered ELD capable devices that run compliant AOBRD software to continue to do so until December 16, 2019. The Company was an early adopter of ELD capable devices, requiring the devices to be installed on its entire fleet and requiring its drivers to use AOBRD’s since 2010. These rulings affect the majority of carriers, including us. We do not anticipate a material impact to our profitability as a result of implementation of existing rules; however, we believe that enforcement of these rules on non-compliant carriers may present challenges for them and may improve our competitive position.
 
The FMCSA administers carrier safety compliance and enforcement through its Compliance, Safety, Accountability (“CSA”) program that became effective in December 2010. CSA is designed to measure and evaluate the safety performance of carriers and drivers through categorization of inspection and crash results into Behavior Analysis and Safety Improvement Categories (“BASICs”) including unsafe/fatigued driving, driver fitness, controlled substances and alcohol, maintenance, cargo, and crashes. BASIC scores are evaluated relative to carrier peer groups to determine carriers that exceed certain thresholds, identifying them for intervention. Intervention status might include targeted roadside inspections, onsite investigations and the development of cooperative safety plans, among other things. Ongoing compliance with CSA may result in additional expenses to the Company or a reduction in the pool of drivers eligible for us to hire. In addition to FMCSA action, a BASIC score that exceeds an intervention threshold might have a negative impact on our ability to attract customers and drivers.
 
The Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”) jointly developed new standards for various vehicles, including heavy duty trucks, that were adopted in August 2011 and cover model years 2014 through 2018. The standard adopted for heavy duty trucks was intended to achieve a reduction in CO2 and fuel consumption ranging from 7% to 20% by model year 2017. In August 2016, the EPA and NHTSA finalized the second phase of these standards which will further reduce GHG emissions and fuel consumption for heavy duty trucks through model year 2027. In addition, the state of California has adopted its own fuel efficiency regulations that include the use of special aerodynamic equipment for trucks and 53 foot trailers traveling through the state. Compliance with these federal and state requirements has increased the cost of our equipment and may further increase the cost of replacement equipment in the future.
 
Our motor carrier operations are also subject to environmental laws and regulations, including laws and regulations dealing with the transportation of hazardous materials and other environmental matters, and our operations involve certain inherent environmental risks. Our operations involve the risks of fuel spillage or seepage, environmental damage, and hazardous waste disposal, among others. We have instituted programs to monitor and control environmental risks and assure compliance with applicable environmental laws. As part of our safety and risk management program, we periodically perform internal environmental reviews so that we can achieve environmental compliance and avoid environmental risk. We transport a minimum amount of environmentally hazardous substances and, to date, have experienced no significant claims for hazardous materials shipments. If we should fail to comply with applicable regulations, we could be subject to substantial fines or penalties and to civil and criminal liability.

Company operations are often conducted in industrial areas, where truck terminals and other industrial activities are conducted, and where groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination have occurred, which could potentially expose us to claims that we contributed to the environmental contamination.
 
We believe we are currently in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations and that the cost of compliance has not materially affected results of operations.
