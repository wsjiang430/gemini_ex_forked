Item 1.                 Business.
Corporate History
 
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on April 28, 2010 under the name Norman Cay Development, Inc. From inception until September 1, 2011, we were an Exploration Stage company that had not commenced any operations. It was our initial intention to be an authorized retailer of wireless telephones and service plans with our initial operation in Michigan or elsewhere in the Midwest. Due to lack of cell phone and service plan sales, in September 2011, we abandoned the original business plan and began seeking out potential acquisition candidates in the mining industry.
 
On July 12, 2012, we changed the name of the Company from Norman Cay Development, Inc. to Discovery Gold Corporation to better reflect the direction and business of the Company.
 
Except as otherwise indicated by the context, references in this Annual Report to “Company,” “DCGD,” “we,” “us” and “our” are to Discovery Gold Corporation.
 
On September 2, 2011,  the Company entered into a certain Share Exchange Agreement (the “Share Exchange Agreement”) by and among the Company, Discovery Gold Ghana Limited, a company organized under the laws of the country of Ghana (“DGG”), the stockholders of DGG (the “DGG Stockholders”), and the majority stockholder of the Company. Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, the Company acquired one hundred percent (100%) of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of DGG, and in exchange the Company: (i) made a one-time payment of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) to DGG and (ii) issued seventeen million five hundred thousand (17,500,000) newly-issued shares of restricted Common Stock of the Company to the DGG Stockholders resulting in the acquisition of DGG by the Company (the “Acquisition”). As a result of closing the Share Exchange Agreement, the Company has acquired DGG, as its wholly-owned subsidiary. The acquisition of DGG by the Company did not require Ghana government regulatory consent under the Mining Act or any other applicable legislation of Ghana. On February 23, 2015, the Company sold all issued and outstanding shares in DGG to James Clark, thereby disposing of the wholly owned subsidiary.
 
The Company operated as an Exploration Stage company in Ghana involved in the examination and investigation of land that it believed contained valuable minerals, with the primary focus on gold. The Company unsuccessfully tried to raise capital in order to implement its business plan, and subsequently failed to file its reports to the Commission in a timely fashion. The Company terminated its registration with the Commission on May 1, 2015 by filing Form 15 12g-4(a)(2). Thereafter, the Company stopped filing required reports pursuant to Rules 13 and 15d of the Securities Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and ceased operations. 
 
On July 30, 2018, the Company filed Form 10-12g with the Commission disclosing that it was a shell company with no operations or assets seeking to acquire an interest in business opportunities presented to us by persons or firms which desire to seek the advantages of an issuer who has complied with the Exchange Act.
 
On June 20, 2019, GRN Funds, LLC, a Washington limited liability company, and its manager and Chief Executive Officer, Justin Costello, purchased a total of 139 million shares of the Registrant’s common stock representing 55.65% of this issued and outstanding shares, in a private transaction with Stephen Flechner and David Cutler. As a result of the closing of the transaction on June 25, 2019, GRN Funds, LLC and Mr. Costello acquired a majority of the issued shares eligible to vote. The total purchase price of $300,000 was paid in cash by GRN Funds, LLC. As a condition to the closing of the transaction, the Registrant’s Directors Mr. Stephen Flechner and Mr. Ralph Shearing resigned, and Mr. Flechner resigned as Chief Executive Officer and President, and Mr. Justin Costello was concurrently named Director of the Registrant, President and Chief Executive Officer. As of the date of this filing, the Company has not commenced operations and remains a shell company.
