ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

 Armstrong World Industries, Inc. (“AWI” or the “Company”) is a Pennsylvania corporation incorporated in 1891.  When we refer to “we,” “our” and “us” in this report, we are referring to AWI and its subsidiaries.
 We are a leading global producer of ceiling systems for use primarily in the construction and renovation of commercial and residential buildings. We design, manufacture and sell ceiling systems (primarily mineral fiber, fiberglass wool and metal) throughout the Americas.
 
In August 2018, we acquired the business and assets of Steel Ceilings, Inc. (“Steel Ceilings”), based in Johnstown, Ohio. Steel Ceilings is a manufacturer of aluminum and stainless metal ceilings that include architectural, radiant and security solutions with one manufacturing facility. Steel Ceilings’ operations, and its assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2018, are included as a component of our Architectural Specialties segment.  
 
In May 2018, we acquired the business and assets of Plasterform, Inc. (“Plasterform”), based in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada.  Plasterform is a manufacturer of architectural cast ceilings, walls, facades, columns and moldings with one manufacturing facility. Plasterform’s operations, and its assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2018, are included as a component of our Architectural Specialties segment.  
 
In November 2017, we entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Knauf International GmbH (“Knauf”), to sell certain subsidiaries comprising our business in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (including Russia) (“EMEA”) and the Pacific Rim, including the corresponding businesses and operations conducted by Worthington Armstrong Venture (“WAVE”), our joint venture with Worthington Industries, Inc. (“Worthington”) in which AWI holds a 50% interest. The consideration paid by Knauf in connection with the sale was $330 million in cash, inclusive of amounts due to WAVE, subject to certain adjustments as provided in the Purchase Agreement, including adjustments based on the economic impact of any required regulatory remedies and a working capital adjustment.  
 
On July 18, 2018, we entered into an amendment to the Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which Knauf agreed to irrevocably and unconditionally pay AWI (i) $250 million on August 1, 2018, and (ii) $80 million on September 15, 2018, if, prior to such date, (A) any competition condition has not been satisfied or (B) the closing has not yet occurred. The amendment also provided for the reduction (from a maximum of $35 million to a maximum of $20 million) of potential adjustments to the purchase price consideration for the transaction based on the impact of remedies required to satisfy competition conditions. We received both the $250 million payment and the $80 million payment from Knauf in the third quarter of 2018.  Following receipt of these payments, we remitted $70 million to WAVE in partial consideration of the purchase price payable in respect of the business and operations of WAVE under the transaction.  WAVE subsequently paid each of AWI and Worthington a dividend of $35 million.  We also recorded a $22.4 million payable to WAVE, which is reflected within Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses. The total consideration payable by AWI to WAVE will be determined following closing in connection with the calculation of the adjustments contemplated by the Purchase Agreement.  
 
The transaction was notified for merger control clearance in the European Union (“EU”), Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia, Montenegro, Russia and Serbia, and was cleared unconditionally in Montenegro (February 2018), Serbia (February 2018), Russia (March 2018), Macedonia (July 2018) and Bosnia and Herzegovina (August 2018).  On December 7, 2018, the European Commission granted conditional clearance of the transaction, subject to certain commitments intended to address concerns regarding the overlap between the activities of AWI and Knauf, including the divestment by Knauf to a third party of certain mineral fiber and grid businesses and operations in Austria, Estonia, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Portugal, Spain, Turkey and the UK.  This includes our sales operations in each of the relevant countries, as well as our production facilities, and those of WAVE, located in Team Valley, UK.  The terms of the sale of the divestment business by Knauf and the identity of the purchaser are subject to the approval of the European Commission. 
 
We continue to work closely with Knauf towards closing and expect the transaction to close by the end of the first half of 2019.  The EMEA and Pacific Rim historical financial results have been reflected in AWI’s Consolidated Financial Statements as discontinued operations for all periods presented.  
 In January 2017, we acquired the business and assets of Tectum, Inc. (“Tectum”), based in Newark, Ohio.  Tectum is a manufacturer of acoustical ceiling, wall and structural solutions for commercial building applications with two manufacturing facilities. Tectum’s operations from the date of acquisition, and its assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2018, are included as a component of our Architectural Specialties segment.

In April 2016, we completed our separation of Armstrong Flooring, Inc. (“AFI”).  AFI’s historical financial results have been reflected in AWI’s Consolidated Financial Statements as a discontinued operation for all periods presented.  
 See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our acquisition and discontinued operations.
 We are focused on driving sustainable shareholder value by consistently delivering profitable sales and earnings growth, while maintaining a balanced approach to capital allocation.  Through our expanding architectural specialties offerings, bolstered by our acquisitions of Tectum, Plasterform and Steel Ceilings, our innovative core ceilings portfolio, including our Total Acoustics solutions and Sustain family of products, and digitally-enabled systems and tools, we are expanding our capabilities to sell into more spaces and sell more into every space. 
 Markets
 We are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate, often holding a leadership or significant market share position. Our products compete against mineral fiber and fiberglass products from other manufacturers, as well as drywall.  We compete directly with other domestic and international suppliers of these products. The major markets in which we compete are:
 Commercial.  Our revenue opportunities come from new construction as well as renovation of existing buildings.  Renovation work is estimated to represent the majority of the commercial market opportunity.  Most of our revenue comes from the following sectors of commercial building – office, education, transportation, healthcare and retail.  We monitor U.S. construction starts and follow project activity.  Our revenue from new construction can lag behind construction starts by as much as 18 to 24 months.  We also monitor office vacancy rates, the Architecture Billings Index, state and local government spending, gross domestic product (“GDP”) and general employment levels, which can indicate movement in renovation and new construction opportunities.  We believe that these statistics, taking into account the time-lag effect, provide a reasonable indication of our future revenue opportunity from commercial renovation and new construction.  Additionally, we believe that customer preferences for product type, style, color, performance attributes (such as acoustics and sustainability), availability, affordability and ease of installation also affect our revenue. 
 In our Mineral Fiber segment, we estimate that a majority of our commercial market sales are used for renovation purposes by end-users of our products.  The end-use of our products is based on management estimates as such information is not easily determinable.  
 Residential.  We also sell mineral fiber products for use in single and multi-family housing. We estimate that existing home renovation (also known as replacement / remodel) work represents the majority of the residential market opportunity.  Key U.S. statistics that indicate market opportunity include existing home sales (a key indicator for renovation opportunity), housing starts, housing completions, home prices, interest rates and consumer confidence.  
Customers
 We use our reputation, capabilities, service, innovation and brand recognition to develop long-standing relationships with our customers.  We principally sell commercial products to building materials distributors, who re-sell our products to contractors, subcontractors’ alliances, large architect and design firms, and major facility owners. We have important relationships with national home centers such as Lowe’s Companies, Inc. and The Home Depot, Inc., with wholesalers who re-sell our products to dealers who service builders, contractors and consumers, and also with architects and designers who specify products. 
 Approximately 75% of our consolidated net sales are to distributors.  Sales to large home centers account for slightly less than 10% of our consolidated sales.  Our remaining sales are primarily to direct customers and retailers.  
 Net sales to three commercial distributors totaling $459.3 million, included within our Mineral Fiber and Architectural Specialties segments, individually exceeded 10% of our consolidated net sales in 2018.  
 Working Capital
 We produce goods for inventory and sell on credit to our customers.  Generally, our distributors carry inventory as needed to meet local or rapid delivery requirements.  We sell our products to select, pre-approved customers using customary trade terms that allow for payment in the future.  These practices are typical within the industry.  
Competition
 We face strong competition in all of our businesses.  Principal attributes of competition include product performance, product styling, service and price.  Competition comes from both domestic and international manufacturers.  Additionally, some of our products

compete with alternative products or finishing solutions, namely, drywall and exposed structure (also known as open plenum).  Excess industry capacity exists for certain products, which tends to increase price competition.  The following companies are our primary competitors:
 CertainTeed Corporation (a subsidiary of Saint-Gobain), Chicago Metallic Corporation (owned by ROCKWOOL International A/S), Georgia-Pacific Corporation, Rockfon A/S (owned by ROCKWOOL International A/S), USG Corporation, Ceilings Plus (owned by USG Corporation), Rulon International, and 9Wood.
 Raw Materials
 We purchase raw materials from numerous suppliers worldwide in the ordinary course of business.  The principal raw materials include: wood pulp, fiberglass, perlite, starch, waste paper, pigments and clays.  We manufacture most of the production needs for mineral wool at one of our manufacturing facilities.  Finally, we use aluminum and steel in the production of metal ceilings by us and by WAVE, our joint venture that manufactures ceiling grid.
 We also purchase significant amounts of packaging materials and consume substantial amounts of energy, such as electricity and natural gas, and water.
 In general, adequate supplies of raw materials are available to all of our operations.  However, availability can change for a number of reasons, including environmental conditions, laws and regulations, shifts in demand by other industries competing for the same materials, transportation disruptions and/or business decisions made by, or events that affect, our suppliers.  There is no assurance that these raw materials will remain in adequate supply to us.
 Prices for certain high usage raw materials can fluctuate dramatically.  Cost increases for these materials can have a significant adverse impact on our manufacturing costs.  Given the competitiveness of our markets, we may not be able to recover the increased manufacturing costs through increasing selling prices to our customers.
 Sourced Products
 Some of the products that we sell are sourced from third parties.  Our primary sourced products include specialty ceiling products.  We purchase some of our sourced products from suppliers that are located outside of the U.S., primarily from the Pacific Rim and Europe.  Sales of sourced products represented approximately 13% of our total consolidated revenue in 2018.
 In general, we believe we have adequate supplies of sourced products.  However, we cannot guarantee that the supply will remain adequate.
 Seasonality
 Generally, our sales tend to be stronger in the second and third quarters of our fiscal year due to more favorable weather conditions, customer business cycles and the timing of renovation and new construction.  
Patent and Intellectual Property Rights
 Patent protection is important to our business.  Our competitive position has been enhanced by patents on products and processes developed or perfected within AWI or obtained through acquisitions and licenses.  In addition, we benefit from our trade secrets for certain products and processes.
 Patent protection extends for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of a patent in the various countries where patent protection is obtained.  The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies.  Although we consider that, in the aggregate, our patents, licenses and trade secrets constitute a valuable asset of material importance to our business, we do not believe we are materially dependent upon any single patent or trade secret, or any group of related patents or trade secrets.
 Certain of our trademarks, including without limitation,  , Armstrong®, Calla®, Cirrus®, Cortega®, DESIGNFlex™, Dune™, Humiguard®, Infusions®, Lyra®, MetalWorks™,  Optima®, Perla™, Soundscapes®, Sustain®, Tectum®, Total Acoustics®,  Ultima®, and WoodWorks®, are important to our business because of their significant brand name recognition.  Registrations are generally for fixed, but renewable, terms.

In connection with the separation and distribution of AFI, we entered into several agreements with AFI that, together with a plan of division, provided for the separation and allocation of assets between AWI and AFI.  These agreements include a Trademark License Agreement and a Transition Trademark License Agreement.  Pursuant to the Trademark License Agreement, AWI provided AFI with a perpetual, royalty-free license to utilize the “Armstrong” trade name and logo.  Pursuant to the Transition Trademark License Agreement, AFI provided us with a five-year royalty-free license to utilize the “Inspiring Great Spaces” tagline, logo and related color scheme.
 Pursuant to our Purchase Agreement with Knauf related to the sale of our EMEA and Pacific Rim businesses and prior to the closing, AWI anticipates entering into an agreement with Knauf relating to the use of certain intellectual property by Knauf after the closing, including the Armstrong trade name. 
 We review the carrying value of trademarks at least annually for potential impairment.  See the “Critical Accounting Estimates” section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 of this Form 10-K for further information.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 4,000 full time and part time employees. As on December 31, 2017, we had approximately 3,900 full-time and part-time employees. Excluding our EMEA and Pacific Rim businesses, we had approximately 2,200 employees as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017.  
 As of December 31, 2018, approximately 81% of our approximately 1,000 production employees in the U.S. were represented by labor unions.  Collective bargaining agreements covering approximately 65 employees at one U.S. plant will expire during 2019.  Outside the U.S., most of our production employees are covered by either industry-sponsored and/or state-sponsored collective bargaining mechanisms.  We believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory. 
 Research & Development
 Research and development (“R&D”) activities are important and necessary in helping us improve our products’ competitiveness.  Principal R&D functions include the development and improvement of products and manufacturing processes.
Sustainability and Environmental Matters
 The adoption of environmentally responsible building codes and standards such as the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (“LEED”) rating system established by the U.S. Green Building Council, has the potential to increase demand for products, systems and services that contribute to building sustainable spaces. Many of our products meet the requirements for the award of LEED credits, and we are continuing to develop new products, systems and services to address market demand for products that enable construction of buildings that require fewer natural resources to build, operate and maintain. Our competitors also have developed and introduced to the market products with an increased focus on sustainability.
 We expect that there will be increased demand over time for products, systems and services that meet evolving regulatory and customer sustainability standards and preferences and decreased demand for products that produce significant greenhouse gas emissions. We also believe that our ability to continue to provide these products, systems and services to our customers will be necessary to maintain our competitive position in the marketplace.  We are committed to complying with all environmental laws and regulations that are applicable to our operations.
 Legal and Regulatory Proceedings
 Regulatory activities of particular importance to our operations include proceedings under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), and state Superfund and similar type environmental laws governing existing or potential environmental contamination at three domestically owned locations allegedly resulting from past industrial activity. We are one of several potentially responsible parties in these matters and have agreed to jointly fund required investigation, while preserving our defenses to the liability.  We may also have rights of contribution or reimbursement from other parties or coverage under applicable insurance policies.  
 Most of our facilities are affected by various federal, state and local environmental requirements relating to the discharge of materials or the protection of the environment.  We make expenditures necessary for compliance with applicable environmental requirements at each of our operating facilities. We have not experienced a material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures or competitive position as a result of environmental control legislation and regulations.

On September 8, 2017, Roxul USA, Inc. (d/b/a Rockfon) filed litigation against us in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware alleging anticompetitive conduct seeking remedial measures and unspecified damages.  Roxul USA, Inc. is a significant ceilings systems competitor with global headquarters in Europe and expanding operations in the Americas.  We believe the allegations are without merit and are vigorously defending the matter. During the first quarter of 2018, the Court denied, in part, and granted, in part, our motion to dismiss, dismissing two of the claims brought by Roxul USA, Inc. We recently filed a motion seeking summary judgment on all of Rockfon’s remaining claims and have moved to exclude the testimony of Rockfon’s expert witness.  Rockfon moved for partial summary judgment in its favor on a single claim of alleged liability only (not damages).  We subsequently opposed that motion on numerous grounds.  The date for determination of motions is not currently scheduled.  A trial date is reserved, if necessary, for early in the second quarter of 2019.  We continue to incur defense costs for the matter.
 We are involved in various other lawsuits, claims, investigations and other legal matters from time to time that arise in the ordinary course of business, including matters involving our products, intellectual property, relationships with suppliers, relationships with distributors, relationships with competitors, employees and other matters. From time to time, for example, we may be a party to various litigation matters that involve product liability, tort liability and other claims under various allegations, including illness due to exposure to certain chemicals used in the workplace, or medical conditions arising from exposure to product ingredients or the presence of trace contaminants.  Such allegations may involve multiple defendants and relate to legacy products that we and other defendants purportedly manufactured or sold. We believe that any current claims are without merit and intend to defend them vigorously. For these matters, we also may have rights of contribution or reimbursement from other parties or coverage under applicable insurance policies.  When applicable and appropriate, we will pursue coverage and recoveries under those policies, but are unable to predict the outcome of those demands.  While complete assurance cannot be given to the outcome of these proceedings, we do not believe that any current claims, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.
 Liabilities of $12.4 million and $13.5 million as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, were recorded for environmental liabilities that we consider probable and for which a reasonable estimate of the probable liability could be made.  See Note 27 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Form 10-K, for information regarding the possible effects that compliance with environmental laws and regulations may have on our businesses and operating results.
