  BUSINESS
 Overview
 
We are a biopharmaceutical company pioneering the understanding of the non-coding regulatory region of the genome to advance a new wave of medicines that control the expression of genes. We have built a proprietary platform that is designed to systematically and efficiently analyze this unexploited region of DNA to identify and drug novel targets linked to genomically defined patient populations. Because gene expression is fundamental to the function of all cells, we believe that our gene control platform has broad potential to create medicines that achieve profound and durable benefit across a range of diseases. We are currently focused on developing treatments for cancer and diseases resulting from mutations of a single gene, also known as monogenic diseases, and building a pipeline of gene control medicines.
 Our lead product candidates are:
  
• | SY-1425, a selective retinoic acid receptor alpha, or RARα, agonist that is currently being evaluated in combination with azacitidine, a hypomethylating agent frequently used to treat acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, patients in a Phase 2 clinical trial in genomically defined subsets of patients with AML;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | SY-1365, a selective inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase 7, or CDK7, that is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with advanced solid tumors, including multiple ovarian and breast cancer patient populations as a single agent and in combination with standard-of-care therapies; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | SY-5609, a novel CDK7 inhibitor that can be administered orally, which is being evaluated in investigational new drug application, or IND, enabling preclinical studies.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial is assessing the safety and efficacy of SY-1425 in combination with azacitidine in a cohort of approximately 25 newly diagnosed AML patients who are not suitable candidates for standard chemotherapy. All patients enrolled or to be enrolled in this cohort of the trial in support of our primary efficacy analyses have been or will be prospectively selected using our proprietary RARA or IRF8 biomarkers. In addition, to support the development of a commercial companion diagnostic test for SY-1425, we are evaluating SY-1425 in combination with azacitidine in a cohort of approximately 25 newly diagnosed AML patients who are not suitable candidates for standard chemotherapy and who are biomarker-negative. 
 At the American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting held in December 2018, or ASH 2018, we reported data from these cohorts of the Phase 2 clinical trial as of an October 29, 2018 data cut-off, and we continue to enroll and follow patients in the trial. As of the data cut-off, 11 biomarker-positive and eight biomarker-negative patients had been enrolled in the trial. Of the biomarker-positive patients, ten were evaluable for safety and eight were also evaluable for clinical responses. Of the biomarker-negative patients, seven were evaluable for safety and six were evaluable for clinical responses. We reported at ASH 2018 that SY-1425 in combination with azacitidine had been generally well-tolerated, with no evidence of increased toxicities, and that adverse events had been consistent with what has previously been seen with SY-1425 and azacitidine as single agents in AML. We also reported that the aggregate rate of complete response and complete response with incomplete blood count recovery, as defined by Revised International Working Group, or IWG, criteria, as of the data cut-off was 50% and the overall response rate using IWG criteria was 63%, in each case in response-evaluable patients enrolled in the biomarker-positive cohort of the trial. Most of the initial responses reported were seen at the end of the first treatment cycle. Single-agent azacitidine has shown response rates of 18-29% in newly-diagnosed AML patients who are not suitable candidates for chemotherapy, with initial responses generally occurring after four cycles of treatment in most patients who respond. We also reported at ASH 2018 an overall response rate of 17% as of the data cut-off in response-evaluable patients enrolled in the biomarker-negative cohort. While data from this cohort are less mature (because enrollment in this cohort started later than the biomarker-positive cohort), we believe that the difference in the observed overall response rates as of the cut-off date supports the potential predictive value of the RARA and IRF8 biomarkers for identifying patients most likely to respond to SY-1425. We expect to complete enrollment in the biomarker-positive cohort of the trial in mid-2019 and to report updated clinical data in the second half of 2019. We also plan to expand this trial in the third quarter of 2019 to include an assessment of the safety and efficacy of SY-1425 in combination with azacitidine in approximately 25 biomarker-positive patients with relapsed or refractory AML, and expect to report initial data on these patients in 2020.
 We also reported data at ASH 2018 from a pilot cohort of our Phase 2 clinical trial of SY-1425 evaluating the safety and efficacy of SY-1425 in combination with daratumumab, an anti-CD38 antibody approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma, in biomarker-positive patients with relapsed or refractory AML or higher-risk myelodysplastic syndrome, or MDS. Specifically, we reported that SY-1425 in combination with daratumumab was generally well tolerated with no evidence of increased toxicities, and that, while eight of nine evaluable patients had increased CD38 expression in myeloid blast cells, this expression increased to levels exceeding those of a multiple myeloma cell line in only two of those patients. In January 2019, we reported that we made a portfolio prioritization decision not to pursue further development of SY-1425 in combination with daratumumab beyond completion of this pilot cohort, which is closed to further enrollment.

In September 2018, we opened the expansion portion of our Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating the safety and clinical activity of SY-1365 in multiple ovarian cancer populations as a single agent as well as in combination with carboplatin, a chemotherapeutic agent, following completion of the dose-escalation portion of the trial. The high-grade serous ovarian cancer populations being evaluated include a 24-patient cohort evaluating SY-1365 as a single agent in patients who have relapsed after three or more prior therapies and a 24-patient cohort evaluating SY-1365 in combination with carboplatin in patients who relapsed after one or more prior therapies but who may still benefit from additional platinum-based treatment. We expect that a new 12-patient pilot cohort evaluating SY-1365 as a single agent in patients with recurrent ovarian clear cell cancer will be open for enrollment in the second quarter of 2019. We have stopped enrollment in a previously announced pilot cohort evaluating SY-1365 in patients with primary platinum-refractory ovarian cancer due to the recent approval of a new therapy in this indication that we believe will result in fewer patients meeting the strict clinical definition of “primary platinum refractory.” We are also evaluating SY-1365 in combination with fulvestrant, a hormonal medicine, in approximately 12 patients with hormone-receptor positive, or HR+, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer who have previously been treated with a CDK4/6 inhibitor plus an aromatase inhibitor. In addition, we are evaluating the mechanism of action of SY-1365 as a single agent in approximately 30 patients with any solid tumor accessible for biopsy. We plan to report initial clinical data from the expansion portion of our Phase 1 clinical trial in the fourth quarter of 2019. We expect these data to include initial safety assessments from the cohort evaluating SY-1365 in combination with carboplatin, as well as initial safety and efficacy assessments from the cohort evaluating SY-1365 in patients who have relapsed after three or more prior therapies and in patients with any solid tumor accessible for biopsy. We expect to report initial data from the other cohorts of the trial, including the recurrent ovarian clear cell cancer cohort, in 2020.
 In November 2018, we reported data as of October 15, 2018 from the dose-escalation portion of the Phase 1 clinical trial of SY-1365 at the EORTC-NCI-AACR Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics Symposium, or ENA 2018, which demonstrated proof-of mechanism at tolerable doses in patients with advanced solid tumors. Specifically, we reported that SY-1365 demonstrated dose-dependent effects on CDK7 occupancy and downstream gene expression changes in blood cells. In addition, we reported that adverse events occurring in the dose-escalation portion of the trial were predominantly low-grade, reversible and generally manageable and that a maximum tolerated dose was not defined. We also reported that clinical activity per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1, or RECIST, criteria was observed in seven of the 19 patients (37%) who were evaluable for clinical responses, including one patient with recurrent ovarian clear cell cancer in her fourth relapse who had a confirmed partial response after two cycles of treatment at an 80 mg/m2 twice weekly dose. This patient remained in a partial response at an assessment after six cycles of treatment. Six additional patients had stable disease lasting between 50 and 127 days. Most of these patients received doses of SY-1365 equal to or greater than 32 mg/m2. Based on these data, we initiated the expansion cohorts of the Phase 1 clinical trial at 53 and 80 mg/m2, and we are exploring once and twice weekly treatment regimens. 
 In November 2018, we designated SY-5609 as a development candidate to enter IND-enabling preclinical studies. We expect to complete these studies during 2019 in order to support potential initiation of a Phase 1 clinical trial of SY-5609 in oncology patients in early 2020.
 We currently have several other programs in our preclinical and discovery pipeline, including a CDK12/13 inhibitor program, a program directed to inhibitors of a macrophage target in immuno-oncology, and discovery programs related to a gene control target to treat sickle cell disease and in the field of cancer. We have and are continuing to use our gene control platform in collaboration with third parties to identify and validate targets in diseases beyond our current areas of focus. To this end, we entered into a target discovery, research collaboration and option agreement with Incyte Corporation, or Incyte, in January 2018 under which we are using our platform to identify novel therapeutic targets with a focus on myeloproliferative neoplasms. 
 Our Focus – Gene Control Medicines Providing a Profound Benefit for Patients
 There are approximately 200 different cell types in the human body. Despite having identical genomes, each of these cell types has a different function. For example, a skin cell functions differently than a muscle cell despite sharing the exact same DNA. What determines cell type and function is the specific set of genes that is expressed, or turned “on” or “off,” in that given cell. This coordinated activation and repression of genes, known as the cell’s gene expression program, is controlled in part by a number of cellular components acting on non-coding regions of the genome. These components include transcription factors, transcriptional kinases, other transcriptional and regulatory proteins, and RNA. These transcriptional and regulatory proteins bind with specific regions of non‑coding DNA to control the rate and magnitude of gene transcription.
 In some diseases, alterations in the physical state or function of the non‑coding regions of the genome can change a cell’s gene expression program, altering the type and function of that cell. Because the altered gene expression program is implemented by transcription factors, transcriptional kinases, other transcriptional and regulatory proteins, and RNA, these proteins and RNA can be important points for therapeutic intervention. Because this biology is fundamental to the function of all cells, it applies across diseases, whether the cause is genetic, environmental, bacterial, viral or multi‑factorial.
 6


Although researchers have long believed that alterations in non‑coding regions of DNA, which account for 98% of the genome, play a key role in driving disease, the scientific community has lacked the tools to study these regions of the genome, rendering them poorly understood. As a result, the discovery and development of targeted therapies to date has focused almost exclusively on abnormal proteins resulting from genetic alterations found in regions of DNA that encode for proteins, which represent less than 2% of the entire genome. 
 We believe we have the industry-leading platform for the systematic and efficient analysis of non‑coding regions of the genome to identify alterations in gene expression programs that represent optimal points of therapeutic intervention and the development of drugs to control the expression of disease‑driving genes. By doing so, we believe our gene control platform will allow us to (i) identify a wide array of potential new drug targets across a range of diseases, (ii) provide a new lens for diagnosing and segmenting patients, including those with complex, multi‑factorial diseases that have eluded segmentation with other genomic‑based approaches, and (iii) advance a new wave of medicines that have the potential to influence multiple drivers of disease through a single target, making them less susceptible to drug resistance and providing patients with a more profound and durable benefit than many of today’s targeted therapies.
 Our Gene Control Platform
 Our proprietary gene control platform consists of two fundamental pillars: 
  
• | identifying gene control targets that, when modulated with a drug, may provide a therapeutic benefit to defined patient populations; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | drugging gene control targets.
--+-------------------------------

 We analyze gene expression programs and the non-coding regions of the genome associated with those expression programs in diseased and healthy cells taken from patient tissues to identify points of therapeutic intervention and associated biomarkers in specific patient populations. The discovery and validation of these gene control targets has led to the identification of our clinical candidates SY‑1425 and SY-1365 as well as additional novel product candidates in earlier stages of research and preclinical development. We plan to analyze gene expression programs in other cancers, and to collaborate with third parties such as Incyte to identify and validate targets in diseases beyond our current areas of focus.
 In some diseases, particularly monogenic diseases, research has revealed that a therapeutic benefit might be possible from modulating expression of a single gene. We are also using our platform to characterize the regulatory region associated with such a gene and identify protein or RNA components that could be modulated to alter the expression of that single gene. We are applying this approach to sickle cell disease based on the hypothesis that increased expression of the fetal hemoglobin gene in individuals with sickle cell disease could be therapeutically beneficial.
 We develop product candidates to modulate gene control targets through internal drug discovery efforts focused on creating small molecule drugs targeting transcription factors, transcriptional kinases and other transcriptional and regulatory proteins. We have also used our platform to link existing drugs to novel genomically defined patient populations, and seek to in‑license, acquire or use those drugs as starting points for our own drug discovery programs to accelerate our development path, as we did with SY-1425.
 We have developed significant core internal capabilities in small molecule chemistry, biochemistry and structural biology to characterize the structure and function of transcription factors such as transcriptional kinases, chromatin regulators, and other transcriptional and regulatory proteins in order to generate novel chemical matter, including SY-1365 and SY-5609. We have also developed a sophisticated suite of proprietary assays, which are internally developed tests to measure the biochemical, biophysical, cellular and genomic activity of known and novel compounds against gene control targets
 Our Clinical Programs
 SY‑1425
 Overview
 SY‑1425 (tamibarotene) is an oral, potent and selective agonist of the transcription factor RARα. We are currently conducting a Phase 2 clinical trial assessing the safety and efficacy of SY-1425 in combination with azacitidine, a hypomethylating agent frequently used to treat patients with AML, in a cohort of approximately 25 biomarker-positive newly diagnosed AML patients who are not suitable candidates for standard chemotherapy. We expect to complete enrollment in this cohort of the trial in mid-2019 and to report updated clinical data in the second half of 2019. We also plan to expand this trial in the third quarter of 2019 to include an assessment of the safety and efficacy of SY-1425 in combination with azacitidine in biomarker-positive patients with relapsed or refractory AML.

Linking SY‑1425 to Novel Patient Populations
 We leveraged our platform to analyze gene expression programs in primary AML and breast cancer patient tissue samples. We discovered that RARA, the gene that codes for RARα, was associated with a super‑enhancer in some patients’ tumors but not in others. A super-enhancer is a highly specialized region of non-coding DNA central to orchestrating gene expression programs and driving increased expression of genes crucial to the function of a given cell. The function of RARα differs depending on whether it is bound to its ligand. In the absence of a ligand, RARα represses differentiation. We believe that in tumors with the RARA‑associated super‑enhancer, there is an abundance of unliganded RARα, resulting in the repression of differentiation, thereby locking the cell in an immature, proliferative and undifferentiated state. Introducing a RARα agonist, such as SY‑1425, simulates the activity of a ligand, activating differentiation. 
SY‑1425 Development Plan
 We plan to develop SY‑1425 in North America and Europe for treatment of AML in genomically defined subsets of patients with either the RARA or IRF8 biomarker, or both. In September 2016, we initiated a multi-center, open-label Phase 2 clinical trial enrolling genomically-defined subsets of patients with AML and MDS pursuant to an investigational new drug application, or IND, accepted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in May 2016. In the fourth quarter of 2016, an investigational device exemption for the assay being used to select patients with the RARA and IRF8 biomarkers for inclusion in this trial was approved by the FDA. At the European School of Hematology’s 4th International Conference on AML in October 2017, or ESH 2017, we presented data from 201 evaluable patients screened in our Phase 2 clinical trial demonstrating that approximately 40% of patients were positive for either the RARA or IRF8 biomarker, or both, and that approximately one-third of the relapsed or refractory AML and higher-risk MDS patients tested were biomarker positive.
 Tamibarotene, the active pharmaceutical ingredient of SY‑1425, has been extensively studied and has a well‑established safety profile. In our Phase 2 clinical trial, we are using the same dosage used in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia, or APL, in Japan (6 mg/m2 orally, divided into two daily doses). This same dosage for SY‑1425 was previously used in a U.S. trial in relapsed and refractory APL, for which an IND was opened. We have exclusively in‑licensed from TMRC Co., Ltd., or TMRC, certain intellectual property rights controlled by TMRC and the preclinical data package that was used for approval in Japan and the IND filing in the United States for use in all cancer indications in North America and Europe.
 We have entered into an agreement with a third-party commercial provider to provide a validated laboratory test under Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment, or CLIA, guidelines using a well‑established diagnostic platform and approach that is being used to prospectively enroll RARA and IRF8 biomarker‑positive patients in our clinical trial. This CLIA laboratory test could become the basis for a commercial companion diagnostic. We are evaluating commercial providers to lead the development of a potential commercial companion diagnostic for these biomarkers, but have not yet selected a platform for development of a companion diagnostic test or entered in to an agreement with a third party for this work. We expect to do so in 2019.
We have chosen AML as our lead indication for development of SY-1425 due to high levels of observed activity of SY‑1425 in our preclinical models, clinical activity and tolerability observed in clinical trials, the significant unmet medical need of these patients and our belief, in the case of development in relapsed or refractory AML, in the potential for efficient or accelerated development. We believe that the data to be generated in the planned clinical trial of SY-1425 in combination with azacitidine for the treatment of biomarker-positive patients with relapsed or refractory AML, if positive, could support a decision to enter into a registration-enabling clinical trial. We intend to pursue additional indications upon establishing proof‑of‑concept in AML because we believe there are subsets of patients with other tumor types with our RARA and IRF8 biomarkers.
 SY-1425 in Combination with Azacitidine
 Our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial is currently assessing the safety and efficacy of SY-1425 in combination with azacitidine in a cohort of approximately 25 newly diagnosed AML patients who are not suitable candidates for standard chemotherapy. The primary endpoint for this cohort of the trial is overall response rate, as determined by IWG criteria. Secondary endpoints include duration of response as well as safety and tolerability. All patients enrolled or to be enrolled in this cohort of the trial in support of our primary efficacy analyses have been or will be prospectively selected using our proprietary RARA or IRF8 biomarkers. In addition, to support the development of a commercial companion diagnostic test for SY-1425, we are evaluating SY-1425 in combination with azacitidine in a cohort of approximately 25 newly diagnosed AML patients who are not suitable candidates for standard chemotherapy and who are biomarker-negative. 
 8


At ASH 2018, we reported initial data from these cohorts of the Phase 2 trial as of an October 29, 2018 data cut-off, and we continue to enroll and follow patients in these cohorts. As of the data cut-off, 11 biomarker-positive and eight biomarker-negative patients had been enrolled in the trial. Of the biomarker-positive patients, ten were evaluable for safety and eight were also evaluable for clinical responses. Of the biomarker-negative patients, seven were evaluable for safety and six were also evaluable for clinical responses. The median age of the biomarker-positive patients was 78, with more than half of the patients in both cohorts having poor risk cytogenetics. The data presentation at ASH 2018 included the following:
  
• | SY-1425 in combination with azacitidine was generally well-tolerated with no evidence of increased toxicities;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Adverse events, or AEs, were consistent with what has previously been seen with SY-1425 or azacitidine when administered as single agents in patients with AML. Across all grades and causalities, the most commonly reported AEs were decreased appetite (41%), fatigue (35%) and hypertriglyceridemia (35%). The most commonly reported grade 3 or higher AEs of all causality were febrile neutropenia (24%), thrombocytopenia (24%), neutropenia (12%) and fatigue (12%); and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The aggregate rate of complete response and complete response with incomplete blood count recovery, as defined by IWG criteria, was 50% in the biomarker-positive cohort. The overall response rate using IWG criteria was 63%, consisting of three CRs, including one molecular CR, one CRi, and one morphologic leukemia-free state, or MLFS. The duration of these IWG responses ranged from 29 to 337 days, with four of the five responding patients remaining on treatment as of the data cutoff. Most of the initial responses were seen at the end of the first treatment cycle.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In the reported literature, single-agent azacitidine has shown response rates of 18-29% in newly-diagnosed AML patients who are not suitable candidates for chemotherapy, with initial responses generally occurring after four cycles of treatment in most patients who respond. 
 We also reported at ASH 2018 that, in the cohort of biomarker-negative patients, the overall response rate was 17%, with one of the six response evaluable patients achieving a cytogenic CR. While data from this cohort are less mature (because enrollment in this cohort started later than the biomarker-positive cohort), we believe that the difference in the observed overall response rates as of the cut-off date supports the potential predictive value of the RARA and IRF8 biomarkers for identifying patients most likely to respond to SY-1425.
 We continue to enroll and follow patients in these cohorts of the trial to further characterize the safety and clinical activity of the combination of SY-1425 and azacitidine, and we expect to complete enrollment in the biomarker-positive cohort of the Phase 2 clinical trial in mid-2019. We also expect to report updated clinical data in the second half of 2019. We plan to expand this trial in the third quarter of 2019 to include an assessment of the safety and efficacy of SY-1425 in combination with azacitidine in approximately 25 biomarker-positive patients with relapsed or refractory AML, and expect to report initial data on these patients in 2020.
 In October 2018, we published preclinical data in Haematologica, a peer-reviewed journal of the European Hematology Association, demonstrating the mechanistic rationale for combining SY-1425 with hypomethylating agents such as azacitidine in AML with high RARA expression. These data showed that SY-1425 in combination with azacitidine resulted in synergistic anti-proliferative effects supported by evidence of DNA damage and apoptosis and, in patient-derived xenograft models of AML with high RARA expression, SY-1425 in combination with azacitidine showed both greater clearance of tumor cells in bone marrow and other tissues and greater duration of response, compared to either azacitidine or SY-1425 alone.
 SY-1425 in Combination with Daratumumab
 We also reported data at ASH 2018 from a pilot cohort of our Phase 2 clinical trial of SY-1425 evaluating the safety and efficacy of SY-1425 in combination with daratumumab, an anti-CD38 antibody approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma, in biomarker-positive patients with relapsed or refractory AML or higher-risk MDS. While CD38 is normally expressed at high levels on multiple myeloma cells, AML cells have low CD38 expression. In preclinical studies, we showed that SY-1425 induced CD38 expression in AML cells, sensitizing them to treatment with daratumumab. Patients in this cohort of the trial were treated with SY-1425 as a single agent for seven days, after which daratumumab was added and administered weekly at 16 mg/kg intravenously for eight doses, then biweekly for eight doses and every four weeks thereafter. The primary endpoint for this cohort of the trial was overall response rate, as determined by IWG criteria. Secondary endpoints included duration of response, hematologic improvement and CD38 induction, as well as safety and tolerability.
 9


As of an October 29, 2018 data cut-off, nine patients had been enrolled in this cohort of the trial, all of them were evaluable for safety and CD38 induction, and six of them were also evaluable for clinical responses. The median age of these patients was 68, with more than half having poor risk cytogenetics. The data presentation at ASH 2018 included the following:
  
• | SY-1425 in combination with daratumumab was generally well-tolerated with no evidence of increased toxicities;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | AEs were consistent with what has previously been seen with SY-1425 when administered as a single agent in AML and MDS patients or with daratumumab administered as a single agent in multiple myeloma patients;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Across all grades and causalities, the most commonly reported AEs were febrile neutropenia (67%), anemia (44%), nausea (44%), vomiting (44%) and infusion-related reaction (44%). The most commonly reported grade 3 or higher AEs of all causality were febrile neutropenia (67%) and anemia (44%); and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Eight of the nine (89%) patients had increased CD38 expression in myeloid blast cells, with a median 1.57-fold induction after seven days of treatment with SY-1425 as measured by mean fluorescence intensity; however, CD38 expression increased to levels exceeding those of a multiple myeloma cell line control in only two of those patients. Of those patients, one had an MLFS response and the other progressed without a clinical response.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In January 2019, we reported that we made a portfolio prioritization decision not to pursue further development of SY-1425 in combination with daratumumab beyond completion of this pilot cohort, which is closed to further enrollment.
 SY-1425 as a Single Agent
 At the American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting held in December 2017, or ASH 2017, we presented clinical data from cohorts of our Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating SY-1425 as a single agent in 29 patients with relapsed or refractory AML or relapsed higher-risk MDS, and in 29 patients with lower-risk transfusion-dependent MDS. In these cohorts of the trial, we observed that chronic daily dosing of SY-1425 administered at 6 mg/m2 orally divided in two doses was generally well-tolerated, with a median treatment duration of 80 days and patients treated up to eight months and remaining on study. The majority of adverse events observed in the trial were low grade. At the time of the data cut-off for presenting data at ASH 2017, 48 patients were evaluable for response assessment, including 23 patients in the relapsed or refractory AML or relapsed higher-risk MDS cohort and 25 patients in the lower-risk transfusion-dependent MDS cohort. Myeloid differentiation was observed in the bone marrow, consistent with the underlying mechanism of action. Clinical activity was observed in ten of 23 (43%) evaluable patients with relapsed or refractory AML and higher-risk MDS, and two of the 25 (8%) evaluable lower-risk MDS patients. We are no longer evaluating SY-1425 as a single agent in patients with AML or MDS, but believe that these data support the ongoing development of SY-1425 as a combination agent. 
 Prior Clinical Data in APL
 Tamibarotene, the active pharmaceutical ingredient of SY‑1425, is approved and marketed in Japan under the brand name Amnolake® for treatment of acute recurrent or intractable APL. Given the demonstrated efficacy of the drug in acute recurrent or intractable APL, we have the opportunity to evaluate SY‑1425 for treatment of APL in North America and Europe, but we do not have any current plans to do so. Extensive clinical work had been conducted on tamibarotene prior to us in‑licensing it from TMRC. The effectiveness of tamibarotene has been evaluated in patients with APL, including for relapsed patients and as maintenance therapy for newly diagnosed patients.
  
• | In a Phase 2 clinical trial of tamibarotene as a single agent in patients who relapsed following treatment with all-trans retinoic acid, or ATRA, 58% achieved a complete response. The majority of these patients went on to receive a bone marrow transplant or chemotherapy after treatment with tamibarotene and maintained a complete response for at least 14 months.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In a Phase 3 clinical trial comparing tamibarotene as an add‑on therapy to arsenic trioxide, or ATO, a standard of care treatment for APL, versus ATRA as an add‑on therapy to ATO in relapsed patients, patients in the tamibarotene‑treated group demonstrated:
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | An overall complete response rate of 80%, compared to 54% in the ATRA‑treated group (p=0.022); and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A complete molecular remission rate of 23%, compared to 3% in the ATRA‑treated group (p=0.0275). Complete molecular remission is achieved when there is no evidence of disease in the patient’s blood cells as detected by DNA‑based tests.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In a different Phase 3 clinical trial comparing tamibarotene to ATRA as maintenance therapy in newly diagnosed APL patients, the seven‑year relapse‑free survival rate in high‑risk patients treated with tamibarotene was 89%, compared to 62% in high‑risk patients treated with ATRA (p=0.034). In all patients, the seven-year relapse-free survival rate was 93% in the tamibarotene arm and was 84% in the ATRA arm (p=0.031).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In all these studies, tamibarotene was generally well tolerated. Adverse effects included mild or moderate dry skin, skin rash, headache and bone pain, as well as retinoic acid syndrome and elevated levels of cholesterol, lipids, liver function enzymes and white blood cells, which were severe in certain cases. One such adverse effect, retinoic acid syndrome, is referenced on the drug’s label and was infrequently observed clinically. Retinoic acid syndrome is a side effect associated with retinoids and ATO and can be mitigated by regular monitoring of clinical parameters, including white blood cell counts. A summary of four published clinical studies of tamibarotene use in APL is provided below.

SY‑1425 Market Opportunity
 We believe that SY‑1425 has the potential to address significant unmet medical need across a range of blood cancers and solid tumors and, despite a significant number of new product approvals in AML during 2018, that there continues to be a significant unmet medical need in that indication.
 We believe that approximately 40,000 patients are diagnosed with AML or higher-risk MDS each year in the United States and the five largest European countries (France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom) and estimate that sales of biopharmaceutical products for use in those indications in those countries will exceed $1 billion in 2019. At ESH 2017, we presented data from 201 evaluable patients screened in our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial demonstrating that approximately 40% of patients were positive for either the RARA or IRF8 biomarker, or both, and that approximately one-third of the relapsed or refractory AML and higher-risk MDS patients tested were biomarker positive. 
 It is estimated that more than half of newly diagnosed AML patients are elderly or unfit for treatment with intensive therapies, leaving this group with limited treatment options and an average survival of less than one year. Despite initial responses to therapy in select patients, the majority of AML patients relapse or become refractory to current treatment options. There are an estimated 20,000 cases of relapsed or refractory AML each year in the United States and the five largest European countries. In the absence of adequate therapies, these relapsed or refractory patients may be put into clinical trials for new and emerging therapies, and average survival of these patients is estimated to be less than six months.
 There have been no new drug approvals for higher-risk MDS since 2006. Based on current treatment guidelines, a majority of higher-risk MDS patients receive hypomethylating agents upon diagnosis, but those treatments are believed to have modest efficacy, with an estimated survival of less than 1.6 years for higher-risk, newly-diagnosed patients and less than six months for patients who have relapsed or become refractory to front-line treatment.
 There are an estimated 2,500 new APL cases diagnosed in the United States, Canada and the five largest European countries each year. Despite advances in treating APL, approximately 20-30% of APL patients relapse and require salvage therapy.

SY‑1365
 Overview
 SY‑1365 is a highly potent and selective, covalent small molecule CDK7 inhibitor. CDK7, a member of the cyclin‑dependent kinase, or CDK, family, is a transcriptional kinase that plays a central role in the two processes that cancer cells use to survive and thrive: increased expression of cancer-promoting genes, and uncontrolled cell cycle progression. CDK7 activity has been implicated in various solid tumors with transcriptional dependencies. We believe that inhibiting CDK7 preferentially lowers the expression of disease‑driving transcription factors and anti-apoptotic proteins, resulting in the preferential killing of cancer cells over non‑cancerous cells. We also believe that selective inhibition of CDK7 interferes with cancer-driving adaptations at multiple points in the cell cycle, promoting the induction of apoptosis, or cell death. Using our platform, we have generated several potent and selective small molecule CDK7 inhibitors, including SY‑1365. 
 SY-1365 is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with advanced solid tumors, including multiple ovarian and breast cancer populations as a single agent and in combination with standard-of-care therapies. We believe that SY-1365 is the most advanced selective CDK7 inhibitor in clinical development. SY-1365, alone and in combination with other therapeutic agents, has shown significant anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic activity in multiple in vitro and in vivo models of difficult-to-treat solid tumors, including ovarian and breast cancers, and has induced anti-tumor activity in both cell line-derived xenograft, and patient-derived xenograft, or PDX, models, including tumor regressions at a dose and schedule consistent with that being evaluated in our Phase 1 clinical trial. SY-1365 has also shown anti-tumor activity in models of blood cancers such as acute leukemias, as evidenced by in vitro cell death or complete tumor growth inhibition in cell-derived xenografts. 
 SY‑1365 Clinical Development Plan
 In April 2017, the FDA accepted our IND application to advance SY-1365 into a Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with advanced solid tumors. This trial began enrolling patients in the second quarter of 2017. The trial is testing the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of SY-1365 with the goal of establishing a maximum tolerated dose and a recommended Phase 2 dose and schedule. Additional study objectives include assessing pharmacodynamic changes and early signs of biological activity using biomarkers and clinical efficacy as measured by response rate using radiographic measures. Pharmacodynamic assays used to establish proof-of-mechanism include a CDK7 occupancy assay to evaluate SY-1365 binding and a custom gene expression assay to evaluate downstream transcriptional changes in patients.
 In November 2018, we reported data as of October 15, 2018 from the dose-escalation portion of the Phase 1 clinical trial of SY-1365. Enrollment in the dose-escalation portion of the trial was completed in September 2018. In total, 32 patients were treated with SY-1365 as a single agent at doses ranging from 2 mg/m2 to 112 mg/m2 using either a weekly or twice weekly dosing regimen. Patients were treated for three weeks out of each four-week cycle. Patients had a range of solid tumors, with the most prevalent being ovarian cancer (eight patients), breast cancer (eight patients) and endometrial cancer (five patients). Patients’ median age was 63 (ranging from 25 to 87), with a median of five prior therapies (ranging from one to 13). As of the data cut-off, the median treatment duration was 46.5 days (ranging from two to 147 days) and four patients remained on treatment. The data presented at ENA 2018 included the following:

• | AEs were predominantly low-grade, reversible and generally manageable, with the most commonly reported AEs being headache, nausea, vomiting and fatigue. No neutropenia was reported. Dose limiting toxicities were headache, coronary vasospasm and fatigue, and a maximum tolerated dose was not defined;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Plasma pharmacokinetic exposures were linear over the doses tested and no drug accumulation was observed with repeat dosing;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | SY-1365 demonstrated dose-dependent effects on CDK7 occupancy and downstream gene expression changes in blood cells. At doses of 32 mg/m2 and higher, CDK7 occupancy was greater than 50% when measured three days following dose administration, exceeding target occupancy levels in preclinical models that correlated with anti-tumor activity. CDK7 occupancy in blood cells was similar to target occupancy in tumor tissue biopsies available from two patients in the clinical trial; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Clinical activity measured using RECIST criteria was observed in seven of the 19 patients (37%) who were evaluable for clinical responses, including (i) one patient with recurrent ovarian clear cell cancer in her fourth relapse who had a confirmed partial response, or PR, of an approximately 32% reduction in target lesions, after two cycles of treatment at the 80 mg/m2 twice weekly dose, who remained in PR with a 49% decrease in target lesions after her sixth cycle of treatment, and (ii) six additional patients who had stable disease lasting between 50 and 127 days, most of whom received doses greater than or equal to 32 mg/m2.

Based on these data, we initiated the expansion portion of the Phase 1 clinical trial in September 2018. In this portion of the trial, we are further evaluating the safety and anti-tumor activity of SY-1365 in multiple ovarian and breast cancer populations based on supporting preclinical data, mechanistic rationale, and unmet medical need. The expansion cohorts began enrolling patients at 53 and 80 mg/m2 doses, and we are exploring once and twice weekly treatment regimens. The high-grade serous ovarian cancer populations being evaluated include: (i) a 24-patient cohort evaluating SY-1365 as a single agent in patients who have relapsed after three or more prior therapies and (ii) a 24-patient cohort evaluating SY-1365 in combination with carboplatin in patients who relapsed after one or more prior therapies but who may still benefit from additional platinum-based treatment. Based on the response observed in the dose-escalation portion of the trial, we expect that a new 12-patient pilot cohort evaluating SY-1365 as a single agent in patients with recurrent ovarian clear cell cancer will be open for enrollment in the second quarter of 2019. We have stopped enrollment in a previously announced pilot cohort evaluating SY-1365 in patients with primary platinum-refractory ovarian cancer due to the recent approval of a new therapy in this indication that we believe will result in fewer patients meeting the strict clinical definition of “primary platinum refractory.” 
 We are also evaluating SY-1365 in combination with fulvestrant in approximately 12 patients with HR+, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer who have previously been treated with a CDK4/6 inhibitor plus an aromatase inhibitor. In addition, we are evaluating the mechanism of action of SY-1365 as a single agent in approximately 30 patients with any solid tumor accessible for biopsy. 
 We plan to report initial clinical data from the expansion portion of our Phase 1 clinical trial in the fourth quarter of 2019. We expect these data to include initial safety assessments from the cohort evaluating SY-1365 in combination with carboplatin, as well as initial safety and efficacy assessments from the cohort evaluating SY-1365 in patients who have relapsed after three or more prior therapies and in patients with any solid tumor accessible for biopsy. We expect to report data from the other cohorts of the trial, including the ovarian clear cell cancer cohort, in 2020. 
 We are seeking opportunities to develop SY-1365 in patient populations where we believe there is the potential for efficient or accelerated development. We believe that the data to be generated in the cohorts of the SY-1365 clinical trial in ovarian cancer patients who have relapsed after three or more prior therapies, and in patients recurrent ovarian clear cell cancer, if positive, could support a decision to move into a registration-enabling clinical trial. 
 Our Preclinical Data
 Our clinical development program for SY-1365 is based on a robust preclinical development program showing significant anti-proliferative activity of SY-1365 in multiple in vitro and in vivo models of difficult-to-treat solid tumors and blood cancers, including ovarian cancer, breast cancer and AML. 
 For example, we, together with our collaborators at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, or DFCI, reported data at the American Association for Cancer Research Annual Meeting in April 2018 showing potent anti-tumor activity of SY-1365 in multiple models of heavily pretreated ovarian cancer, including models developed from patients treated with multiple prior therapies. These data showed that:

• | SY-1365 induced cell death in numerous ovarian cancer cell lines and inhibited tumor growth in ten of the 17 ovarian PDX models studied, including complete regressions. Notably, these responses were observed irrespective of BRCA gene mutation status or sensitivity to a poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase, or PARP, inhibitor;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | SY-1365 lowered expression of MCL-1, a gene in the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway that is known to inhibit cell death; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | sensitivity to SY-1365 was associated with low expression of BCLXL, a known apoptosis inhibitor, and RB1, a known tumor suppressor, pointing to potential biomarkers that may be predictive of response to SY-1365.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We also presented preclinical data at ENA 2018 that we believe provides a strong mechanistic rationale for the ongoing clinical investigation of SY-1365 in combination with carboplatin in ovarian cancer patients. Homologous recombination deficiency, or HRD, a cellular defect caused by the disruption of normal DNA damage repair processes, sensitizes cells to treatment with DNA repair inhibitors, including PARP inhibitors and DNA-damaging agents such as carboplatin. In preclinical models of ovarian cancer, SY-1365 was shown to inhibit DNA repair and decrease the expression of homologous combination repair genes, which are believed to be important for repairing harmful breaks in DNA. These data suggest that SY-1365 induces an HRD-like state, which may result in enhanced sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents and DNA repair inhibitors.

At the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium held in December 2018, our collaborators at DFCI presented preclinical data showing that SY-1365 inhibits tumor growth in HR+ breast cancer cell lines and that it has synergistic activity in combination with fulvestrant in these treatment-resistant cells. We and our academic collaborators had previously demonstrated that SY-1365:
  
• | could inhibit many HR+ cancer cells, including those with a form of acquired resistance to aromatase inhibitors;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | was able to inhibit breast cancer cell lines in vitro that no longer respond to inhibitors of CDK4/6; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | showed a combination effect with fulvestrant in an in vivo model of HR+ breast cancer.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe that these data, taken together, provide a mechanistic rationale for evaluating SY-1365 in combination with fulvestrant in patients with HR+ metastatic breast cancer who have previously been treated with a CDK4/6 inhibitor plus an aromatase inhibitor.
 We also believe that SY-1365 has potential in blood cancers as well as in other solid tumor malignancies. The preclinical rationale for potential development of SY-1365 in blood cancers includes data we presented at ASH 2017 demonstrating that SY-1365:
  
• | inhibited proliferation in vitro in leukemia and lymphoma cells, as well as leukemia cells from primary patient cultures;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | induced cell death in the majority of AML, leukemia and lymphoma cell lines tested; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | inhibited tumor growth, including inducing tumor regression, using bi-weekly dosing in preclinical mouse models of AML.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, we demonstrated that SY-1365 synergized with venetoclax, a product recently approved for the treatment of AML, in AML cell lines in vitro, and that the administration of SY-1365 plus venetoclax in an in vivo model resulted in greater tumor growth inhibition than either agent alone. 
 SY‑1365 Market Opportunity
 With SY‑1365, we believe we have the opportunity to address significant unmet medical needs across a range of cancers. The initial disease-specific focus of our clinical development program for SY‑1365 is expected to be in ovarian cancer and HR+ breast cancer. We estimate that sales of biopharmaceutical products targeting ovarian cancer and HR+ breast cancer will exceed $8 billion in 2019.
 Ovarian cancer is the fifth most common cause of cancer death in women. There are an estimated 60,000 ovarian cancer diagnoses each year in what we refer to as the developed pharmaceutical markets – the United States, Canada, Japan and the five largest European countries by population. Of these, approximately 70% have high-grade serous ovarian cancer and present with advanced disease at initial diagnosis. The standard of care treatment for these patients is platinum-based chemotherapy. Approximately 30% of these patients are “platinum-resistant” after initial therapy, which means that they progress within six months of responding to platinum-based treatment. We believe that subsequent treatment options for these patients at the present time have limited activity and significant toxicities. Approximately 60% of these patients are “platinum-sensitive,” which means that they initially respond to platinum-based treatment, but progress after six months or more. The majority of these patients relapse within three to five years. The expansion cohorts of our Phase 1 clinical trial of SY-1365 include patients who have progressed after platinum-based treatments. Approximately 10% of ovarian cancer diagnoses in North America have a clear cell histology. Unlike serous tumors, ovarian clear cell cancer is believed to be relatively resistant to chemotherapy, with only an estimated 15% to 30% responding to chemotherapy. Recurrent ovarian clear cell cancer has a response rate of approximately 10% and estimated rates of progression-free survival of less than four months.
 Breast cancer is the most common tumor type in women and is the leading cause of cancer death in women worldwide. According to the American Cancer Society, approximately 269,000 new breast cancer cases will be diagnosed in the United States in 2019, with approximately 42,000 deaths from the disease. Approximately 80% of breast cancers express estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, or both. Hormone-based therapies are the cornerstone for these HR+ cancers. It is estimated that there are approximately 58,000 patients with HR+ metastatic breast cancer in the developed pharmaceutical markets. In metastatic breast cancer, aromatase inhibitors, or AIs, are frequently used as a first-line treatment option. Recent approvals of a class of drugs that inhibit CDK4/6, such as palbociclib, ribociclib and abemaciclib, have resulted in their use in combination with AIs for the treatment of HR+, HER2-negative, breast cancers. Patients who relapse following treatment with an AI in combination with a CDK4/6 inhibitor currently have few effective and tolerable treatment options

SY-5609
 Based on our belief in the broad potential of CDK7 inhibition, we generated a suite of highly selective and potent, orally available CDK7 inhibitors. We presented preclinical data on these inhibitors at ENA 2018 showing that a representative oral CDK7 inhibitor generated by us:
  
• | exhibited 200- to 1,200-fold greater selectivity for CDK7 over other members of the CDK family, including CDK2, CDK9 and CDK12;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | showed anti-proliferative activity in triple-negative breast cancer and ovarian cancer cell lines, which was associated with the induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | showed correlation between biochemical potency, CDK7 target engagement and tumor growth inhibition; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | demonstrated substantial anti-tumor effects in multiple cell lines and PDX models of triple-negative breast and ovarian cancers, including a complete regression in a breast cancer model.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 These data supported the selection of SY-5609 as a development candidate for entry into IND-enabling preclinical studies. We expect to complete these studies during 2019 in order to support potential initiation of a Phase 1 clinical trial of SY-5609 in oncology patients in early 2020.
 Other Programs
 We currently have several other programs in our preclinical and discovery pipeline, including a CDK12/13 inhibitor program, a program directed to inhibitors of a macrophage target in immuno-oncology, and discovery programs related to a gene control target to treat sickle cell disease and in the field of cancer. 
 We are also using our platform to analyze gene expression programs in tumors and immune cells across various cancers and monogenic diseases to identify optimal points of therapeutic intervention in specific subsets of patients and to create a pipeline of novel product candidates targeting transcriptional and regulatory proteins. We are also using our platform in collaboration with third parties to identify and validate targets in diseases beyond our current areas of focus. To this end, we entered a target discovery, research collaboration and option agreement with Incyte in January 2018 under which we are using our platform to identify novel therapeutic targets with a focus on myeloproliferative neoplasms. See “—License and Collaboration Agreements–Incyte Corporation” below.
 Research and Development Expense
 During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, our research and development expenses were $50.2 million, $41.9 million and $37.8 million, respectively. For additional information regarding our research and development expense as well as our revenues, operating loss, and total assets, see the sections of this report entitled, “Financial Statements” in Part II, Item 8 and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7.
Intellectual Property
 We file patent applications directed to various compositions of matter, formulations and methods related to our product candidates and compounds in earlier stages of development, methods related to our gene control platform, and other commercially relevant inventions. As of December 31, 2018, we own five issued U.S. patents and 15 pending U.S. patent applications. Sixty-four corresponding applications are pending or granted in various jurisdictions outside the United States, including Europe, Japan, Australia, Canada and China, and we own nine applications that are pending in accordance with the Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT. In addition, as of December 31, 2018, we have exclusively licensed 11 issued U.S. patents and three pending U.S. utility applications. Nineteen corresponding applications are pending or granted in various jurisdictions outside the United States, including Europe, Japan, Australia, Canada and China. A significant portion of the patents and applications we own or license pertain to our product candidates that are in clinical or pre-clinical development, to methods of using them in the treatment of disease, and to methods of selecting patients for treatment based on biomarker expression.
 Our intellectual property portfolio as of December 31, 2018 is further described below. For some of our pending patent applications, prosecution has yet to commence. Prosecuting patent applications to allowance is often a lengthy process, during which the scope of the claims initially submitted for examination by various patent offices is often significantly narrowed, and some claims may never be granted. It is possible that we will amend the claims of our pending patent applications to limit their scope. We may also elect to abandon some of our pending patent applications, particularly those pending outside of the United States, if we determine these applications do not have strategic significance to our programs or platform.
 15


SY‑1425
 The patent portfolio we own for SY‑1425 contains three issued U.S. patents, three pending U.S. patent applications, 22 applications pending or granted in countries other than the United States, including Europe, Japan, Australia, Canada and China, and two pending patent applications filed in accordance with the PCT. Generally, these patents and applications disclose methods of identifying and treating patients who are sensitive to RARα agonists, including SY-1425, based on the expression of certain biomarkers, including RARA and IRF8. The applications disclose methods of treating selected patients with SY-1425 alone or with a combination of SY-1425 and a second agent, such as azacitidine or daratumumab. One of our issued patents, U.S. Patent No. 9,845,508, covers methods of diagnosing and treating human patients suffering from non-APL AML by administering SY-1425; the patients are diagnosed based on the level of RARA messenger RNA, or mRNA, previously determined to be present in a sample of diseased cells from the subject. The granted claims of the second patent, U.S. Patent No. 10,167,518, cover methods of treating human subjects suffering from MDS. The diagnosis is again based on the level of RARA mRNA expression, and the subjects are treated with SY-1425. The third patent, U.S. Patent No. 9,868,994, covers methods of treating non-APL AML or MDS by administering SY-1425 to a patient when a defined sample obtained from the patient is determined to have an elevated level of IRF8 mRNA or elevated levels of both IRF8 and RARA mRNA. We believe these three U.S. patents are eligible for listing in the FDA’s “Orange Book.” These patents, as well as any additional patents that may grant from applications claiming the benefit of the same filing date as the currently granted patents, have statutory expiration dates no earlier than March 2036. Patent term extensions could result in later expiration dates.
 In addition, we have an exclusive license from TMRC to practice the inventions claimed in two U.S. patents and five corresponding patents granted in Canada and Europe. The claims of the U.S. patents are directed to a tamibarotene capsule preparation, to a crystal form of tamibarotene, medicaments comprising that form, and methods of making it. The U.S. patent covering capsule preparations has a statutory expiration date in April 2028, and the U.S. patent related to the crystalline form has a statutory expiration date in August 2021. We do not have composition of matter patent protection with respect to SY-1425.
 SY‑1365 and SY-5609
 The patent portfolio we own for SY‑1365, SY-5609 and our other CDK7 inhibitors contains patents and patent applications generally directed to the inhibitors, pharmaceutical formulations containing them, and methods of making and using them, including their use in treating various biomarker-selected patient populations. As of December 31, 2018, we own two issued U.S. patents, five pending U.S. patent applications, 35 corresponding applications pending or granted in countries outside the United States, including Europe, Japan, Australia, Canada and China, and four pending applications filed in accordance with the PCT. We are also exclusively licensed to practice under two U.S. patents, and two corresponding applications remain pending in the United States. In addition, our license encompasses 11 pending applications in a number of other jurisdictions, including Europe, Japan, Australia and Canada, directed to this program. Any patent that has issued or will issue and that claims the benefit of the priority date of one or more of these patents or patent applications will have a statutory expiration date ranging from October 2034 to November 2039. Patent term adjustments or patent term extensions could result in later expiration dates.
 Of the two issued U.S. patents that we own, U.S. Patent No. 10,106,526 covers compounds and pharmaceutical compositions generically describing SY-1365, and U.S. Patent No. 10,059,690 specifically claims SY-1365 and pharmaceutical compositions containing SY-1365. These patents have a statutory expiration date of April 2035, not including available patent term extensions. A patent covering SY-5609 and pharmaceutical compositions containing SY-5609, if granted, would have a statutory expiration date of November 2039, not including available patent term adjustments or patent term extensions.
 Other Programs
 The intellectual property portfolio that relates to programs other than those described above contains patents and patent applications directed to compositions of matter for inhibiting transcription factors and immuno-oncology targets in multiple compound families, and methods of treating various diseases, including cancer and immunological diseases, through inhibition of specific transcription factor(s) or gene products. As of December 31, 2018, we own five U.S. provisional patent applications and three U.S. patent applications and are exclusively licensed to two issued U.S. patents directed to our other programs. The licensed U.S. patents have statutory expiration dates of July 2032 and November 2033. Any U.S. or non‑U.S. patents issuing from the pending applications or applications claiming priority to the pending applications covering transcription factor inhibitors, immuno-oncology target inhibitors or methods of treating disease by inhibition of transcription factors or gene products will have statutory expiration dates ranging from February 2031 to December 2038.
 16


Platform
 The patent portfolio directed to our platform includes patent applications and patents directed to super‑enhancers and their detection and uses thereof to detect novel disease targets. As of December 31, 2018, we own one pending U.S. patent application and one pending patent application in Europe directed to these technologies which, if issued, will have a statutory expiration date of March 2034. In addition, we have an exclusive license to one issued U.S. patent, one U.S. pending patent application and one pending patent application in Europe, directed to these technologies. The U.S. and foreign patent applications that we own are directed to the identification of new super‑enhancer components and methods of treating diseases by targeting those novel components, and if issued, will have a statutory expiration date no earlier than March 2034. The licensed U.S. patent has a statutory expiration date of October 2033 and the licensed pending applications directed to super‑enhancers and their detection and uses thereof to detect novel disease targets, if issued, will have a statutory expiration date no earlier than October 2033. 
 In most countries, including the United States, a patent expires 20 years from its earliest effective filing date. In the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened to compensate for delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, in examining and granting a patent or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier filed patent. A patent that covers a therapeutic agent may also be eligible for patent term extension when FDA approval is granted, provided statutory and regulatory requirements are met. See “—Government Regulation and Product Approvals—Marketing Authorization” below for additional information on such exclusivity. If and when our products receive approval by the FDA or regulatory agencies in other countries, we expect to apply for a patent term extension on an issued patent covering a given product, depending upon the length of the clinical trials for each product and other factors. There can be no assurance that any of our pending patent applications will issue or that we will benefit from any patent term extension or favorable adjustment to the terms of any of our patents.
 As with other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, our ability to exclude others from making, using, or selling our product candidates and other inventions will depend on our success in obtaining valid patent claims and enforcing those claims. One or more of our pending patent applications, and any that we may file or license from third parties in the future may not, however, proceed to grant as an issued patent. We also cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents. Any patent may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. For example, we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by pending third‑party patent applications. If third parties prepare and file patent applications in the United States that also claim technology or therapeutics to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference proceedings in the USPTO to determine priority of invention, which could result in substantial costs to us, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us, which is highly unpredictable. In addition, because of the extensive time required for clinical development and regulatory review of a product candidate we may develop, it is possible that, before any of our product candidates can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby limiting protection such patent would afford the respective product and any competitive advantage such patent may provide.
 In addition to patents and pending patent applications, we rely upon unpatentable know‑how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, by executing non‑competition, non‑solicitation, confidentiality, and invention assignment agreements with our employees, collaborators, scientific advisors and consultants as appropriate. The confidentiality agreements we enter into are designed to protect our proprietary information and the agreements or clauses requiring assignment of inventions to us are designed to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through our relationship with the respective counterparty. We cannot guarantee, however, that these agreements will afford us adequate protection of our intellectual property and proprietary information rights.
 License and Collaboration Agreements
 We are a party to global target discovery collaboration with Incyte under which we intend to identify and validate novel therapeutic targets with a focus on myeloproliferative neoplasms. By entering into this collaboration, we aim to use our platform to benefit patients with diseases beyond our current areas of focus, although we do not have any rights to commercialize any products arising from this collaboration. These collaborations impose certain performance obligations on us. We may enter into agreements similar to this one in the future. 
 In addition, we are a party to a number of license agreements under which we license patents, patent applications and other intellectual property from third parties. We enter into these agreements to augment our proprietary intellectual property portfolio. The licensed intellectual property covers some of the compounds that we are researching and developing and some of the scientific processes that we use. These licenses impose various diligence and financial payment obligations on us. We expect to continue to enter into these types of license agreements in the future.

Incyte Corporation
 In January 2018, we entered into a target discovery, research collaboration and option agreement with Incyte. Under this agreement, we will use our gene control platform to identify novel therapeutic targets with a focus on myeloproliferative neoplasms, and Incyte has received options to obtain exclusive worldwide rights to intellectual property resulting from the collaboration for the development and commercialization of therapeutic products directed to up to seven validated targets. Incyte will have exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize any therapies under the collaboration that modulate those validated targets. 
 
Under the terms of the collaboration agreement, Incyte paid us $10.0 million in up-front consideration, consisting of $2.5 million in cash and $7.5 million in pre-paid research funding, or the pre-paid research amount. Our activities under this agreement are subject to a joint research plan and, subject to certain exceptions, Incyte is responsible for funding our activities under the research plan, including amounts in excess of the pre-paid research amount. Under the collaboration agreement, we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to conduct the research services over a period commencing on the effective date of the collaboration agreement and ending upon the completion of specified target validation activities.
 
We are eligible to receive target selection milestone payments and option exercise fees of up to an aggregate of $54.0 million if Incyte selects the maximum number of targets for validation and exercises its options to obtain exclusive rights to collaboration intellectual property for therapeutic products directed to all seven validated targets. Should any therapeutic product be developed by Incyte against a target as to which Incyte has exercised its option to obtain exclusive rights to collaboration intellectual property, we will be eligible to receive milestone payments and, if approved and commercialized, royalty payments from Incyte. For each of the seven validated targets, we would become eligible to receive from Incyte a total of up to $50.0 million in development and regulatory milestone payments. If products arising from the collaboration are approved, we would become eligible to receive from Incyte, for each validated target, a total of up to $65.0 million in commercial milestone payments. Upon approval and commercialization of any therapeutic product resulting from the collaboration, we would become eligible to receive low single-digit royalties on net sales of such product.
 
The term of the collaboration agreement with Incyte will, unless terminated by a party early, expire when all royalty obligations for products arising from the collaboration expire. The agreement may be terminated by Incyte for convenience on sixty (60) days’ prior written notice to us, or by us on thirty (30) days’ written notice in the event Incyte or one of its affiliates or sublicensees challenges the validity or enforceability of certain patent rights controlled by us. The agreement may also be terminated by either of the parties on thirty (30) days’ prior written notice in the event of an uncured material breach of the agreement by the other party or immediately in the case of certain bankruptcy events. If the collaboration agreement is terminated by Incyte for material breach, then we must refund any unexpended pre-paid research amount. Incyte’s right to terminate for convenience and each party’s right to terminate for uncured material breach may be exercised either with respect to the agreement in its entirety or, as applicable, in relation to the relevant validated target and associated therapeutic products.
 
In connection with the collaboration agreement, we sold 793,021 shares of our common stock to Incyte for an aggregate purchase price of $10.0 million in cash, or $12.61 per share, in a private placement. In addition, from the closing of this sale until the earlier of the second anniversary of such closing or the expiration or termination of the collaboration agreement, we have granted to Incyte the right to purchase up to its pro rata share of the securities offered in certain subsequent offerings of our common stock or common stock equivalents, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the stock purchase agreement. In February 2018, we sold 144,505 additional shares of our common stock to Incyte at a price of $9.55 per share, resulting in proceeds to us of $1.4 million.
 
TMRC
 
In September 2015 we entered into, and in April 2016 we amended and restated, a license agreement with TMRC, which we refer to as the TMRC license agreement, pursuant to which TMRC granted us an exclusive license, with the right to sublicense, under TMRC patent rights, data, regulatory filings and other intellectual property for the North American and European development and commercialization of SY‑1425 (tamibarotene) products for the treatment of human cancer indications. Under the TMRC license agreement, we have agreed to pay TMRC single‑digit royalties based on net sales if TMRC’s patents cover our product and low single‑digit royalties based on net sales with respect to know‑how licensed by TMRC during a predefined royalty term, and to make payments to TMRC upon meeting specified clinical and regulatory milestones in an aggregate amount of approximately $13.0 million per indication, of which $1.0 million was paid in the third quarter of 2016 upon successful dosing of the first patient in our Phase 2 clinical trial of SY-1425. Under the TMRC license agreement, we must use commercially reasonable efforts to, among other things, commence development activities within one year, to develop SY‑1425 in at least one cancer indication, and, following marketing approval, to market the product. The license agreement expires on the expiration of the subject patent rights or 15 years after the date of first commercial sale of product, whichever is later. The TMRC license agreement may be terminated by either party if the other party is in breach and the breach is not cured within a required amount of time or if the other party is in bankruptcy. If we have reason to do so, we may also terminate the agreement after one year from the original effective date at our sole discretion.
 18


In connection with the TMRC license agreement, in April 2016 we entered into a supply management agreement with TMRC. Pursuant to the supply management agreement, we and TMRC have agreed to establish a joint manufacturing committee to discuss strategy for supply of SY‑1425. In addition, we have agreed to pay TMRC a fee for each kilogram of SY‑1425 active pharmaceutical ingredient we procure for clinical trial or commercial use. The supply management agreement terminates on the expiration or termination of the TMRC license agreement, and our obligation to pay these fees survives the termination of the supply management agreement. In April 2016, we also entered into a standby license with TMRC and Toko Pharmaceuticals Ind. Co. Ltd., or Toko, the owner of the patent rights licensed to TMRC from which our license agreement with TMRC derives its rights, pursuant to which we obtain a standby license from Toko if Toko’s license with TMRC is terminated.
 Competition
 The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technology, development experience, and scientific knowledge provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.
 We compete in the segments of the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other related markets that address gene control and cancer. There are other companies working to develop therapies in the fields of gene control and cancer. These companies include divisions of large pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies of various sizes.
 The most common methods of treating patients with cancer are surgery, radiation and drug therapy, including chemotherapy, hormone therapy and targeted drug therapy. There are a variety of available drug therapies marketed for cancer. In many cases, these drugs are administered in combination to enhance efficacy. While our product candidates may compete with many existing drug and other therapies, they may also be used in combination with or as an adjunct to these therapies. Some of the currently approved drug therapies are branded and subject to patent protection, and others are available on a generic basis. Many of these approved drugs are well‑established therapies and are widely accepted by physicians, patients and third‑party payors. In general, although there has been considerable progress over the past few decades in the treatment of cancer and the currently marketed therapies provide benefits to many patients, these therapies all are limited to some extent in their efficacy and frequency of adverse events. As a result, the level of morbidity and mortality from cancer remains high.
 In addition to currently marketed therapies, there are also a number of medicines in late stage clinical development to treat cancer. These medicines in development may provide efficacy, safety, convenience and other benefits that are not provided by currently marketed therapies. As a result, they may provide significant competition for any of our product candidates for which we obtain market approval.
 Many of our competitors may have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved medicines than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.
 The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the effectiveness of companion diagnostics in guiding the use of related therapeutics, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third‑party payors.
 Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize medicines that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any medicines that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their medicines more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third‑party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic medicines. There are many generic medicines currently on the market for the indications that we are pursuing, and additional medicines are expected to become available on a generic basis over the coming years. If our therapeutic product candidates are approved, we expect that they will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic medicines.
 If the product candidates of our priority programs are approved for the indications for which we are currently planning clinical trials, they will compete with the drugs discussed below and will likely compete with other drugs currently in development.
 19


SY‑1425
 We plan to initially develop SY‑1425, our RARα agonist, for patients with AML. We intend to select patients for our clinical trials based on high‑levels of RARα as measured by our proprietary RARA and IRF8 biomarkers. We are aware of four new drugs approved by the FDA during 2018 for the treatment of AML or patient subsets within AML: ivosidenib, venetoclax, glasdegib and gilteritinib. SY-1425 may also face competition from other investigational products currently in clinical development for AML and MDS, including investigational products in late-stage development from Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited, Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Roche, Actinium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., GlycoMimetics Inc., Arog Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Rafael Pharmaceuticals, Inc., MEI Pharma Inc. and Celgene Corporation. We are not aware of any selective RARα agonist programs that are in active clinical development. 
 SY‑1365
 We are conducting a Phase 1 clinical trial of SY-1365 in patients with advanced solid tumors and have opened expansion cohorts in various ovarian and breast cancer populations as a single agent and in combination with standard-of-care therapies. We believe that SY‑1365 is the most advanced selective CDK7 inhibitor in clinical development. We are aware of an oral CDK7 inhibitor being developed by Carrick Therapeutics Ltd. that is in Phase 1/2 clinical development and of several other selective CDK7 inhibitor programs that we believe are in preclinical development, including programs from Aurigene Discovery Technologies Ltd., Ube Industries Ltd., Qurient Co. Ltd., and Beta Pharma, Inc. SY-1365 may face competition from these CDK7 inhibitors.
 Government Regulation and Product Approvals
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions such as the European Union, or EU, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, pricing, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of biopharmaceutical products. The processes for obtaining marketing approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
 Approval and Regulation of Drugs in the United States
 In the United States, drug products are regulated under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and applicable implementing regulations and guidance. The failure of an applicant to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements at any time during the product development process, including non-clinical testing, clinical testing, the approval process or post-approval process, may result in delays to the conduct of a study, regulatory review and approval and/or administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions may include, but are not limited to, the FDA’s refusal to allow an applicant to proceed with clinical trials, refusal to approve pending applications, license suspension or revocation, withdrawal of an approval, warning letters, adverse publicity, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines and civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA or Department of Justice, or DOJ, or other government entities, including state agencies.
 An applicant seeking approval to market and distribute a new drug in the United States generally must satisfactorily complete each of the following steps before the product candidate will be approved by the FDA:
  
• | preclinical testing including laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies, which must be performed in accordance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations and standards;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety, potency and purity of the product candidate for each proposed indication, in accordance with current good clinical practices, or GCP;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | preparation and submission to the FDA of a new drug application, or NDA, for a drug product which includes not only the results of the clinical trials, but also, detailed information on the chemistry, manufacture and quality controls for the product candidate and proposed labelling for one or more proposed indication(s);
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | review of the product candidate by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 20


 
• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities, including those of third parties, at which the product candidate or components thereof are manufactured to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of any FDA audits of the non-clinical and clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of clinical data in support of the NDA;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | payment of user fees and securing FDA approval of the NDA to allow marketing of the new drug product; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, and the potential requirement to conduct any post-approval studies required by the FDA.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preclinical Studies
 Before an applicant begins testing a product candidate with potential therapeutic value in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as other studies to evaluate, among other things, the toxicity of the product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests and formulation of the compounds for testing must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations and standards. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, and long-term toxicity studies, may continue after the IND is submitted.
 The IND and IRB Processes
 An IND is an exemption from the FDCA that allows an unapproved product candidate to be shipped in interstate commerce for use in an investigational clinical trial and a request for FDA authorization to administer such investigational product to humans. Such authorization must be secured prior to interstate shipment and administration of any product candidate that is not the subject of an approved NDA. In support of a request for an IND, applicants must submit a protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, must be submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. The FDA requires a 30-day waiting period after the filing of each IND before clinical trials may begin. This waiting period is designed to allow the FDA to review the IND to determine whether human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. At any time during this 30-day period, or thereafter, the FDA may raise concerns or questions about the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND and impose a clinical hold or partial clinical hold. In this case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can begin.
 Following commencement of a clinical trial under an IND, the FDA may also place a clinical hold or partial clinical hold on that trial. A clinical hold is an order issued by the FDA to the sponsor to delay a proposed clinical investigation or to suspend an ongoing investigation. A partial clinical hold is a delay or suspension of only part of the clinical work requested under the IND. For example, a specific protocol or part of a protocol is not allowed to proceed, while other protocols may do so. No more than 30 days after imposition of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, the FDA will provide the sponsor a written explanation of the basis for the hold. Following issuance of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, an investigation may only resume after the FDA has notified the sponsor that the investigation may proceed. The FDA will base that determination on information provided by the sponsor correcting the deficiencies previously cited or otherwise satisfying the FDA that the investigation can proceed.
 A sponsor may choose, but is not required, to conduct a foreign clinical study under an IND. When a foreign clinical study is conducted under an IND, all FDA IND requirements must be met unless waived. When a foreign clinical study is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor must ensure that the study complies with certain regulatory requirements of the FDA in order to use the study as support for an IND or application for marketing approval. Specifically, in April 2008, the FDA amended its regulations governing the acceptance of foreign clinical studies not conducted under an investigational new drug application as support for an IND or a new drug application. The final rule provides that such studies must 
be conducted in accordance with good clinical practice, or GCP, including review and approval by an independent ethics committee, or IEC, and informed consent from subjects. The GCP requirements in the final rule encompass both ethical and data integrity standards for clinical studies. The FDA’s regulations are intended to help ensure the protection of human subjects enrolled in non-IND foreign clinical studies, as well as the quality and integrity of the resulting data. They further help ensure that non-IND foreign studies are conducted in a manner comparable to that required for IND studies.
 21


In addition to the foregoing IND requirements, an IRB representing each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review and reapprove the study at least annually. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the study protocol and informed consent information to be provided to study subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. An IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 Additionally, some trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee, or DSMB. This group provides a recommendation as to whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access that only the group maintains to available data from the study. Suspension or termination of development during any phase of clinical trials can occur if it is determined that the participants or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Other reasons for suspension or termination may be made by us based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate.
 Information about clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on its ClinicalTrials.gov website.
 Human Clinical Trials in Support of an NDA
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product candidate to human subjects under the supervision of a qualified investigator in accordance with GCP requirements which include, among other things, the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under written clinical trial protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, inclusion and exclusion criteria, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. 
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined. Additional studies may also be required after approval.
 Phase 1 clinical trials are initially conducted in a limited population to test the product candidate for safety, including adverse effects, dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and pharmacodynamics in healthy humans or in patients. During Phase 1 clinical trials, information about the investigational drug product’s pharmacokinetics and pharmacological effects may be obtained to permit the design of well-controlled and scientifically valid Phase 2 clinical trials.
 Phase 2 clinical trials are generally conducted in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, evaluate the efficacy of the product candidate for specific targeted indications and determine dose tolerance and optimal dosage and dosage schedule. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more costly Phase 3 clinical trials. Phase 2 clinical trials are well controlled, closely monitored and conducted in a limited patient population.
 Phase 3 clinical trials proceed if the Phase 2 clinical trials demonstrate that a dose range of the product candidate is potentially effective and has an acceptable safety profile. Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken within an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and further test for safety in an expanded and diverse patient population at multiple, geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. A well-controlled, statistically robust Phase 3 clinical trial may be designed to deliver the data that regulatory authorities will use to decide whether or not to approve, and, if approved, how to appropriately label a drug: such Phase 3 studies are referred to as “pivotal.” 
 In some cases, the FDA may approve an NDA for a product candidate but require the sponsor to conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the product candidate’s safety and effectiveness after approval. Such post-approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of a larger number of patients in the intended treatment group and to further document a clinical benefit in the case of drugs approved under accelerated approval regulations. Failure to exhibit due diligence with regard to conducting Phase 4 clinical trials could result in withdrawal of approval for products.
 Progress reports detailing the status and a brief description of available results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA. In addition, IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA for any of the following: serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions; findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the product; and any clinically important increase in the case of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or completed at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. The FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of the clinical data submitted.
 22


Concurrent with clinical trials, companies often complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, purity, and potency of the final drug. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 Review and Approval of an NDA
 In order to obtain approval to market a drug product in the United States, a marketing application must be submitted to the FDA that provides sufficient data establishing the safety, purity and potency of the proposed drug product for its intended indication. The application includes all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety, purity and potency of the drug product to the satisfaction of the FDA.
 The NDA is a vehicle through which applicants formally propose that the FDA approve a new product for marketing and sale in the United States for one or more indications. Every new drug product candidate must be the subject of an approved NDA before it may be commercialized in the United States. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is subject to an application user fee, which for federal fiscal year 2019 is $2,588,478 for an application requiring clinical data. The sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to an annual program fee, which for fiscal year 2019 is $309,915. Certain exceptions and waivers are available for some of these fees, such as an exception from the application fee for products with orphan designation and a waiver for certain small businesses.
 Following submission of an NDA, the FDA conducts a preliminary review of the application generally within 60 calendar days of its receipt and strives to inform the sponsor by the 74th day after the FDA’s receipt of the submission whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept the application for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review process of NDAs. Under that agreement, 90% of applications seeking approval of New Molecular Entities, or NMEs, are meant to be reviewed within ten months from the date on which the FDA accepts the application for filing, and 90% of applications for NMEs that have been designated for “priority review” are meant to be reviewed within six months of the filing date. For applications seeking approval of products that are not NMEs, the ten-month and six-month review periods run from the date that the FDA receives the application. The review process and the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, goal date may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider new information or clarification provided by the applicant to address an outstanding deficiency identified by the FDA following the original submission.
 Before approving an application, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is or will be manufactured. These pre-approval inspections may cover all facilities associated with an NDA submission, including component manufacturing, finished product manufacturing and control testing laboratories. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Under the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017, the FDA must implement a protocol to expedite review of responses to inspection reports pertaining to certain applications, including applications for products in shortage or those for which approval is dependent on remediation of conditions identified in the inspection report. 
 In addition, as a condition of approval, the FDA may require an applicant to develop a REMS. REMS use risk minimization strategies beyond the professional labeling to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. To determine whether a REMS is needed, the FDA will consider the size of the population likely to use the product, seriousness of the disease, expected benefit of the product, expected duration of treatment, seriousness of known or potential adverse events and whether the product is a new molecular entity.
 The FDA may refer an application for a novel product to an advisory committee or explain why such referral was not made. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 23


Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy and Priority Review
 The FDA is authorized to designate certain products for expedited review if they are intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life
‑threatening disease or condition. These programs, as applicable to our business, are referred to as fast track 
designation, breakthrough therapy designation and priority review designation.
 Specifically, the FDA may designate a product for Fast Track review if it is intended, whether alone or in combination with one or more other products, for the treatment of a serious or life‑threatening disease or condition, and it demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. For Fast Track products, sponsors may have greater interactions with the FDA and the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track product’s application before the application is complete. This rolling review may be available if the FDA determines, after preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by the sponsor, that a Fast Track product may be effective. The sponsor must also provide, and the FDA must approve, a schedule for the submission of the remaining
 information and the sponsor must pay applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing a Fast Track application does not begin until the last section of the application is submitted. In addition, the Fast Track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
 Second, a product may be designated as a Breakthrough Therapy if it is intended, either alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life‑threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA may take certain actions with respect to Breakthrough Therapies, including holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process; providing timely advice to the product sponsor regarding development and approval; involving more senior staff in the review process; assigning a cross‑disciplinary project lead for the review team; and taking other steps to design the clinical trials in an efficient manner.
 Third, t
he FDA may designate a product for priority review if it is a product that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The FDA determines, on a case‑by‑case basis, whether the proposed product represents a significant improvement when compared with other available therapies. Significant improvement may be illustrated by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment‑limiting product reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes, and evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation. A priority designation is intended to direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of such applications, and to shorten the FDA’s goal for taking action on a marketing application from ten months to six months.
 Accelerated Approval Pathway
 The FDA may grant accelerated approval to a product for a serious or life‑threatening condition that provides meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments based upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA may also grant accelerated approval for such a condition when the product has an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Products granted accelerated approval must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted traditional approval.
 For the purposes of accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign or other measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit, but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. An intermediate clinical endpoint is a measurement of a therapeutic eff
ect that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a drug, such as an effect on IMM. The FDA has limited experience with accelerated approvals based on intermediate clinical endpoints, but has indicated that such endpoints generally may support accelerated approval where the therapeutic effect measured by the endpoint is not itself a clinical benefit and basis for traditional approval, if there is a basis for concluding that the therapeutic effect is reasonably likely to predict the ultimate clinical benefit of a product.
 The accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a product, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. Thus, accelerated approval has been used extensively in the development and approval of products for treatment of a variety of cancers in which the goal of therapy is generally to im
prove survival or decrease morbidity and the duration of the typical disease course requires lengthy and sometimes large trials to demonstrate a clinical or survival benefit. Thus, the benefit of accelerated approval derives from the potential to receive a
pproval based on surrogate endpoints sooner than possible for trials with clinical or survival endpoints, rather than deriving from any explicit shortening of the FDA approval timeline, as 
is the case with priority review.
 24


The accelerated approval pathway is usually contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional post‑approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the product’s clinical benefit. As a result, a product candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post‑marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post‑approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post‑approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post‑marketing studies, would allow the FDA to initiate expedited proceedings to withdraw approval of the product. All promotional materials for product candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA.
 The FDA’s Decision on an NDA
 On the basis of the FDA’s evaluation of the application and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
 If the FDA approves a new product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product. The agency may also require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, including REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for health care professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patent registries. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. After approval, many types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
 Post-Approval Regulation
 If regulatory approval for marketing of a product or new indication for an existing product is obtained, the sponsor will be required to comply with all regular post-approval regulatory requirements as well as any post-approval requirements that the FDA may have imposed as part of the approval process. The sponsor will be required to report, among other things, certain adverse reactions and manufacturing problems to the FDA, provide updated safety and efficacy information and comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling requirements. Manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMP regulations, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon manufacturers. Accordingly, the sponsor and its third-party manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP regulations and other regulatory requirements.
 A product may also be subject to official lot release, meaning that the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release, the manufacturer must submit samples of each lot, together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot, to the FDA. The FDA may in addition perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products before releasing the lots for distribution. Finally, the FDA will conduct laboratory research related to the safety, purity, potency and effectiveness of pharmaceutical products.
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 25


 
• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA strictly regulates the 
marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of prescription drug 
products placed on the market. This regulation includes, among other things, standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, communications regarding unapproved uses, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the Interne
t and social media. Promotional claims about a drug’s safety or effectiveness are prohibited before the drug is approved. After approval, a drug product generally may not be promoted for uses that are not 
approved by the FDA, as reflected in the product’s prescribing information. In the United States, health care professionals are generally permitted to prescribe drugs for such uses not described in the drug’s labeling, known as off-label uses, because the FDA does not regulate the practice of medicine. However, FDA regulations impose rigorous restrictions on manufacturers’ communications, 
prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. It may be permissible, under very specific, narrow conditions, for a manufacturer to engage in nonpromotional, non-misleading communication regarding off-label information, such as distributing scientific or medical journal information. 
 If a company is found to have promoted off-label uses, it may become subject to adverse public relations and administrative and judicial enforcement by the FDA, the DOJ, or the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as state authorities. This could subject a company to a range of penalties that could have a significant commercial impact, including civil and criminal fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes drug products. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion, and has also requested that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed.
 In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, and its implementing regulations, as well as the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, or DSCA, which regulate the distribution and tracing of prescription drug samples at the federal level, and set minimum standards for the regulation of distributors by the states. The PDMA, its implementing regulations and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples, and the DSCA imposes requirements to ensure accountability in distribution and to identify and remove counterfeit and other illegitimate products from the market.
 Pediatric Studies and Exclusivity
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, an NDA or supplement thereto must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. Sponsors must also submit pediatric study plans prior to the assessment data. Those plans must contain an outline of the proposed pediatric study or studies the applicant plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, any deferral or waiver requests and other information required by regulation. The applicant, the FDA, and the FDA’s internal review committee must then review the information submitted, consult with each other and agree upon a final plan. The FDA or the applicant may request an amendment to the plan at any time.
 For drugs intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, the FDA must, upon the request of an applicant, meet to discuss preparation of the initial pediatric study plan or to discuss deferral or waiver of pediatric assessments. In addition, FDA will meet early in the development process to discuss pediatric study plans with sponsors and FDA must meet with sponsors by no later than the end-of-phase 1 meeting for serious or life-threatening diseases and by no later than ninety (90) days after the FDA’s receipt of the study plan.
 The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. Additional requirements and procedures relating to deferral requests and requests for extension of deferrals are contained in the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan designation.
 The FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 established new requirements to govern certain molecularly targeted cancer indications. Any company that submits an NDA three years after the date of enactment of that statute must submit pediatric assessments with the NDA if the drug is intended for the treatment of an adult cancer and is directed at a molecular target that the FDA determines to be substantially relevant to the growth or progression of a pediatric cancer. The investigation must be designed to yield clinically meaningful pediatric study data regarding the dosing, safety and preliminary efficacy to inform pediatric labeling for the product.
 26


Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the non-patent and orphan exclusivity. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if an NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection cover the product are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve another application.
Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a drug product as an “orphan drug” if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition, generally meaning that it affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more in cases in which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a product available in the United States for treatment of the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. A company must seek orphan drug designation before submitting an NDA for the candidate product. If the request is granted, the FDA will disclose the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential use. Orphan drug designation does not shorten the PDUFA goal dates for the regulatory review and approval process, although it does convey certain advantages such as tax benefits and exemption from the PDUFA application fee.
 If a product with orphan designation receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation or for a select indication or use within the rare disease or condition for which it was designated, the product generally will receive orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity means that the FDA may not approve another sponsor’s marketing application for the same drug for the same condition for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances. Orphan exclusivity does not block the approval of a different product for the same rare disease or condition, nor does it block the approval of the same product for different conditions. If a drug designated as an orphan drug ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated in its orphan drug application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity. 
 Orphan drug exclusivity will not bar approval of another product under certain circumstances, including if a subsequent product with the same drug for the same condition is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care, or if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand. This is the case despite an earlier court opinion holding that the Orphan Drug Act unambiguously required the FDA to recognize orphan exclusivity regardless of a showing of clinical superiority.
 Section 505(b)(2) NDAs 
 NDAs for most new drug products are based on two full clinical studies that must contain substantial evidence of the safety and efficacy of the proposed new product for the proposed use. These applications are submitted under Section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA. The FDA is, however, authorized to approve an alternative type of NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. This type of application allows the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA’s previous findings of safety and efficacy for a similar product, or published literature. Specifically, Section 505(b)(2) applies to NDAs for a drug for which the investigations made to show whether or not the drug is safe for use and effective in use and relied upon by the applicant for approval of the application “were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted.” 
 Thus, Section 505(b)(2) authorizes the FDA to approve an NDA based on safety and effectiveness data that were not developed by the applicant. NDAs filed under Section 505(b)(2) may provide an alternate and potentially more expeditious pathway to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products. If the 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on the FDA’s previous approval is scientifically appropriate, the applicant may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical studies of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all or some of the label indications for which the referenced drug has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant. 
 27


Abbreviated New Drug Applications for Generic Drugs
In 1984, with passage of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the FDCA, Congress established an abbreviated regulatory scheme authorizing the FDA to approve generic drugs that are shown to contain the same active ingredients as, and to be bioequivalent to, drugs previously approved by the FDA pursuant to NDAs. To obtain approval of a generic drug, an applicant must submit an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, to the agency. An ANDA is a comprehensive submission that contains, among other things, data and information pertaining to the active pharmaceutical ingredient, bioequivalence, drug product formulation, specifications and stability of the generic drug, as well as analytical methods, manufacturing process validation data and quality control procedures. ANDAs are “abbreviated” because they generally do not include preclinical and clinical data to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Instead, in support of such applications, a generic manufacturer may rely on the preclinical and clinical testing previously conducted for a drug product previously approved under an NDA, known as the reference-listed drug, or RLD. 
 Specifically, in order for an ANDA to be approved, the FDA must find that the generic version is identical to the RLD with respect to the active ingredients, the route of administration, the dosage form, the strength of the drug and the conditions of use of the drug. At the same time, the FDA must also determine that the generic drug is “bioequivalent” to the innovator drug. Under the statute, a generic drug is bioequivalent to a RLD if “the rate and extent of absorption of the drug do not show a significant difference from the rate and extent of absorption of the listed drug.” Upon approval of an ANDA, the FDA indicates whether the generic product is “therapeutically equivalent” to the RLD in its publication “Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,” also referred to as the “Orange Book.” Physicians and pharmacists consider a therapeutic equivalent generic drug to be fully substitutable for the RLD. In addition, by operation of certain state laws and numerous health insurance programs, the FDA’s designation of therapeutic equivalence often results in substitution of the generic drug without the knowledge or consent of either the prescribing physician or patient. 
 Under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, the FDA may not approve an ANDA until any applicable period of non-patent exclusivity for the RLD has expired. The FDCA provides a period of five years of non-patent data exclusivity for a new drug containing a new chemical entity. For the purposes of this provision, a new chemical entity, or NCE, is a drug that contains no active moiety that has previously been approved by the FDA in any other NDA. An active moiety is the molecule or ion responsible for the physiological or pharmacological action of the drug substance. In cases where such NCE exclusivity has been granted, an ANDA may not be filed with the FDA until the expiration of five years unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification, in which case the applicant may submit its application four years following the original product approval. 
 The FDCA also provides for a period of three years of exclusivity if the NDA includes reports of one or more new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, that were conducted by or for the applicant and are essential to the approval of the application. This three-year exclusivity period often protects changes to a previously approved drug product, such as a new dosage form, route of administration, combination or indication. Three-year exclusivity would be available for a drug product that contains a previously approved active moiety, provided the statutory requirement for a new clinical investigation is satisfied. Unlike five-year NCE exclusivity, an award of three-year exclusivity does not block the FDA from accepting ANDAs seeking approval for generic versions of the drug as of the date of approval of the original drug product. The FDA typically makes decisions about awards of data exclusivity shortly before a product is approved.
 The FDA must establish a priority review track for certain generic drugs, requiring the FDA to review a drug application within eight months for a drug that has three or fewer approved drugs listed in the Orange Book and is no longer protected by any patent or regulatory exclusivities, or is on the FDA’s drug shortage list. The new legislation also authorizes FDA to expedite review of ‘‘competitor generic therapies’’ or drugs with inadequate generic competition, including holding meetings with or providing advice to the drug sponsor prior to submission of the application.
 Hatch-Waxman Patent Certification and the 30-Month Stay
 Upon approval of an NDA or a supplement thereto, NDA sponsors are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant’s product or an approved method of using the product. Each of the patents listed by the NDA sponsor is published in the Orange Book. When an ANDA applicant files its application with the FDA, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the reference product in the Orange Book, except for patents covering methods of use for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval. To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would.
 28


Specifically, the applicant must certify with respect to each patent that:
  
• | the required patent information has not been filed;
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | the listed patent has expired;
--+-------------------------------


• | the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the new product.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or indicates that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired (other than method of use patents involving indications for which the applicant is not seeking approval).
 If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months after the receipt of the Paragraph IV notice, expiration of the patent, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.
 To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would. As a result, approval of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA can be stalled until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired, until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired, and, in the case of a Paragraph IV certification and subsequent patent infringement suit, until the earlier of 30 months, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.
 Patent Term Restoration and Extension
 A patent claiming a new drug product may be eligible for a limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act, which permits a patent restoration of up to five years for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review. The restoration period granted on a patent covering a product is typically one-half the time between the effective date of a clinical investigation involving human beings is begun and the submission date of an application, plus the time between the submission date of an application and the ultimate approval date. Patent term restoration cannot be used to extend the remaining term of a patent past a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent in question. A patent that covers multiple products for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals. The United States Patent and Trademark Office reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration in consultation with the FDA.
The 21st Century Cures Act
 In December 2016, President Obama signed the 21st Century Cures Act, or Cures Act, into law. The Cures Act is designed to modernize and personalize healthcare, spur innovation and research, and streamline the discovery and development of new therapies through increased federal funding of particular programs. It authorizes increased funding for the FDA to spend on innovation projects. The new law also amends the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, to reauthorize and expand funding for the NIH. The Cures Act establishes the NIH Innovation Fund to pay for the cost of development and implementation of a strategic plan, early stage investigators and research. It also charges NIH with leading and coordinating expanded pediatric research. Further, the Cures Act directs the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to expand surveillance of neurological diseases.
 With amendments to the FDCA and the PHSA, Title III of the Cures Act seeks to accelerate the discovery, development, and delivery of new medicines and medical technologies. To that end, and among other provisions, the Cures Act reauthorizes the existing priority review voucher program for certain drugs intended to treat rare pediatric diseases until 2020; creates a new priority review voucher program for drug applications determined to be material national security threat medical countermeasure applications; revises the FDCA to streamline review of combination product applications; requires FDA to evaluate the potential use of “real world evidence” to help support approval of new indications for approved drugs; provides a new “limited population” approval pathway for antibiotic and antifungal drugs intended to treat serious or life-threatening infections; and authorizes the FDA to designate a drug as a “regenerative advanced therapy,” thereby making it eligible for certain expedited review and approval designations.

FDA Approval and Regulation of Companion Diagnostics
 If safe and effective use of a therapeutic depends on an in vitro diagnostic, then the FDA generally will require approval or clearance of that diagnostic, known as a companion diagnostic, at the same time that the FDA approves the therapeutic product. In August 2014, the FDA issued final guidance clarifying the requirements that will apply to approval of therapeutic products and in vitro companion diagnostics. According to the guidance, if the FDA determines that a companion diagnostic device is essential to the safe and effective use of a novel therapeutic product or indication, the FDA generally will not approve the therapeutic product or new therapeutic product indication if the companion diagnostic device is not approved or cleared for that indication. Approval or clearance of the companion diagnostic device will ensure that the device has been adequately evaluated and has adequate performance characteristics in the intended population. The review of in vitro companion diagnostics in conjunction with the review of our therapeutic treatments for cancer will, therefore, likely involve coordination of review by the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health Office of In Vitro Diagnostics Device Evaluation and Safety.
 Under the FDCA, in vitro diagnostics, including companion diagnostics, are regulated as medical devices. In the United States, the FDCA and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post‑market surveillance. Unless an exemption applies, diagnostic tests require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercial distribution. The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization applicable to a medical device are premarket notification, also called 510(k) clearance, and premarket approval, or PMA approval.
 The PMA process, including the gathering of clinical and preclinical data and the submission to and review by the FDA, can take several years or longer. It involves a rigorous premarket review during which the applicant must prepare and provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness and information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. PMA applications are subject to an application fee, which exceeds $250,000 for most PMAs. In addition, PMAs for certain devices must generally include the results from extensive preclinical and adequate and well‑controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the device for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. In particular, for a diagnostic, a PMA application typically requires data regarding analytical and clinical validation studies. As part of the PMA review, the FDA will typically inspect the manufacturer’s facilities for compliance with the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which imposes elaborate testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance requirements.
 PMA approval is not guaranteed, and the FDA may ultimately respond to a PMA submission with a not approvable determination based on deficiencies in the application and require additional clinical trial or other data that may be expensive and time‑consuming to generate and that can substantially delay approval. If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA application is favorable, the FDA typically issues an approvable letter requiring the applicant’s agreement to specific conditions, such as changes in labeling, or specific additional information, such as submission of final labeling, in order to secure final approval of the PMA. If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. A not approvable letter will outline the deficiencies in the application and, where practical, will identify what is necessary to make the PMA approvable. The FDA may also determine that additional clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and then the data submitted in an amendment to the PMA. If the FDA concludes that the applicable criteria have been met, the FDA will issue a PMA for the approved indications, which can be more limited than those originally sought by the applicant. The PMA can include post‑approval conditions that the FDA believes necessary to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution. Once granted, PMA approval may be withdrawn by the FDA if compliance with post approval requirements, conditions of approval or other regulatory standards are not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
 After a device is placed on the market, it remains subject to significant regulatory requirements. Medical devices may be marketed only for the uses and indications for which they are cleared or approved. Device manufacturers must also establish registration and device listings with the FDA. A medical device manufacturer’s manufacturing processes and those of its suppliers are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging and shipping of medical devices. Domestic facility records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic unscheduled inspections by the FDA. The FDA also may inspect foreign facilities that export products to the United States.

Healthcare Law and Regulation
 Health care providers and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of drug products that are granted marketing approval. Arrangements with providers, consultants, third-party payors and customers are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse, anti-kickback, false claims laws, patient privacy laws and regulations and other health care laws and regulations that may constrain business and/or financial arrangements. Restrictions under applicable federal and state health care laws and regulations, include the following:

• | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, paying, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal health care program such as Medicare and Medicaid;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties laws, which prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false, fictitious or fraudulent or knowingly making, using or causing to made or used a false record or statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created additional federal criminal laws that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program or making false statements relating to health care matters;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final Omnibus Rule published in January 2013, which impose obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal false statements statute, which prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing •or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, which prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making, or offering or promising to make, improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or otherwise seeking favorable treatment;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal transparency requirements known as the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care Education Reconciliation Act, or the ACA, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, within the United States Department of Health and Human Services, information related to payments and other transfers of value made by that entity to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to health care items or services that are reimbursed by non-government third-party payors, including private insurers.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Further, some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other health care providers or marketing expenditures. Additionally, some state and local laws require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives in the jurisdiction. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 Pharmaceutical Insurance Coverage and Healthcare Reform
 In the United States and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated health care costs. Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of products approved by the FDA and other government authorities. Thus, even if a product candidate is approved, sales of the product will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations, provide coverage and establish adequate reimbursement levels for, the product. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication.
 31


In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable marketing approvals. Nonetheless, product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost effective. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician utilization once the product is approved and have a material adverse effect on sales, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage and reimbursement for the product, and the level of coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor.
 The containment of health care costs also has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments and the prices of products have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit a company’s revenue generated from the sale of any approved products. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which a company or its collaborators receive marketing approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 There have been a number of federal and state proposals during the last few years regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, limiting coverage and reimbursement for drugs and biologics and other medical products, government control and other changes to the health care system in the United States. In March 2010, the ACA was enacted, which includes measures that have significantly changed health care financing by both governmental and private insurers. The provisions of the ACA of importance to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry are, among others, the following:
  
• | an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drug agents or biologic agents, which is apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government health care programs;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | an increase in the rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1% and 13% of the average manufacturer price for branded and generic drugs, respectively;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts to negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer's outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | extension of manufacturers' Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, unless the drug is subject to discounts under the 340B drug discount program;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers' Medicaid rebate liability;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | new requirements under the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act for drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals as well as ownership or investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | creation of the Independent Payment Advisory Board, which, if and when impaneled, will have authority to recommend certain changes to the Medicare program that could result in reduced payments for prescription drugs; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | establishment of a Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. 
 Since enactment of the ACA, there have been numerous legal challenges and Congressional actions to repeal and replace provisions of the law. For example, with enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which was signed by the President in December 2017, Congress repealed the “individual mandate.” The repeal of this provision, which requires most Americans to carry a minimal level of health insurance, will become effective in 2019. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the repeal of the individual mandate will cause 13 million fewer Americans to be insured in 2027 and premiums in insurance markets may rise. Additionally, in January 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain ACA-mandated fees, including the so-called “Cadillac” tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices. Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, among other things, amends the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to increase from 50 percent to 70 percent the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D and to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole.” The Congress will likely consider other legislation to replace elements of the ACA during the next Congressional session.
 The Trump Administration has also taken executive actions to undermine or delay implementation of the ACA. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two Executive Orders designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the ACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the ACA. One Executive Order directs federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. The second Executive Order terminates the cost-sharing subsidies that reimburse insurers under the ACA. Several state Attorneys General filed suit to stop the administration from terminating the subsidies, but their request for a restraining order was denied by a federal judge in California in October 2017. In addition, CMS has recently proposed regulations that would give states greater flexibility in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the ACA for plans sold through such marketplaces. Further, in June 2018, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that the federal government was not required to pay more than $12 billion in ACA risk corridor payments to third-party payors who argued were owed to them. The effects of this gap in reimbursement on third-party payors, the viability of the ACA marketplace, providers, and potentially our business, are not yet known. 
 Further, there have been several recent U.S. congressional inquiries and proposed federal and proposed and enacted state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the costs of drugs under Medicare and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. At the federal level, Congress and the Trump Administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. For example, in May 2018, the Trump Administration issued a plan to lower drug prices. Under this blueprint for action, the Administration indicated that the Department of Health and Human Services will: take steps to end the gaming of regulatory and patent processes by drug makers to unfairly protect monopolies; advance biosimilars and generics to boost price competition; evaluate the inclusion of prices in drug makers’ ads to enhance price competition; speed access to and lower the cost of new drugs by clarifying policies for sharing information between insurers and drug makers; avoid excessive pricing by relying more on value-based pricing by expanding outcome-based payments in Medicare and Medicaid; work to give Part D plan sponsors more negotiation power with drug makers; examine which Medicare Part B drugs could be negotiated for a lower price by Part D plans, and improving the design of the Part B Competitive Acquisition Program; update Medicare’s drug-pricing dashboard to increase transparency; prohibit Part D contracts that include “gag rules” that prevent pharmacists from informing patients when they could pay less out-of-pocket by not using insurance; and require that Part D plan members be provided with an annual statement of plan payments, out-of-pocket spending, and drug price increases.
 At the state level, individual states are increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional health care authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other health care programs. These measures could reduce the ultimate demand for our products, once approved, or put pressure on our product pricing. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing pressures.

Review and Approval of Medicinal Products in the European Union
 In order to market any product outside of the United States, a company must also comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of products. Whether or not it obtains FDA approval for a product, an applicant will need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable non-U.S. regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries or jurisdictions. Specifically, the process governing approval of medicinal products in the EU, generally follows the same lines as in the United States. It entails satisfactory completion of preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for each proposed indication. It also requires the submission to the relevant competent authorities of a marketing authorization application, or MAA, and granting of a marketing authorization by these authorities before the product can be marketed and sold in the EU.
 Clinical Trial Approval
 The Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC, the Directive 2005/28/EC on Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, and the related national implementing provisions of the individual EU Member States govern the system for the approval of clinical trials in the EU. Under this system, an applicant must obtain prior approval from the competent national authority of the EU Member States in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. Furthermore, the applicant may only start a clinical trial at a specific study site after the competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion. The clinical trial application must be accompanied by, among other documents, an investigational medicinal product dossier (the Common Technical Document) with supporting information prescribed by Directive 2001/20/EC, Directive 2005/28/EC, where relevant the implementing national provisions of the individual EU Member States and further detailed in applicable guidance documents. 
 In April 2014, the new Clinical Trials Regulation, (EU) No 536/2014, or Clinical Trials Regulation, was adopted. The Regulation was published in June 2014 but is not expected to apply until the second half of 2019. The Clinical Trials Regulation will be directly applicable in all the EU Member States, repealing the current Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC and replacing any national legislation that was put in place to implement the Directive. Conduct of all clinical trials performed in the EU will continue to be bound by currently applicable provisions until the new Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable. The extent to which on-going clinical trials will be governed by the Clinical Trials Regulation will depend on when the Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable and on the duration of the individual clinical trial. If a clinical trial continues for more than three years from the day on which the Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable the Clinical Trials Regulation will at that time begin to apply to the clinical trial. 
 The new Clinical Trials Regulation aims to simplify and streamline the approval of clinical trials in the EU. The main characteristics of the regulation include: a streamlined application procedure via a single entry point, the “EU Portal and Database”; a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the application as well as simplified reporting procedures for clinical trial sponsors; and a harmonized procedure for the assessment of applications for clinical trials, which is divided in two parts. Part I is assessed by the appointed reporting Member State, whose assessment report is submitted for review by the sponsor and all other competent authorities of all EU Member States in which an application for authorization of a clinical trial has been submitted (Concerned Member States). Part II is assessed separately by each Concerned Member State. Strict deadlines have been established for the assessment of clinical trial applications. The role of the relevant ethics committees in the assessment procedure will continue to be governed by the national law of the Concerned Member State. However, overall related timelines will be defined by the Clinical Trials Regulation.
 PRIME Designation in the EU
 In March 2016, the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, launched an initiative to facilitate development of product candidates in indications, often rare, for which few or no therapies currently exist. The PRIority MEdicines, or PRIME, scheme is intended to encourage drug development in areas of unmet medical need and provides accelerated assessment of products representing substantial innovation reviewed under the centralized procedure. Products from small- and medium-sized enterprises may qualify for earlier entry into the PRIME scheme than larger companies. Many benefits accrue to sponsors of product candidates with PRIME designation, including but not limited to, early and proactive regulatory dialogue with the EMA, frequent discussions on clinical trial designs and other development program elements, and accelerated marketing authorization application assessment once a dossier has been submitted. Importantly, a dedicated Agency contact and rapporteur from the Committee for Human Medicinal Products, or CHMP, or Committee for Advanced Therapies are appointed early in PRIME scheme facilitating increased understanding of the product at EMA’s Committee level. A kick-off meeting initiates these relationships and includes a team of multidisciplinary experts at the EMA to provide guidance on the overall development and regulatory strategies.

Marketing Authorization
 To obtain a marketing authorization for a product under EU regulatory systems, an applicant must submit an MAA either under a centralized procedure administered by the EMA, or one of the procedures administered by competent authorities in the EU Member States (decentralized procedure, national procedure or mutual recognition procedure). A marketing authorization may be granted only to an applicant established in the EU. Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 provides that prior to obtaining a marketing authorization in the EU, applicants have to demonstrate compliance with all measures included in an EMA-approved Paediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, covering all subsets of the pediatric population, unless the EMA has granted (i) a product-specific waiver, (ii) a class waiver or (iii) a deferral for one or more of the measures included in the PIP. 
 The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization by the European Commission that is valid across the European Economic Area (i.e., the EU as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway). Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, the centralized procedure is compulsory for specific products, including for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy medicinal products, and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, including products for the treatment of cancer. For products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of other diseases and products that are highly innovative or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients, the centralized procedure may be optional. The centralized procedure may at the request of the applicant also be used in certain other cases. We anticipate that the centralized procedure will be mandatory for the product candidates we are developing.
 Under the centralized procedure, the CHMP is also responsible for several post-authorization and maintenance activities, such as the assessment of modifications or extensions to an existing marketing authorization. Under the centralized procedure in the EU, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional information or written or oral explanation is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions of the CHMP. Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is of major interest from the point of view of public health and in particular from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. If the CHMP accepts such request, the time limit of 210 days will be reduced to 150 days but it is possible that the CHMP can revert to the standard time limit for the centralized procedure if it considers that it is no longer appropriate to conduct an accelerated assessment. At the end of this period, the CHMP provides a scientific opinion on whether or not a marketing authorization should be granted in relation to a medicinal product. Within 15 calendar days of receipt of a final opinion from the CHMP, the European Commission must prepare a draft decision concerning an application for marketing authorization. This draft decision must take the opinion and any relevant provisions of EU law into account. Before arriving at a final decision on an application for centralized authorization of a medicinal product the European Commission must consult the Standing Committee on Medicinal Products for Human Use. The Standing Committee is composed of representatives of the EU Member States and chaired by a non-voting European Commission representative. The European Parliament also has a related “droit de regard.
” The European Parliament's role is to ensure that the European Commission has not exceeded its powers in deciding to grant or refuse to grant a marketing authorization. 
 The European Commission may grant a so-called “marketing authorization under exceptional circumstances.
” Such authorization is intended for products for which the applicant can demonstrate that it is unable to provide comprehensive data on the efficacy and safety under 
normal conditions of use, because the indications for which the product 
in question is intended are encountered so rarely that the applicant cannot reasonably be expected to provide comprehensive evidence, or in the present state of scientific knowledge, comprehensive information cannot be provided, or it would be contrary to generally accepted principles of medical ethics to collect such information. Consequently, marketing authorization under exceptional circumstances may be granted subject to certain specific obligations, which may include the following:
  
• | the applicant must complete an identified program of studies within a time period specified by the competent authority, the results of which form the basis of a reassessment of the benefit/risk profile;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the medicinal product in question may be supplied on medical prescription only and may in certain cases be administered only under strict medical supervision, possibly in a hospital and in the case of a radiopharmaceutical, by an authorized person; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the package leaflet and any medical information must draw the attention of the medical practitioner to the fact that the particulars available concerning the medicinal product in question are as yet inadequate in certain specified respects.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A marketing authori
zation under exceptional circumstances 
is subject to annual review to reassess the risk-benefit balance in an annual reassessment procedure. Continuation of the authorization is linked 
to the annual reassessment and a negative assessment could potentially result 
in the marketing authorization being suspended or revoked. The renewal of a marketing authorization of a 
medicinal product under exceptional circumstances, however, follows the same rules as a “normal” marketing authorization. Thus, a marketing authorization under exceptional circumstances is granted for an initial five years, after which the authorization will become valid indefinitely, unless the EMA decides that safety grounds merit one additional five-year renewal.
 35


The European Commission may also grant a so-called “conditional marketing authorization” prior to obtaining the comprehensive clinical data required for an application for a full marketing authorization. Such conditional marketing authorizations may be granted for product candidates (including medicines designated as orphan medicinal products), if (i) the risk-benefit balance of the product candidate is positive, (ii) it is likely that the applicant will be in a position to provide the required comprehensive clinical trial data, (iii) the product fulfills an unmet medical need and (iv) the benefit to public health of the immediate availability on the market of the medicinal product concerned outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. A conditional marketing authorization may contain specific obligations to be fulfilled by the marketing authorization holder, including obligations with respect to the completion of ongoing or new studies, and with respect to the collection of pharmacovigilance data. Conditional marketing authorizations are valid for one year, and may be renewed annually, if the risk-benefit balance remains positive, and after an assessment of the need for additional or modified conditions and/or specific obligations. The timelines for the centralized procedure described above also apply with respect to the review by the CHMP of applications for a conditional marketing authorization.
 The EU medicines rules expressly permit the EU Member States to adopt national legislation prohibiting or restricting the sale, supply or use of any medicinal product containing, consisting of or derived from a specific type of human or animal cell, such as embryonic stem cells. While the products we have in development do not make use of embryonic stem cells, 
it is possible that the national laws in certain EU Member States may prohibit or restrict us from commercializing our products, even if they have been granted an EU marketing authorization.
 Unlike the centralized authorization procedure, the decentralized marketing authorization procedure requires a separate application to, and leads to separate approval by, the competent authorities of each EU Member State in which the product is to be marketed. This application is identical to the application that would be submitted to the EMA for authorization through the centralized procedure. The reference EU Member State prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. The resulting assessment report is submitted to the concerned EU Member States who, within 90 days of receipt, must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials. If a concerned EU Member State cannot approve the assessment report and related materials due to concerns relating to a potential serious risk to public health, disputed elements may be referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all EU Member States.
 The mutual recognition procedure similarly is based on the acceptance by the competent authorities of the EU Member States of the marketing authorization of a medicinal product by the competent authorities of other EU Member States. The holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the competent authority of an EU Member State requesting that this authority recognize the marketing authorization delivered by the competent authority of another EU Member State.
 Regulatory Data Protection in the EU
 In the EU
, innovative medicinal products approved 
on the basis of a complete independent data package qualify for 
eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity pursuant to Directive 2001/83/EC. Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 repeats this entitlement for medicinal products 
authorized in accordance the centralized authorization procedure. Data exclusivity prevents applicants for authorization of generics of 
these innovative products from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic (abridged) application for a period of eight years. During an additional two-year period of 
market exclusivity, a generic marketing authorization application can be submitted and authorized, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic 
medicinal product can be placed on the EU market until the expiration of the market exclusivity
. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during 
the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their 
authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical
 benefit in comparison with existing therapies. Even if a compound is considered to be a new chemical entity so that the innovator gains the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company nevertheless could also market another version of the product if such company obtained marketing authorization based on an MAA with a complete independent data package of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical tests and clinical trials. 
 Periods of 
Authorization and Renewals
 A marketing authorization has an initial validity 
for five years in principle. The marketing authorization 
may be renewed after five years on the basis of a re-evaluation 
of the risk-benefit balance by the EMA or by the competent authority of the EU Member State. To this end, the marketing authorizat
ion holder must provide the EMA or the competent authority with a consolidated version of the file in respect of quality, safety and efficacy, including all variations introduced since 
the marketing authorization was granted, at least six months before the marketing authorization ceases to be valid. The 
European Commission or the competent authorities 
of the EU Member States may decide
, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one further five-year period of marketing authorization. Once subsequently definitively renewed, the marketing authorization shall be 
valid for an unlimited period. Any authorization which 
is not followed by the actual placing 
of the medicinal product on the EU n market (in case of centralized procedure) or o
n the market of the authorizing 
EU Member State within three years after authorization ceases to be valid. 
 36


Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
 Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000, as implemented by Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000 provides that a drug can be des
ignated as an orphan drug by the European Commission if its sponsor can establish: that the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of (i) a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in ten t
housand persons in the EU when the application is made, or (ii
) a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the EU 
and that without incentives it 
is unlikely that the marketing 
of the drug in the EU would generate sufficient return to justify the necessary investment
. For either of these conditions, the applicant must demonstrate that there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition in question that has been authorized in the EU or
, if such method exists, the drug 
will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition. 
 Once authorized, orphan medicinal products are entitled to ten 
years of market exclusivity in all EU Member States and 
a range of other benefits during the development and regulatory review process including scientific assistance for study protocols, authorization through the centralized marketing authorization procedure covering all member countries and a reduction or elimination of registration and marketing authorization fees. However, marketing authorization may be granted to 
a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication during the ten-year period with the consent 
of the marketing authorization holder for the original orphan medicinal product or 
if the manufacturer of the original orphan medicinal product is unable to supply sufficient quantities. Marketing authorization may also be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication if this product is safer, more effecti
ve or otherwise clinically superior to the original orphan medicinal product. The 
period of market exclusivity may, in addition, 
be reduced to six years if it can be demonstrated on the basis of available evidence that the original orphan medicinal product
 is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. 
 Regulatory Requirements after a Marketing Authorization has been Obtained
 In case an authorization for a medicinal product in the EU is obtained, the holder of the marketing authorization is required to comply with a range of requirements applicable to the manufacturing, marketing, promotion and sale of medicinal products. These include: 
  
• | Compliance with the EU’s stringent pharmacovigilance or safety reporting rules must be ensured. These rules can impose post-authorization studies and additional monitoring obligations.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The manufacturing of authorized medicinal products, for which a separate manufacturer’s license is mandatory, must also be conducted in strict compliance with the applicable EU laws, regulations and guidance, including Directive 2001/83/EC, Directive 2003/94/EC, Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and the European Commission Guidelines for Good Manufacturing Practice. These requirements include compliance with EU cGMP standards when manufacturing medicinal products and active pharmaceutical ingredients, including the manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients outside of the EU with the intention to import the active pharmaceutical ingredients into the EU.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The marketing and promotion of authorized drugs, including industry-sponsored continuing medical education and advertising directed toward the prescribers of drugs and/or the general public, are strictly regulated in the EU notably under Directive 2001/83EC, as amended, and EU Member State laws. Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medicines is prohibited across the EU.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom
 In June 2016, the electorate in the United Kingdom voted in favor of leaving the EU, which is commonly referred to as “Brexit.” Thereafter, in March 2017, the country formally notified the EU of its intention to withdraw pursuant to Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. The withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU will take effect either on the effective date of the withdrawal agreement or, in the absence of agreement, two years after the United Kingdom provides a notice of withdrawal pursuant to the EU Treaty. Since the regulatory framework for pharmaceutical products in the United Kingdom. covering quality, safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical products, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of pharmaceutical products is derived from EU directives and regulations, Brexit could materially impact the future regulatory regime which applies to products and the approval of product candidates in the United Kingdom. It remains to be seen how, if at all, Brexit will impact regulatory requirements for product candidates and products in the United Kingdom.
 37


Pricing Decisions for Approved Products
 In the EU, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies or so-called health technology assessments, in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. For example, the EU provides options for its Member States to restrict the range of products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. Member States may approve a specific price for a product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the product on the market. Other Member States allow companies to fix their own prices for products, but monitor and control prescription volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Recently, many countries in the EU have increased the amount of discounts required on pharmaceuticals and these efforts could continue as countries attempt to manage health care expenditures, especially in light of the severe fiscal and debt crises experienced by many countries in the EU. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription products, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. Political, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various Member States, and parallel trade, i.e., arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced Member States, can further reduce prices. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any products, if approved in those countries.
Sales and Marketing
 We hold North American and European commercialization rights to SY‑1425 for all cancer indications, and worldwide rights to SY‑1365, SY-5609 and all of our other preclinical programs for all potential indications. Subject to receiving marketing approval, we intend to build a focused sales and marketing organization in the United States and potentially in Europe to sell our products. We believe that such an organization will be able to address the community of physicians who are key specialists in treating the patient populations for which our product candidates are being developed.
 We also plan to build a marketing and sales management organization to create and implement marketing strategies for any products that we market through our own sales organization and to oversee and support our sales force. The responsibilities of the marketing organization would include developing educational initiatives with respect to approved products and establishing relationships with researchers and practitioners in relevant fields of medicine.
 Outside of the United States and potentially Europe, where appropriate, we may elect in the future to utilize strategic partners, distributors or contract sales forces to assist in the commercialization of our products. In certain instances, we may consider building our own commercial infrastructure.
 Manufacturing
 We do not currently own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of clinical or commercial quantities of our product candidates. Although we intend to rely on third‑party contract manufacturers to produce our product candidates and any products we may develop in the future, we have recruited personnel with experience to manage these third‑party contract manufacturers.
Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 76 full-time employees, including 36 employees with M.D. or Ph.D. degrees. Of these full-time employees, 57 employees are engaged in research and development activities and 19 employees are engaged in general and administrative activities. None of our employees is represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
