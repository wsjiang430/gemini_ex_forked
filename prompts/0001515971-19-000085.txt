  ITEM 1. BUSINESS
  Historical Background
  Daybreak Oil and Gas, Inc. (referred to herein as we, our, us, Daybreak or the Company) was originally incorporated in the State of Washington on March 11, 1955 as Daybreak Uranium, Inc. The Company was organized to explore for, acquire and develop mineral properties throughout the Western United States. In August 1955, we acquired the assets of Morning Sun Uranium, Inc. By the late 1950s, we ceased to be a producing mining company and thereafter engaged in mineral exploration only. In May 1964, to reflect the diversity of our mineral holdings, we changed our name to Daybreak Mines, Inc. By February 1967, we had ceased all exploration operations. After that time, our activities were confined to annual assessment and maintenance work on our Idaho mineral properties and other general and administrative functions. In November 2004, we sold our last remaining mineral rights covering approximately 340 acres in Shoshone County, Idaho.  Effective March 1, 2005, we undertook a new business direction for the Company; that of an exploration, development and production company in the crude oil and natural gas industry. In October of 2005, to better reflect this new direction of the Company, our shareholders approved changing our name to Daybreak Oil and Gas, Inc. Our Common Stock is quoted on the OTC Pink® Open Market under the symbol DBRM.  Our corporate office is located at 1101 N. Argonne Road, Suite A 211, Spokane Valley, Washington 99212-2699. Our telephone number is (509) 232-7674. Additionally, we have a regional operations office located at 1414 S. Friendswood Dr., Suite 212, Friendswood, Texas 77546. The telephone number of our office in Friendswood is (281) 996-4176.  Crude Oil and Natural Gas Overview
  We are an independent crude oil and natural gas exploration, development and production company. Our basic business model is to increase shareholder value by finding and developing crude oil and natural gas reserves through exploration and development activities and selling the production from those reserves at a profit. To be successful, we must, over time, be able to find crude oil and natural gas reserves and then sell the resulting production at a price that is sufficient to cover our finding costs, operating expenses, administrative costs and interest expense, plus offer us a return on our capital investment. A secondary means of generating returns can include the sale of either producing or non-producing lease properties.  Our long-term success depends on, among many other factors, the acquisition and drilling of commercial grade crude oil and natural gas properties and on the prevailing sales price for crude oil and natural gas along with associated operating expenses. The volatile nature of the energy markets makes it difficult to estimate future prices of crude oil and natural gas; however, any prolonged period of depressed prices or market volatility, such as we have experienced since June of 2014, will and does have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.  The Companys focus is to pursue crude oil and natural gas drilling opportunities through joint ventures with industry partners as a means of limiting our drilling risk. Prospects are generally brought to us by other crude oil and natural gas companies or individuals. We identify and evaluate prospective crude oil and natural gas properties to determine both the degree of risk and the commercial potential of the project. We seek projects that offer a mix of low risk with a potential of steady reliable revenue as well as projects with a higher risk, but that may also have a larger return.  Modern technology including 3-D seismic helps us identify potential crude oil and natural gas reservoirs and to mitigate our risk. The Company conducts all of our drilling, exploration and production activities in the United States, and all of our revenues are derived from sales to customers within the United States. We seek to maximize the value of our asset base by exploring and developing properties that have both production and reserve growth potential. Currently, our core areas of activity are located in Kern County, California and Michigan, although new opportunities may ultimately be secured in other areas.    4   In some instances, such as with our California crude oil operations, we strive to be the operator of our crude oil and natural gas properties. As the operator, we are more directly in control of the timing; costs of drilling and completion; and production operations on our projects. We are compensated by our other working interest partners for the additional duties performed by Daybreak as operator. In other instances, we may not serve as operator where we have concluded that the existing operator has existing operational knowledge, equipment and personnel in place, and operates competently and prudently and with the same operational goals that we would have if we served as operator. However, we have our own personnel onsite during critical operations such as drilling, fracturing and completion operations.  In January 2017, we acquired a 30% working interest in 1,400 acres in the Michigan Basin. The leases have been secured and multiple targets were identified through a 2-D seismic interpretation. A 3-D seismic survey was obtained in January and February of 2017 on the first prospect. An analysis of the 3-D seismic survey confirmed the first prospect originally identified on the 2-D seismic, as well as several additional drilling locations. We have plans to obtain an additional 3-D survey on the second prospect. However; the two prospects are independent of each other and the success or failure of either one does not effect the other. The wells will be drilled vertically with conventional completions and no hydraulic fracturing is anticipated. With the settlement of our debt obligations in December 2018 with Maximilian Resources LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and successor by assignment from Maximilian Investors LLC (either party, as appropriate, is referred to as Maximilian), we acquired an additional 40% working interest, bringing our aggregate working interest in Michigan to 70%. The first well is expected to be drilled during the late summer of 2019.  Known Trends and Uncertainties
  As we continue to pursue our development and exploratory drilling programs in our California and Michigan properties, respectively, the timing of these activities continues to be determined by current crude oil and natural gas prices; the availability of drilling funds; and in California, the length and timing of the drilling permit approval process. Additionally, our drilling programs are also very sensitive to drilling costs. We attempt to control these costs through drilling efficiencies by working with service providers to receive acceptable unit costs.  In order to continue our drilling program in California and undertake a new drilling program in Michigan, we must be able to realize an acceptable margin between our expected cash flows from new production and the cost to drill and complete new wells. If any combination of a decrease in crude oil and natural gas prices; the availability of drilling funds; and/or, the rising costs of drilling, completion and other field services occurs in future periods, we may be forced to modify or discontinue a planned drilling program.  All of the Companys crude oil production in California is sold under contracts which are market-sensitive. Accordingly, the Companys financial condition, results of operations, and capital resources are highly dependent upon prevailing market prices of hydrocarbon prices and demand for crude oil and natural gas. These commodity prices are subject to wide fluctuations and market uncertainties due to a variety of factors that are beyond the control of the Company. Some of these factors include the level of global demand for and price of petroleum products, foreign supply of crude oil and natural gas, the establishment of and compliance with production quotas by oil-exporting countries, the relative strength of the U.S. dollar, weather conditions, the price and availability of alternative fuels, and overall economic conditions, both foreign and domestic. Because of the size of our Company, we are highly susceptible to downward changes in the price we receive for our hydrocarbon sales especially crude oil.
  California Crude Oil Prices
  The price we receive for crude oil sales in California is based on prices posted for Midway-Sunset crude oil delivery contracts, less deductions that vary by grade of crude oil sold and transportation costs. 

The posted Midway-Sunset price generally moves in correlation to, and at a discount to, prices quoted on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) for spot West Texas Intermediate (WTI) Cushing, Oklahoma delivery contracts. Effective June 1, 2017, we were able to negotiate with our crude oil purchaser the use of a more favorable crude oil pricing schedule. We do not have any natural gas revenues in California.
  There continues to be a significant amount of volatility in hydrocarbon prices and dramatic decline in our realized sale price of crude oil since June of 

2014 when the monthly average price of WTI oil was $105.79 per barrel.  This volatility and decline in the price of crude oil has had a substantial negative impact on our cash flow from our producing California properties. While there has been an improvement in crude oil prices for the twelve months ended February 28, 2019 in comparison to the twelve months ended February 28, 2018; there is no guarantee this trend will continue. Most recently the monthly average WTI price of oil has declined from $70.75 in October of 2018 to $54.95 in February 2019 representing the continued volatility in crude oil prices. It is beyond our ability to accurately predict how long crude oil prices will continue to improve; when or at what level they may begin to stabilize; or when they may start to decline again as there are many factors beyond our control that dictate the price we receive on our crude oil sales.
   5   A comparison of the average WTI price and average realized crude oil sales price at our East Slope Project in California for the twelve months ended February 28, 2019 and February 28, 2018 is shown in the table below:  
 | Twelve Months Ended | | 
 | February 28, 2019 | | February 28, 2018 | | Percentage Change
Average twelve month WTI crude oil price | $ | 63.31 | | $ | 52.55 | 20.5%
Average twelve month realized crude oil sales price (Bbl) | $ | 64.64 | | $ | 49.34 | 31.0%


For the twelve months ended February 28, 2019, the average WTI price was $63.31 and our average realized crude oil sale price was $64.64, representing a premium of $1.33 per barrel or 2.1% higher than the average WTI price. In comparison, for the twelve months ended February 28, 2018, the average WTI price was $52.55 and our average realized sale price was $49.34 representing a discount of $3.21 per barrel or 6.1% lower than the average WTI price. Historically, the sale price we receive for California heavy crude oil has been less than the quoted NYMEX WTI price because of the lower API gravity of our California crude oil in comparison to WTI crude oil API gravity.

California Crude Oil Revenue and Production

Crude oil revenue in California for the twelve months ended February 28, 2019 increased $114,205 or 18.2% to $742,857 in comparison to revenue of $628,652 for the twelve months ended February 28, 2018. The average sale price of a barrel of crude oil for the twelve months ended February 28, 2019 was $64.64 in comparison to $49.34 for the twelve months ended February 28, 2018. The increase of $15.30 or 31.0% per barrel in the average realized price of a barrel of crude oil accounted for 100.0% of the increase in crude oil revenue for the twelve months ended February 28, 2019. Effective June 1, 2017, we were able to negotiate with our crude oil purchaser the use of a more favorable crude oil pricing schedule that has contributed to increasing the average realized price we receive on our crude oil sales.

Our net sales volume for the twelve months ended February 28, 2019 was 11,492 barrels of crude oil in comparison to 12,741 barrels sold for the twelve months ended February 28, 2018. This decrease in crude oil sales volume of 1,249 barrels or 9.8% was primarily due to the natural depletion of the reservoir during the twelve months ended February 28, 2019.

The gravity of our produced crude oil in California ranges between 14° API and 16° API. Production for the twelve months ended February 28, 2019 was from 20 wells resulting in 7,257 well days of production in comparison to 7,236 well days of production from 20 wells for the twelve months ended February 28, 2018.

Competition

We compete with other independent crude oil and natural gas companies for exploration prospects, property acquisitions and for the equipment and labor required to operate and develop these properties. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have. These competitors may be able to pay more for exploratory prospects and may be able to define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than we can.

We conduct all of our drilling, exploration and production activities onshore in the United States. All of our crude oil assets are located in the United States and all of our revenues are from sales to customers within the United States.

Significant Customers

At our East Slopes Project, located in Kern County, California, we sell all of our crude oil production to one buyer. At February 28, 2019 and 2018, this one individual customer represented 100% of crude oil sales receivable. If this local purchaser is unable to resell their products or if they lose a significant sales contract then we may incur difficulties in selling our crude oil production.

The Companys accounts receivable from continuing operations in California for crude oil sales at February 28, 2019 and 2018 are set forth in the table below.


 | | February 28, 2019 | | February 28, 2018
Project | Customer | Accounts Receivable Crude Oil Sales | | Percentage | | Accounts Receivable Crude Oil Sales | | Percentage
California  East Slopes Project (Crude oil) | Plains Marketing | $ | 75,410 | | 100.0% | | $ | 104,840 | 100.0%

Title to Properties

As is customary in the crude oil and natural gas industry, we make only a cursory review of title to undeveloped crude oil and natural gas leases at the time we acquire them. However, before drilling operations commence, we search the title, and remedy material defects, if any, before we actually begin drilling the well. To the extent title opinions or other investigations reflect title defects, we (rather than the seller or lessor of the undeveloped property) typically are obligated to cure any such title defects at our expense. If we are unable to remedy or cure any title defects, so that it would not be prudent for us to commence drilling operations on the property, we could suffer a loss of our entire investment in the property. Except for encumbrances we have granted as described below under Encumbrances, we believe that we have good title to our crude oil and natural gas properties, some of which are subject to immaterial easements, and restrictions.
Regulation

The exploration and development of crude oil and natural gas properties are subject to various types of federal, state and local laws and regulations. These laws and regulations govern a wide range of matters, including the drilling and spacing of wells, hydraulic fracturing operations, allowable rates of production, restoration of surface areas, plugging and abandonment of wells and specific requirements for the operation of wells. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations can result in substantial penalties.

Laws and regulations relating to our business frequently change so we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with such laws. Future laws and regulations, including changes to existing laws and regulations, could adversely affect our business. These regulatory burdens generally do not affect us any differently than they affect other companies in our industry with similar types, quantities and locations of production.

All of the states in which we operate generally require permits for drilling operations, require drilling bonds and reports concerning operations and impose other requirements relating to the exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas.  Such states also have statutes or regulations addressing conservation matters, including provisions for the unitization or pooling of crude oil and natural gas properties, the establishment of maximum rates of production from crude oil and natural gas wells, the spacing, plugging and abandonment of such wells, restrictions on venting or flaring of natural gas and requirements regarding the ratability of production.

These laws and regulations may limit the amount of crude oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells and may limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill. Moreover, many states impose a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of crude oil and natural gas within their jurisdiction. States do not generally regulate wellhead prices or engage in other, similar direct economic regulation of production, but there can be no assurance they will not do so in the future.

 In California, where we currently operate a 20 well oilfield project, there is substantial federal and state regulation and oversight of produced water and its disposal. Water regulations on California are currently under review and are subject to change. We produce a substantial amount of water while lifting oil from our reservoirs. While the water we produce is considered to be fresh water under current testing standards, its handling and use are currently under review by regional authorities. As rules change, we may be required to invest in additional water management infrastructure. There is no guarantee that we will not have to incur additional costs in the future in regards to the disposal and use of our produced water.  In the event we conduct operations on federal, state or American Indian crude oil and natural gas leases, our operations may be required to comply with additional regulatory restrictions, including various nondiscrimination statutes, royalty and related valuation requirements and on-site security regulations, and other appropriate permits issued by the Bureau of Land Management or other relevant federal or state agencies.  The sales price of crude oil and natural gas are not presently regulated but rather are set by the market. We cannot predict, however, whether new legislation to regulate the price of energy commodities might be proposed, what proposals, if any, might actually be enacted by Congress or the various state legislatures and what effect, if any, the proposals might have on the operations of the underlying properties.    7   Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations. The hydraulic fracturing process involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into the formation to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. Hydraulic fracturing typically is regulated by state crude oil and natural gas commissions, but the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority pursuant to the Safe Drinking Water Act over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel fuel. At the state level, several states have adopted or are considering legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, chemical disclosure and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. If new or more stringent federal, state or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we operate, we could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells. We do not use hydraulic fracturing methods in our crude oil production in California.  Operational Hazards and Insurance
  Our operations are subject to the usual hazards incident to the drilling and production of crude oil and natural gas, such as blowouts, cratering, explosions, uncontrollable flows of crude oil, natural gas or well fluids, fires and pollution and other environmental risks. These hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment, pollution or environmental damage and suspension of operation. In addition, the presence of unanticipated pressures or irregularities in formations, miscalculations, or accidents may cause our drilling activities to be unsuccessful and result in a total loss of our investment.  We maintain insurance of various types to cover our operations with policy limits and retention liability customary in the industry. We believe the coverage and types of insurance we maintain are adequate. The occurrence of a significant adverse event, the risks of which are not fully covered by insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We cannot give any assurances that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable.  Employees and Consultants
  At February 28, 2019, we had six full-time employees. Additionally, we regularly use the services of four consultants on an as-needed basis for accounting, technical, oil field, geological, investor relations and administrative services. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. In our opinion, relations with our employees are good. We may hire more employees in the future as needed. All other services are currently contracted for with independent contractors. We have not obtained key person life insurance on any of our officers or directors.  Long-Term Success
  Our long-term success depends on the successful acquisition, exploration and development of commercial grade crude oil and natural gas properties as well as the prevailing prices for crude oil and natural gas to generate future revenues and operating cash flow. Crude oil and natural gas prices are extremely volatile and have decreased significantly since June of 2014 and are affected by many factors outside of our control. The volatile nature of the energy markets makes it difficult to estimate future prices of crude oil and natural gas; however, any prolonged period of price instability, such as we have experienced since June 2014, has had and will likely continue to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Such pricing factors are beyond our control, and have resulted and will result in negative fluctuations of our earnings. We believe; however, that even in this volatile pricing environment there are significant opportunities available to us in the crude oil and natural gas exploration and development industry.
