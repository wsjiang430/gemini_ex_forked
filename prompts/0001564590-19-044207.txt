--------+---------

General
 Cabot is a global specialty chemicals and performance materials company headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts. Our principal products are rubber and specialty grade carbon blacks, specialty compounds, fumed metal oxides, activated carbons, inkjet colorants, and aerogel. Cabot and its affiliates have manufacturing facilities and operations in the United States (“U.S.”) and over 20 other countries. Cabot’s business was founded in 1882 and incorporated in the State of Delaware in 1960. The terms “Cabot”, “Company”, “we”, and “our” as used in this report refer to Cabot Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries.
 Our vision is to be the most innovative, respected and responsible leader in our markets – delivering performance that makes a difference. Our “advancing the core” corporate strategy is to extend our leadership in performance materials by investing for growth in our core businesses, driving application innovation with our customers, and generating strong cash flows through efficiency and optimization. Our products are generally based on technical expertise and innovation in one or more of our four core competencies: making and handling very fine particles; modifying the surfaces of very fine particles to alter their functionality; designing particles to impart specific properties to a formulation; and combining particles with other ingredients to deliver a formulated performance intermediate or composite. We focus on creating particles, and formulations of those particles, with the composition, morphology, and surface functionalities to deliver the requisite performance to support our customers’ existing and emerging applications.
 Through June 28, 2019, our business was organized into four reportable segments: Reinforcement Materials; Performance Chemicals; Purification Solutions; and Specialty Fluids. We divested our Specialty Fluids business as of June 28, 2019 and since that time have been organized into the three remaining segments. We routinely evaluate our portfolio in light of our growth strategy and will continue to evaluate strategic options for our Purification Solutions segment. Our business segments are discussed in more detail later in this section.

Reinforcement Materials
 Products
 Carbon black is a form of elemental carbon that is manufactured in a highly controlled process to produce particles and aggregates of varied structure and surface chemistry, resulting in many different performance characteristics for a wide variety of applications. Rubber grade carbon blacks are used to enhance the physical properties of the systems and applications in which they are incorporated.
 Our rubber blacks products are used in tires and industrial products. Rubber blacks have traditionally been used in the tire industry as a rubber reinforcing agent to increase tread durability and are also used as a performance additive to reduce rolling resistance and improve traction. In industrial products such as hoses, belts, extruded profiles and molded goods, rubber blacks are used to improve the physical performance of the product, including the product’s physical strength, fluid resistance, conductivity and resistivity.
 In addition to our rubber blacks products, we manufacture compounds of carbon black and rubber using our patented elastomer composites manufacturing process. These compounds improve abrasion/wear resistance, reduce fatigue of rubber parts and reduce rolling resistance compared to carbon black/rubber compounds made by conventional dry mix methods.
 Sales and Customers
 Sales of rubber blacks products are made by Cabot employees and through distributors and sales representatives. Sales to six major tire customers represent a material portion of Reinforcement Materials’ total net sales and operating revenues. The loss of any of these customers, or a significant reduction in volumes sold to them, could have a material adverse effect on the segment.
 Under appropriate circumstances, we have entered into supply arrangements with certain customers, the typical duration of which is one year. These arrangements typically provide for sales price adjustments to account for changes in relevant feedstock indices and, in some cases, changes in other relevant costs (such as the cost of natural gas). In fiscal 2019, approximately half of our rubber blacks volume was sold under these supply arrangements. The majority of the volumes sold under these arrangements are sold to customers in the Americas and Europe.
 We licensed our patented elastomer composites manufacturing process to Manufacture Francaise des Pneumatiques Michelin for their exclusive use in tire applications through fiscal 2017, and for a period of limited exclusivity in tire applications through fiscal 2019. As consideration, we receive quarterly royalty payments extending through calendar year 2022.
 Much of the rubber blacks we sell is used in tires and automotive products and, therefore, our financial results may be affected by the cyclical nature of the automotive industry. However, a large portion of the market for our products is in replacement tires that historically have been less subject to automotive industry cycles.
 Competition
 We are one of the leading manufacturers of carbon black in the world. We compete in the sale of carbon black with four companies that operate globally and numerous other companies that operate regionally, a number of which export product outside their country. Competition for our Reinforcement Materials products is based on product performance, quality, reliability, price, service, technical innovation, and logistics. We believe our product differentiation, technological leadership, global manufacturing presence, operations and logistics excellence and customer service provide us with a competitive advantage.
Raw Materials
 The principal raw material used in the manufacture of carbon black is composed of residual heavy oils derived from petroleum refining operations, the distillation of coal tars, and the production of ethylene throughout the world. Natural gas is also used in the production of carbon black. Raw materials are, in general, readily available and in adequate supply. Raw material costs generally are influenced by the availability of various types of carbon black feedstock and natural gas, supply and demand of such raw materials and related transportation costs. 
Operations
 We own, or have a controlling interest in, and operate plants that produce rubber blacks in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, the Czech Republic, France, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands and the U.S. An equity affiliate operates a carbon black plant in Venezuela.

During fiscal 2019, we began engineering work on an expansion of our Cilegon, Indonesia plant, which will add approximately 90,000 metric tons of capacity to our network. We anticipate that product from this expansion will be available for sale starting in 2021.
 Performance Chemicals
 Our Performance Chemicals reporting segment is organized into two businesses: our Performance Additives business and our Formulated Solutions business. Our Performance Additives business combines our specialty grades of carbon black, fumed metal oxides and aerogel product lines, and our Formulated Solutions business combines our specialty compounds and inkjet product lines.
 In Performance Chemicals, we design, manufacture and sell materials that deliver performance in a broad range of customer applications across the automotive, construction, infrastructure, energy, inkjet printing, electronics, and consumer products sectors. Our focus areas for growth include carbon additives and other materials for battery applications, inks and dispersions for packaging applications, and conductive compounds for various plastics applications. 
 Products
 Performance Additives Business
 Carbon black is a form of elemental carbon that is manufactured in a highly controlled process to produce particles and aggregates of varied structure and surface chemistry, resulting in many different performance characteristics for a wide variety of applications.
 Our specialty grades of carbon black are used to impart color, provide rheology control, enhance conductivity and static charge control, provide UV protection, enhance mechanical properties, and provide formulation flexibility through surface treatment. These specialty carbon products are used in a wide variety of applications, such as inks, coatings, plastics, adhesives, toners, batteries, and displays.
 Fumed silica is an ultra-fine, high-purity particle used as a reinforcing, thickening, abrasive, thixotropic, suspending or anti-caking agent in a wide variety of products for the automotive, construction, microelectronics, batteries, and consumer products industries. These products include adhesives, sealants, cosmetics, batteries, inks, toners, silicone elastomers, coatings, polishing slurries and pharmaceuticals. Fumed alumina, also an ultra-fine, high-purity particle, is used as an abrasive, absorbent or barrier agent in a variety of products, such as inkjet media, lighting, coatings, cosmetics and polishing slurries.
 Aerogel is a hydrophobic, silica-based particle with a high surface area that is used in a variety of thermal insulation and specialty chemical applications. In the building and construction industry, the product is used in insulative sprayable plasters and composite building products, as well as translucent skylight, window, wall and roof systems for insulating eco-daylighting applications. In the specialty chemicals industry, the product is used to provide matte finishing, insulating and thickening properties for use in a variety of applications.
 Formulated Solutions Business
 Our masterbatch and conductive compound products, which we refer to as “specialty compounds”, are formulations derived from specialty grades of carbon black mixed with polymers and other additives. These products are generally used by plastic resin producers and converters in applications for the automotive, industrial, packaging, infrastructure, agriculture, consumer products, and electronics industries. As an alternative to directly mixing specialty carbon blacks, these formulations offer greater ease of handling and help customers achieve their desired levels of dispersion and color and manage the addition of small doses of additives. In addition, our electrically conductive compound products generally are used to help ensure uniform conductive performance and reduce risks associated with electrostatic discharge in plastics applications.

Our inkjet colorants are high-quality pigment-based black and color dispersions based on our patented carbon black surface modification technology. The dispersions are used in aqueous inkjet inks to impart color, sharp print characteristics and durability, while maintaining high printhead reliability. These products are used in various inkjet printing applications, including commercial printing, small office/home office and corporate office, that all require a high level of dispersibility and colloidal stability. Our inkjet inks, which utilize our pigment-based colorant dispersions, are used in the commercial printing segment for digital print.
 Sales and Customers
 Sales of these products are made by Cabot employees and through distributors and sales representatives. In our specialty carbons and specialty compounds product lines, sales are generally to a broad number of customers. In our fumed metal oxides product line, sales under contracts with two customers have accounted for a substantial portion of the revenue.
Competition
 We are a leading producer of the products we sell in this segment. We compete in the sale of carbon black with four companies that operate globally and numerous other companies that operate regionally, a number of which export product outside their region. For fumed silica, we compete primarily with two companies with a global presence and several other companies which have a regional presence. For aerogel, we compete principally with one other company that produces aerogel products. We also compete with non-aerogel insulation products manufactured by regional companies throughout the world. For specialty compounds, competition is fragmented and we compete with many regional companies and a small number of global companies. Our inkjet colorants and inks are designed to replace traditional pigment dispersions and dyes used in inkjet printing applications. Competitive products for inkjet colorants are organic dyes and other dispersed pigments manufactured and marketed by large chemical companies and small independent producers. 
 Competition for our Performance Chemicals products is based on product performance, quality, reliability, service, technical innovation and price. We believe our product differentiation, technological leadership, operations excellence and customer service provide us with a competitive advantage.
 Raw Materials
 Raw materials for our products are, in general, readily available and in adequate supply. The principal raw material used in the manufacture of carbon black is composed of residual heavy oils derived from petroleum refining operations, the distillation of coal tars, and the production of ethylene throughout the world. Natural gas is also used in the production of carbon black. These raw material costs generally are influenced by the availability of various types of carbon black feedstock and natural gas, supply and demand of such raw materials and related transportation costs. 
 Raw materials for the production of fumed silica are various chlorosilane feedstocks. We purchase feedstocks and for certain customers convert their feedstock to product on a fee-basis (so called “toll conversion”). We also purchase aluminum chloride as feedstock for the production of fumed alumina. We have long-term procurement contracts or arrangements in place for the purchase of fumed silica feedstock, which we believe will enable us to meet our raw material requirements for the foreseeable future. In addition, we buy some raw materials in the spot market to help ensure flexibility and minimize costs. The principal raw materials for the production of aerogel are silica sol and/or sodium silicate.
 The primary raw materials used for our specialty compounds include carbon black, primarily sourced from our carbon black plants, prime and recycled thermoplastic resins and mineral fillers supplied from various sources. Raw materials for inkjet colorants include carbon black sourced from our carbon black plants, organic pigments and other treating agents available from various sources. Raw materials for inkjet inks include pigment dispersions, solvents and other additives.
 Operations
 We own, or have a controlling interest in, and operate plants that produce specialty grades of carbon black primarily in China, the Netherlands and the U.S. We also own, or have a controlling interest in, manufacturing plants that produce fumed metal oxides in China, Germany, the United Kingdom (“U.K”), and the U.S. and a manufacturing plant that produces aerogel in Frankfurt, Germany. An equity affiliate operates a fumed metal oxides plant in India. Our specialty compounds are predominately produced in facilities that we own, or have a controlling interest in, located in Belgium, Canada, China and the United Arab Emirates. Our inkjet colorants and inks are manufactured at our facility in the U.S.

We are investing for growth in our core businesses with a number of capacity expansion projects. In September 2018, we acquired NSCC Carbon (Jiangsu) Co., Ltd. from Nippon Steel Carbon Co., Ltd., a subsidiary of Nippon Steel Chemical & Material Co., Ltd., adding to our portfolio a 50,000-metric ton facility in Pizhou, Jiangsu Province, China. We plan to modify this facility to produce specialty carbons, and expect production to begin in 2021. In addition, during fiscal 2018, we purchased Tech Blend, a leading North American producer of black masterbatches, extending our geographic footprint in black masterbatch and compounds. The acquisition added a manufacturing facility in Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Québec, Canada to our manufacturing network. In June 2019, we acquired certain intangible assets from a leading masterbatch producer in Asia, which extends our global footprint in black masterbatch.
 We also continue to expand our fumed silica manufacturing capacity, with new plants in Wuhai, China and Carrollton, Kentucky, U.S. In fiscal 2019, we completed construction and began operations at our facility in Wuhai, and we expect construction of our facility in Carrollton, which is adjacent to DowDuPont’s existing silicone monomer plant, to be completed in 2020.
 Purification Solutions
 Products
 Activated carbon is a porous material consisting mainly of elemental carbon treated with heat, steam and/or chemicals to create high internal porosity, resulting in a large internal surface area that resembles a sponge. It is generally produced in two forms, powdered and granular, and is manufactured in different sizes, shapes and levels of purity and using a variety of raw materials for a wide variety of applications. Activated carbon is used to remove contaminants from liquids and gases using a process called adsorption, whereby the interconnected pores of activated carbon trap contaminants.
 Our activated carbon products are used for the purification of water, air, food and beverages, pharmaceuticals and other liquids and gases, as either a colorant or a decolorizing agent in the manufacture of products for food and beverage applications and as a chemical carrier in slow release applications. In gas and air applications, one of the uses of activated carbon is for the removal of mercury in flue gas streams. In certain applications, used activated carbon can be reactivated for further use by removing the contaminants from the pores of the activated carbon product. The most common applications for our reactivated carbon are water treatment and food and beverage purification. In addition to our activated carbon production and reactivation, we also provide activated carbon solutions through on-site equipment and services, including delivery systems for activated carbon injection in coal-fired utilities, mobile water filter units and carbon reactivation services.
 Sales and Customers
 Sales of activated carbon are made by Cabot employees and through distributors and sales representatives to a broad range of customers, including coal-fired utilities, food and beverage processors, water treatment plants, pharmaceutical companies and catalyst producers. Some of our sales of activated carbon are made under annual contracts or longer-term agreements, particularly in mercury removal applications.
Competition
 We are one of the leading manufacturers of activated carbon in the world. We compete in the manufacture of activated carbon with a number of companies, some of which have a global presence and others that have a regional or local presence, although not all of these companies manufacture activated carbon for the range of applications for which we sell our products.
 Competition for activated carbon and activated carbon equipment and services is based on quality, price, performance, and supply-chain stability. We believe our commercial strengths include our product and application diversity, product differentiation, technological leadership, and quality.
 Raw Materials
 The principal raw materials we use in the manufacture of activated carbon are various forms of coal, including lignite, wood and other carbonaceous materials, which are, in general, readily available and we believe we have in adequate supply. We also own a lignite mine that is operated by Caddo Creek Resources Company, LLC, a subsidiary of the North American Coal Company, which supplies our Marshall, Texas facility.

Operations
 We own, or have a controlling interest in, and operate plants that produce activated carbon in Italy, the Netherlands, the U.K. and the U.S. We also have joint venture interests in activated carbon plants in Canada and Mexico, and a reactivation plant in Singapore. The following table shows our ownership interest as of September 30, 2019 in activated carbon operations in which we own less than 100%:

Location | Percentage Interest 
---------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------
Estevan, Saskatchewan, Canada | 50% (contractual joint venture) 
Atitalaquia, Hidalgo, Mexico Republic of Singapore | 49% (equity affiliate) 35% (equity affiliate)

Specialty Fluids
 We divested our Specialty Fluids business on June 28, 2019. Refer to Note D of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the terms of this transaction.
 Our Specialty Fluids segment produced and marketed a range of cesium products that included cesium formate brines and other fine cesium chemicals. Cesium formate brines are used as a drilling and completion fluid primarily in high pressure and high temperature oil and gas well construction. Fine cesium chemicals are used across a wide range of industries and applications that include catalysts, doping agents and brazing fluxes.
 We sold our cesium formate products to oil and gas operating companies directly by Cabot employees and sales representatives and indirectly through oil field service companies. We generally rented cesium formate to our customers for use in drilling operations on a short-term basis and on occasion made direct sales of cesium formate outside of the rental process. After completion of a job under our rental process, the customer returned the remaining fluid to Cabot and it was reprocessed for use in subsequent well operations. Any fluid that was not returned to Cabot was paid for by the customer.
 Formate fluids compete mainly with traditional drilling fluid technologies. Competition in the well fluids business is based on product performance, quality, reliability, service, technical innovation, price, and proximity of inventory to customers’ drilling operations. 
 The principal raw material used in this business is pollucite (cesium ore). Prior to our sale of this business we owned a substantial portion of the world’s known reserves of cesium ore at our mine in Manitoba, Canada. 
 Most oil and gas well construction jobs for which cesium formate is used require a large volume of the product. Accordingly, our Specialty Fluids business maintained a large supply of fluid.
 Our mine and cesium formate and fine cesium chemical manufacturing facility were located in Manitoba, Canada, and we had fluid blending and reclamation facilities in Aberdeen, Scotland and in Bergen, Norway. In addition, we warehoused fluid and fine cesium chemical products at various locations around the world to support existing and potential operations.
 Patents and Trademarks
 We own and are a licensee of various patents, which expire at different times, covering many of our products as well as processes and product uses. Although the products made and sold under these patents and licenses are important to Cabot, the loss of any particular patent or license would not materially affect our business, taken as a whole. We sell our products under a variety of trademarks we own and take reasonable measures to protect them. While our trademarks are important to Cabot, the loss of any one of our trademarks would not materially affect our business, taken as a whole.
Seasonality
 Our businesses are generally not seasonal in nature, although we may experience some regional seasonal declines during holiday periods and some weather-related seasonality in Purification Solutions.
Backlog
 We do not consider backlog to be a significant indicator of the level of future sales activity. In general, we do not manufacture our products against a backlog of orders. Production and inventory levels are based on the level of incoming orders as well as projections of future demand. Therefore, we believe that backlog information is not material to understanding our overall business and is not a reliable indicator of our ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance.
Employees
 As of September 30, 2019, we had approximately 4,500 employees. Some of our employees in the U.S. and abroad are covered by collective bargaining or similar agreements. We believe that our relations with our employees are generally satisfactory.

Safety, Health and Environment (“SH&E”)
 Cabot has been named as a potentially responsible party under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (the “Superfund law”) and comparable state statutes with respect to several sites primarily associated with our divested businesses. (See “Legal Proceedings” below.) During the next several years, as remediation of various environmental sites is carried out, we expect to spend against our $13 million environmental reserve for costs associated with such remediation. Adjustments are made to the reserve based on our continuing analysis of our share of costs likely to be incurred at each site. Inherent uncertainties exist in these estimates due to unknown conditions at the various sites, changing governmental regulations and legal standards regarding liability, and changing technologies for handling site investigation and remediation. While the reserve represents our best estimate of the costs we expect to incur, the actual costs to investigate and remediate these sites may exceed the amounts accrued in the environmental reserve. While it is always possible that an unusual event may occur with respect to a given site and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in a particular period, we do not believe that the costs relating to these sites, in the aggregate, are likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position. Furthermore, it is possible that we may also incur future costs relating to environmental liabilities not currently known to us or as to which it is currently not possible to make an estimate.
 Our ongoing operations are subject to extensive federal, state, local, and foreign laws, regulations, rules, and ordinances relating to safety, health, and environmental matters (“SH&E Requirements”). These SH&E Requirements include requirements to obtain and comply with various environmental-related permits for constructing any new facilities and operating all of our existing facilities and for product registrations. We have expended and will continue to expend considerable sums to construct, maintain, operate, and improve facilities for safety, health and environmental protection and to comply with SH&E Requirements. We spent approximately $26 million in environmental-related capital expenditures at existing facilities in fiscal 2019. We anticipate spending approximately $58 million for such matters in fiscal 2020, a significant portion of which will be for the installation of air pollution control equipment and wastewater infrastructure improvements at certain of our plants.
 In recognition of the importance of compliance with SH&E Requirements to Cabot, our Board of Directors has a Safety, Health, Environment, and Sustainability Committee. The Committee, which is comprised of a majority of independent directors, meets regularly and oversees aspects of our sustainability program, including safety, health, and environmental performance, process safety, security, product stewardship, community engagement and governmental affairs. In particular, the Committee reviews metrics, audit results, emerging trends, overall performance, risks and opportunity assessments and management processes related to our safety, health, environmental and sustainability program. 
 The International Agency for Research on Cancer (“IARC”) classifies carbon black as a Group 2B substance (known animal carcinogen, possible human carcinogen). We have communicated IARC’s classification of carbon black to our customers and employees and have included that information in our safety data sheets and elsewhere, as appropriate. We continue to believe that the available evidence, taken as a whole, indicates that carbon black is not carcinogenic to humans, and does not present a health hazard when handled in accordance with good housekeeping and safe workplace practices as described in our safety data sheets.
 REACH (Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals), the European Union (“EU”) regulatory framework for chemicals developed by the European Commission (“EC”), applies to all chemical substances produced or imported into the EU in quantities of one metric ton a year or more. Manufacturers or importers of these chemical substances are required to submit specified health, safety, risk and use information about the substance to the European Chemical Agency (“ECHA”). We have completed all required registrations under REACH to date and will update registration dossiers as needed. Under the evaluation portion of REACH, ECHA and EU member states assess the information submitted in registration dossiers and testing proposals to determine whether the substances are safe for use. Silica is currently being evaluated and carbon black is scheduled for review in 2022. In addition, the EC is working on re-defining nanomaterial. ECHA is developing guidance on nanomaterials and additional requirements for nanomaterials that apply to many of our existing products, including carbon black, fumed silica, inkjet pigments and fumed alumina. Country-specific nanomaterial reporting programs have been implemented in some countries and are being developed by others. We will continue to monitor and address these requirements.

Environmental agencies worldwide are increasingly implementing regulations and other requirements resulting in more restrictive air emission limits globally, particularly as they relate to nitrogen oxide, sulphur dioxide and particulate matter emissions. In addition, global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions impact the carbon black and activated carbon industries as carbon dioxide is emitted from those manufacturing processes. In Europe, the EU Emission Trading Scheme applies to our four carbon black facilities and one activated carbon facility. In China, two of our carbon black facilities participate in regional pilot greenhouse gas emissions trading programs associated with the development of a national trading program. The national program was implemented on a limited scale in 2018 and 2019, with broader applicability expected in 2020. In Canada, our carbon black manufacturing facility was subject to the Province of Ontario’s emissions trading program, which was eliminated in 2018. That facility is now subject to the backstop Canadian carbon tax program. In Mexico, our carbon black facility is subject to the recently approved cap and trade pilot program. In other regions where we operate, some of our facilities are required to report their greenhouse gas emissions, but are not currently subject to programs requiring trading or emission controls. We generally expect to pay any incurred taxes or purchase emission credits, as needed, to respond to any allocation shortfalls. In addition, air emission regulations may be adopted in the future in other regions and countries where we operate, which could have an impact on our operations. Increasing regulatory programs associated with greenhouse gas emissions and concerns regarding climate change could increase our operational costs in the future.
 A number of organizations and regulatory agencies have become increasingly focused on the issue of water scarcity and water quality, particularly in certain geographic regions. We are engaged in various activities to promote water conservation and wastewater recycling. The costs associated with these activities are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our operations.
 Various U.S. agencies and international bodies have adopted security requirements applicable to certain manufacturing and industrial facilities and marine port locations. These security-related requirements involve the preparation of security assessments and security plans in some cases, and in other cases the registration of certain facilities with specified governmental authorities. We closely monitor all security-related regulatory developments and believe we are in compliance with all existing requirements. Compliance with such requirements is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our operations.
