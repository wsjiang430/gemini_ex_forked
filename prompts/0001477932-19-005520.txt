Company Overview

Banjo & Matilda founded in 2009, is a designer and retailer of its own branded cashmere apparel sold predominantly online via its web site banjoandmatilda.com. Banjo & Matilda is known as a modern luxury brand specializing in luxury casual cashmere knitwear which retails at a reduced price point as compared to the more traditional luxury brands of similar quality. It has an authentic brand heritage founded in Australia in 2009, encapsulating the iconic surf, sand, sun and healthy living lifestyle that Australia has become known for. Streamlining the production process by partnering with cashmere yarn producers in inner Mongolia (where 98% of the world’s cashmere originates), and manufacturing in specialist factories with deep knitting expertise, the Company sells directly to customers online, avoiding the typical costs of wholesale/retailer mark-up -- conveniently delivering a luxury quality product at an accessible price point.
Our Products

Banjo & Matilda offers a line of luxury women's cashmere knitwear including sweaters and pants, and accessories such as cashmere scarves, slippers, eye-masks and travel blankets.

Product Manufacturing

Banjo & Matilda use third party contract manufacturers rather than owning operating low margin manufacturing facilities itself. All yarns and fabrics are sourced from reputable suppliers. Materials used are typically the highest grade that can be sourced. Banjo & Matilda works with various manufacturers at any one time, with one manufacturer accounting for 10% or more of annual manufacturing costs; however, the Company believes that all of its manufacturers are replaceable without adversely affecting its business. Our manufacturers provide us with the speed to market necessary to respond quickly to changing trends and increased demand. While we believe that we have a good relationship with our manufacturers, we do not have any long-term agreements requiring us to use any manufacturer, and no manufacturer is required to produce our products pursuant to a long-term contract. We regularly secure and test new manufacturing partners and believe that the services of additional, or other, manufacturers and/or suppliers of our fabrics are available.
Product Distribution

The Company was founded as an e-commerce only direct to consumer model – distribution only online via its e-commerce store www.banjoandmatilda.com.

Competition

There is meaningful competition in the luxury apparel industry with emphasis on the brand image and recognition as well as product quality, style, and distribution. Banjo & Matilda successfully competes thanks to a premium and unique brand, unique designs, and attainable price points previously not available in the luxury product sector. This enables the brand to acquire and keep customers which would not typically purchase traditional luxury products due to the much higher price points. There are limited entrants into the market with similar cashmere focused e-commerce offerings which directly compete in terms of product quality and price point.
Intellectual Property

Banjo & Matilda has registered trademarks in Australia and the USA. We believe we own the material trademarks used in connection with the marketing, distribution and sale of all of our products in Australia, the United States, and Europe (and in the other countries in which our products are currently or intended to be either sold or manufactured). We also own the (i) website URL's including and associated to banjoandmatilda.com (as well as banjoandmatilda.com.au, banjoandmatilda.com, thesweaterexchange.com etc.), (ii) account “@BanjoMatilda” on Twitter, (iii) account “@Banjoandmatilda” on Instagram and (iv) Facebook page “Banjo & Matilda”. We also maintain an account on Pinterest.com.
