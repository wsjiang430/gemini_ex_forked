Item 1. | Description of Business

General.  The Company was incorporated under the laws of South Carolina on February 22, 1973 and is now one of the nation's largest small-loan consumer finance companies, offering short-term small installment loans, medium-term larger installment loans, related credit insurance and ancillary products and services to individuals. The Company offers standardized installment loans generally between $300 and $4,000, with the average loan being $1,482. The Company operates 1,193 branches in Alabama, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, New Mexico, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas, Tennessee, Utah, and Wisconsin as of March 31, 2019. The Company generally serves individuals with limited access to other sources of consumer credit such as banks, credit unions, other consumer finance businesses and credit card lenders. The Company also offers income tax return preparation services to its loan customers and other individuals.
The small-loan consumer finance industry is a highly fragmented segment of the consumer lending industry. Small-loan consumer finance companies generally make loans to individuals of less than $2,000 with maturities of less than 18 months. These companies approve loans on the basis of the personal creditworthiness of their customers and maintain close contact with borrowers to encourage the repayment or, when appropriate to meet the borrower’s needs, the refinancing of loans. By contrast, commercial banks, credit unions and other consumer finance businesses typically make loans of more than $5,000 with maturities of greater than one year. Those financial institutions generally approve consumer loans on the security of qualifying personal property pledged as collateral or impose more stringent credit requirements than those of small-loan consumer finance companies. As a result of their higher credit standards and specific collateral requirements, commercial banks, savings and loans and other consumer finance businesses typically charge lower interest rates and fees and experience lower delinquency and charge-off rates than do small-loan consumer finance companies.  Small-loan consumer finance companies generally charge higher interest rates and fees to compensate for the greater risk of delinquencies and charge-offs and increased loan administration and collection costs.
The majority of the participants in the industry are independent operators with generally less than 100 branches. We believe that competition between small-loan consumer finance companies occurs primarily on the basis of the strength of customer relationships, customer service and reputation in the local community rather than pricing, as participants in this industry generally charge interest rates and fees at, or close to, the maximum permitted by applicable state laws. We believe that our relatively large size affords us a competitive advantage over smaller companies by increasing our access to, and reducing our cost of, capital.
Small-loan consumer finance companies are subject to extensive regulation, supervision, and licensing under various federal and state statutes, ordinances, and regulations. Consumer loan offices are licensed under state laws which, in many states, establish maximum loan amounts and interest rates and the types and maximum amounts of fees and other charges. In addition, state laws govern other aspects of the operation of small-loan consumer finance companies. Periodically, constituencies within states seek to enact stricter regulations that would affect our business. Furthermore, the industry is subject to numerous federal laws and regulations that affect lending operations. These federal laws require companies to provide complete disclosure of the principal terms of each loan to the borrower in accordance with specified standards prior to the consummation of the loan transaction. Federal laws also prohibit misleading advertising, protect against discriminatory lending practices and prohibit unfair, deceptive, or abusive credit practices.
Expansion.  During fiscal 2019, the Company opened 25 new branches, purchased 17 branches, and merged or consolidated 26 branches into existing branches due to their inability to generate sufficient returns or for efficiency reasons. In fiscal 2020, the Company currently plans to open or acquire approximately 50 new branches by increasing the number of branches in its existing market areas or commencing operations in new states where it believes demographic profiles and state regulations are attractive. The Company may merge other branches on a case-by-case basis based on profitability or other factors. The Company's ability to continue existing operations and expand its operations in existing or new states is dependent upon, among other things, laws and 
4

regulations that permit the Company to operate its business profitably and its ability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals and licenses. There can be no assurance that such laws and regulations will not change in ways that adversely affect the Company or that the Company will be able to obtain any such approvals or consents. See Part 1, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” for a further discussion of risks to our business and plans for expansion.
The Company's expansion is also dependent upon its ability to identify attractive locations for new branches and to hire suitable personnel to staff, manage, and supervise new branches. In evaluating a particular community, the Company examines several factors, including the demographic profile of the community, the existence of an established small-loan consumer finance market and the availability of suitable personnel.

Loan and Other Products.  In each state in which we operate, we primarily offer pre-computed consumer installment loans that are standardized by amount and maturity. Consumer installment loans are our principal product and interest and fee income from such loans accounted for 86.2%, 86.7%, and 87.2% of our total revenues in fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. Our loans are payable in fully-amortizing monthly installments with terms generally from 6 to 36 months and are pre-payable at any time without penalty. In addition, we offer income tax preparation and filing services as well as interest and fee-free tax advance loans.

(1) Gross loan net of finance charges
Specific allowable interest, fees, and other charges vary by state and, consistent with industry practice, we generally charge at, or close to, the maximum rates allowable under applicable state law in those states that limit loan rates. The finance charge is a combination of origination or acquisition fees, account maintenance fees, monthly account handling fees, interest and other charges permitted by the relevant state laws. As of March 31, 2019, the annual percentage rates on loans we offer for small and large loans, including interest, fees and other charges as calculated in accordance with the Federal Truth in Lending Act, ranged from 25% to 199%, depending on the loan size, maturity, and the state in which the loan was made. 
As of March 31, 2019, annual percentage rates applicable to our gross loans receivable as defined by the Truth in Lending Act were as follows:

Low | | High | | Amount | Percentage of totalgross loansreceivable
25 | % | | 36 | % | $ | 304,804,497 | | 27.0 | %

The Company, as an agent for an unaffiliated insurance company, markets and sells credit life, credit accident and health, credit property and auto, unemployment, and accidental death and dismemberment insurance in connection with its loans in selected states where the sale of such insurance is permitted by law. Credit life insurance provides for the payment in full of the borrower's credit obligation to the lender in the event of death. Credit accident and health insurance provides for repayment of loan installments to the lender that come due during the insured's period of income interruption resulting from disability from illness or injury. Credit property and auto insurance insures payment of the borrower's credit obligation to the lender in the event that the personal property pledged as security by the borrower is damaged or destroyed by a covered event. Unemployment insurance provides for repayment of loan installments to the lender that come due during the insured’s period of involuntary unemployment. Accidental death and dismemberment insurance insures against unintentional death or dismemberment of the insured. The Company offers credit insurance for all loans originated in Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, and South Carolina, and on a more limited basis in Alabama, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Texas. Customers in those states typically obtain such credit insurance through the Company. Charges for such credit insurance are made at filed, authorized rates and are stated separately in the Company's disclosure to customers, as required by the Truth in Lending Act and by various applicable state laws. In the sale of insurance policies, the Company, as an agent, writes policies only within limitations established by its agency contracts with the insurer. The Company does not sell credit insurance to non-borrowers.
The Company has a wholly-owned, captive insurance subsidiary that reinsures a portion of the credit insurance sold in connection with loans made by the Company. Certain coverages currently sold by the Company on behalf of the unaffiliated insurance carrier are ceded by the carrier to the captive insurance subsidiary, providing the Company with an additional source of income derived from the earned reinsurance premiums.

The Company also offers automobile club memberships to its borrowers in Alabama, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, and Wisconsin, as an agent for an unaffiliated automobile club. Club memberships entitle members to automobile breakdown coverage, towing reimbursement and related services. The Company is paid a commission on each membership sold, but has no responsibility for administering the club, paying benefits or providing services to club members. The Company primarily sells automobile club memberships to borrowers.
The table below shows the types of insurance and ancillary products the Company sells by state as of March 31, 2019:

(1) Credit insurance is offered for certain loans.
Another service offered by the Company is income tax return preparation and electronic filing.  This program is provided in all but a few of the Company’s branches. The Company prepared approximately 91,000, 77,000 and 72,000 returns in fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. Net revenue generated by the Company from this program during fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017 amounted to approximately $21.5 million, $16.8 million, and $14.7 million, respectively. In addition, our tax customers are eligible to receive an interest and fee-free tax advance loan which is generally a percentage of the anticipated tax refund amount. The Company believes that this is a beneficial service for its existing customer base as well as non-loan customers, and it plans to continue to promote this program.
The following table sets forth information about our tax advance loan product for fiscal 2019:

Total | 876,639 | | $ | 1,287 | | $ | 1,127,957

Seasonality.  The Company's highest loan demand occurs generally from October through December, its third fiscal quarter. Loan demand is generally lowest and loan repayment highest from January to March, its fourth fiscal quarter. Consequently, the Company experiences significant seasonal fluctuations in its operating results and cash needs. Operating results for the Company's third fiscal quarter are generally lower than in other quarters, and operating results for its fourth fiscal quarter are generally higher than in other quarters.
Lending and Collection Operations.  The Company seeks to provide short-term consumer installment loans to the segment of the population that has limited access to other sources of credit. In evaluating the creditworthiness of potential customers, the Company primarily examines the individual's discretionary income, length of current employment and/or sources of income, duration of residence, and prior credit experience. Loans are made to individuals on the basis of their discretionary income and other factors and are limited to amounts we believe that customers can reasonably be expected to repay from that income given our assessment of their stability and ability and willingness to pay. All loan applicants are required to complete standardized credit applications in person or by telephone at local Company branches. Each of the Company's local branches are equipped to perform rapid background, employment, and credit checks and approve loan applications promptly, often while the customer waits. The Company's employees verify the applicant's sources of income and credit histories through telephone checks with employers, other employment references, and verification with various credit bureaus. Substantially all new customers are required to submit a listing of personal property that will serve as collateral to secure the loan, but the Company does not rely on the value of such collateral in the loan approval process and generally does not perfect its security interest in that collateral. Accordingly, if the customer were to default in the repayment of the loan, the Company may not be able to recover the outstanding loan balance by resorting to the sale of collateral. 
The Company believes that development and continual reinforcement of personal relationships with customers improve the Company's ability to monitor their creditworthiness, reduce credit risk, and generate customer loyalty. It is not unusual for the Company to have made a number of loans to the same customer over the course of several years, many of which were refinanced with a new loan after the borrower had reduced the existing loan's outstanding balance by making multiple payments. In determining whether to refinance existing loans, the Company typically requires loans to be current on a recency basis, and repeat customers are generally required to complete a new credit application if they have not completed one within the prior two years.
Approximately 78.7%, 79.0%, and 79.7% of the Company's loans were generated through refinancings of outstanding loans and the origination of new loans to previous customers in fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. A refinancing represents a new loan transaction with a present customer in which a portion of the new loan proceeds is used to repay the balance of an existing 
9

loan and the remaining portion is advanced to the customer. The Company markets the opportunity for qualifying customers to refinance existing loans prior to maturity. In many cases the existing customer’s past performance and established creditworthiness with the Company qualifies that customer for a larger loan. This, in turn, may increase the fees and other income realized for a particular customer. For fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, the percentages of the Company's loan originations that were refinancings of existing loans were 66.2%, 65.9%, and 66.8%, respectively.
The Company allows refinancing of delinquent loans on a case-by-case basis for those customers who otherwise satisfy the Company's credit standards. Each such refinancing is carefully examined before approval in an effort to avoid increasing credit risk. A delinquent loan generally may be refinanced only if the customer has made payments that, together with any credits of insurance premiums or other charges to which the customer is entitled in connection with the refinancing, reduce the balance due on the loan to an amount equal to or less than the original cash advance made in connection with the loan. The Company does not allow the amount of the new loan to exceed the original amount of the existing loan. The Company believes that refinancing delinquent loans for certain customers who have made periodic payments allows the Company to increase its average loans outstanding and its interest, fees and other income without experiencing a significant increase in loan losses. These refinancings also provide a resolution to temporary financial setbacks for these borrowers and sustain their credit rating. Refinancings of delinquent loans represented 1.1%, 1.2%, and 1.2% of the Company’s loan volume in fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.
To reduce late payment risk, local branch staff encourage customers to inform the Company in advance of expected payment problems. Local branch staff also promptly contact delinquent customers following any payment due date and thereafter remain in close contact with such customers through phone calls or letters until payment is received or some other resolution is reached. The Company expanded our centralized collections in fiscal 2018, focusing on customers who have become more than 90 days past due on a recency basis. In Alabama, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Utah, and Wisconsin, the Company is permitted under state laws to garnish customers' wages for repayment of loans, but the Company does not otherwise generally resort to litigation for collection purposes and rarely attempts to foreclose on collateral.
Insurance-related Operations.  As discussed above, in certain states, the Company sells credit insurance to customers in connection with its loans as an agent for an unaffiliated insurance company. These insurance policies provide for the payment of the outstanding balance of the Company's loan upon the occurrence of an insured event. The Company earns a commission on the sale of such credit insurance, which, for most products, is directly impacted by the claims experience of the insurance company on policies sold on its behalf by the Company. In states where commissions on certain products are capped, the commission earned is not directly impacted by the claims experience.
The Company has a wholly-owned, captive insurance subsidiary that reinsures a portion of the credit insurance sold in connection with loans made by the Company. Certain coverages currently sold by the Company on behalf of the unaffiliated insurance carrier are ceded by the carrier to the captive insurance subsidiary, providing the Company with an additional source of income derived from the earned reinsurance premiums. In fiscal 2019, the captive insurance subsidiary reinsured approximately 10.1% of the credit insurance sold by the Company and contributed approximately $1.8 million to the Company's total revenue.
Non-Filing Insurance.  The Company typically does not perfect its security interest in collateral securing its smaller loans by filing UCC financing statements. Non-filing insurance premiums are equal in aggregate amount to the premiums paid by the Company to purchase non-filing insurance coverage from an unaffiliated insurance company. Under its non-filing insurance coverage, the Company is reimbursed for losses on loans resulting from its policy not to perfect its security interest in collateral securing the loans.
Information Technology. ParaData Financial Systems, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, is a financial services software company headquartered near St. Louis, Missouri. The Company uses the proprietary data processing software package developed by ParaData, to fully automate all of its loan account processing and collection reporting.
Monitoring and Supervision.  The Company's loan operations are organized into Southeastern, Central, and Western Divisions. As of March 31, 2019 the Southeastern Division consisted of Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, South Carolina and Tennessee; the Central Division consisted of Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, Oklahoma and Wisconsin; and the Western Division consisted of Idaho, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico, Texas, and Utah. Several levels of management monitor and supervise the operations of each of the Company's branches. Branch managers are directly responsible for the performance of their respective branches. District supervisors are responsible for the performance of 8 to 11 branches in their districts. They typically communicate with the branch managers of each of their branches at least weekly and visit the branches at least monthly. The Vice Presidents of Operations monitor the performance of all branches within their states (or partial state in the case of Texas), primarily through communication with district supervisors. These Vice Presidents of Operations typically communicate with the district supervisors of each of their 
10

districts weekly and regularly visit branches. The Senior Vice Presidents of each of the Southeastern, Central, and Western Divisions are responsible for supervising the Vice Presidents of Operations.
Senior management has access to daily delinquency, loan volume, charge-off, and other statistical data on a consolidated, state and branch level. At least eight times per fiscal year district supervisors examine the operations of each branch in their geographic area and submit standardized reports detailing their findings to the Company's senior management. At least once per year each branch undergoes an audit by the Company's internal auditors. These audits include an examination of cash balances and compliance with Company loan approval, review and collection procedures, and compliance with federal and state laws and regulations.
Staff and Training.  Local branches are generally staffed with two to four employees. The branch manager supervises operations of the branch and is responsible for approving all borrower loan applications and requests for increases in the amount of credit extended. Each branch generally has one or two branch service representatives who take loan applications, process loan applications, apply payments, and assist in the preparation of operational reports, collection efforts and marketing activities. Larger branches may employ additional branch service representatives.
New employees are required to review detailed training materials that explain the Company's operating policies and procedures. The Company tests each employee on the training materials during the first year of employment. In addition, each branch associate completes an online training session once every week and attends periodic training sessions outside the branch. The Company has also implemented an enhanced training tool known as World University, which provides continuous, real-time, on-line training to all locations. This allows for more training opportunities to be available to all employees throughout the course of their career with the Company.
Advertising.  The Company actively advertises through direct mail, targeting both its present and former customers and potential customers who have used other sources of consumer credit. The Company obtains or acquires mailing lists from third party sources. In addition to the general promotion of its loans for last-minute needs, back-to-school needs and other uses, the Company advertises extensively during the October through December holiday season and in connection with new branch openings. The Company also advertises across digital platforms, by email and to existing customers via SMS/text.  The Company believes its advertising contributes significantly to its ability to compete effectively with other providers of small-loan consumer credit. Advertising expenses as a percent of revenue were approximately 4.1%, 4.2%, and 3.4% in fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.
Competition.  The small-loan consumer finance industry is highly fragmented, with numerous competitors. The majority of the Company's competitors are independent operators with generally less than 100 branches. Competition from community banks and credit unions is limited because they typically do not make loans of less than $5,000. We believe that online lending could be affecting the consumer lending market within which we operate. While it appears that online lenders are marketing to a different customer segment than that of our primary customers, some of our customers may overlap.
The Company believes that competition between small-loan consumer finance companies occurs primarily on the basis of the strength of customer relationships, customer service, and reputation in the local community rather than pricing, as participants in this industry generally all charge interest rates and fees at or close to the maximum permitted by applicable laws. The Company believes that its relatively larger size affords it a competitive advantage over smaller companies by increasing its access to, and reducing its cost of, capital.  
Several of the states in which the Company currently operates limit the size of loans made by small-loan consumer finance companies and prohibit the extension of more than one loan to a customer by any one company. As a result, many customers borrow from more than one finance company, which enables the Company, subject to the limitations of various consumer protection and privacy statutes, including, but not limited to, the Fair Credit Reporting Act and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, to obtain information on the credit history of specific customers from other consumer finance companies.
Employees.  As of March 31, 2019, the Company had 3,624 employees, none of whom were represented by labor unions. The Company considers its relations with its employees to be good. The Company seeks to hire people who will become long-term employees, and, as a result, the vast majority of our field leadership has been promoted from within.

Government Regulation.
Operations.  Small-loan consumer finance companies are subject to extensive regulation, supervision, and licensing under various federal and state statutes, ordinances, and regulations. In many cases these statutes establish maximum loan amounts and interest rates and the types and maximum amounts of fees and other charges. In addition, state laws regulate collection procedures, the keeping of books and records, and other aspects of the operation of small-loan consumer finance companies. Generally, state regulations also establish minimum capital requirements for each local branch. Accordingly, the ability of the Company to expand by acquiring existing branches and opening new branches will depend in part on obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals.
For example, Texas regulation requires the approval of the Texas Consumer Credit Commissioner for the acquisition, directly or indirectly, of more than 10% of the voting or common stock of a consumer finance company. A Louisiana statute prohibits any person from acquiring control of 50% or more of the shares of stock of a licensed consumer lender, such as the Company, without first obtaining a license as a consumer lender. The overall effect of these laws, and similar laws in other states, is to make it more difficult to acquire a consumer finance company than it might be to acquire control of an unregulated corporation.
All of the Company's branches are licensed under the laws of the state in which the branch is located. Licenses in these states are subject to renewal every year and may be revoked for failure to comply with applicable state and federal laws and regulations. In the states in which the Company currently operates, licenses may be revoked only after an administrative hearing.
The Company and its operations are regulated by several state agencies, including the following:

• | The Alabama State Banking Department


• | The Industrial Loan Division of the Office of the Georgia Insurance Commissioner


• | The Idaho Department of Finance


• | The Consumer Credit Division of the Illinois Department of Financial Institutions


• | The Indiana Department of Financial Institutions


• | The Kentucky Department of Financial Institutions


• | The Louisiana Office of Financial Institutions


• | The Mississippi Department of Banking and Consumer Finance


• | The Missouri Division of Finance


• | The Financial Institutions Division of the New Mexico Regulation and Licensing Department


• | The Oklahoma Department of Consumer Credit


• | The Consumer Finance Division of the South Carolina Board of Financial Institutions and the South Carolina Department of Consumer Affairs


• | The Tennessee Department of Financial Institutions


• | The Texas Office of the Consumer Credit Commissioner


• | The Utah Department of Financial Institutions


• | The Wisconsin Department of Financial Institutions

These state regulatory agencies audit the Company's local branches from time to time, and each state agency performs an annual compliance audit of the Company's operations in that state.
Insurance. The Company is also subject to state regulations governing insurance agents in the states in which it sells credit insurance. State insurance regulations require that insurance agents be licensed, govern the commissions that may be paid to agents in connection with the sale of credit insurance and limit the premium amount charged for such insurance. The Company's captive insurance subsidiary is regulated by the insurance authorities of the Turks and Caicos Islands of the British West Indies, where the subsidiary is organized and domiciled.
Consumer finance companies are affected by changes in state and federal statutes and regulations.  The Company actively participates in trade associations and in lobbying efforts in the states in which it operates and at the federal level. There have been, and the Company expects that there will continue to be, media attention, initiatives, discussions, proposals, and legislation regarding the entire consumer credit industry, as well as our particular installment loan business, and possible significant changes to the laws and regulations that govern our business, or the authority exercised pursuant to those laws and regulations. In some cases, proposed or pending legislative or regulatory changes have been introduced that would, if enacted,  have a material adverse effect on, or possibly even eliminate, our ability to continue our current business. We can give no assurance that the laws and regulations that govern our business, or the interpretation or administration of those laws and regulations, will remain unchanged or that any such future changes will not materially and adversely affect, or in the worst case, eliminate, the Company’s lending practices, operations, profitability, or prospects. See "State legislation" and “Federal legislation” below and Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” for a further discussion of the potential impact of regulatory changes on our business.

State legislation.  The Company is subject to numerous state laws and regulations that affect our lending activities. Many of these regulations impose detailed and complex constraints on the terms of our loans, lending forms and operations. Further, there is a trend of increased state regulation on loan origination, servicing, and collection procedures, as well as more detailed reporting and examinations, and coordination of examinations among the states. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to regulatory enforcement action that could result in the assessment against us of civil, monetary, or other penalties.
In addition, state authorities regulate and supervise our insurance operations. The extent of such regulation varies by product and by state, but relate primarily to the following: licensing; conduct of business, including marketing and sales practices; periodic financial and market conduct examination of the affairs of insurers; form and content of required financial reports; standards of solvency; limitations on the payment of dividends and other affiliate transactions; types of products offered; approval of policy forms and premium rates; formulas used to calculate any unearned premium refund due to an insured customer; permissible investments; deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders; reserve requirements for unearned premiums, losses, and other purposes; and claims processing.
In the past, several state legislative and regulatory proposals have been introduced which, had they become law, would have had a materially adverse impact on our operations and ability to continue to conduct business in the relevant state. Although to date none of these state initiatives have been successful, state legislatures continue to receive pressure to adopt similar legislation that would affect our lending operations. For example, in Missouri, following a 2013 failed ballot initiative, the same proponents again commenced ballot initiatives to legislatively cap annual interest rates at 36% and to constitutionally impose other interest rate limitations. The proponents of the rate cap did not obtain sufficient signatures on this initiative to have it placed on the November 2014 election ballot. A similar attempt to introduce rate cap legislation was initiated in New Mexico, but was tabled in early February 2015 by a legislative committee. There can be no assurance that proponents of these or similar initiatives will not pursue them and be successful in the future. 

In addition, any adverse change in existing laws or regulations, or any adverse interpretation or litigation relating to existing laws and regulations in any state in which we operate, could subject us to liability for prior operating activities or could lower or eliminate the profitability of our operations going forward by, among other things, reducing the amount of interest and fees we can charge in connection with our loans. If these or other factors lead us to close our branches in a state, then in addition to the loss of net revenues attributable to that closing, we would also incur closing costs such as lease cancellation payments, and we would have to write off assets that we could no longer use. If we were to suspend rather than permanently cease our operations in a state, we may also have continuing costs associated with maintaining our branches and our employees in that state, with little or no revenues to offset those costs.
Federal legislation.  In addition to state and local laws and regulations, we are subject to numerous federal laws and regulations that affect our lending operations. These laws include the Truth in Lending Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Military Lending Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, and the regulations thereunder, and the Federal Trade Commission's Credit Practices Rule.  These laws require the Company to provide complete disclosure of the principal terms of each loan to the borrower prior to the consummation of the loan transaction, prohibit misleading advertising, protect against discriminatory lending practices, and prohibit unfair, deceptive, or abusive credit practices. Among the principal disclosure items under the Truth in Lending Act and the CFPB's Regulation Z, which implements this statute, are the terms of repayment, the final maturity, the total finance charge, and the annual percentage rate charged on each loan. The Equal Credit Opportunity Act prohibits creditors from discriminating against loan applicants on, among other things, the basis of race, color, sex, age, or marital status. Pursuant to Regulation B promulgated under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, creditors are required to make certain disclosures regarding consumer rights and advise consumers whose credit applications are not approved of the reasons for the rejection. The Military Lending Act applies to active-duty service members and their covered dependents. We are prohibited from charging a borrower covered under the Military Lending Act more than a 36% Military Annual Percentage Rate, which includes certain costs associated with the loan in calculating the interest rate. The Fair Credit Reporting Act, which among other things, governs the use of credit bureau reports and reporting information to credit bureaus. Additionally, the Fair Credit Reporting Act requires the Company to provide certain information to consumers whose credit applications are not approved on the basis of a report obtained from a consumer reporting agency and to provide additional information to those borrowers whose loans are approved and consummated if the credit decision was based in whole or in part on the contents of a credit report. The Credit Practices Rule limits the types of property a creditor may accept as collateral to secure a consumer loan. Violations of these statutes and regulations may result in actions for damages, claims for refund of payments made, certain fines and penalties, injunctions against certain practices, and the potential forfeiture of rights to repayment of loans.
Although these laws and regulations remained substantially unchanged for many years, over the last several years the laws and regulations directly affecting our lending activities have been under review and are subject to change as a result of various developments and changes in economic conditions, the make-up of the executive and legislative branches of government, and the political and media focus on issues of consumer and borrower protection. See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors—Media and public

characterization of consumer installment loans as being predatory or abusive could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations, and financial condition” below. Any changes in such laws and regulations could force us to modify, suspend, or cease part or, in the worst case, all of our existing operations. It is also possible that the scope of federal regulations could change or expand in such a way as to preempt what has traditionally been state law regulation of our business activities. The enactment of one or more of such regulatory changes could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and prospects.
Various legislative proposals addressing consumer credit transactions have been passed in recent years or are currently pending in the U.S. Congress. Congressional members continue to receive pressure from consumer activists and other industry opposition groups to adopt legislation to address various aspects of consumer credit transactions. As part of a sweeping package of financial industry reform regulations, in July 2010 Congress passed and the President signed into law the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”). The Dodd-Frank Act established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (commonly referred to as the CFPB), which has sweeping regulatory, supervisory, and enforcement powers over providers of consumer financial products and services, including explicit supervisory authority to examine and require registration of non-depository lenders and to promulgate rules that can affect the practices and activities of lenders. The CFPB continues to actively engage in the announcement and implementation of various plans and initiatives in the area of consumer financial transactions generally. Some of these CFPB announced plans and initiatives, if implemented, would directly affect certain loan products we currently offer and subject us to the CFPB’s supervisory authority. See Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Regulatory Matters,” for more information regarding the CFPB's regulatory initiatives.
The Dodd-Frank Act also gives the CFPB the authority to examine and regulate large non-depository financial companies and gives the CFPB authority over anyone deemed by rule to be a “larger participant of a market for other consumer financial products or services.” The CFPB contemplates regulating the installment lending industry as part of the “consumer credit and related activities” market. However, this so-called “larger participant rule” will not impose substantive consumer protection requirements, but rather will provide to the CFPB the authority to supervise larger participants in certain markets, including by requiring reports and conducting examinations to ensure, among other things, that they are complying with existing federal consumer financial law. While the CFPB has defined a “larger participant” standard for certain markets, such as the debt collection, automobile finance, and consumer reporting markets, it has not yet acted to define “larger participant” in the traditional installment lending market. If, in the future, a traditional installment lending “larger participant rule” is promulgated by the CFPB, the rule would likely cover only the largest installment lenders, and we do not yet know whether the definition of larger participant would cover us. 
In addition to the grant of certain regulatory powers to the CFPB, the Dodd-Frank Act gives the CFPB authority to pursue administrative proceedings or litigation for violations of federal consumer financial laws. In these proceedings, the CFPB can obtain cease and desist orders (which can include orders for restitution or rescission of contracts, as well as other kinds of affirmative relief) and monetary penalties. Also, where a company has violated Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act or CFPB regulations thereunder, the Dodd-Frank Act empowers state attorneys general and state regulators to bring civil actions to remedy violations of state law.
Although the Dodd-Frank Act prohibits the CFPB from setting interest rates on consumer loans, efforts to create a federal usury cap, applicable to all consumer credit transactions and substantially below rates at which the Company could continue to operate profitably, are still ongoing. Any federal legislative or regulatory action that severely restricts or prohibits the provision of small-loan consumer credit and similar services on terms substantially similar to those we currently provide would, if enacted, have a material, adverse impact on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition. Any federal law that would impose a national 36% or similar annualized credit rate cap on our services would, if enacted, almost certainly eliminate our ability to continue our current operations. See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors - Federal legislative or regulatory proposals, initiatives, actions or changes that are adverse to our operations or result in adverse regulatory proceedings, or our failure to comply with existing or future federal laws and regulations, could force us to modify, suspend, or cease part or all of our nationwide operations,” for further information regarding the potential impact of adverse legislative and regulatory changes.
