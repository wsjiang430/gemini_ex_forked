DESCRIPTION OF GOODYEAR’S BUSINESS
GENERAL INFORMATION REGARDING OUR SEGMENTS
For the year ended December 31, 2018, we operated our business through three operating segments representing our regional tire businesses: Americas; Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”); and Asia Pacific.
Our principal business is the development, manufacture, distribution and sale of tires and related products and services worldwide. We manufacture and market numerous lines of rubber tires for:

• | automobiles


• | trucks


• | buses


• | aircraft


• | motorcycles


• | earthmoving and mining equipment


• | farm implements


• | industrial equipment, and


• | various other applications.

In each case, our tires are offered for sale to vehicle manufacturers for mounting as original equipment (“OE”) and for replacement worldwide. We manufacture and sell tires under the Goodyear, Dunlop, Kelly, Debica, Sava and Fulda brands and various other Goodyear owned “house” brands, and the private-label brands of certain customers. In certain geographic areas we also:

• | retread truck, aviation and off-the-road ("OTR") tires,


• | manufacture and sell tread rubber and other tire retreading materials,


• | sell chemical products, and/or


• | provide automotive and commercial repair services and miscellaneous other products and services.

 1

Our principal products are new tires for most applications. Approximately 85% of our sales in 2018, and 87% of our sales in 2017 and 2016 were for new tires. Sales of chemical products and natural rubber to unaffiliated customers were 4% in 2018, and 3% in 2017 and 2016, of our consolidated sales (7%, 6% and 5% of Americas total sales in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively). The percentages of each segment’s sales attributable to new tires during the periods indicated were:

 | Year Ended December 31,
Sales of New Tires By | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016
Americas | 79 | % | | 81 | % | 82 | %
Europe, Middle East and Africa | 94 | | | 94 | | 94 | 
Asia Pacific | 91 | | | 90 | | 89 | 

Each segment exports tires to other segments. The financial results of each segment exclude sales of tires exported to other segments, but include operating income derived from such transactions.
Goodyear does not include motorcycle, aviation, race or all-terrain vehicle tires in reported tire unit sales.
Tire unit sales for each segment during the periods indicated were:

New tires are sold under highly competitive conditions throughout the world. On a worldwide basis, we have two major competitors: Bridgestone (based in Japan) and Michelin (based in France). Other significant competitors include Continental, Cooper, Hankook, Kumho, Pirelli, Sumitomo, Toyo, Yokohama and various regional tire manufacturers.
We compete with other tire manufacturers on the basis of product design, performance, price and terms, reputation, warranty terms, customer service and consumer convenience. Goodyear and Dunlop brand tires enjoy a high recognition factor and have a reputation for performance and product design. The Kelly, Debica, Sava and Fulda brands and various house brand tire lines offered by us, and tires manufactured and sold by us to private brand customers, compete primarily on the basis of value and price.
We do not consider our tire businesses to be seasonal to any significant degree.
AMERICAS
Americas, our largest segment in terms of revenue, develops, manufactures, distributes and sells tires and related products and services in North, Central and South America, and sells tires to various export markets, primarily through intersegment sales. Americas manufactures tires in six plants in the United States, two plants in Canada and five plants in Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru.

remedy tire safety defects without charge for five years and comply with revised and more rigorous tire testing standards. NHTSA is also in the process of establishing national tire labeling regulations, under which certain tires sold in the United States will be required to be rated for rolling resistance, traction and tread wear.
Our Brazilian operations are subject to a tire certification and labeling regulation which requires that consumers be informed about rolling resistance, wet grip braking and noise characteristics. The tire certification and labeling regulation applies to all radial passenger car, light truck and commercial truck tires sold in Brazil.

GENERAL BUSINESS INFORMATION
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
The principal raw materials used by Goodyear are synthetic and natural rubber. Synthetic rubber accounts for approximately 55% of all rubber consumed by us on an annual basis. Our plants located in Beaumont and Houston, Texas supply a major portion of our global synthetic rubber requirements. We purchase all of our requirements for natural rubber in the world market.
Other important raw materials and components we use are carbon black, steel cord, fabrics and petrochemical-based commodities. Substantially all of these raw materials and components are purchased from independent suppliers, except for certain chemicals we manufacture. We purchase most raw materials and components in significant quantities from several suppliers, except in those instances where only one or a few qualified sources are available. We anticipate the continued availability of all raw materials and components we will require during 2019, subject to spot shortages and unexpected disruptions caused by natural disasters such as hurricanes and other events.
Substantial quantities of fuel and other petrochemical-based commodities are used in the production of tires, synthetic rubber and other products. Supplies of such fuels and commodities have been and are expected to continue to be available to us in quantities sufficient to satisfy our anticipated requirements, subject to spot shortages.
 5

Patents and Trademarks
We own approximately 1,800 product, process and equipment patents issued by the United States Patent Office and approximately 3,400 patents issued or granted in other countries around the world. We have approximately 400 applications for United States patents pending and approximately 1,200 patent applications on file in other countries around the world. While such patents and patent applications as a group are important, we do not consider any patent or patent application to be of such importance that the loss or expiration thereof would materially affect Goodyear or any business segment.
We own, control or use approximately 1,500 different trademarks, including several using the word “Goodyear” or the word “Dunlop.” Approximately 8,400 registrations and 400 pending applications worldwide protect these trademarks. While such trademarks as a group are important, the only trademarks we consider material to our business, or to the business of any of our segments, are those using the word “Goodyear,” and with respect to certain of our international business segments, those using the word “Dunlop.” We believe our trademarks are valid and most are of unlimited duration as long as they are adequately protected and appropriately used.
Backlog
Our backlog of orders is not considered material to, or a significant factor in, evaluating and understanding any of our business segments or our businesses considered as a whole.
Employees
At December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 64,000 full-time and temporary people throughout the world, including approximately 38,000 people covered under collective bargaining agreements. Approximately 7,000 of our employees in the United States are covered by a master collective bargaining agreement with the United Steelworkers ("USW"), which expires in July 2022. In addition, approximately 1,000 of our employees in the United States are covered by other contracts with the USW and various other unions. Approximately 15,000 of our employees outside of the United States are covered by union contracts that currently have expired or that will expire in 2019, primarily in Luxembourg, China, South Africa, France and Turkey. Unions represent a major portion of our employees in the United States and Europe.
Compliance with Environmental Regulations
We are subject to extensive regulation under environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations. These laws and regulations relate to, among other things, air emissions, discharges to surface and underground waters and the generation, handling, storage, transportation and disposal of waste materials and hazardous substances. We have several continuing programs designed to ensure compliance with federal, state and local environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations. We expect capital expenditures for pollution control facilities and occupational safety and health projects to be $40 million annually in 2019 and 2020.
We also incur ongoing expenses to maintain and operate our pollution control facilities and conduct our other environmental activities, including the control and disposal of hazardous substances. These expenditures are expected to be sufficient to comply with existing environmental laws and regulations and are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive position.
In the future, we may incur increased costs and additional charges associated with environmental compliance and cleanup projects necessitated by the identification of new waste sites, the impact of new environmental laws and regulatory standards, or the availability of new technologies. Compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations in the future may require a material increase in our capital expenditures and could adversely affect our earnings and competitive position.
