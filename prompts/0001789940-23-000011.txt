Item 1. Business
First Watch Restaurant Group, Inc. is a Delaware holding company that was acquired by funds affiliated with or managed by Advent International Corporation (“Advent”) in August 2017 (the “Advent Acquisition”). Unless the context otherwise requires, “we,” “us,” “our,” “First Watch,” the “Company,” “Management” and other similar references refer to First Watch Restaurant Group, Inc. and, unless otherwise stated, all of its subsidiaries. 
Overview 
Since opening our doors in 1983, we have been a pioneer in Daytime Dining, serving made-to-order breakfast, brunch and lunch using the freshest of ingredients. We have built our brand on our commitment to operational excellence, our culinary mission centered around a fresh, continuously evolving menu, and our “You First” culture. Our focus on one daytime shift enables us to optimize restaurant operations while generating an average unit volume of $2.0 million per restaurant in 2022 in only 7.5 hours per day. This daytime focus also provides us with a competitive advantage allowing us to attract and retain employees who are passionate about hospitality and drawn to our “No Night Shifts Ever” approach. 
As of December 25, 2022, we had a total of 474 restaurants across 29 states, 366 of which were company-owned and 108 were franchise-owned. 
Our Promise: Yeah, It’s Fresh! 
At First Watch, we take a creative approach to Daytime Dining led by our commitment to freshness. Each item is made-to-order and prepared with care. We do not use microwave ovens, heat lamps or deep fryers in our kitchens. Every morning, we arrive at the crack of dawn to slice and juice fresh fruits and vegetables, bake muffins, brew our fresh coffee and whip up our French Toast batter from scratch. Our award-winning chef-driven menu includes elevated executions of classic favorites for breakfast, brunch and lunch, along with First Watch-specific specialties such as our protein-packed Breakfast Quinoa, Farmstand Breakfast Tacos, Avocado Toast, Morning Meditation (juiced in-house daily), our Pomegranate Sunrise, Chickichangas and our famous Million Dollar Bacon. While our menu constantly evolves, our promise of freshness never wavers.
Our Culture: You First 
For four decades, we have cultivated an organizational culture built on our foundational concept of “You First,” which puts serving others above all else. As a company, we put our employees first and empower them to do whatever it takes to put our customers first. We also work hard to provide an opportunity for limitless growth and meaningful relationships, and we prioritize personal and professional growth so that our people can thrive. We believe our approach and operating model have enabled us to retain and attract the best and brightest employees in the industry and are key factors in our ability to meet the growing demand we are seeing across the country. In 2022, a five-year longitudinal study of employee surveys on Glassdoor published by William Blair ranked us #1 for work/life balance and we were in the top 10 in overall employee satisfaction, among casual dining concepts. Also in 2022, First Watch was recognized with ADP’s Culture at Work Award and named a Top 100 Most Loved Workplace ® by Newsweek and the Best Practice Institute. 
We extend our You First culture by giving to important local organizations and causes in communities where our restaurants operate. First Watch also supports national and international causes we care about, such as our Project Sunrise partnership. Through Project Sunrise we source our coffee beans from women-owned farms in Colombia, and we pay an annual quality incentive bonus to farmers to further support their high-quality production. This program in turn empowers these women leaders to reinvest in their communities.
Growth Strategies 
New Restaurant Openings 
We currently believe First Watch has the potential for more than 2,200 restaurants in the continental United States. In 2021, First Watch was recognized by FSR Magazine as the fastest-growing full-service restaurant company in the United States based on unit growth and in 2022, we continued to realize that potential by opening 43 new company-owned and franchise-owned restaurants, which we collectively refer to as “system-wide” restaurants, across 16 states. Our growth strategy targets an accelerating pace of new restaurant development with a long-term goal of a percentage increase of system-wide restaurants in the low double digits.
In selecting new locations, we evaluate specific market characteristics, demographics, traffic patterns, co-tenants and growth potential. Our development approach has proven that First Watch has tremendous portability across markets, with new restaurants boasting consistent and a strong average unit volume across all geographies. In 2022, our new company-owned restaurants generated an annualized average unit volume of $2.2 million. Our new restaurant performance continues to accelerate and we are confident in our ability to continue this growth by elevating both the quality of real estate as well as the introduction of new design features that allow our teams to serve the significant demand.
Acquisitions of Franchise-Owned Restaurants
As an element of our growth strategy, from time to time, we have acquired restaurants from our franchisees. We believe there is potential to increase value through strategic acquisitions of our franchise-owned restaurants. As of December 25, 2022, we had 15 franchisees operating 108 restaurants with 39 total new restaurant development obligations. At December 25, 2022, sixty franchise-owned restaurants are subject to our option to purchase.
Drive Restaurant Traffic and Build Sales 
Our attractive returns on invested capital in each restaurant starts with our focus on traffic and customer frequency in the building of our sales through: 
•Delivering an Excellent On-Premise Dining Experience. Excellence in restaurant-level execution, recognized by customers and reinforced by the hundreds of accolades we have received, increases the visit frequency of our customers, promotes trial by new consumers and ultimately encourages loyalty. Our single menu, throughout the day and across all restaurants in our system, streamlines our supply chain and restaurant operations, simplifies our employee training and provides for a consistent and superior customer dining experience.
•Continued Menu Innovation. We continuously evolve our on-trend menu which highlights our commitment to quality and freshness and is also operationally efficient. When it comes to sourcing, we are guided by a core philosophy: “Follow The Sun.” Our five highly anticipated seasonal menus and the introduction of new platforms drive customer frequency and incremental revenue opportunities. This means that we welcome each season into our menu with exceptional ingredients harvested when they are most flavorful and fresh. In addition, successful platform introductions over the past few years, such as our Fresh Juice program and Shareables, add incremental revenue opportunities while enhancing our culinary credibility. We have seen the incidences from our Fresh Juice and Shareables platforms rise from 9.6% and 3.4%, respectively, in the fourth fiscal quarter ended December 30, 2018 to 15.4% and 7.1%, respectively, in 2022.
•Convenience and Increased Accessibility of Our Off-Premises Offering. We believe our integrated technology and improvements continue to optimize our customers’ convenience when ordering directly from us as well as our third-party delivery partners. In 2022, our total off-premises sales accounted for 20.6% of our total restaurant sales. Even as our in-restaurant dining sales recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic, off-premises sales remained strong, indicating continued customer demand. We see future opportunity to refine and grow this demand largely by focusing on in-restaurant infrastructure, especially in our new restaurant prototypes, which include dedicated make lines and to-go rooms, separate entrances and dedicated parking spots to enhance the experience of both our off-premises and dine-in customers.
•Offer Alcohol as Only First Watch Can. Our alcohol platform is unique and reflects our culinary innovation in combining fresh juices and ingredients with a variety of liquors. We have continued to expand on this strategic initiative and acquire the necessary licenses. As of December 25, 2022, our alcohol menu was offered in about 85.0% of our system-wide restaurants. 
•Increasing Our Brand Awareness. For 40 years, our awareness has grown primarily through word-of-mouth as our service, menu and environment created loyal fans. While we believe that organic growth of awareness contributes to our local feel, we also recognize the potential of strategically marketing in appropriate channels to accelerate our brand awareness. We continue to build expertise in, and deploy tested strategies for, utilizing targeted digital channels to reach certain attractive customer segments and build top-of-mind awareness. By using our first party data, we have been able to identify higher frequency customers and target similar customers with digital media vehicles. These demand generation strategies have aided us to “balance out” our customer base in recent years by growing penetration with Millennial and Gen Z segments.
•Additional Platforms and Initiatives. We continue to evolve the First Watch concept and offerings via the implementation of initiatives that include: 
–Weekday Occasions: We believe that the broad appeal of our menu and the quality of our ingredients give us a competitive advantage over many alternatives that offer breakfast and lunch and provide us with the opportunity to significantly increase market share by driving incremental customer visits during the week. As a result of an evolving consumer landscape, there has been a significant migration of people from urban to suburban areas, where a meaningful portion of our restaurants exist. This migration, coupled with trending work-from-home flexibility, presents First Watch with an incremental customer opportunity during the weekday business hours which we believe will further propel long-term growth.
–Customer Technology & Customer Data: We accelerated the implementation of customer data acquisition systems in order to better inform the habits and behaviors of our customers. With the large increase in remote digital orders, we also sought to digitize in-restaurant orders for the purpose of creating an omnichannel view of the First Watch customer. By integrating remote waitlist, remote orders, tokenized credit card transactions and WiFi into one system, we now have the ability to better understand trial and frequency. Since the establishment of these systems, we have gathered customer information for over 10 million unique customer profiles, 4 million of which are opted into communication. The advancements in these foundational systems have allowed us to learn more about our customers and the behaviors that drive customer lifetime value. We see this as a long-term opportunity to drive increased visit frequency as we have the ability to build new customer technology features that elevate the customer experience through reduced friction. 
–Serving More Demand: First Watch has long appreciated significant demand that regularly exceeds our capacity to serve. Following 2020, the composition of our sales shifted with the increase in our off-premises sales. Combined with a significant acceleration in our business, we focused on optimizing our back-of-house roles, functions and processes. New technologies, such as the implementation of kitchen display screens in all company-owned restaurants in 2022, have increased our ability to serve more demand during peak hours. This focus has also extended to the front-of-house, where we have implemented new practices to increase table turns, optimize seat utilization and drive improved customer satisfaction scores. This initiative to serve more of our existing demand is highly desirable, given that these additional customers are already visiting our restaurants and do not require investment in customer acquisition. We are confident this enduring initiative will continue to create value for First Watch. 
Operations
Quality and Food Safety
First Watch emphasizes high food quality and a commitment to food safety in each restaurant through the careful training and supervision of personnel and by following rigorous quality and cleanliness standards. Food preparation and cleaning procedures are defined, monitored and maintained by our quality assurance department. We contract with third-party inspectors to regularly monitor restaurant performance through unannounced non-biased food safety assessments with program standards that meet or exceed those of local health departments. These inspections are intended to achieve active managerial control in our restaurants in an effort to reduce risk factors and maintain a strong food safety culture. 
Restaurant management incentive plans provide strong motivation to meet and exceed standards. In addition, as part of our overall food quality assurance, we have a process in place to review vendors’ food safety practices to ensure they meet or exceed industry standards. 
Restaurant Staff
As of December 25, 2022, we had approximately 12,000 employees. None of our employees are part of a collective bargaining agreement and based upon independent surveys and our internal evaluations, we believe our “You First” organizational culture continues to foster overall favorable relations with our employees.
Each restaurant operates with a staff of approximately 20 to 30 team members led by general manager(s). 
During a restaurant’s 7:00 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. shift, our staff focus on gracious service, food preparation, order accuracy and “instagrammable” plating. We employ a narrow span of control, which we believe contributes to the consistency of our restaurants’ performance across our system. The general managers interview each applicant and identify motivated employees who are friendly, service oriented, eager to prepare high-quality food and a fit for our “You First” culture. 
Training
Our training programs share our legacy and culture of operating excellence. We have established a training facility at our corporate headquarters named the F.A.R.M. (“First Watch Academy of Restaurant Management”), to which we invite managers-in-training for a week-long brand experience where they learn everything from our history and cultural pillars to leadership and management tools. We have enhanced this training program to also focus on building a more diverse and inclusive team. In addition, managers-in-training also complete a comprehensive 10-week C.A.F.E. (“Culture and Food Experience”) training program in the restaurants, alongside experienced managers. Training for all in-restaurant management positions was also enhanced to clearly define and delineate roles in order to drive both results and engagement. New hourly employees participate in at least three days of initial onboarding training and shadowing. Our general managers and directors of operations conduct in-restaurant training for our staff who also train online through our Virtual Learning Academy. 
Purchasing and Distribution
Our Supply Chain department manages and negotiates directly with qualified, national suppliers and distributors with the dual goals of securing the supply of high quality, fresh products and controlling cost. Our selected vendors undergo inspection to ensure that products purchased conform to our standards. Our Quality Assurance department requires third-party supplier audits or Global Food Safety Initiative certification for all food distributors and manufacturing facilities to ensure good manufacturing practices, food safety, pest control, sanitation, training, regulatory compliance and food defense systems are in place. To ensure freshness, most of our restaurants accept produce and broadline distribution deliveries at least three times per week. 
Management Information Systems
All our restaurants use digital management information systems, which we believe are scalable to support our future growth plans. These systems are designed to enable functionality, improve operating efficiencies, provide us with timely access to financial and marketing data and reduce restaurant and corporate administrative time and expense. In addition, our in-restaurant systems are used to process customer orders, credit card payments, employee time-keeping and scheduling. 
Marketing and Advertising
We use a variety of marketing channels, including affiliate partnerships, social media interactions, digital marketing, direct mailers, public relations initiatives and local community sponsorships, email communications, promotions and partnerships. We focus on increasing our engagement with social media platforms in order to generate brand awareness and also to gather information we can then apply to future marketing efforts. 
Franchise Program 
As of December 25, 2022, we had 15 franchisees that operated 108 restaurants and our existing franchisees had 39 total new restaurant development obligations. Typically, our franchise agreements provide an initial term of 10 years with additional renewal terms that total 10 years subject to various conditions that include upgrades to the restaurant facility and brand image. All franchise agreements grant licenses to use our trademarks, trade secrets and proprietary methods, recipes and procedures. The initial franchise fee for each restaurant is $35,000 to $40,000. Franchisees are required to pay 4.0%-4.5% of franchised restaurant sales in royalties and contribute 1.0%-3.0% of franchised restaurant sales to a system fund, which is used for advertising, marketing and public relations programs and materials on a system-wide basis. Presently, we are not extending franchise agreements to new franchisees. 
Human Capital 

“You First” Culture Elevates Employee and Customer Satisfaction 
First Watch has a simple mission statement based on its “You First.” culture - “Making days brighter at every opportunity.” We have been people-focused from our inception as we have always believed our employees are our greatest asset. We believe that putting our employees first, in turn, leads them to put customers first. We believe the Company’s culture plays a significant role in higher retention of all employees, as the Company had historically experienced below industry turnover. This culture was also a key factor in the Company’s achievement of top 50 status in Newsweek’s Top 100 Most Loved Workplaces, a designation that was a result of an assessment of First Watch’s people practices along with an independent survey of approximately 1,000 of our employees. First Watch also introduced a new Vision, Mission and Values statement to all employees to further reinforce its award-winning culture and emphasis on both employee and customer engagement and loyalty.
Diversity and Inclusion
In 2020, we developed and launched an annual campaign, branded #beabetterhuman, which has taken our people-focused approach to a new level. We turned participation in the #beabetterhuman campaign into an opportunity for employees to give back to the community. The #beabetterhuman initiative included a six-part live, interactive web series tackling sensitive topics such as unconscious bias, privilege and mental health. The #beabetterhuman campaign was designed to educate our entire workforce, raise awareness and influence change. In order to provide employees with a chance to make a difference, for each employee that participated in all six #beabetterhuman web sessions, First Watch made a donation to Bryan Stevenson’s Equal Justice Initiative (featured in the book and film “Just Mercy”). We continue to build upon the success of the program with training on the program for new managers and an ongoing #beabetterhuman series on Facebook, Instagram and Glassdoor highlighting diverse employees within the restaurants and their unique and inspiring stories. 
The R.I.S.E. (Race Inclusion and Support Exchange) Council was created to engage high performing diverse leaders in dialogue on how to best advance the Company’s diversity efforts. As a result of ideas that the R.I.S.E. Council surfaced, The Rising 20, a new mentor program was established as an important step in the #beabetterhuman campaign to help accelerate the development and advancement of under-represented groups within First Watch. In this mentoring program, employees are partnered with a senior leader in the organization for a six-month guided mentorship journey targeting personal development and professional growth. In addition, the program includes a self-assessment and career goal setting workshops. 
In both 2021 and 2022, First Watch also worked with an independent Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (“DEI”) consultant to track our DEI data, complete a thorough assessment of our current state and benchmark on key metrics. Leveraging this data, along with their analytics and strategy platform, we then identified efforts to prioritize DEI in order to drive impact and took action. First Watch was pleased to achieve solid positioning in the benchmarking results and significant year-over-year improvement. 
In 2022, CEO and President, Chris Tomasso, Chief People Officer, Laura Sorensen and Chief Operating Officer, Dan Jones, hosted nineteen separate 90 minute calls with hourly employees across the country for their second annual W.H.Y. Tour – their “We Hear You” listening tour. The purpose of the in-depth sessions was to learn more about the issues that matter most to our hourly workforce. As a result of this tour, the Company was able to take swift action on the most meaningful issues. New employee benefits, practices and operational tools have been introduced as a direct result of 
feedback from each tour, reinforcing the Company’s culture of listening to its employees and taking action on the issues that matter the most to them. 
Experienced, Passionate Leadership Team and Deep Bench of Talent 
Our team is led by passionate executives who have an extensive mix of experience in our brand and with other leading national restaurant concepts and consumer facing businesses. We have a deep bench of talent throughout the organization. Our executives and key employees average more than 15 years of industry experience and our directors of operations have an average tenure at First Watch of approximately ten years. In addition, our restaurant staff includes hundreds of fully-trained, tested, high-performing managers throughout our system who are poised to step into the general manager role as we execute our growth strategy and open new restaurants. 
Government Regulation
We are subject to extensive federal, state and local government laws and regulations, including those relating to, among others, public health and safety, zoning and fire codes, alcoholic beverage control and franchising. 
In addition, we are also subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, the Americans with Disabilities Act and various federal and state laws governing such matters as minimum wages, exempt versus non-exempt, overtime, unemployment tax rates, workers’ compensation rates, citizenship requirements and other working conditions. New laws, regulations or interpretations could impact our business or our cost of compliance.
For a discussion of the various risks we face from regulation and compliance matters, see Item 1A.“Risk Factors.” 
Intellectual Property 
We have registered “First Watch the Daytime Cafe,” “You First,” “Yeah, It’s Fresh!” and certain other names used by our restaurants as trademarks or service marks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”). In addition, the First Watch logo, website name and address and Facebook and Twitter accounts are our intellectual property. Our policy is to pursue and maintain registration of service marks and trademarks and to oppose vigorously any infringement or dilution of the service marks or trademarks. We maintain certain recipes for our menu items, as well as certain standards, specifications and operating procedures, as trade secrets or confidential information. 
Competition 
The restaurant industry is highly competitive and fragmented, with restaurants competing directly and indirectly with regard to dining experience, food quality, service, price and location. We also compete with grocery store chains and meal subscription services. In addition, there is active competition for management personnel, real estate sites, supplies and restaurant employees. Competition is also influenced strongly by marketing and brand reputation.
As consumers increasingly seek higher quality breakfast, brunch and lunch experiences, we believe we are well-positioned to compete with a wide range of national, regional and local establishments that operate during our hours of operation. More directly, we do not believe there is a comparable offering within our segment that operates at scale as First Watch does and we view our primary competition as a network of independent restaurants that also serve breakfast and lunch in neighborhoods across the United States. 
Seasonality 
Our quarterly results of operations are subject to seasonal fluctuations. Additionally, the timing of holidays, weather conditions and the number of new restaurant openings may affect sales volumes seasonally. 
See Item 1A.“Risk Factors” for discussion of risks related to seasonal and periodic fluctuations.
