 Item 1: Business
 Our Company
 First Western Financial, Inc. is a financial holding company headquartered in Denver, Colorado. We provide a fully integrated suite of wealth management services on our private trust bank platform, which includes a comprehensive selection of deposit, loan, trust, wealth planning and investment management products and services. We believe our integrated business model distinguishes us from other banks and non-bank financial services companies in the markets in which we operate. As of December 31, 2018, we provided fiduciary and advisory services on $5.2 billion of trust and investment management assets (referred to as "AUM"), and we had total assets of $1.1 billion, total loans of $894.0 million, total deposits of $937.8 million and total shareholders' equity of $116.9 million. 
 Our mission is to be the best private bank for the Western wealth management client. We believe that the "Western wealth management client" shares our entrepreneurial spirit and values our sophisticated, high-touch wealth management services that are tailored to meet their specific needs. Our target clients include successful entrepreneurs, professionals and other high net worth individuals or families, along with their businesses and philanthropic organizations. We offer our services through a branded network of boutique private trust bank offices, which we believe are strategically located in affluent and high-growth markets in thirteen locations across Colorado, Arizona, Wyoming and California. 
 We generate a significant portion of our revenues from non-interest income, which we produce primarily from our trust, investment management and other advisory services as well as through the origination and sale of mortgage loans. The balance of our revenue is generated from net interest income, which we derive from our traditional banking products and services. For the year ended December 31, 2018, non-interest income was $27.2 million, or 47.0% of gross revenue (which is our total income before non-interest expense, less gains on securities sold, plus provision for credit losses), and net interest income was $30.6 million, or 53.0% of gross revenue
 We believe that we have developed a unique approach to private banking to best serve our Western wealth management clients primarily as a result of the combination of the following factors:

· | Offering sophisticated wealth management products and services, including traditional banking as well as trust, wealth planning, investment management and other related services often provided by larger financial institutions with the high-touch and personalized experience that is typically associated with community and trust banks;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Delivering services through our strategically located private trust bank offices, which we refer to internally as "profit centers"; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Using our relationship-based team approach to become a "trusted advisor" to our clients by understanding their investment management, ultimate goals and banking needs and tailoring our products and services to meet those needs.

 Our Initial Public Offering
 We completed an initial public offering of our common stock on July 23, 2018. Our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol “MYFW.” Our History and Growth
 We were founded in 2002 by our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, Scott C. Wylie, and a group of local business leaders with the vision of building the best private bank for the Western wealth management client. Since opening our first profit center in Denver, Colorado in 2004, we have grown organically primarily by establishing thirteen offices, attracting new clients and expanding our relationships with existing clients, as well as through a series of ten strategic acquisitions of various trust, registered investment advisory and other financial services firms.  Balance Sheet Growth
 Since opening our first profit center in 2004, we have also experienced growth in gross loans, total deposits and AUM throughout various economic cycles. From 2004 to 2008, which we refer to as our “Growth & Expansion” period, we experienced significant growth in our gross loans, total deposits and assets under management primarily through the opening of six profit centers and organic growth, enhanced with seven acquisitions.
 From 2009 to 2013, which we refer to as our “Conservative Growth” period due to difficult economic and industry conditions prevalent at such time, growth in gross loans, total deposits and assets under management was limited as we focused our efforts on integrating prior acquisitions, opening three new profit centers and improving our asset quality. During this time, we strengthened our regulatory capital position through a number of preferred stock and subordinated debt offerings, which limited dilution to our common shareholders.
 From 2013 to our intitial public offering, effective July 23, 2018, which we refer to as our “Capital Constrained Growth” period, we have strategically focused our efforts on building our team, distribution channels and products for improved growth and earnings, while managing our balance sheet to stay below $1.0 billion in assets through December 31, 2017, in order to retain the benefits available to us under the Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (referred to as the “Federal Reserve”), including not being subject to consolidated capital ratio requirements under the final rules adopted by federal bank regulators implementing the December 2010 final capital framework for strengthening international capital standards (known as “Basel III”) of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.
 Since December 31, 2014, we have increased gross loans from $532.5 million at December 31, 2014 to $894.0 million at December 31, 2018, representing a compound annual growth rate or, CAGR of 13.8% and we have increased total deposits from $588.8 million at December 31, 2014 to $937.8 million at December 31, 2018, representing a CAGR of 12.3%.
 Revenue, Expense & Pre‑Tax, Pre‑Provision Income Growth
 Since December 31, 2014, we have increased gross revenues from $43.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $57.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, representing a CAGR of 7.2%, while total non‑interest expense increased from $43.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $50.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, representing a CAGR of 3.7%. This 195% operating leverage (which we calculate as the ratio of gross revenue CAGR to total non‑interest expense CAGR) has resulted in improved pre‑tax, pre‑provision income, which increased 15.6 times over the same time period. We believe that while the higher fixed costs of our product groups have limited our earnings, we have demonstrated significant operating leverage by growing pre‑tax, pre‑provision income at a faster rate than expenses. Pre‑tax, pre‑provision income is a non‑GAAP measure. The nearest GAAP measure is income before income tax, which was $7.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.  See “Non‑GAAP Reconciliation and Management Explanation of Non‑GAAP Financial Measures.” Pre‑tax, pre‑provision income increased from $0.5 million

for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $7.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as indicated in the following chart.

      Our Business Strategy
 We believe we have built a premier private trust bank in the Western United States that is focused on providing the best financial solutions to our clients. We are service-driven, solution-oriented and relationship-based. We (intend to) accomplish this by continuing to execute on the following strategies:
· | Building Out Existing Markets. Once we have established a presence in a particular geographic market that contains attractive high net worth household demographics, we then look to establish additional locations that are closely situated to sub-concentrations of affluent households and/or commercial activity (a “hub and spoke” market build-out, as we have commenced in Denver and Phoenix). We also seek to employ highly capable associates with local market experience and relationships. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Deepening Existing Client Relationships. We deliver our services though our local boutique private trust bank offices. This allows us to use multi-discipline sales and client service teams, in-market, to ensure we are meeting each client’s comprehensive set of needs. These teams take the time to understand the complexities of our clients’ financial world through wealth planning solutions and create the financial plan that helps them reach their goals. This profit center-based service model is a critical component of our future growth as we continue to develop our understanding of our clients’ evolving needs, allowing us to deepen, broaden and grow our existing relationships. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Generating Referrals for New Client Relationships. We believe we have demonstrated a successful sales and marketing capability, built around the personal and professional networks and centers of influence of our local profit center leadership. Our existing client base also provides a significant amount of new clients through referrals. In surveys, our clients generally rate us very favorably overall in areas of professionalism, reliability, service-orientation, and trust. We have added wealth advisors in each of our profit centers as commissioned sales associates to enhance our acquisition of new clients. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Developing Client Relationships through our Product Groups. Each profit center is designed to feel like a boutique private trust bank office and is staffed with business development and client service personnel. The profit centers work closely with our central product groups to customize our services to each client’s specific situation, without sacrificing the flexibility, expertise and authority to quickly meet complex client needs. Our central product groups are designed to support a significantly larger client and AUM base, providing an opportunity for significant operating leverage as we open additional profit centers. We have sales and service specialists in our product groups, such as Retirement Services and Mortgage Services, who are able to build relationships within their area of expertise and provide expertise and high quality service that creates an opportunity for a broader relationship across our suite of products and services. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

· | Expanding to New Markets. We believe that our profit centers are profitable and stable businesses when mature. We also believe that our product group and support center teams have a high degree of operating leverage (i.e., we believe that increasing the number of profit centers would not require a proportionate increase in our product group or support center expenses). Therefore, a key strategy of ours is to add incremental profit centers and grow them to maturity. The trends in the financial services industry that make our business model successful in our existing geographic markets also exist in other locations in the Western United States. Our analysis indicates that there are hundreds of markets and submarkets in the Western United States that could support our profit centers and fit our target demographics. As such, we intend to continue to explore new Western United States markets with favorable high net worth demographics and competitive marketplaces. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Growing our Core Deposit Franchise. The strength of our deposit franchise is derived from the long-standing relationships we have with our clients and the strong ties we have to the markets we serve. Our deposit footprint has provided, and we believe will continue to provide, primary support for our loan growth. A key part of our strategy is to continue to enhance our funding sources by continuing to build our private and commercial banking capabilities to keep building our base of attractively priced core deposits. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Attracting Talent. Our team of seasoned associates has been, and will continue to be, an important driver of our organic growth by further developing relationships with current and potential clients. We have a record of hiring experienced associates to enhance our organic growth, and sourcing and hiring talent will continue to be a core focus for us. We believe that our recent initial public offering will further enhance our ability to attract and retain this talent. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Developing New Products. We seek to be the primary source of financial products and services for our clients. By continuing to expand our product offerings—either by internal product development or establishing third-party relationships—we work to meet expanding client needs while further diversifying our revenue streams. Most recently, we have added a Health Savings Account consulting capability to our business services team, again providing additional client ties to increase revenues per client, improve “stickiness,” and allow for building broader relationships. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Service Model and Products
 We deliver a broad array of wealth management products and services through our profit centers using our proprietary ConnectView® approach, which looks holistically across a client’s current and projected financial situation. We believe providing financial solutions in one area (such as estate, retirement planning or lending) often impacts other areas of our clients’ wealth planning (such as risk or balance sheet management), which provides us opportunities to evaluate proposed solutions across multiple business lines and offer additional services to our clients.
 We have designed our business around having each profit center staffed with seasoned management. Typically, each profit center team is led by a president, who is a senior investment advisor or banker with strong client relationships and sales and leadership skills. The local team includes deposit, loan, trust, wealth planning, and related professionals, creating a strong interdisciplinary sales and service team. In addition to this service team, we recently added wealth advisors as a commissioned sales force to several profit centers to enhance our acquisition of new clients.
 We provide a broad array of products and services through our boutique private trust bank offices, largely comprised of the products and services described below.
 Lending
 General.  Through our relationship-oriented private bank lending approach, our strategy is to offer a broad range of customized consumer and commercial lending products for the personal investment and business needs of our clients. Our clients are typically well diversified and the purpose for their loan and liquidity needs often does not correlate to the collateral used to secure the loan.

 
  8

 

 Our commercial lending products include commercial loans, business term loans and lines of credit to a diversified mix of small and midsized businesses. We offer both owner occupied and non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans, as well as construction loans.
 Our consumer lending products include residential first mortgage loans, originated loans for our own portfolio, as well as those for which we conduct mortgage banking activities whereby we originate and sell, servicing-released, whole loans in the secondary market. Our mortgage banking loan sales activities are primarily directed at originating single family mortgages, which generally conform to Fannie Mae guidelines and are delivered to the investor shortly after funding. Additionally, we offer installment loans and lines of credit, typically to facilitate investment opportunities for consumer clients whose financial characteristics support the request. We also provide clients and prospects loans collateralized by cash and marketable securities.
 We employ experienced banking and business development teams who provide superior client service, value-add lending solutions and competitive pricing to market our lending products and services. As of December 31, 2018, gross loans were $894.0 million, an increase of $80.3 million, or 9.9%, compared to $813.7 million as of December 31, 2017. These increases were primarily due to our continued organic growth in our market areas and in the commercial and residential mortgage segments of our loan portfolio.
 As of December 31, 2018, our loan portfolio contained a balanced and diverse mix of loans, as shown below: 

 Our loan portfolio includes commercial and industrial loans, residential real estate loans, commercial real estate loans and other consumer loans. The principal risk associated with each category of loans we make is the creditworthiness of the borrower. Borrower creditworthiness is affected by general economic conditions and the attributes of the borrower and the borrower’s market or industry. We underwrite for strong cash flow, multiple sources of repayment, adequate collateral, borrower experience and backup guarantors. Attributes of the relevant business market or industry include the competitive environment, client and supplier availability, the threat of substitutes and barriers to entry and exit.
 1-4 Family Residential.  Our 1-4 family residential loan portfolio consists of loans and home equity lines of credit secured by 1-4 family residential properties. These loans typically enable borrowers to purchase or refinance existing homes, most of which serve as the primary residence of the owner. In addition, some borrowers secure a commercial purpose loan with owner occupied or non-owner occupied 1-4 family residential properties. At December 31, 2018, 1-4 family residential loans were $350.9 million, or 39.3% of our total loan portfolio, consisting of $104.6 million and $246.3 million of fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans, respectively. While we typically originate loans with adjustable rates and 

 
  9

 
maturities up to 30 years, as of December 31, 2018, the average term on our 1-4 family portfolio was 17.4 years with an average remaining term of 15.3 years. Such loans typically remain outstanding for substantially shorter periods because borrowers often prepay their loans in full either upon sale of the property pledged as security or upon refinancing the original loan.
 Commercial loans secured by 1-4 family residential are dependent on the strength of the local economy, and local residential and commercial real estate markets. Borrower demand for adjustable-rate compared to fixed-rate loans is a function of the level of interest rates, the expectations of changes in the level of interest rates, and the difference between the interest rates and loans fees offered for fixed-rate mortgage loans as compared to the interest-rates and loans fees for adjustable rate loans.
 The loan fees, interest rates, and other provisions of mortgage loans are determined by us on the basis of our own pricing criteria and competitive market conditions. The loans are secured by the real estate, and appraisals are obtained to support the loan amount at origination. Loans collateralized by 1-4 family residential real estate generally are originated in amounts of no more than 80% of appraised value. Generally, our loans conform to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac underwriting guidelines and conform to internal policies for debt-to-income or free cash flow levels. We retain a valid lien on real estate, obtain a title insurance policy that insures that the property is free from encumbrances and require hazard insurance.
 Our focus for mortgage lending is to originate high-quality loans to drive growth in our mortgage loan portfolio. Our mortgage strategy includes attracting new loan clients with our mortgage loan products and services, which we believe will provide an opportunity for our profit centers to bring in well-qualified prospects, and to cross-sell other products and services to clients. We believe that cross-selling enables us to generate additional revenues, increase client retention, and provide products that benefit our clients. We have developed a scalable platform, including loan processing, underwriting and closings, for both secondary sales and origination of 1-4 family residential mortgages maintained in our portfolio and believe we have significant opportunities to grow this business.
 Cash, Securities and Other.  Our cash, securities and other loan portfolio consists of consumer and commercial purpose loans that are primarily secured by securities managed and under custody with us, cash on deposit with us or life insurance policies. In addition, loans in this portfolio are collateralized with other sources of consumer collateral, which typically leaves an immaterial amount of the loan balance unsecured. At December 31, 2018, loans secured with cash, marketable securities and other were $114.2 million, or 12.8% of our total loan portfolio. This segment of our portfolio is affected by a variety of local and national economic factors affecting borrowers’ employment prospects, income levels, and overall economic sentiment.
 Commercial and Industrial.  We make commercial and industrial loans, including working capital lines of credit, permanent working capital term loans, business asset loans, acquisition, expansion and development loans, and other loan products, primarily in our target markets. These loans are underwritten on the basis of the borrower’s ability to service the debt from income, with maturities tied to the underlying life of the collateral. We generally take a lien on all business assets, including, among other things, available real estate, accounts receivable, inventory and equipment and generally obtain a personal guaranty of the principal(s). Our commercial and industrial loans generally have variable interest rates and terms that typically range from one to five years. Fixed-rate commercial and industrial loan maturities are generally short-term, with three- to five-year maturities, including periodic interest rate resets. At December 31, 2018, commercial and industrial loans were $113.7 million, or 12.7% of our total loan portfolio. The average maturity on our commercial and industrial portfolio was four years with an average remaining term of one year. This portfolio primarily consists of term loans and lines of credit which are mostly dependent on the strength of the industries of the related borrowers and the success of their businesses.
 Commercial Real Estate, Owner Occupied and Non-Owner Occupied.  We make commercial loans collateralized by real estate. These loans may be collateralized by owner occupied or non-owner occupied real estate, as well as multi-family residential real estate. Commercial real estate lending typically involves higher loan principal amounts and the repayment is dependent, in large part, on sufficient income from the properties securing the loans to cover operating expenses and debt service. We require our commercial real estate loans to be secured by well-managed property with adequate margins and generally obtain a guaranty from responsible parties who have outside cash flows, experience and/or other assets. Our commercial real estate loans are generally secured by properties used for business purposes such as office 

 
  10

 
buildings, industrial facilities and retail facilities. Loan amounts generally do not exceed 80% or 75% of the property’s appraised value for owner occupied and non-owner occupied respectively. In addition, aggregate debt service ratios, including the guarantor’s cash flow and the borrower’s other projects, are required by policy to have a minimum annual cash flow to debt service ratio of 2.0x. We require independent appraisals or evaluations from a list of approved appraisers on all loans secured by commercial real estate. At December 31, 2018, owner occupied commercial real estate loans were $108.5 million, or 12.2% of our total loan portfolio and non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans were $173.7 million, or 19.5% of our total loan portfolio. These loans are primarily dependent on the strength of the industries of the related borrowers and the success of their businesses.
 Construction and Development.  We make loans to finance the construction of residential and non-residential properties. Construction and development loans are generally collateralized by first liens on real estate and usually have floating interest rates. Our construction and development loans typically have maturities of up to two years depending on factors such as the type and size of the development and the financial strength of the borrower/guarantor, and are typically structured with an interest only construction period. These loans are underwritten to either mature at the completion of construction, or transition to a traditional amortizing commercial real estate facility with the terms and characteristics in line with other commercial real estate loans we hold in our portfolio. At December 31, 2018, construction and development loans were $31.9 million, or 3.5% of our total loan portfolio.
 Concentrations.  Most of our lending activity and credit exposure, including real estate collateral for many of our loans, are concentrated in Colorado, Arizona, Wyoming and California, as approximately 97.5% of the loans in our loan portfolio as of December 31, 2018. were made to borrowers who live in or conduct business in those states. Our commercial real estate loans are generally secured by first liens on real property. The remaining commercial and industrial loans are typically secured by general business assets, accounts receivable inventory and/or the corporate guaranty of the borrower and personal guaranty of its principals. The geographic concentration subjects the loan portfolio to the general economic conditions within Colorado, Arizona, Wyoming and California. The risks created by such concentrations have been considered by management in the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. As of December 31, 2018, management believes the allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb probable losses in our loan portfolio.
 Sound risk management practices and appropriate levels of capital are essential elements of a sound commercial real estate lending program. Concentrations of commercial real estate exposures add a dimension of risk that compounds the risk inherent in individual loans. Interagency guidance on commercial real estate concentrations describe sound risk management practices which include board and management oversight, portfolio management, management information systems, market analysis, portfolio stress testing and sensitivity analysis, credit underwriting standards, and credit risk review functions. Management believes it has implemented these practices in order to monitor concentrations in commercial real estate in our loan portfolio.
 Credit Policies and Procedures
 General.    Asset quality and robust underwriting are integral to our strategy and credit culture. We place a considerable emphasis on effective risk management and preserving sound credit underwriting standards as we grow our loan portfolio. Underwriting considerations include collateral, defined sources of repayment, strength of guarantor(s) and opportunities to broaden the relationship with the client. Our credit policy requires key risks be identified and measured, documented and mitigated, to the extent possible, to seek to ensure the soundness of our loan portfolio.
 Loan Underwriting and Approval.    Historically, we believe we have made sound, high quality loans while recognizing that lending money involves a degree of business risk. We have loan policies designed to assist us in managing this business risk. These policies provide a general framework for our loan origination, monitoring and funding activities, while recognizing that not all risks can be anticipated. Our board of directors delegates limited lending authority to individuals and internal loan committees. When the total relationship exceeds an individual’s loan authority, a higher authority or credit committee approval is required. The objective of our approval process is to provide a disciplined, collaborative approach to larger credits while maintaining responsiveness to client needs. Loan decisions are documented as to the borrower’s business, purpose of the loan, evaluation of the repayment source and the associated risks, evaluation of collateral, covenants and monitoring requirements, and the risk rating rationale.

 Managing credit risk is an enterprise-wide process. Our strategy for credit risk management includes well-defined, central credit policies, uniform underwriting criteria and ongoing risk monitoring and review processes. Our processes emphasize early stage review of loans, regular credit evaluations and management reviews of loans, which supplement the ongoing and proactive credit monitoring and loan servicing provided by our bankers. Our Chief Credit Officer, together with our central underwriting, credit administration and loan operations teams, provides credit oversight. We periodically review all credit risk portfolios to ensure that the risk identification processes are functioning properly and that our credit standards are followed. In addition, a third-party loan review is performed to assist in the identification of problem assets and to confirm our internal risk rating of loans.
 Our loan policies include other underwriting guidelines for loans collateralized by real estate. These underwriting standards are designed to determine the maximum loan amount that a borrower has the capacity to repay based upon the type of collateral securing the loan and the borrower’s income. Such loan policies include maximum amortization schedules and loan terms for each category of loans collateralized by liens on real estate. In addition, our loan policies provide guidelines for personal guarantees; an environmental review; loans to employees, executive officers and directors; problem loan identification; maintenance of an adequate allowance for loan losses; and other matters relating to lending practices.
 We believe that an important part of our assessment of client risk is the ongoing completion of periodic risk rating reviews. As part of these reviews, we seek to review the risk rating of each facility within a client relationship and may recommend an upgrade or downgrade to the risk rating. We categorize loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of the borrowers to service their debt such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. We analyze loans individually by classifying the loans as to credit risk on a quarterly basis. We attempt to identify potential problem loans early in an effort to seek aggressive resolution of these situations before the loans become a loss, record any necessary charge-offs promptly and maintain adequate allowance levels for probable incurred loan losses in the loan portfolio.
 Lending Limits.    Our lending activities are subject to a variety of lending limits imposed by state and federal regulation. The Bank is subject to a legal lending limit on loans to related borrowers based on the Bank’s capital level. The dollar amounts of the Bank’s lending limit increases or decreases as the Bank’s capital increases or decreases. The Bank is able to sell participations in its larger loans to other financial institutions, which allows it to manage the risk involved in these loans and to meet the lending needs of its clients requiring extensions of credit in excess of these limits.
 Deposits
 The strength of our deposit franchise is derived from the long-standing relationships we have with our clients and the strong ties we have to the markets we serve. Our deposit footprint has provided, and we believe will continue to provide, primary support for our loan growth. A key part of our strategy is to continue to enhance our funding sources by continuing to build our private and commercial banking capabilities to keep building our base of attractively priced core deposits.
 We provide a broad range of deposit products and services, including demand deposits, interest-bearing transaction accounts, money market accounts, time and savings deposits, certificates of deposit and CDARS® reciprocal products. Other than client deposits obtained through our locations that choose to use the CDARS program, we do not accept brokered deposits as a source of funding. We also offer a range of treasury management products including electronic receivables management, remote deposit capture, cash vault services, merchant services and other cash management services. Deposit flows are significantly influenced by general and local economic conditions, changes in prevailing interest rates, internal pricing decisions and competition. Our deposits are primarily obtained from depositors located in our geographic footprint, and we believe that we have attractive opportunities to capture additional deposits in our markets. In order to attract and retain deposits, we rely on providing quality service, offering a suite of retail and commercial products and services and introducing new products and services that meet our clients’ needs as they evolve.
 We have experienced banking and business development teams who we believe provide superior client service, creative cash management solutions and competitive pricing to market our depository products and services.  As of 

 
  12

 
December 31, 2018, total deposits were $937.8 million, an increase of $121.6 million, or 14.9%, compared to $816.1 million as of December 31, 2017.
 As of December 31, 2018, our deposit portfolio contained a balanced and diverse mix of deposits, as shown below:

 Trust and Investment Management, Advisory
 We offer sophisticated wealth advisory and planning services including investment management, trusts and estate services, philanthropic services, insurance planning and retirement consulting. Our client relationships frequently include in-depth proprietary ConnectView® financial plans and sophisticated, institutional quality investment management that is driven by comprehensive investment policy statements and access to industry-leading money managers. These customized documents—ConnectView® wealth plans and investment policy statements—form the roadmap for how we serve each client and monitor our progress in achieving their goals.
 We have experienced trust officers in several profit centers, plus expert trust and estate attorneys on our central product group team, to provide fiduciary services through our profit centers. These include traditional fiduciary, directed trusts, special needs trusts, and custody services. Most of our investment management business is conducted through the trust department in agency accounts where we are not serving as trustee.
 We also have experienced portfolio managers and business development teams in our profit centers who provide high-touch, tailored solutions that we believe further exemplify our superior client service. These local teams have personal and professional networks and relationships with centers of influence to market our wealth advisory products and services. As of December 31, 2018, total AUM was $5.2 billion, a decrease of $139.0 million, or 2.6%, compared to $5.4 billion as of December 31, 2017.

 
  13

 

 As of December  31, 2018, we provided fiduciary and advisory services on $5.2 billion of trust and investment management assets, as shown below: 

 Our investment management platform combines a broad range of asset and sub asset classes meeting the needs of both taxable and tax-free private client accounts as well as trust investment services. We deliver most of our discretionary money management by allocating client portfolios across a centrally controlled platform of select third-party managers in each asset and sub asset class, including separately managed and comingled options, and with active and passive management strategies. We also have a limited number of proprietary products that we believe further differentiates us from many of our competitors.
 We believe acting as an investment manager, and not just a manager of managers, has a number of critical benefits for our clients. These include the ability to have our money managers available to meet with clients and prospects, to tailor products and separately managed accounts for our clients, to better educate and inform our client-facing portfolio managers, and to develop new solutions as market conditions and client needs change. We manage proprietary fixed income and equity strategies, including acting as the advisor on our three highly rated First Western mutual funds. By combining internal research and a dedicated team of accredited specialized advisors like Certified Financial Analysts and Certified Financial Planners with our pairing of proprietary and third-party investment options, we create unique solutions tailored to the specific needs of each of our clients.
 Other Products
 In addition to the traditional loan, deposit and trust and investment management products and services, our profit centers are supported by a central team of specialized product experts in our “product groups,” which include experienced professionals in commercial banking, investment management, wealth planning, risk management/insurance, personal trust, retirement planning and tax-advantaged products, and mortgage lending. We believe that the sophistication of our product groups rivals the offerings and expertise typically provided by larger financial institutions. Our product groups are led and staffed with highly accredited and well known professionals, each with significant experience in their fields. Beyond traditional banking, trust and wealth management activities, at each profit center we provide other services including:
· | Mortgage Lending. Although our primary objective is to originate loans for our own portfolio, we also conduct mortgage banking activities in which we originate and sell, servicing-released, whole loans in the secondary market. Typically, loans with a fixed interest rate of greater than 10 years are available-for-sale 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

and sold on the secondary market. Our mortgage banking loan sales activities are primarily directed at originating single family mortgages that are priced and underwritten to conform to previously agreed criteria before loan funding and are delivered to the investor shortly after funding. The level of future loan originations, loan sales and loan repayments depends on overall credit availability, the interest rate environment, the strength of the general economy, local real estate markets and the housing industry, and conditions in the secondary loan sale market. The amount of gain or loss on the sale of loans is primarily driven by market conditions and changes in interest rates, as well as our pricing and asset liability management strategies. As of December 31, 2018, we had mortgage loans held for sale of $14.8 million in residential mortgage loans we originated. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we had net proceeds of $486.5 million on mortgage loans that we originated and sold into the secondary market.

· | Specialized Philanthropic Services. We provide advisory services for nonprofit organizations seeking to effectively manage their funds as well as individuals seeking to use philanthropic strategies, for example, build a legacy, instill shared values in the next generation, or contribute to causes about which they are passionate. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Retirement Services, including 401(k) Plan Consulting. We have a team of retirement plan consultants who partner with businesses to sponsor retirement plans. We offer creative corporate retirement plan design and analysis solutions and fiduciary liability management, providing tools such as corporate retirement plans, health savings accounts, and third-party administrative services along with ERISA regulation compliance, education and expertise. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Our profit centers and product groups are also supported centrally by teams providing management services such as operations, risk management, credit administration, technology support, marketing, human capital and accounting/finance services, which we refer to as “support centers.” Our associates in our support centers have significant experience in wealth management, investment advisory, and commercial banking, including areas such as lending, underwriting, credit administration, risk management, accounting/finance, operations and information technology. We have structured our teams, services and product offerings to use technology to efficiently provide our clients with a high-touch, solution-oriented experience, that we believe is scalable and provides operating leverage for future growth.
 To demonstrate how these three groups—profit centers, product groups and support centers—work together to deliver a highly competitive product offering through a team of local professionals, our investment management offering is an example:

· | In each profit center, there are one or more portfolio managers that work as part of that local team’s sales and service delivery. These portfolio managers are typically Certified Financial Planners with experience in wealth planning and portfolio construction. They meet with clients and develop an overall wealth management strategy, specific goals and objectives, an investment policy statement, and an implementation plan. They use our guided architecture, a diverse array of select third-party and proprietary investment products covering a broad range of asset classes as their source for structure, asset allocation and products. Sales and marketing support is provided centrally but delivered locally.

  Investment Activities
 The primary objectives of our Bank portfolio investment policy are to provide a source of liquidity, to provide an appropriate return on funds invested, to manage interest rate risk, to meet pledging requirements and to meet regulatory capital requirements. As of December 31, 2018, the carrying value of our investment portfolio totaled $44.9 million, with an average yield of 2.24%.
 Our investment policy outlines investment type limitations, security mix parameters, authorization guidelines and risk management guidelines. The policy authorizes us to invest in a variety of investment securities, subject to various limitations. Our current investment portfolio consists of obligations of the U.S. Treasury and other U.S. government agencies, corporate or sponsored entities, including mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations and mutual funds. We are required to maintain an investment in Federal Home Loan Bank of Topeka (“FHLB Topeka”) stock, which investment is based on the level of our FHLB Topeka borrowings. Our board of directors has the overall responsibility for the investment portfolio, including approval of our investment policy. Our Asset and Liability Committee (“ALCO”) and management are responsible for implementation of the investment policy and monitoring of our investment performance. Our ALCO and management review the status of our investment portfolio at least monthly.
 Our Markets
 Our strategic market area is defined by metropolitan areas in the Western United States having strong long-term economic growth prospects, a significant wealth demographic measured by growth in high net worth households, a dynamic commercial business landscape and the ability to sustain one or more of our profit centers. We target households with more than $1.0 million in liquid net worth and their related businesses and philanthropic interests. We believe that the complex and diverse financial needs of this market segment presents an opportunity to serve a broad array of client needs efficiently and cost effectively.
 Our current operating markets have a high concentration of our targeted client segment and are expected to experience high growth, providing opportunity for continued future organic growth through demographic and market share growth.
 We seek to expand our presence in our existing markets as well as other Western markets with similar demographic profiles. With improved access to capital as a result of our initial public offering, we expect to proactively evaluate opportunities to accelerate our organic growth and acquire banks, investment management firms and related businesses, while also seeking to hire talented personnel. We believe consolidation in the financial services industry along with the industry’s movement towards automated and impersonal client service further presents the Company with a unique and significant opportunity. Our business model differentiates us from the industry, which we expect will enable us to increase our market share in existing markets and, on a strategic and opportunistic basis, expand our geographic footprint into new markets in the Western United States that share similar characteristics to our current markets.
 Information Technology
 We continue to make investments in our information technology systems as we adapt to the changing technology, online and mobile, and other platform needs and wants of our clients. We believe that this investment is essential to our ability to offer new products and optimize overall client experience, provide opportunities for future growth and acquisitions, and provide a control structure that supports our operations. We leverage the experience of a third-party service provider to provide managed information technology services, enhance our IT security, and deliver the technical expertise around network design and architecture required to operate effectively. The majority of our systems are hosted 

 
  16

 
by third-party service providers. The scalability of this infrastructure supports our growth strategy. In addition, the tested capability of these vendors to switch over to standby systems should allow us to recover our systems and provide redundancy and business continuity quickly in case of a disaster.
 Enterprise Risk Management
 We place significant emphasis on our holistic approach to integrated risk management that provides oversight, control, and discipline to drive continuous improvement. Our governance framework includes a process of anticipating, identifying, assessing, managing and monitoring risks within the organization. We have developed an Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) Committee that oversees our ERM program. This group contains key members of management including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer. In order to carry out the ERM program, we have developed the following objectives to:
· | Integrate ERM practices with our strategy setting process and performance management practices to realize benefits related to value;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Improve the Company’s ability to identify risks and establish appropriate responses to reduce costs and limit losses;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Identify operational gaps to reduce performance variability;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


· | Identify interrelated risks within First Western and establish an integrated response; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Assess the positive and negative aspects of risk to address challenges and opportunities within our internal and external environment.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  We routinely monitor and measure risk throughout the organization and allocate resources and capital to maintain the quality of information and compliance within our regulatory environment.
 Competition
 The financial services industry is highly competitive and we compete in a number of areas, including commercial and consumer banking, residential mortgages, wealth advisory, investment management, trust, and insurance among others. We compete with other bank and nonbank institutions located within our market area, along with competitors situated regionally, nationally or with only an online presence. These include large banks and other financial intermediaries, such as consumer finance companies, brokerage firms, mortgage banking companies, business leasing and finance companies and insurance agencies, as well as major retailers, all actively engaged in providing various types of loans and other financial services. We also face growing competition from online businesses with few or no physical locations, including online banks, lenders and consumer and commercial lending platforms as well as automated retirement and investment services providers. Competition involves efforts to retain current clients, obtain new loan, deposit and advisory services customers, increase the scope and type of services offered, and offer competitive interest rates paid on deposits, charged on loans, or charged for advisory services. We believe our integrated and high-touch service offering, along with our sophisticated relationship-oriented approach sets us apart from our competitors. Associates
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 245 associates. We provide extensive training to our associates in an effort to ensure that our clients receive superior service and that our risks are well managed. None of our associates are represented by any collective bargaining unit or are parties to a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that our relations with our associates are good.

The foregoing information is also available in print to any shareholder who requests it from the Company. Except as explicitly provided, information furnished by the Company and information on, or accessible through, the SEC’s or the Company’s website is not incorporated into this Annual Report on Form 10-K or our other securities filings and is not a part of them.  Supervision and Regulation
 The U.S. banking industry is highly regulated under federal and state law. Banking laws, regulations, and policies affect the operations of the Company and its subsidiaries. Investors should understand that the primary objective of the U.S. bank regulatory regime is the protection of depositors, the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”), and the banking system as a whole, not the protection of the Company’s shareholders.
 As a bank holding company, we are subject to inspection, examination, supervision, and regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”). The Bank, which is our subsidiary, is a Colorado-chartered commercial bank and is not a member of the Federal Reserve System (a “state nonmember bank”). As such, the Bank is subject to regulation, supervision, and examination by both the Colorado Division of Banking (the “CDB”) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”). In addition, we expect that any additional businesses that we may invest in or acquire will be regulated by various state and/or federal banking regulators.
 Banking statutes and regulations are subject to continual review and revision by Congress, state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies. A change in such statutes or regulations, including changes in how they are interpreted or implemented, could have a material effect on our business. In addition to laws and regulations, state and federal bank regulatory agencies may issue policy statements, interpretive letters and similar written guidance pursuant to such laws and regulations, which are binding on us and our subsidiaries.
 Banking statutes, regulations and policies could restrict our ability to diversify into other areas of financial services, acquire depository institutions, and make distributions or pay dividends on our equity securities. They may also require us to provide financial support to any bank that we control, maintain capital balances in excess of those desired by management, and pay higher deposit insurance premiums as a result of a general deterioration in the financial condition of the Bank or other depository institutions we control.
 The description below summarizes certain elements of the applicable bank regulatory framework. This description is not intended to describe all laws and regulations applicable to us and our subsidiaries. The description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes, regulations, policies, interpretive letters and other written guidance that are described.
 Regulatory Capital
 The Company and the Bank are each required to comply with applicable capital adequacy standards established by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC. The current risk-based capital standards applicable to the Company and the Bank are based on the December 2010 final capital framework for strengthening international capital standards, known as Basel III, of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, or Basel Committee. In July 2013, the federal bank regulators approved final rules, the Basel III Capital Rules, implementing the Basel III framework as well as certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Basel III Capital Rules became effective for the Company and the Bank on January 1, 2015 

 
  18

 
(subject to a phase-in period for certain provisions). The Basel III Capital Rules require banks and bank holding companies, including the Company and the Bank, to maintain four minimum capital standards: (1) a Tier 1 capital‑to‑adjusted total assets ratio, or leverage capital ratio, of at least 4.0%; (2) a Tier 1 capital to risk‑weighted assets ratio, or Tier 1 risk‑based capital ratio, of at least 6.0%; (3) a total risk‑based capital (Tier 1 plus Tier 2) to risk‑weighted assets ratio, or total risk‑based capital ratio, of at least 8.0%; and (4) a common equity tier 1 (“CET1”) capital ratio of at least 4.5%. 
 The Basel III Capital Rules also call for bank holding companies and banks to maintain a “capital conservation buffer” on top of the minimum risk‑based capital requirements. The buffer must be composed of common equity Tier 1 capital. This buffer is intended to help to ensure that banking organizations conserve capital when it is most needed, allowing them to better weather periods of economic stress. The buffer, which became fully phased in on January 1, 2019, is 2.5% of risk‑weighted assets.
 The Basel III Capital Rules also attempt to improve the quality of capital by implementing changes to the definition of capital. Among the most important changes are stricter eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments that would disallow the inclusion of certain instruments, such as trust preferred securities (other than grandfathered trust preferred securities such as those issued by the Company), in Tier 1 capital going forward and new constraints on the inclusion of minority interests, mortgage‑servicing assets, deferred tax assets and certain investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions. In addition, the Basel III Capital Rules  require that most regulatory capital deductions be made from CET1 capital.
 The Federal Reserve and the FDIC may also set higher capital requirements for individual institutions whose circumstances warrant it. For example, institutions experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions are expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels, without significant reliance on intangible assets. At this time, the bank regulatory agencies are more inclined to impose higher capital requirements to meet well capitalized standards and future regulatory change could impose higher capital standards as a routine matter. The Company’s regulatory capital ratios and those of the Bank are in excess of the levels established for “well capitalized” institutions under the rules.
 These rules also set forth certain changes in the methods of calculating certain risk‑weighted assets, which in turn will affect the calculation of risk‑based ratios. Under the Basel III Capital Rules, higher or more sensitive risk weights have been assigned to various categories of assets, including certain credit facilities that finance the acquisition, development or construction of real property, certain exposures or credits that are 90 days past due or on nonaccrual status, foreign exposures and certain corporate exposures. In addition, these rules include greater recognition of collateral and guarantees, and revised capital treatment for derivatives and repo‑style transactions.
 In September 2017, the federal bank regulators proposed to revise and simplify the capital treatment for certain deferred tax assets, mortgage servicing assets, investments in non-consolidated financial entities and minority interests for banking organizations, such as the Company and the Bank, that are not subject to the advanced approaches requirements. In November 2017, the federal banking regulators revised the Basel III Capital Rules to extend the transitional treatment of these items for non-advanced approaches banking organizations until the September 2017 proposal is finalized. The September 2017 proposal would also change the capital treatment of certain commercial real estate loans under the standardized approach, which we use to calculate our capital ratios.
 In December 2017, the Basel Committee published standards that it described as the finalization of the Basel III post-crisis regulatory reforms (commonly referred to as Basel IV). Among other things, these standards revise the Basel Committee’s standardized approach for credit risk (including by recalibrating risk weights and introducing new capital requirements for certain “unconditionally cancellable commitments,” such as unused credit card lines of credit) and provides a new standardized approach for operational risk capital. Under the Basel framework, these standards will generally be effective on January 1, 2022, with an aggregate output floor phasing in through January 1, 2027. Under the current U.S. capital rules, operational risk capital requirements and a capital floor apply only to advanced approaches institutions, and not to the Company or the Bank. The impact of Basel IV on us will depend on the manner in which it is implemented by the federal bank regulators.

 The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (the “Regulatory Relief Act”), which was designed to ease certain restrictions imposed by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), was enacted on May 24, 2018.  Section 201 of the Regulatory Relief Act directs the federal banking agencies to develop a community bank leverage ratio (“CBLR”) of not less than 8% and not more than 10% for qualifying community banks and bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion.  Qualifying community banking organizations that exceed the CBLR level established by the agencies, and that elect to be covered by the CBLR framework, will be considered to have met:  (i) the generally applicable leverage and risk-based capital requirements under the banking agencies’ capital rules; (ii) the capital ratio requirements necessary to be considered “well capitalized” under the banking agencies’ prompt corrective action framework in the case of insured depository institutions; and (iii) any other applicable capital or leverage requirements.  On February 8, 2019, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve Board, and the FDIC published for comment a proposed rule to implement the provisions of Section 201 of the Regulatory Relief Act.  Under the proposal, a qualifying community banking organization would be defined as a depository institution or depository institution holding company with less than $10 billion in assets and specified limited amounts of off-balance sheet exposures, trading assets and liabilities, mortgage servicing assets, and certain temporary difference deferred tax assets.  A qualifying community banking organization would be permitted to elect the CBLR framework if its CBLR were greater than 9%.  The proposed rulemaking also addresses opting in and opting out of the CBLR framework by a community banking organization, the treatment of a community banking organization that falls below CBLR requirements, and the effect of various CBLR levels for purposes of the prompt corrective action categories applicable to insured depository institutions.  Advanced approaches banking organizations (generally, institutions with $250 billion or more in consolidated assets or $10 billion or more in on-balance sheet foreign exposure), or subsidiaries of such banking organizations, would not be eligible to use the CBLR framework.
 Regulation of the Company
 The Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, or the BHC Act, and other federal laws subject bank holding companies to particular restrictions on the types of activities in which they may engage, and to a range of supervisory requirements and activities, including regulatory enforcement actions for violations of laws and regulations.
 Permitted Activities.    Generally, bank holding companies are prohibited under the BHC Act from engaging in, or acquiring direct or indirect control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any company engaged in any activity other than (i) banking or managing or controlling banks or (ii) an activity that the Federal Reserve determines to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident to the business of banking. The Federal Reserve has the authority to require a bank holding company to terminate an activity or terminate control of or liquidate or divest certain subsidiaries or affiliates when the Federal Reserve believes the activity or the control of the subsidiary or affiliate constitutes a significant risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of any of its banking subsidiaries.
 Status as a Financial Holding Company.    Under the BHC Act, a bank holding company may file an election with the Federal Reserve to be treated as a financial holding company and engage in an expanded list of financial activities. The election must be accompanied by a certification that all of the company’s insured depository institution subsidiaries are “well capitalized” and “well managed.” Additionally, the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (“CRA”) rating of each subsidiary bank must be satisfactory or better. If, after becoming a financial holding company and undertaking activities not permissible for a bank holding company, the company fails to continue to meet any of the prerequisites for financial holding company status, the company must enter into an agreement with the Federal Reserve to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements. If the company does not return to compliance within 180 days, the Federal Reserve may order the company to divest its subsidiary banks or the company may discontinue or divest investments in companies engaged in activities permissible only for a bank holding company that has elected to be treated as a financial holding company. The Company filed an election and became a financial holding company in 2006.
 Sound Banking Practices.    Bank holding companies and their non-banking subsidiaries are prohibited from engaging in activities that represent unsafe or unsound banking practices. For example, under certain circumstances the Federal Reserve’s Regulation Y requires a holding company to give the Federal Reserve prior notice of any redemption or repurchase of its own equity securities if the consideration to be paid, together with the consideration paid for any repurchases in the preceding year, is equal to 10% or more of the company’s consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve may oppose the transaction if it believes that the transaction would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or would 

 
  20

 
violate a regulation. As another example, a holding company is prohibited from impairing its subsidiary bank’s soundness by causing the bank to make funds available to non-banking subsidiaries or their customers if the Federal Reserve believes it not prudent to do so. The Federal Reserve has the power to assess civil money penalties for knowing or reckless violations if the activities leading to a violation caused a substantial loss to a depository institution. Potential penalties are as high as $1.0 million for each day the activity continues.
 Source of Strength.    In accordance with the Dodd-Frank Act and long-standing Federal Reserve policy, the Company must act as a source of financial and managerial strength to the Bank. Under this policy, the Company must commit resources to support the Bank, including at times when the Company may not be in a financial position to provide it. As discussed below, the Company could be required to guarantee the capital plan of the Bank if it becomes undercapitalized for purposes of banking regulations. Any capital loans by a bank holding company to its subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary bank. The BHC Act provides that, in the event of a bank holding company’s bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a bank subsidiary will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment.
 Regulatory agencies have promulgated regulations to increase the capital requirements for bank holding companies to a level that matches those of banking institutions.
 Anti-Tying Restrictions.    Bank holding companies and affiliates are prohibited from tying the provision of services, such as extensions of credit, to other services offered by a holding company or its affiliates.
 Acquisitions.    The BHC Act, Section 18(c) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended (”FDIA”) the Colorado Banking Code and other federal and state statutes regulate acquisitions of commercial banks and their holding companies. The BHC Act generally limits acquisitions by bank holding companies to commercial banks and companies engaged in activities that the Federal Reserve has determined to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto. The BHC Act requires every bank holding company to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve before: (i) acquiring more than 5% of the voting stock of any bank or other bank holding company; (ii) acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of any bank or bank holding company; or (iii) merging or consolidating with any other bank holding company.
 In reviewing applications seeking approval of merger and acquisition transactions, the bank regulatory authorities generally consider, among other things, the competitive effect and public benefits of the transactions, the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the combined organization (including the capital position of the combined organization), the applicant’s performance record under the Community Reinvestment Act, or CRA (see the section captioned “Community Reinvestment Act” included below in this item), fair housing laws and the effectiveness of the subject organizations in combating money laundering activities.
 The Company is also subject to the Change in Bank Control Act of 1978 (“Control Act”) and related Federal Reserve regulations, which provide that any person who proposes to acquire at least 10% (but less than 25%) of any class of a bank holding company’s voting securities is presumed to control the company (unless the company is not publicly held or some other shareholder owns a greater percentage of voting stock). Any person who would be presumed to acquire control or who proposes to acquire control of more than 25% of any class of a bank holding company’s voting securities, or who proposes to acquire actual control, must provide the Federal Reserve with at least 60 days’ prior written notice of the acquisition. The Federal Reserve may disapprove a proposed acquisition if: (i) it would result in adverse competitive effects; (ii) the financial condition of the acquiring person might jeopardize the target institution’s financial stability or prejudice the interests of depositors; (iii) the competence, experience or integrity of any acquiring person indicates that the proposed acquisition would not be in the best interests of the depositors or the public; or (iv) the acquiring person fails to provide all of the information required by the Federal Reserve. Any proposed acquisition of the voting securities of a bank holding company that is subject to approval under the BHC Act is not subject to the Control Act notice requirements. Any company that proposes to acquire “control,” as those terms are defined in the BHC Act and Federal Reserve regulations, of a bank holding company or to acquire 25% or more of any class of voting securities of a bank holding company would be required to seek the Federal Reserve’s prior approval under the BHC Act to become a bank holding company.

 Dividends. The Company’s earnings and activities are affected by legislation, by regulations and by local legislative and administrative bodies and decisions of courts in the jurisdictions in which we conduct business. These include limitations on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to the Company and the Company’s ability to pay dividends to its shareholders. It is the policy of the Federal Reserve that bank holding companies should pay cash dividends on common stock only out of income available over the past year and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization’s expected future needs and financial condition. The policy provides that bank holding companies should not maintain a level of cash dividends that undermines the bank holding company’s ability to serve as a source of strength to its banking subsidiary. Consistent with such policy, a banking organization should have comprehensive policies on dividend payments that clearly articulate the organization’s objectives and approaches for maintaining a strong capital position and achieving the objectives of the policy statement.
 As a Colorado state-chartered bank, the Bank is subject to limitations under Colorado law on the payment of dividends. The Colorado Banking Code provides that a bank may declare dividends from retained earnings and other components of capital specifically approved by the Colorado State Banking Board so long as the declaration is made in compliance with rules established by the Colorado State Banking Board.
 In addition, a state nonmember bank may not declare a dividend if paying the dividend would result in the bank being undercapitalized under FDIA, discussed above, and must comply with any discretionary distribution restrictions imposed on it under the federal banking agencies’ capital buffer rules. The FDIC has stated that, in general, state nonmember banks can pay dividends in reasonable amounts only after the bank’s earnings have first been applied to the elimination of losses and the establishment of necessary reserves and prudent capital levels. The FDIC may also direct state nonmember banks that are poorly rated or subject to written supervisory actions not to pay dividends in order to ensure adequate capital exists to support their risk profile.
 In 2009, the Federal Reserve issued a supervisory letter providing greater clarity to its policy statement on the payment of dividends by bank holding companies. In this letter, the Federal Reserve stated that when a holding company’s board of directors is deciding on the level of dividends to declare, it should consider, among other factors: (i) overall asset quality, potential need to increase reserves and write down assets, and concentrations of credit; (ii) potential for unanticipated losses and declines in asset values; (iii) implicit and explicit liquidity and credit commitments, including off-balance sheet and contingent liabilities; (iv) quality and level of current and prospective earnings, including earnings capacity under a number of plausible economic scenarios; (v) current and prospective cash flow and liquidity; (vi) ability to serve as an ongoing source of financial and managerial strength to depository institution subsidiaries insured by the FDIC, including the extent of double leverage and the condition of subsidiary depository institutions; (vii) other risks that affect the holding company’s financial condition and are not fully captured in regulatory capital calculations; (viii) level, composition, and quality of capital; and (ix) ability to raise additional equity capital in prevailing market and economic conditions (the “Dividend Factors”). It is particularly important for a bank holding company’s board of directors to ensure that the dividend level is prudent relative to the organization’s financial position and is not based on overly optimistic earnings scenarios. In addition, a bank holding company’s board of directors should strongly consider, after careful analysis of the Dividend Factors, reducing, deferring or eliminating dividends when the quantity and quality of the holding company’s earnings have declined or the holding company is experiencing other financial problems, or when the macroeconomic outlook for the holding company’s primary profit centers has deteriorated. The Federal Reserve further stated that, as a general matter, a bank holding company should eliminate, defer or significantly reduce its distributions if: (i) its net income is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends; (ii) its prospective rate of earnings retention is not consistent with its capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition; or (iii) it will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios. Failure to do so could result in a supervisory finding that the bank holding company is operating in an unsafe and unsound manner.
 Additionally, the Federal Reserve possesses enforcement powers over bank holding companies and their non-bank subsidiaries with which it can prevent or remedy actions that represent unsafe or unsound practices, or violations of applicable statutes and regulations. Among these powers is the ability to proscribe the payment of dividends by banks and bank holding companies.
 Stock Redemptions and Repurchases.    It is an essential principle of safety and soundness that a banking organization’s redemption and repurchases of regulatory capital instruments, including common stock, from investors be 

 
  22

 
consistent with the organization’s current and prospective capital needs. In assessing such needs, the board of directors and management of a bank holding company should consider the Dividend Factors discussed above under “Dividends.” The risk-based capital rule directs bank holding companies to consult with the Federal Reserve before redeeming any equity or other capital instrument included in Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital prior to stated maturity, if such redemption could have a material effect on the level or composition of the organization’s capital base. Bank holding companies that are experiencing financial weaknesses, or that are at significant risk of developing financial weaknesses, must consult with the appropriate Federal Reserve supervisory staff before redeeming or repurchasing common stock or other regulatory capital instruments for cash or other valuable consideration. Similarly, any bank holding company considering expansion, whether through acquisitions or through organic growth and new activities, generally also must consult with the appropriate Federal Reserve supervisory staff before redeeming or repurchasing common stock or other regulatory capital instruments for cash or other valuable consideration. In evaluating the appropriateness of a bank holding company’s proposed redemption or repurchase of capital instruments, the Federal Reserve will consider the potential losses that the holding company may suffer from the prospective need to increase reserves and write down assets from continued asset deterioration and the holding company’s ability to raise additional common stock and other Tier 1 capital to replace capital instruments that are redeemed or repurchased. A bank holding company must inform the Federal Reserve of a redemption or repurchase of common stock or perpetual preferred stock for cash or other value resulting in a net reduction of the bank holding company’s outstanding amount of common stock or perpetual preferred stock below the amount of such capital instrument outstanding at the beginning of the quarter in which the redemption or repurchase occurs. In addition, a bank holding company must advise the Federal Reserve sufficiently in advance of such redemptions and repurchases to provide reasonable opportunity for supervisory review and possible objection should the Federal Reserve determine a transaction raises safety and soundness concerns.
 Regulation Y requires that a bank holding company that is not well capitalized or well managed, or that is subject to any unresolved supervisory issues, provide prior notice to the Federal Reserve for any repurchase or redemption of its equity securities for cash or other value that would reduce by 10% or more the holding company’s consolidated net worth aggregated over the preceding 12-month period.
 Annual Reporting; Examinations.    The Company is required to file an annual report with the Federal Reserve and to provide such additional information as the Federal Reserve may require. The Federal Reserve may examine a bank holding company and any of its subsidiaries, and charge the company for the cost of such an examination.
 The Bank is examined from time to time by its primary federal banking regulator, the FDIC, and the CDB and is charged for the cost of such an examination. Depending on the results of a given examination, the FDIC and the CDB may revalue the Bank’s assets and require that the Bank establish specific reserves to compensate for the difference between the value determined by the regulator and the book value of the assets.
 Imposition of Liability for Undercapitalized Subsidiaries.    FDIA requires bank regulators to take “prompt corrective action” to resolve problems associated with insured depository institutions. In the event an institution becomes “undercapitalized,” it must submit a capital restoration plan. The capital restoration plan will not be accepted by the regulators unless each company “having control of” the undercapitalized institution “guarantees” the subsidiary’s compliance with the capital restoration plan until it becomes “adequately capitalized.” For purposes of this statute, the Company has control of the Bank. Under FDIA, the aggregate liability of all companies controlling a particular institution is limited to the lesser of five percent of the depository institution’s total assets at the time it became undercapitalized or the amount necessary to bring the institution into compliance with applicable capital standards. FDIA grants greater powers to bank regulators in situations where an institution becomes “significantly” or “critically” undercapitalized or fails to submit a capital restoration plan. For example, a bank holding company controlling such an institution can be required to obtain prior Federal Reserve approval of proposed distributions, or might be required to consent to a merger or to divest the troubled institution or other affiliates.
 State Law Restrictions.    As a Colorado corporation, the Company is subject to certain limitations and restrictions under applicable Colorado corporate law. For example, state law restrictions in Colorado include limitations and restrictions relating to indemnification of directors; distributions and dividends to shareholders; transactions involving directors, officers or interested shareholders; maintenance of books, records, and minutes; and observance of certain corporate formalities.

 Regulation of the Bank
 Capital Adequacy. Under the Basel III Capital Rules, discussed above, the FDIC monitors the capital adequacy of the Bank by using a combination of risk‑based guidelines and leverage ratios. The FDIC considers the Bank’s capital levels when taking action on various types of applications and when conducting supervisory activities related to the safety and soundness of the Bank and the banking system. Higher capital levels may be required if warranted by the circumstances or risk profiles of individual institutions, or if required by the banking regulators due to the economic conditions impacting our markets. For example, FDIC regulations provide that higher capital may be required to take adequate account of, among other things, interest rate risk and the risks posed by concentrations of credit, nontraditional activities or securities trading activities.
 As of December 31, 2018, the Bank exceeded all regulatory minimum capital requirements.
 Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action.    Under applicable federal statutes, the federal bank regulatory agencies are required to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to institutions that do not meet specified minimum capital requirements. For these purposes, the law establishes five capital categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. Under the FDIC’s prompt corrective action regulations, an institution is deemed to be “well capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, a Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 8.0% or greater, a common equity Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets ratio of 6.5% or better and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater. An institution is “adequately capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 6.0% or greater, a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 4.5% or better and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.0% or greater. An institution is “undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0%, a Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of less than 6.0%, a common equity Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets ratio of less than 4.5% or a Tier 1 leverage ratio of less than 4.0%. An institution is deemed to be “significantly undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of less than 4.0%, a common equity Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets ratio of less than 3.0% or a Tier 1 leverage ratio of less than 3.0%. An institution is considered to be “critically undercapitalized” if it has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0%.
  Undercapitalized institutions are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit a capital restoration plan to the FDIC. The federal bank regulatory agencies may not accept such a plan without determining, among other things, that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institution’s capital. In addition, for a capital restoration plan to be acceptable, the depository institution’s parent holding company must guarantee that the institution will comply with such capital restoration plan. If a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is “significantly undercapitalized.” “Significantly undercapitalized” depository institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become “adequately capitalized,” requirements to reduce total assets, and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks. “Critically undercapitalized” institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator.
 As of December 31, 2018, the Bank qualified as “well capitalized” under the prompt corrective action rules.
 Deposit Insurance Assessments.    All of a depositor’s accounts at an insured bank, including all noninterest-bearing transaction accounts, are insured by the FDIC up to $250,000. FDIC-insured banks are required to pay deposit insurance premiums to the FDIC. The FDIC has adopted a risk-based assessment system whereby FDIC-insured depository institutions pay insurance premiums at rates based on their risk classification. An institution’s risk classification is assigned based on its capital levels and the level of supervisory concern the institution poses to the regulators.
 Assessments are based on an institution’s average total consolidated assets less average tangible equity (subject to risk-based adjustments that would further reduce the assessment base for custodial banks). The Bank may be able to pass part or all of this cost on to its clients, including in the form of lower interest rates on deposits, or fees to some depositors, depending on market conditions.
 The FDIC may terminate a depository institution’s deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution’s financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or has violated any 

 
  24

 
applicable rule, regulation, order or condition enacted or imposed by the institution’s regulatory agency. If deposit insurance for a banking business that we invest in or acquire were to be terminated, that would have a material adverse effect on that banking business and potentially on the Company as a whole.
 Depositor Preference.    FDIA provides that, in the event of the “liquidation or other resolution” of an insured depository institution, the claims of depositors of the institution, including the claims of the FDIC as subrogee of insured depositors, and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as a receiver, will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution. If an insured depository institution fails, insured and uninsured depositors, along with the FDIC, will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured, non-deposit creditors, including the parent bank holding company, with respect to any extensions of credit they have made to such insured depository institution.
 Consumer Financial Protection.    The Bank is subject to a number of federal and state consumer protection laws that extensively govern its relationship with its customers. These laws include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Right to Financial Privacy Act, the Service Members Civil Relief Act and these laws’ respective state law counterparts, as well as state usury laws and laws regarding unfair and deceptive acts and practices. These and other federal laws, among other things, require disclosures of the cost of credit and terms of deposit accounts, provide substantive consumer rights, prohibit discrimination in credit transactions, regulate the use of credit report information, provide financial privacy protections, prohibit unfair, deceptive and abusive practices, restrict the Bank’s ability to raise interest rates and subject the Company and the Bank to substantial regulatory oversight. Violations of applicable consumer protection laws can result in significant potential liability from litigation brought by customers, including actual damages, restitution and attorneys’ fees. Federal bank regulators, state attorneys general and state and local consumer protection agencies may also seek to enforce consumer protection requirements and obtain these and other remedies, including regulatory sanctions, customer rescission rights, action by the state and local attorneys general in each jurisdiction in which we operate and civil money penalties. Failure to comply with consumer protection requirements may also result in our failure to obtain any required bank regulatory approval for merger or acquisition transactions the Company may want to pursue or our prohibition from engaging in such transactions even if approval is not required.
 The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) has broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer financial laws that apply to all banks. The CFPB is authorized to issue rules for both bank and non-bank companies that offer consumer financial products and services, subject to consultation with the prudential banking regulators. In general, however, banks with assets of $10 billion or less, such as the Bank, will continue to be examined for consumer compliance by their primary bank regulator.
 Much of the CFPB’s rulemaking has focused on mortgage lending and servicing, including an important rule requiring lenders to ensure that prospective buyers have the ability to repay their mortgages. Other areas of current CFPB focus include consumer protections for prepaid cards, payday lending, debt collection, overdraft services and privacy notices. The CFPB has been particularly active in issuing rules and guidelines concerning residential mortgage lending and servicing, issuing numerous rules and guidance related to residential mortgages. Perhaps the most significant of these guidelines is the “Ability-to-Repay and Qualified Mortgage Standards under the Truth in Lending Act” portions of Regulation Z. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, creditors must make a reasonable and good faith determination, based on verified and documented information, that the consumer has a reasonable “ability to repay” a residential mortgage according to its terms. There is a statutory presumption of compliance with this requirement for mortgages that meet the requirements to be deemed “qualified mortgages.” The CFPB rule defines the key threshold terms “ability to repay” and “qualified mortgage.”
 The CFPB has actively issued enforcement actions against both large and small entities and to entities across the entire financial service industry. The CFPB has relied upon “unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts” prohibitions as its primary enforcement tool. However, the CFPB and Department of Justice (‘DOJ”) continue to be focused on fair lending in taking enforcement actions against banks with renewed emphasis on alleged “redlining” practices. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could give rise to regulatory sanctions, client rescission rights, actions by state and local attorneys general and civil or criminal liability.

 Brokered Deposit Restrictions.    Well capitalized institutions are not subject to limitations on brokered deposits, while an adequately capitalized institution is able to accept, renew or roll over brokered deposits only with a waiver from the FDIC and is subject to certain restrictions on the yield paid on such deposits. Undercapitalized institutions are generally not permitted to accept, renew or roll over brokered deposits.
 Community Reinvestment Act.    The CRA is intended to encourage banks to help meet the credit needs of their entire communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with safe and sound operations. The regulators examine banks and assign each bank a public CRA rating. The CRA then requires bank regulators to take into account the bank’s record in meeting the needs of its community when considering certain applications by a bank, including applications to establish a banking center or to conduct certain mergers or acquisitions. The Federal Reserve is required to consider the CRA records of a bank holding company’s controlled banks when considering an application by the bank holding company to acquire a bank or to merge with another bank holding company.
 When we apply for regulatory approval to make certain investments, the regulators will consider the CRA record of the target institution and our depository institution subsidiary. An unsatisfactory CRA record could substantially delay approval or result in denial of an application.
 Insider Credit Transactions.    Banks are subject to certain restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve Act on extensions of credit to certain executive officers, directors, principal shareholders and any related interests of such persons. Extensions of credit to such persons must (a) be made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with persons not covered by such restrictions, and (b) not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features. Banks are also subject to certain lending limits and restrictions on overdrafts to such persons. A violation of these restrictions may result in the assessment of substantial civil monetary penalties on the affected bank or any officer, director, employee, agent or other person participating in the conduct of the affairs of that bank, the imposition of a cease and desist order, and other regulatory sanctions.
 Safety and Soundness Standards.    Under the FDIC Improvement Act (“FDICIA”), each federal banking agency has prescribed, by regulation, non-capital safety and soundness standards for institutions under its authority. These standards cover internal controls, information and internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, compensation, fees and benefits, such other operational and managerial standards as the agency determines to be appropriate, and standards for asset quality, earnings and stock valuation. An institution which fails to meet these standards must develop a plan acceptable to the agency, specifying the steps that the institution will take to meet the standards. Failure to submit or implement such a plan may subject the institution to regulatory sanctions.
 Financial Privacy.    In accordance with the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (the “GLB Act”), federal banking regulators adopted rules that limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties. These rules require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to a nonaffiliated third party. The privacy provisions of the GLB Act affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors.
 Anti-Money Laundering.    Under federal law, including the Bank Secrecy Act and Title III of the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (the “USA PATRIOT Act”), certain types of financial institutions, including insured depository institutions, must maintain anti-money laundering programs that include established internal policies, procedures and controls; a designated compliance officer; an ongoing training program; and testing of the program by an independent audit function. Financial institutions are restricted from entering into specified financial transactions and account relationships and must meet enhanced standards for due diligence, client identification and recordkeeping, including in their dealings with non-U.S. financial institutions and non-U.S. clients. Financial institutions must take reasonable steps to conduct enhanced scrutiny of account relationships to guard against money laundering and to report any suspicious information maintained by financial institutions. Bank regulators routinely examine institutions for compliance with these obligations and they must consider an institution’s anti-money laundering compliance when considering regulatory applications filed by the 

 
  26

 
institution, including applications for banking mergers and acquisitions. The regulatory authorities have imposed “cease and desist” orders and civil money penalty sanctions against institutions found to be violating these obligations.
 Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulation.    The United States has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, foreign nationals and others. These are typically known as the “OFAC” rules based on their administration by the U.S. Department of the Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”). The OFAC-administered sanctions targeting countries take many different forms. Generally, however, they contain one or more of the following elements: (i) restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country, including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on “U.S. persons” engaging in financial transactions relating to making investments in, or providing investment-related advice or assistance to, a sanctioned country; and (ii) a blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest, by prohibiting transfers of property subject to U.S. jurisdiction (including property in the possession or control of U.S. persons). Blocked assets (e.g., property and bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC. The Bank is responsible for, among other things, blocking accounts of, and transactions with, such targets and countries, prohibiting unlicensed trade and financial transactions with them and reporting blocked transactions after their occurrence. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences
 Transactions with Affiliates
 Transactions between depository institutions and their affiliates, including transactions between the Bank and the Company, are governed by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and the Federal Reserve’s Regulation W promulgated thereunder. Generally, Section 23A limits the extent to which a depository institution and its subsidiaries may engage in “covered transactions” with any one affiliate to an amount equal to 10% of the depository institution’s capital stock and surplus, and contains an aggregate limit on all such transactions with all affiliates of an amount equal to 20% of the depository institution’s capital stock and surplus. Section 23A also establishes specific collateral requirements for loans or extensions of credit to, or guarantees, acceptances or letters of credit issued on behalf of, an affiliate. Section 23B requires that covered transactions and a broad list of other specified transactions be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the depository institution and its subsidiaries, as those for similar transactions with non-affiliates. The Volcker Rule
 Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act, commonly known as the “Volcker Rule,” generally prohibits certain banking entities from engaging in short-term proprietary trading of financial instruments and from owning, sponsoring or having certain relationships with hedge funds or private equity funds (collectively, “covered funds”). Management believes the investment portfolio and activities of the Bank, the Company, and their affiliates and subsidiaries are in compliance with the Volcker Rule and its implementing regulations. Concentration in Commercial Real Estate Lending
 As a part of their regulatory oversight, the federal regulators have issued guidelines on sound risk management practices with respect to a financial institution’s CRE lending activities. The guidelines identify certain concentration levels that, if exceeded, will expose the institution to additional supervisory analysis surrounding the institution’s CRE concentration risk. The guidelines are designed to promote appropriate levels of capital and sound loan and risk management practices for institutions with a concentration of CRE loans. The Company’s CRE concentrations are discussed in the “Risk Factors” section below. Interstate Banking and Branching
 Under the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1999 (the “Riegle-Neal Act”), a bank holding company may acquire banks in states other than its home state, subject to any state requirement that the bank has been organized and operating for a minimum period of time, not to exceed five years, and to certain deposit market-share limitations. Bank holding companies must be well capitalized and well managed, not merely adequately capitalized and 

 
  27

 
adequately managed, in order to acquire a bank located outside of the bank holding company’s home state. The Riegle-Neal Act also authorizes banks to merge across state lines, thereby creating interstate branches.
 Colorado state law provides that a Colorado-chartered bank can establish a branch anywhere in Colorado provided that the branch is approved in advance by the CDB. The branch must also be approved by the FDIC. The approval process takes into account a number of factors, including financial history, capital adequacy, earnings prospects, character of management, needs of the community and consistency with corporate powers. The Dodd-Frank Act permits a national or state bank, with the approval of its regulator, to open a de novo branch in any state if the law of the state in which the branch is proposed would permit the establishment of the branch if the bank was charted in such state.
 The Federal Reserve, OCC and FDIC jointly issued a final rule in 1997 that adopted uniform regulations implementing Section 109 of the Riegle-Neal Act. Section 109 prohibits any bank from establishing or acquiring a branch or branches outside of its home state primarily for the purpose of deposit production. Congress enacted Section 109 to ensure that interstate branches would not take deposits from a community without the bank reasonably helping to meet the credit needs of that community.
 Limitations on Incentive Compensation
 In June 2016, several federal financial agencies (including the Federal Reserve and FDIC) re-proposed restrictions on incentive-based compensation pursuant to Section 956 of the Dodd-Frank Act for financial institutions with $1 billion or more in total consolidated assets. For institutions with at least $1 billion but less than $50 billion in total consolidated assets, the proposal would impose principles-based restrictions that are broadly consistent with existing interagency guidance on incentive-based compensation. Such institutions would be prohibited from entering into incentive compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks by the institution (i) by providing an executive officer, employee, director, principal shareholder or individuals who are “significant risk takers” with excessive compensation, fees or benefits, or (ii) that could lead to material financial loss to the institution. The comment period for these proposed regulations has closed, but a final rule has not been published. Depending upon the outcome of the rule making process, the application of this rule to us could require us to revise our compensation strategy, increase our administrative costs and adversely affect our ability to recruit and retain qualified associates. Cybersecurity
 In March 2015, the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council issued two related statements regarding cybersecurity. One statement indicates that financial institutions should design multiple layers of security controls to establish lines of defense and to ensure that their risk management processes also address the risk posed by compromised customer credentials, including security measures to reliably authenticate customers accessing internet-based services of the financial institution. The other statement indicates that a financial institution’s management is expected to maintain sufficient business continuity planning processes to ensure the rapid recovery, resumption and maintenance of the institution’s operations after a cyber-attack involving destructive malware. A financial institution is also expected to develop appropriate processes to enable recovery of data and business operations and address rebuilding network capabilities and restoring data if the institution or its critical service providers fall victim to this type of cyber-attack. If we fail to observe the regulatory guidance, we could be subject to various regulatory sanctions, including financial penalties. 2018 Regulatory Reform
 As mentioned above, the Regulatory Relief Act was enacted in May 2018 and was designed to ease certain restrictions imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act.  Most of the provisions of the Regulatory Relief Act can be grouped into five general areas:  mortgage lending; certain regulatory relief for “community” banks; enhanced consumer protections in specific areas, including subjecting credit reporting agencies to additional requirements; certain regulatory relief for large financial institutions, including increasing the threshold at which institutions are classified a systemically important financial institutions (from $50 billion to $250 billion) and therefore subject to stricter oversight, and revising the rules for larger institution stress testing; and certain changes to Federal securities regulations designed to promote capital formation.  Some of the key provisions of the Regulatory Relief Act as it relates to community banks and bank holding companies include, but are not limited to: (i) designating mortgages held in portfolio as “qualified mortgages” for banks with less 

 
  28

 
than $10 billion in assets, subject to certain documentation and product limitations; (ii) exempting banks with less than $10 billion in assets (and total trading assets and trading liabilities of 5% or less of total assets) from Volcker Rule requirements relating to proprietary trading; (iii) simplifying capital calculations for banks with less than $10 billion in assets by requiring the federal banking agencies to establish a community bank leverage ratio of tangible equity to average consolidated assets of not less than 8% or more than 10%, and provide that banks that maintain tangible equity in excess of such ratio will be deemed to be in compliance with risk-based capital and leverage requirements; (iv) assisting smaller banks with obtaining stable funding by providing an exception for reciprocal deposits from FDIC restrictions on acceptance of brokered deposits; (v) raising the eligibility threshold for use of short-form Call Reports from $1 billion to $5 billion in assets; (vi) clarifying definitions pertaining to high volatility commercial real estate loans (“HVCRE”), which require higher capital allocations, so that only loans with increased risk are subject to higher risk weightings; (vii) directing the Federal Reserve to raise the asset threshold of the Policy Statement from $1 billion to $3 billion; and (viii) raising the consolidated asset threshold from $1 billion to $3 billion for eligible banks to undergo 18-month examination cycles rather than annual cycles.
 We will continue to analyze the changes resulting from the Regulatory Relief Act and the federal banking agencies’ implementation efforts, including the CBLR framework proposal.  We believe these reforms are favorable to our operations, but the true impact remains difficult to predict until rulemaking is complete and the reforms are fully implemented.
 Changing Regulatory Structure and Future Legislation and Regulation
 Congress may enact further legislation that affects the regulation of the financial services industry, and state legislatures may enact further legislation affecting the regulation of financial institutions chartered by or operating in these states. Federal and state regulatory agencies also periodically propose and adopt changes to their regulations or change the manner in which existing regulations are applied. We cannot predict the substance or impact of pending or future legislation or regulations, or the application thereof, although enactment of the proposed legislation could impact the regulatory structure under which the Company operates and may significantly increase costs, impede the efficiency of internal business processes, require an increase in regulatory capital, require modifications to the Company’s business strategy, and limit the Company’s ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner. A change in statutes, regulations or regulatory policies applicable to the Company or any of its subsidiaries could have a material effect on our business. Monetary Policy and Economic Environment
 The policies of regulatory authorities, including the monetary policy of the Federal Reserve, can have a significant effect on the operating results of bank holding companies and their subsidiaries. Among the means available to the Federal Reserve to affect the money supply are open market operations in United States Government securities, changes in the discount rate on member bank borrowings, and changes in reserve requirements against member bank deposits. These means are used in varying combinations to influence overall growth and distribution of bank loans, investments and deposits, and their use may affect interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits.
 The Federal Reserve’s monetary policies have materially affected the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. The nature of future monetary policies and the effects of these policies on the Bank’s business and earnings cannot be predicted.
