General
 
We are a world leader in the production of high value natural products derived from microalgae. Incorporated in 1983, we are guided by the principle of providing beneficial, quality microalgal products for health and human nutrition in a sustainable, reliable and environmentally sensitive operation. We are GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices) certified by the Natural Products Association™, reinforcing our commitment to quality in our products, quality in our relationships (with our customers, suppliers, employees and the communities we live in), and quality of the environment in which we work. Our products include:

● | Hawaiian BioAstin® natural astaxanthin - a powerful dietary antioxidant shown to support and maintain the body’s natural inflammatory response, to enhance skin, and to support eye and joint health. It has expanding applications as a human nutraceutical and functional food ingredient; and

● | Hawaiian Spirulina Pacifica® - a nutrient-rich dietary supplement used for extra energy, a strengthened immune system, cardiovascular benefits and as a source of antioxidant carotenoids 

 
Microalgae are a diverse group of microscopic plants that have a wide range of physiological and biochemical characteristics and contain, among other things, high levels of natural protein, amino acids, vitamins, pigments and enzymes. Microalgae have the following properties that make commercial production attractive: (1) microalgae grow much faster than land grown plants, often up to 100 times faster; (2) microalgae have uniform cell structures with no bark, stems, branches or leaves, permitting easier extraction of products and higher utilization of the microalgae cells; and (3) the cellular uniformity of microalgae makes it practical to control the growing environment in order to optimize a particular cell characteristic. Efficient and effective cultivation of microalgae requires consistent light, warm temperatures, low rainfall and proper chemical balance in a very nutrient-rich environment, free of environmental contaminants and unwanted organisms. This is a challenge that has motivated us to design, develop and implement proprietary production and harvesting technologies, systems and processes in order to commercially produce human nutritional products derived from microalgae.
 
Our production of these products at the 96-acre facility on the Kona Coast of the island of Hawaii provides several benefits. We selected the Keahole Point location in order to take advantage of relatively consistent warm temperatures, sunshine and low levels of rainfall needed for optimal cultivation of microalgae. This location also offers us access to cold deep ocean water, drawn from an offshore depth of 2,000 feet, which we use in our Ocean-Chill Drying system to eliminate the oxidative damage caused by standard drying techniques and as a source of trace nutrients for microalgal cultures. The area is also designated a Biosecure Zone, with tight control of organisms allowed into the area and free of genetically modified organisms (GMO’s). In November 2018, we acquired the former Cellana Demonstration Facility adjacent to the northern border of our existing 90 acres. This six-acre pilot production and research facility will provide us with upgraded and expanded lab space that will facilitate our research and development efforts. We believe that our technology, systems, processes and favorable growing location generally permit year-round harvest of our microalgal products in a cost-effective manner.
 
Our Business
 
We operate entirely in one operating segment, the cultivation and production of microalgae into high-value, high-quality natural health and nutrition products. We cultivate, on a large-scale basis, two microalgal species from which our two major product lines, natural astaxanthin products and spirulina products, are derived. We record revenue and cost of sales information by product category, but do not record operating expenses by such product category.

Natural Astaxanthin Products
 
We commenced commercial production of natural astaxanthin in 1997 and in 1999 introduced BioAstin®, our natural astaxanthin product for the human health and nutrition market. BioAstin® represents approximately 65% of our net sales in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019. Astaxanthin’s antioxidant properties are believed to surpass many of the antioxidant properties of vitamin C, vitamin E, beta-carotene and other carotenoids. Independent scientific studies indicate that in certain models, natural astaxanthin has up to 550 times the antioxidant activity of vitamin E and 10 times the antioxidant activity of beta-carotene. In addition, a growing body of scientific literature suggests that natural astaxanthin has beneficial properties as an anti-inflammatory, with additional benefits for joint, skin and eye health. 
 
BioAstin® is GRAS (generally recognized as safe) as determined by the United States Food and Drug Administration. Our all natural BioAstin® is cultivated without the use of herbicides or pesticides and is not genetically modified (non-GMO). In fiscal 2012, we applied for a new dietary ingredient (NDI), with the United States Food and Drug Administration, providing for a daily dosage of 12mg of astaxanthin which was reviewed without comment.
 
We produce natural astaxanthin from Haematococcus pluvialis microalgae grown in fresh water supplemented with nutrients. As these algae are extremely susceptible to contamination by unwanted algae, protozoa and amoebae, we developed a proprietary system known as the PhytoDome Closed Culture System or PhytoDome CCS to overcome this problem. Using these large-scale photobioreactors, we have generally been able to grow consistently large volumes of contaminant-free Haematococcus culture, subject to quarterly seasonality.
 
For the final stage of cultivation, the Haematococcus algae is transferred to open ponds where an environmental stress is applied causing the algae to form spores which accumulate high levels of astaxanthin. The astaxanthin crop in each pond is circulated by paddlewheels to keep an even blend of nutrients in suspension and a uniform exposure of the algae to sunlight, which is a major component of cultivation. Once ready for harvest, the media containing these spores is transported through underground pipes to our astaxanthin processing building where the culture media and algal spores are separated. Unlike spirulina, astaxanthin is produced in a batch-mode and each cultivation pond must be completely drained and thoroughly cleaned between cycles.
 
The harvested algal spores are dried to flakes or a fine powder. During processing, the spores are cracked in a proprietary system to assure efficient extraction of astaxanthin. Natural astaxanthin is processed further utilizing a high-pressure supercritical carbon dioxide extraction process at our facility in Kona. The resulting product is a water insoluble lipid extract used in the production of gelcaps.
 
All natural astaxanthin products undergo a prescribed set of microbiological food product tests to ensure safety and quality. We use third party contract manufacturers for the encapsulation and packaging of gelcaps. All third-party contract manufacturers are audit inspected by our Quality Department and are required to comply with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) regulations. These contract manufacturers hold independent third party GMP certifications.
 
BioAstin® is sold primarily as a packaged consumer product through Nutrex Hawaii to natural product distributors, retailers and online channels, or directly to consumers. It is also sold in liquid lipid form as a raw ingredient to dietary supplement manufacturers, health food formulators and cosmetic manufacturers. BioAstin® gelcaps are sold in bulk quantities to international distributors. In 2007, we also introduced a line of BioAstin® based nutritional supplements, MDFormulas. MDFormulas combined the health benefits of BioAstin® with other proven nutrients with benefits for targeted applications such as skin, heart and joint health. In 2012, we began selling our 12 milligram BioAstin® consumer product and in fiscal 2016 we introduced vegetarian formulas of both 4 and 12 milligram consumer products.
 
BioAstin® competes directly with similar products marketed by other manufacturers including Fuji Chemical of Japan, Algatechnologies of Israel and BGG of China. In the general category of nutritional supplements, BioAstin® and MDFormulas also compete with a variety of vitamins, dietary supplements and other antioxidant products available to consumers. The nutritional products market is highly competitive and includes international, national, regional and local producers and distributors, many of whom have greater resources than we have, and many of whom offer a greater variety of products.

The potential benefits of astaxanthin to human health are continuing to emerge. As one of the most potent and bioactive biological antioxidants found in nature, the number of potential roles of natural astaxanthin for human health is growing. Much research has been published in recent years on the beneficial roles of antioxidants in our health, in the aging process and on specific health conditions. The full efficacy of BioAstin® as a human nutraceutical supplement requires further significant clinical study. Independent antioxidant research and prior clinical trials show promising human applications. We hold three United States patents relating to the usage of BioAstin® in the treatment of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, the treatment of canker/cold sores and for its use as a topical and oral sunscreen.
 
Spirulina Products
 
We have been producing a strain of spirulina microalgae marketed as Hawaiian Spirulina Pacifica® since 1984. Spirulina Pacifica® represents approximately 34% of our net sales in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019. Spirulina Pacifica® provides a plant-based, highly absorbable source of protein, natural beta-carotene, mixed carotenoids, B vitamins, gamma linolenic acid, essential amino acids and other phytonutrients.
 
Spirulina Pacifica® is produced in two forms: powder and tablets. Powder is used as an ingredient in nutritional supplements and health beverages; tablets are consumed as a daily dietary supplement. Both forms are sold as raw material ingredients in bulk quantities, as packaged consumer products under the Nutrex Hawaii label and as private label consumer packaged products.
 
Spirulina Pacifica® is GRAS (generally recognized as safe) for addition to a variety of foods as determined by the United States Food and Drug Administration. Our all natural Spirulina Pacifica® is cultivated without the use of herbicides or pesticides, is not genetically modified (non-GMO) and is certified Kosher by Organized Kashrus Laboratories of Brooklyn, New York and certified Halal by the Islamic Food and Nutrition Council of America.
 
Our Spirulina Pacifica® is cultivated in a combination of fresh water and a metered amount of nutrient-rich deep ocean water (containing essential trace elements), drawn from a depth of 2,000 feet below sea level. This water mixture is supplemented with other major required nutrients. We recycle fresh water in our spirulina production process where possible and continue to explore further recycling opportunities.
 
The spirulina crop in each pond is circulated by paddlewheels to keep an even blend of nutrients in suspension and a uniform exposure of the algae to sunlight, which is a major component of cultivation. Our ponds are engineered to maintain the right media depth for sunlight to permeate each crop completely, facilitating rapid growth. The design of our cultivation ponds promotes efficient growing conditions, allowing the Spirulina Pacifica® algae to reproduce rapidly. Each pond can be harvested, on average, in six days.
 
 Once ready for harvest, a majority of the spirulina algae are pumped from a pond to our processing building where the crop is separated from the culture media. The culture remaining in the ponds serves as an inoculum for the next growth cycle. Harvested spirulina is washed with fresh water and filtered before moving to the drying stage. Culture media separated from spirulina algae during processing are conserved and recycled. Our Integrated Culture Biology Management (“ICBM”) technology for microalgae cultivation has proven to be a reliable and stable operating environment, allowing us to grow and harvest spirulina without significant contamination by unwanted microorganisms and without associated loss of productivity.
 
Spirulina Pacifica® powder is dried via our low-oxygen Ocean-Chill Drying process, thereby preserving high levels of antioxidant carotenoids and other nutrients sensitive to heat and oxygen. The rapid drying process results in a dark green powder. Spirulina powder is generally difficult to form into tablets, and most tablet manufacturers either add high amounts (from 10% to 30%) of inert substances to “glue” the tablet together or use a heat granulation process that destroys nutrients. In contrast, our Spirulina Pacifica® tablets contain a maximum of 2% of such substances and are produced in cold press compression tablet-making machines.
 
 Each production lot of Spirulina Pacifica® is sampled and subjected to thorough quality control analyses including testing for moisture, carotenoids, minerals, color and taste, among others. Further, each lot of our Spirulina Pacifica® undergoes a prescribed set of microbiological food product tests, including total aerobic bacteria, coliform bacteria and E. coli. The Spirulina Pacifica® powder and tablets are packaged to extend shelf life and ensure product freshness. Our packaged consumer products are bottled and labeled by third party contractors in California. These contractors are subject to regular government inspections and hold Drug Manufacturing Licenses & Processed Food Registrations with the State of California Department of Health. These contract manufacturers hold independent third party GMP certifications.

The majority of our bulk spirulina is sold to international health food manufacturers and formulators, many of whom identify and promote our Hawaiian Spirulina Pacifica® in their products. Such customers purchase bulk powder or bulk tablets and package these products under their brand label for sale to the health and natural food markets in their countries. Some of the brands produced by these customers are marketed and sold in direct competition with the packaged consumer products sold through our Nutrex Hawaii subsidiary in international channels. In the domestic market, Nutrex Hawaii packaged consumer products are sold through natural product distributors, retailers and online channels, or directly to consumers. In selected international markets, we have exclusive sales distributors for both our bulk and packaged consumer products.
 
Our Spirulina Pacifica® products compete with a variety of vitamins, dietary supplements, other algal products and similar nutritional products available to consumers. The nutritional products category is highly competitive and includes international, national, regional and local producers and distributors, many of whom have greater resources than Cyanotech and many of whom offer a greater variety of products.
 
Our direct competition in the spirulina market is currently from Dainippon Ink and Chemical Company’s Earthrise facility in California, Parry Nutraceuticals, a division of Murugappa Group of India and several farms in China.
 
In addition, there are numerous other smaller farms throughout the world. As one of the largest producers of spirulina, and the only producer of Hawaiian spirulina, our challenge is to increase our market share among customers who seek the high-quality products we produce while concurrently adjusting our product mix to meet our revenue and profitability targets.
 
Contract Extraction Services
 
As a result of capacity improvements that we made to our best-in-class, 1,000 bar, supercritical carbon dioxide extraction system, we began offering contract extraction services to third-party producers of astaxanthin biomass in fiscal 2019.
Major Customers
 
Two customers accounted for 33% and 24%, respectively, of our total net sales in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019. Two customers accounted for 32% and 15%, respectively, of our total net sales in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018. One customer accounted for 24% of our total net sales in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017.
Research and Development
 
Our expertise for many years has been in the development of efficient, stable and cost-effective production systems for microalgal products. We have learned production levels from our systems may not be sustainable across periods of days, weeks, or even months. Accordingly, we typically investigate each specific microalgae identified in the scientific literature for potentially marketable products and for solutions to production stability and efficiency challenges, and then strive to develop the technology to grow such microalgae on a commercial scale or to incorporate procedures or technology to improve production stability and efficiency. Successful microalgal product developments and technical solutions are highly uncertain and dependent on numerous factors, many beyond our control. Products and solutions or improvements that appear promising in early phases of development may be found to be ineffective, may be uneconomical because of manufacturing costs or other factors, may be precluded from commercialization due to the proprietary rights of other companies, or may fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals. Our research and development expenses were $0.9 million, $0.6 million and $0.6 million for the years ended March 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We plan to use the newly acquired facilities at the Cellana Demonstration Facility to improve and expand our research and development capabilities.
Patents, Trademarks and Licenses
 
We have been granted four United States patents: one on aspects of our production methods and three relating to usage of our BioAstin® products.
 
Our production method patent is directed to microalgae production technology, which expired in April 2016. Our patents relating to usage of our BioAstin® products are three utility patents on the use of astaxanthin, which will expire in December 2019, February 2020 and April 2020.
 
Although we view our proprietary rights as important, we currently believe that a loss of patent rights is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our present business as a whole. Instead, our commercial results mainly depend upon our trade secrets, know-how, other non-patent proprietary rights, customer relationships, our climate and our location. As a result, we feel that our competitors in the U.S. would not be able to implement competing technology covered by our patents now, after their expirations or otherwise, without our same combination of non-patented attributes.
 
We have registered trademarks in the U.S. and in some foreign markets, such as the European Union. Our operations are not dependent upon any single trademark, although some trademarks are identified with a number of our products and are important in the sale and marketing of such products.

Regulations
 
Several governmental agencies regulate various aspects of our business and our products in the United States, including the Food and Drug Administration, the Federal Trade Commission, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the State of Hawaii Department of Health, the Department of Agriculture, the Environmental Protection Agency, the United States Postal Service, state attorney general offices and various agencies of the states and localities in which our products are sold. We believe we are in compliance with all material government regulations which apply to our products and operations. However, we are not able to predict the nature of any future laws, regulations, interpretations or applications, nor can we predict what effect future changes would have on our business.
 
Our international customers are subject to similar governmental agency regulations in their various geographic regions. Compliance by our customers with such local regulations is beyond our control and we cannot predict their ability to maintain such compliance. However, we strive to assist our customers in meeting local regulations pertaining to the use and sale of our products whenever possible.
 
Environmental Matters
 
In 2002, we were issued under the Endangered Species Act (“ESA”) an Incidental Take Permit (“ITP”) by the United States Department of Interior Fish and Wildlife Service (“FWS”). The ESA defines “incidental take” as “incidental to, and not for the purpose of, the carrying out of an otherwise lawful activity.” This permit authorizes incidental take of the endangered Hawaiian stilt (Himantopus mexicanus knudseni) that is anticipated to occur as a result of ongoing operations and maintenance at our Kona facility. As a mandatory component for the issuance of such permit, we submitted and maintain a Habitat Conservation Plan (“HCP”) to ensure that the effects of the permitted action on listed species are adequately minimized and mitigated.
 
The HCP called for the creation of a nesting and breeding ground for the Hawaiian stilt to offset any take activity. We have complied with these requirements since 2002. The breeding program was so successful that the increase in the Hawaiian stilt population in the area became a potential hazard for the adjacent State airport facility. We disassembled the stilt habitat and are mitigating “take” by using standard non-lethal hazing devices to discourage nesting and breeding.
 
A requirement of the ITP is to provide insurance coverage for funding the project for the term of the ITP. Our insurance broker was unable to locate an underwriter who would provide such a bond. As permitted by law, the FWS waived this requirement recognizing that this HCP did not involve a significant capital expenditure. However, under Hawaii state law, no waiver provision is available. A new ITP was issued by the US Department of the Interior effective June 1, 2019; the permit expires June 1, 2035.
 
On March 14, 2016, the Company submitted an application for “Amendment and Extension to Cyanotech Corporation’s Habitat Conservation Plan and Incidental Take Permit” to FWS and DOFAW. The term of the requested extension is 19 years ending in 2035. The application was reviewed by the Federal and State Agencies and was conditionally granted at a meeting of the State of Hawaii Endangered Species Recovery Committee (ESRC) on June 13, 2016. The condition was that the Company reach an agreement with a specified property owner for offsite predator mitigation by June 2017. The Company was unable to reach an agreement with the specified property owner. At its June 13, 2017 meeting, the ESRC asked that detailed options for offsite mitigation be presented to them within six months. We are continuing to work with FWS and DOFAW to develop details of offsite predator mitigation to comply with ESRC requests and are considered to be in compliance as the negotiations proceed. While we do not anticipate any significant problems because we have satisfied all conditions of past HCP’s/ITP’s and our operation is considered by the State of Hawaii as “low effect”, there can be no guarantees that FWS and/or DOFAW will not impose additional requirements on us in connection with offsite predator mitigation which may impose additional costs on us.
 
Employees
 
As of March 31, 2019, we employed 109 people on a full-time basis. Of the total, 53 are involved in harvesting, production and quality, with the remainder in maintenance, shipping, sales, administration and support. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. Management believes that its relations with employees are good.
