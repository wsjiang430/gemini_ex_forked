Item 1. Business
General
We are a Maryland real estate investment trust, qualified as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, that owns a portfolio of equity investments in single-tenant commercial properties, with a focus on industrial properties. A majority of these properties are subject to net or similar leases, where the tenant bears all or substantially all of the costs, including cost increases, for real estate taxes, utilities, insurance and ordinary repairs. However, certain leases provide that the landlord is responsible for certain operating expenses.
As of December 31, 2018, we had equity ownership interests in approximately 135 consolidated real estate properties, located in 34 states and containing an aggregate of approximately 47.6 million square feet of space, approximately 95.1% of which was leased. In 2018, 2017 and 2016, no tenant/guarantor represented greater than 10% of our annual base rental revenue.
In addition to our shares of beneficial interest, par value $0.0001 per share, classified as common stock, which we refer to as common shares, as of December 31, 2018, we had one outstanding class of beneficial interest classified as preferred stock, or preferred shares, our 6.50% Series C Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, or our Series C Preferred Shares. Our common shares and Series C Preferred Shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, under the symbols “LXP” and “LXPPRC”, respectively.
We elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which we refer to as the Code, commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 1993. We intend to continue to qualify as a REIT. If we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal corporate income taxes on our net taxable income that is currently distributed to our common shareholders. We conduct certain taxable activities through our taxable REIT subsidiary, Lexington Realty Advisors, Inc.

History
Lexington is structured as an umbrella partnership REIT, or UPREIT, as a portion of its business is conducted through its operating partnership subsidiary, Lepercq Corporate Income Fund L.P., which we refer to as LCIF. Lexington is party to a funding agreement with LCIF under which Lexington may be required to fund distributions made on account of partner interests in LCIF, which we refer to as OP units. The UPREIT structure enables us to acquire properties through an operating partnership by issuing OP units to a seller of property, as a form of consideration in exchange for the property. However, our credit agreement requires that we own at least 95.5% of LCIF. The outstanding OP units not held by Lexington are generally redeemable for our common shares on a one OP unit for approximately 1.13 common shares basis, or, at our election in certain instances, cash. As of December 31, 2018, there were approximately 3.2 million OP units outstanding, other than OP units held by Lexington, which were convertible into approximately 3.6 million common shares, assuming redemptions are satisfied entirely with common shares. 
Investment and Strategy
General. Our current business strategy is focused on enhancing our cash flow stability, growing our portfolio with attractive leased industrial investments, reducing lease rollover risk and maintaining a strong and flexible balance sheet to allow us to act on opportunities as they arise. To that end, during 2018, we continued to be an active seller of non-core assets such as office properties, retail properties and vacant properties. In addition, we continued and will continue our efforts to increase the percentage of rents from industrial assets. Our disposition of 21 office assets to a newly-formed joint venture, NNN Office JV L.P. (“NNN JV”), and other disposition and acquisition activities during 2018, have resulted in an increase in our percentage of GAAP rent from industrial assets to 65.4% as of December 31, 2018 from 44.3% as of December 31, 2017.
Regardless of capital market and economic conditions, we intend to stay focused on (1) enhancing operating results, (2) improving portfolio quality through acquisitions of industrial assets and reducing risks associated with lease rollover, especially with respect to non-core assets, (3) mitigating risks relating to interest rates and real estate cycles and (4) implementing strategies where our management skills and real estate expertise can add value. 
Investments. When opportunities arise, we intend to continue to acquire single-tenant net-leased industrial assets that we believe will generate favorable returns. We focus on general purpose, well located, industrial assets that, we believe, will provide us with greater long-term overall risk-adjusted returns then we would realize from making new acquisitions of office or other properties. We believe industrial assets, as compared with office assets, provide for greater rental growth potential and less retenanting costs, We seek to grow our portfolio primarily by (1) engaging in, or providing funds to, or partnering with, developers who are engaged in, build-to-suit projects for single-tenant corporate users, (2) providing capital to corporations by buying properties and leasing them back to the sellers under net or similar leases and (3) acquiring properties already subject to net or similar leases, including through strategic transactions such as portfolio acquisitions and mergers with other real estate companies.
Our management has established a broad network of contacts to source investments, including brokers, developers and major corporate tenants. We believe that our geographical diversification, acquisition experience and balance sheet strength will allow us to continue to compete effectively for such investments. In addition, we seek to partner with developers on land parcels suitable for development of industrial assets.
Prior to effecting any investment, our underwriting includes analyzing the (1) property's design, construction quality, efficiency, functionality and location with respect to the immediate sub-market, city and region, (2) lease integrity with respect to term, rental rate increases, tenant credit, corporate guarantees and property maintenance provisions, (3) present and anticipated conditions in the local real estate market and (4) prospects for selling or re-leasing the property on favorable terms in the event of a vacancy. To the extent of information publicly available or made available to us, we also evaluate each potential tenant's financial strength, growth prospects and competitive position within its respective industry and each property's strategic location and function within a tenant's operations or distribution systems. We believe that our comprehensive underwriting process is critical to the assessment of long-term profitability of any investment by us.
Competition
There are numerous commercial developers, real estate companies, financial institutions, such as banks and insurance companies, and other investors with greater financial or other resources that compete with us in seeking properties for acquisition and tenants who will lease space in these properties. Furthermore, competition for industrial assets has increased in recent years. Our competitors include other REITs, pension funds, banks, private companies and individuals.

Internal Growth and Effectively Managing Assets
Tenant Relations and Lease Compliance. We endeavor to maintain close contact with the tenants in the properties in which we have an interest in order to understand their financial strength, operations and future real estate needs. We monitor the financial, property maintenance and other lease obligations of the tenants in properties in which we have an interest, through a variety of means, including periodic reviews of financial statements that we have access to and physical inspections of the properties. 
Extending Lease Maturities. Our property owner subsidiaries seek to extend tenant leases in advance of the lease expiration in order for us to maintain a balanced lease rollover schedule and high occupancy levels. 
Revenue Enhancing Property Expansions. Our property owner subsidiaries undertake expansions of properties based on lease requirements, tenant requirements or marketing opportunities. We believe that selective property expansions can provide attractive rates of return. 
Capital Recycling. Subject to regulatory and contractual requirements, we generally sell our interests in properties when we believe that the return realized from selling a property will exceed the expected return from continuing to hold such property and/or there is a better use of the capital to be received upon sale. We also focus our disposition efforts primarily on non-core assets such as office, vacant, multi-tenant, retail and short-term leased assets and assets that are the only asset we own in a geographic location.
Occasionally, we provide seller financing as a means of efficiently disposing of an asset. As a result, if a buyer defaults under the seller financing, we will once again be the owner of the underlying asset.
Conversion to Multi-Tenant. If one of our property owner subsidiaries is unable to renew a single-tenant lease or if it is unable to find a replacement single tenant, we either attempt to sell our interest in the property or the property owner subsidiary may seek to market the property for multi-tenant use. When appropriate, we seek to sell our interests in multi-tenant properties.
Property Management. From time to time, our property owner subsidiaries use property managers to manage certain properties. Our property management joint venture with an unaffiliated third party manages the majority of these properties. We believe this joint venture provides us with (1) better management of our assets, (2) better tenant relationships, (3) revenue-enhancing opportunities and (4) cost efficiencies. 
Financing Strategy
General. Since becoming a public company, our principal sources of financing have been the public and private equity and debt markets, including property-specific debt, revolving loans, corporate level term loans, corporate bonds, issuance of common and preferred equity, issuance of OP units and undistributed cash flows. 
Property-Specific Debt. Our property owner subsidiaries seek non-recourse secured debt on a limited basis to mitigate tenant credit risk and when credit tenant lease financing is available. Credit tenant lease financing allows us to significantly or fully leverage the rental stream from an investment at, what we believe are, attractive rates.
Corporate Level Borrowings. We also use corporate level borrowings, such as revolving loans, term loans, and debt offerings. We expect to continue to finance more of our operations with such corporate level borrowings as (1) non-recourse secured debt matures and (2) such corporate level borrowings are available on favorable terms.
Balance Sheet Management. In recent years, we have retired non-recourse mortgage debt with proceeds from recourse corporate level borrowings and sales. Our objective is to maintain a strong balance sheet to provide financial flexibility.
Common Share Issuances 
From time to time, we raise capital by issuing common shares through (1) at-the-market offering programs, (2) underwritten public offerings, (3) block trades and (4) our direct share purchase plan. The proceeds from our common share offerings are generally used for working capital, including to fund investments and to retire indebtedness. 
Share Repurchases 
We have made, and may continue to make, repurchases of our common and preferred shares in individual transactions when we believe it is advantageous to do so, including when the discount to our net asset value or the liquidation preference, as the case may be, is attractive. Our share repurchase program authorized in 2015 had approximately 10.7 million common shares available for repurchase as of December 31, 2018. We repurchased and retired 5.9 million common shares in 2018.

Advisory Contracts
We provide, and have provided, advisory services to various net-lease investors, including institutional investors and high net-worth individuals. 
Environmental Matters
Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations, an owner of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances at, on, in or under such property as well as certain other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances.
