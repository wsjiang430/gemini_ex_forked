 BUSINESS PLAN
 Our business plan is primarily focused on investing in income-producing real estate and when possible, monetizing the value of our land holdings through land sales to redeploy the proceeds, on a tax-deferred basis, into investments in income-producing real estate. Our investments in income-producing real estate are primarily through the acquisition of single-tenant and multi-tenant income properties, the self-development of multi-tenant income properties, or investing in commercial loans or similar financings secured by commercial real estate. Our investment in single-tenant and multi-tenant income properties, when possible, utilizes proceeds from other real estate transactions which qualify for income tax deferral through the like-kind exchange provisions under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code including land sales and the disposition of other income properties. We have held the significant majority of our portfolio of land holdings, which are used in our agricultural operations, for most of our over 100-year history, and, as a result, our book basis in the majority of these assets is very low. Because of the low basis in our land holdings, dispositions of our land typically would generate large taxable gains. Utilizing the like-kind exchange structure allows us to defer the related income taxes on these gains and reinvest nearly all of the net sales proceeds of the qualifying transaction into income-producing properties. Generally, in order to utilize the like-kind exchange structure, we are prohibited from engaging in activities that are typically indicative of the developer of the property, therefore we seek to complete land transactions with counterparties who will serve as the developer of the property. In limited circumstances, we have reacquired land that we have previously sold, either pursuant to the terms of the original sales agreement or through foreclosure. Land we have reacquired typically has a higher book basis. Our approach in investing in income-producing real estate is to use leverage, when appropriate or necessary, to fund our acquisitions and to help achieve our business plan objectives. Our use of leverage in acquiring income-producing real estate is intended to provide positive returns relative to our borrowing costs. We believe this enhances our Company’s income-generating real estate asset base while keeping us cash flow positive given that a significant portion of our market capitalization is represented by land assets which largely yield no income.

 Our investment strategy seeks to acquire income properties which will continue to broaden the credit base of our lease tenants, diversify our income property portfolio geographically, with an emphasis on major markets and growth markets in the U.S., and diversify the type of income-producing property, which in the future may include office, hospitality, industrial, or retail. In January 2018, we completed the self-development of two single-tenant net lease restaurant properties in Daytona Beach, Florida. Our investments in commercial loans or similar structured finance investments have been, and will continue to be, secured by commercial real estate, residential real estate developments, land, or a borrower’s pledge of its ownership interest in the entity that owns the real estate. We believe investment in each of these income-producing asset classes provides attractive opportunities for stable current cash flows and increased returns in the long run and the potential for capital appreciation.
 Proceeds from completed land sales provide us with investible capital. Our strategy is to utilize leverage, when appropriate and necessary, and proceeds from land sales, sales of income properties, the disposition or payoffs of our commercial loan investments, and certain transactions involving our Subsurface Interests, to acquire income properties. We may also acquire or originate commercial loan investments, invest in securities of real estate companies, or make other shorter-term investments. Our targeted investment classes may include the following:

· | Single-tenant retail and office, double or triple net leased, properties in major metropolitan areas and growth markets;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Multi-tenant office and retail properties in major metropolitan areas and growth markets, typically stabilized;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Purchase or origination of ground leases;
--+------------------------------------------


· | Self-developed properties on Company-owned land including select office, flex, industrial, and retail;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Joint venture development using Company-owned land;
--+----------------------------------------------------


· | Origination or purchase of commercial loan investments with loan terms of 1-10 years with strong risk-adjusted yields secured by property types to include hotel, office, retail, residential, land and industrial;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Select regional area investments using Company market knowledge and expertise to earn strong risk-adjusted yields; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Real estate-related investment securities, including commercial mortgage-backed securities, preferred or common stock, and corporate bonds.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Our investments in income-producing properties have single or multiple tenants typically subject to long-term leases, primarily in the form of triple or double net leases and ground leases. Triple-net leases generally require the tenant to pay property operating expenses such as real estate taxes, insurance, assessments and other governmental fees, utilities, repairs and maintenance, and capital expenditures. For multi-tenant properties, each tenant typically pays its proportionate share of the aforementioned operating expenses of the property, although for such properties we typically incur additional costs for property management services.

 INCOME PROPERTIES
 We have pursued a strategy of investing in income-producing properties, when possible, by utilizing the proceeds from real estate transactions, including land sales, transactions involving our Subsurface Interests, and the disposition of other income properties, qualifying for income tax deferral through like-kind exchange treatment for tax purposes. 
 Our strategy for investing in income-producing properties is focused on factors including, but not limited to, long-term real estate fundamentals and target markets, including major markets or those markets experiencing significant economic growth. We employ a methodology for evaluating targeted investments in income-producing properties which includes an evaluation of: (i) the attributes of the real estate (e.g. location, market demographics, comparable properties in the market, etc.); (ii) an evaluation of the existing tenant(s) (e.g. credit-worthiness, property level sales, tenant rent levels compared to the market, etc.); (iii) other market-specific conditions (e.g. tenant industry, job and population growth in the market, local economy, etc.); and (iv) considerations relating to the Company’s business and strategy (e.g. strategic fit of the asset type, property management needs, alignment with the Company’s 1031 like-kind exchange structure, etc.).
 During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company acquired eleven single-tenant income properties, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $106.6 million as described below:

Tenant Description | Tenant Type | Property Location | Date of Acquisition | Property Square-Feet | Property Acres | | Purchase Price | | Percentage Leased | Remaining Lease Term at Acquisition Date (in years)
Master Tenant for Commercial Building | Single-Tenant | Aspen, CO | 02/21/18 | 19,596 | 0.18 | | $ | 28,000,000 | (1) | 100% | | 20.0

Wawa (Ground Lease) | Single-Tenant | Jacksonville, FL | 10/10/18 | 6,267 | 2.16 | | | 6,666,667 | | 100% | | 19.3
Macaroni Grill | Single-Tenant | Arlington, TX | 12/20/18 | 8,123 | 1.70 | | | 2,290,000 | | 100% | | 15.0
 | Total / Weighted Average | | 281,700 | | $ | 106,636,566 | | | | | 14.4


 (1)In conjunction with the acquisition of the property in Aspen, Colorado, the master tenant contributed approximately $1.5 million of the purchase price, resulting in a net cash investment by the Company of approximately $26.5 million. The $1.5 million purchase price contribution is reflected as deferred revenue and will be accreted into income property rental revenue over the term of the lease.
     The 112,000 square foot multi-tenant retail center known as The Grove at Winter Park located in Winter Park, Florida (“The Grove”) was approximately 70% leased as of December 31, 2018 with fifteen different tenants including 24 Hour Fitness. Additionally, during 2018, Wawa Florida, LLC (“Wawa”) completed construction of a building on the out-parcel site adjacent to The Grove which was acquired by the Company in 2015. On December 13, 2018, rent commenced on the Company’s 20-year lease with Wawa and the property was added to the Company’s single-tenant income property portfolio.
 Four income properties were disposed of during the year ended December 31, 2018. On March 26, 2018, the Company sold its four self-developed, multi-tenant office properties located in Daytona Beach, Florida, for approximately $11.4 million (the “Self-Developed Properties Sale”). The sale included the 22,012 square-foot Concierge office building, the 30,720 square-foot Mason Commerce Center comprised of two office buildings, and the 15,360 square-foot Williamson Business Park office building. The gain on the sale totaled approximately $3.7 million, or approximately $0.49 per share, after tax. The Company utilized the proceeds to fund a portion of the previously acquired income property located near Portland, Oregon, leased to Wells Fargo, through a reverse 1031 like-kind exchange structure. As part of the transaction, the Company entered into a lease of its approximately 7,600 square-foot office space in Williamson Business Park for approximately 5 years at a market rental rate. 
 Our current portfolio of forty single-tenant income properties generates approximately $27.7 million of revenues from base lease payments on an annualized basis and had a weighted average remaining lease term of 9.6 years as of December 31, 2018. Our current portfolio of seven multi-tenant properties generates approximately $9.5 million of revenue from base lease payments on an annualized basis and had a weighted average remaining lease term of 4.4 years as of December 31, 2018.

 We expect to continue to focus on acquiring income-producing properties during fiscal year 2019, and in the near term thereafter, maintaining our use of the aforementioned tax deferral structure whenever possible.
 As part of our overall strategy for investing in income-producing properties, we self-developed five multi-tenant office properties, all of which are located in Daytona Beach, Florida. One of these properties was sold in 2016, while the other four were sold on March 26, 2018 in the Self-Developed Properties Sale.  
 We also self-developed two single-tenant net lease restaurant properties on a 6-acre beachfront parcel in Daytona Beach, Florida. The development was completed in January of 2018, at which point rent commenced under the leases; therefore, during the first quarter of 2018, these two properties were added to our income property portfolio. On a limited basis, we have acquired and may continue to selectively acquire other real estate, either vacant land or land with existing structures, that we would demolish and develop into additional income properties, possibly in the downtown and beachside areas of Daytona Beach, Florida. During 2018, we invested approximately $4.7 million to acquire approximately 6.0 acres in downtown Daytona Beach that is located in an opportunity zone. Specifically, our investments in the Daytona Beach area would target opportunistic acquisitions of select catalyst sites, which are typically distressed, with an objective of having short investment horizons. Should we pursue such acquisitions, we may seek to partner with developers to develop these sites rather than self-develop the properties. See Real Estate Operations for a discussion of such real estate acquired to date.
 Our focus on acquiring income-producing investments includes a continual review of our existing income property portfolio to identify opportunities to recycle our capital through the sale of income properties based on, among other possible factors, the current or expected performance of the property and favorable market conditions. During the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company commenced efforts to pursue the monetization of certain of its multi-tenant income properties with the Company intending to reinvest the potential proceeds from these dispositions into single-tenant net lease income properties during the year ending December 31, 2019 and possibly early 2020. Accordingly, four multi-tenant income properties were classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2018. Should we sell these multi-tenant properties or certain of our single-tenant income properties, it is likely that we would seek to do so utilizing the 1031 like-kind exchange structure to preserve the tax-deferred gain on the original transaction(s) that pertains to the replacement asset.

 While no single tenant represents more than 10% of our consolidated revenues as of December 31, 2018, we have tenants who represent a large amount of our net operating income and/or a large percentage of the square footage of our income property portfolio. These tenants include Wells Fargo, Hilton Grand Vacations, Aspen Core, LA Fitness, Lowe’s Corporation, and Fidelity.
 REAL ESTATE OPERATIONS
 As of December 31, 2018, the Company owned approximately 5,400 acres of undeveloped land in Daytona Beach, Florida, along six miles of the west and east sides of Interstate 95. Currently, a significant amount of this land is used for agricultural purposes. As of February 27, 2019, approximately 33% of this acreage, or nearly 1,800 acres, is under contract to be sold. Approximately 900 acres of our land holdings are located on the east side of Interstate 95 and are generally well-suited for commercial development. Approximately 4,500 acres of our land holdings are located on the west side of Interstate 95 and the majority of this land is generally well-suited for residential development. Included in the western land is approximately 1,100 acres, primarily an 850-acre parcel and three smaller parcels, which are located further west of Interstate 95 and a few miles north of Interstate 4 that is generally well suited for industrial purposes.
 Real estate operations revenue consisted of the following for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively:

 Tomoka Town Center. The Tomoka Town Center consists of approximately 235 acres of which approximately 180 acres are developable. During 2015 and 2016, land sales with a gross sales price totaling approximately $21.4 million within the Tomoka Town Center consisted of sales of approximately 99 acres to Tanger Outlets, Sam’s Club, and North American Development Group (“NADG”) (the “Tomoka Town Center Sales Agreements”). The Company performed certain infrastructure work, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015 through completion in the fourth quarter of 2016, which required the sales price on the Tomoka Town Center Sales Agreements to be recognized on the percentage-of-completion basis. As the infrastructure work was completed in the fourth quarter of 2016, all revenue related to the Tomoka Town Center Sales Agreements had been recognized as of December 31, 2016. The timing of the remaining reimbursements for the cost of the infrastructure work which totals approximately $1.8 million is more fully described in Note 11, “Other Assets.”
 During the second quarter of 2017, the Company completed the sale of approximately 19 acres to NADG (the “Third NADG Land Sale”). During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company completed the sale of approximately 27 acres to NADG (the “Fourth NADG Land Sale”). During the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company completed the sale of approximately 23 acres to NADG (the “Final NADG Land Sale”). The remaining developable acreage of approximately 12.5 acres is not currently under contract.
 2018 Land Sales. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company completed land transactions representing approximately 2,697 acres including: (i) the sale of a 70% interest in the Mitigation Bank (hereinafter defined) that holds approximately 2,492 acres for proceeds of $15.3 million and (ii) twelve land sales totaling approximately 205 acres for aggregate proceeds of approximately $43.7 million, as described below:

 (1)The Gross Sales Price of land sales during 2018 of approximately $43.7 million above includes the infrastructure reimbursement payments received in the amount of approximately $1.5 million for the Final NADG Land Sale. The Gross Sales Price also includes approximately $831,000 related to the Buc-ee’s land sale held in an escrow reserve related to the portion of the acreage sold for which the Company remains obligated to perform wetlands mitigation. The Company expects to recognize the remaining gain of approximately $831,000 upon completion of the mitigation work. See Note 17, “Deferred Revenue.
 Mitigation Bank. The mitigation bank transaction consists of the sale of a 70% interest in the entity that holds approximately 2,492 acres of land that has been permitted for the creation of a wetland mitigation bank (the “Venture” or the “Mitigation Bank”). The purchaser of the 70% interest in the Mitigation Bank is comprised of certain funds and accounts managed by an investment advisor subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc. (“BlackRock”). The Company retained an approximately 30% non-controlling interest in the Mitigation Bank. A third-party was retained by the Venture as the day-to-day manager of the Mitigation Bank property, responsible for the maintenance, generation, tracking, and other aspects of wetland mitigation credits. 
 The Mitigation Bank intends to engage in the creation and sale of both federal and state wetland mitigation credits. These credits will be created pursuant to the applicable permits that have been or will be issued to the Venture from the federal and state regulatory agencies that exercise jurisdiction over the awarding of such credits, but no assurances can be given as to the ultimate issuance, marketability or value of the credits. The Venture received the permit from the state regulatory agency on June 8, 2018 (the “State Permit”). The state regulatory agency may award up to 355 state credits under the State Permit. On August 6, 2018, the state regulatory agency awarded the initial 88.84 credits under the State Permit. Receipt of the remaining federal permit is anticipated to occur prior to the end of 2019.

 The gain on the sale of the 70% interest in the Mitigation Bank totaled approximately $18.4 million and is comprised of the gain on the sale of 70% interest for proceeds of $15.3 million as well as the gain on the retained 30% interest pursuant to FASB ASC Topic 610-20, Other Income – Gains and Losses from the Derecognition of Nonfinancial Assets. The gain is included in the Gain on Disposition of Assets in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2018, the approximately $6.8 million Investment in Joint Venture included on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets is comprised of the fair market value of the 30% retained interest in the Venture.
 The operating agreement of the Venture (the “Operating Agreement”) executed in conjunction with the mitigation bank transaction stipulates that the Company shall arrange for sales of the Venture’s mitigation credits to unrelated third parties totaling no less than $6 million of revenue to the Mitigation Bank, net of commissions, by the end of 2020, utilizing a maximum of 60 mitigation credits (the “Minimum Sales Requirement”). The Operating Agreement stipulates that if the Minimum Sales Requirement is not achieved, then BlackRock has the right, but is not required, to cause the Company to purchase the number of mitigation credits necessary to reach the Minimum Sales Requirement (the “Minimum Sales Guarantee”). The Company estimates the fair value of the Minimum Sales Guarantee to be approximately $100,000 which was recorded as a reduction in the gain on the transaction and is included in Accrued and Other Liabilities in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2018. 
 Additionally, the Operating Agreement provides BlackRock the right to cause the Company to purchase a maximum of 8.536 mitigation credits per quarter (the “Commitment Amount”) from the Mitigation Bank at a price equal to 60% of the then fair market value for mitigation credits (the “Put Right”). The Put Right is applicable even if the Mitigation Bank has not yet been awarded a sufficient number of mitigation credits by the applicable federal and state regulatory agencies. Further, in any quarter that BlackRock does not exercise its Put Right, the unexercised Commitment Amount for the applicable quarter may be rolled over to future calendar quarters. However, the Operating Agreement also stipulates that any amount of third-party sales of mitigation credits will reduce the Put Rights outstanding on a one-for-one basis, if the sales price of the third-party sales equals or exceeds the prices stipulated by the Put Right. Further, any sales of mitigation credits to third parties at the requisite minimum prices in a quarter that exceeds the quarterly amount of the Put Right will reduce the Put Rights in future calendar quarters on a one-for-one basis. The maximum potential of future payments for the Company pursuant to the Put Right is approximately $27 million. The Company estimates the fair value of the Put Right to be approximately $200,000, which was recorded as a reduction in the gain on the transaction and is included in Accrued and Other Liabilities in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2018.
 2017 Land Sales. During the year ended December 31, 2017, a total of approximately 1,701 acres were sold for approximately $47.0 million as described below:

 (1)Land sales transaction which requires the Company to incur the cost to provide the requisite mitigation credits necessary for obtaining the applicable regulatory permits for the buyer, with such costs representing either our basis in the credits that we own, or potentially up to 5% - 10% of the contract amount noted.
 (2)The Company expects that the buyer will complete the transaction in two separate closings.
 As noted above, these agreements contemplate closing dates ranging from early 2019 through fiscal year 2020, and although some of the transactions will likely close in 2019, some of the buyers may not be contractually obligated to close until after 2019. Each of the transactions are in varying stages of due diligence by the various buyers including, in some instances, having made submissions to the planning and development departments of the City, and other permitting activities with other applicable governmental authorities including wetlands permits from the St. John’s River Water Management District and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, conducting traffic analyses and potential road impact requirements with the Florida Department of Transportation and negotiating other matters with Volusia County. In addition to other customary closing conditions, the majority of these transactions are conditioned upon the receipt of approvals or permits from those various governmental authorities, as well as other matters that are beyond our control. If such approvals are not obtained or costs to meet governmental requirements or obligations are too high, the prospective buyers may have the ability to terminate their respective agreements prior to closing. As a result, there can be no assurances regarding the likelihood or timing of any one of these potential land transactions being completed or the final terms thereof, including the sales price.
 Historical revenues and income from our sales of land are not indicative of future results because of the unique nature of land transactions and other factors including, but not limited to, variations in the cost basis of the owned land. A significant portion of the Company’s revenue and income in any given year may be generated through relatively few land transactions. The timing for these land transactions, from the time of preliminary discussions through contract negotiations, due diligence periods, and the closing, can last from several months to several years. Although we believe there have been 

 
  10

 
recent indications of improvement in the overall economy and credit markets, we expect the overall real estate market, particularly home building, to remain inconsistent in the near term, and as a result we believe our ability to enter into land transactions will remain challenging.
 Land Impairments. As more fully described in Note 8, "Impairment of Long-Lived Assets," during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company did not recognize any impairments on its undeveloped land holdings. During the year ended December 31, 2016, impairment charges totaled approximately $1.0 million on the Company’s undeveloped land.  
 Beachfront Parcel. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company acquired, through a real estate venture with an unaffiliated third-party institutional investor, an interest in approximately six acres of vacant beachfront property located in Daytona Beach, Florida (the “Beachfront Parcel”). The Beachfront Parcel was acquired for approximately $11.3 million, of which the Company contributed approximately $5.7 million. As of December 31, 2015, the real estate venture was fully consolidated as the Company determined that it was the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity (“VIE”). 
 On November 17, 2016, the Company acquired the unaffiliated third party’s 50% interest for approximately $4.8 million, a discount of approximately $879,000. The discount was recorded through equity on the consolidated balance sheet during the year ended December 31, 2016. The Company evaluated its interest in the Beachfront Parcel for impairment and determined that no impairment was necessary as of December 31, 2016. As the Company owned the entire real estate venture as of December 31, 2018 or 2017, there is no longer a consolidated VIE. 
 During the first quarter of 2018, the Company completed the construction of two single-tenant restaurants located on the Beachfront Parcel with a cost basis of approximately $11.7 million, which was included in Land and Development Costs on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2017. The total cost of construction was approximately $6.8 million. Upon completion of the construction and commencement of the tenant leases (described herein), the total basis of approximately $18.5 million was transferred to Income Properties, Land, Buildings, and Improvements from Land and Development Costs and Construction in Process on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The Company’s 15-year lease agreement with the operator of LandShark Bar & Grill, for an approximately 6,264 square foot restaurant property, includes annual rent based on a percentage of the tenant’s net operating income (“NOI”) until the Company has received its investment basis in the property; thereafter, the Company will receive a lower percentage of the tenant’s NOI during the remaining lease term. The Company’s 15-year lease agreement with the operator of Cocina 214 Restaurant & Bar, for the second restaurant property includes annual rent equal to the greater of $360,000 per year or a certain percentage of gross sales, and also provides for additional percentage rent upon the achievement of certain gross sales thresholds.
 Daytona Beach Development. We may selectively acquire other real estate in Daytona Beach, Florida. We may target either vacant land or land with existing structures that we would demolish and develop into additional income properties. During 2018, the Company acquired a 5-acre parcel of land with existing structures in downtown Daytona Beach, for a purchase price of approximately $2.0 million. As of December 31, 2018, the Company has also acquired other contiguous parcels totaling approximately 1-acre for approximately $1.8 million. Combined, these parcels represent the substantial portion of an entire city block in downtown Daytona Beach adjacent to International Speedway Boulevard, a major thoroughfare in Daytona Beach. The combined 6 acres is located in an opportunity zone and a community redevelopment area. In addition, this property is proximate to the future headquarters of Brown & Brown Inc., the sixth largest insurance broker in the U.S. and a publicly listed company that will be occupied by at least 600 of their employees. We have engaged a national real estate brokerage firm to assist us in identifying a developer or investor to acquire a portion or all of the property or to contribute into a potential joint venture to redevelop the property. We are pursuing entitlements for the potential redevelopment of these parcels, along with certain other adjacent land parcels, some of which we have under contract for purchase.  Our intent for investments in the Daytona Beach area is to target opportunistic acquisitions of select catalyst sites, which are typically distressed, with the objective of short-to-medium investment horizons. We may enter into joint ventures or other partnerships to develop land we have acquired or may acquire in the future in lieu of self-developing.
 Other Real Estate Assets. The Company owns impact fees with a cost basis of approximately $2,000 and mitigation credits with a cost basis of approximately $460,000, for a combined total of approximately $462,000 as of December 31, 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company transferred mitigation credits with a basis of approximately $124,000 to the land acquired by Buc-ee’s. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company sold mitigation credits 

 
  11

 
for approximately $1.0 million, for a gain of approximately $882,000, or $0.12 per share, after tax. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company sold mitigation credits for approximately $1.6 million, for a gain of approximately $1.3 million, or $0.15 per share, after tax. Additionally, the Company recorded the transfer of mitigation credits with a cost basis of approximately $298,000 as a charge to direct cost of revenues of real estate operations during the year ended December 31, 2017, as more fully described in Note 20, “Commitments and Contingencies.” During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company received cash payments of approximately $338,000 and $519,000, respectively, for impact fees with a cost basis that was generally of equal value. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2018, impact fees with a cost basis of approximately $72,000 were transferred to the beachfront restaurant leased to LandShark Bar & Grill.
 Subsurface Interests. As of December 31, 2018, the Company owns full or fractional subsurface oil, gas, and mineral interests underlying approximately 455,000 “surface” acres of land owned by others in 20 counties in Florida (the “Subsurface Interests”). The Company leases certain of the Subsurface Interests to mineral exploration firms for exploration. Our subsurface operations consist of revenue from the leasing of exploration rights and in some instances, additional revenues from royalties applicable to production from the leased acreage.
 There were no subsurface sales during the year ended December 31, 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company sold approximately 38,750 acres of subsurface interests in Osceola County, Florida for approximately $2.1 million (the "Osceola Subsurface Sale"). The gain from the Osceola Subsurface Sale totaled approximately $2.08 million, or $0.23 per share, after tax.
 During 2011, an eight-year oil exploration lease was executed covering a portion of our Subsurface Interests. On September 20, 2017, the Company amended the oil exploration lease to, among other things, extend the expiration of the original term for five additional years to the new expiration date of September 22, 2024. The lease is effectively thirteen one-year terms as the lessee has the option to terminate the lease at the end of each lease year. The lessee has exercised renewal options through lease year eight ending September 22, 2019. The terms of the lease state that the Company will receive royalty payments if production occurs, and may receive additional annual rental payments if the lease is continued in years nine through thirteen. The lease calls for annual lease payments which are recognized as revenue ratably over the respective twelve-month lease periods. Pursuant to the amendment for the Year 8 renewal, the annual lease payment is to be paid in installments. In addition, non-refundable drilling penalty payments are made as required by the drilling requirements in the lease, which are recognized as revenue when earned, i.e. when the amount is agreed upon. The lessor, an affiliate of Kerogen Exploration LLC, has submitted a drilling permit application in Hendry County to allow for drilling to commence.
 Lease payments on the respective acreages and drilling penalties received through lease year eight are as follows:

 | Acreage | | | | | | 
Lease Year | (Approximate) | Florida County | Lease Payment (1) | | Drilling Penalty (1) | 
Lease Year 1 - 9/23/2011 - 9/22/2012 | 136,000 | Lee and Hendry | $ | 913,657 | | $ | — 
Lease Year 2 - 9/23/2012 - 9/22/2013 | 136,000 | Lee and Hendry | | 922,114 | | | — 
Lease Year 3 - 9/23/2013 - 9/22/2014 | 82,000 | Hendry | | 3,293,000 | | | 1,000,000
Lease Year 4 - 9/23/2014 - 9/22/2015 | 42,000 | Hendry | | 1,866,146 | | | 600,000 
Lease Year 5 - 9/23/2015 - 9/22/2016 | 25,000 | Hendry | | 1,218,838 | | | 175,000 
Lease Year 6 - 9/23/2016 - 9/22/2017 | 15,000 | Hendry | | 806,683 | | | 150,000 
Lease Year 7 - 9/23/2017 - 9/22/2018 | 15,000 | Hendry | | 806,683 | | | 50,000 
Lease Year 8 - 9/23/2018 - 9/22/2019 | 15,000 | Hendry | | 806,684 | | | 150,000 
Total Payments | | | $ | 10,633,805 | | $ | 2,125,000


(1) | Generally, cash payment for the Lease Payment and Drilling Penalty is received on or before the first day of the lease year. The Drilling Penalty, which is due within thirty days from the end of the prior lease year, is recorded as revenue when earned, i.e. when the amount is agreed upon, while the Lease Payment is recognized on a straight-line basis over the respective lease term. Pursuant to the amendment for the Year 7 renewal, the Lease Payment and Drilling Penalty were both received on October 11, 2017. Pursuant to the amendment for the Year 8 renewal, the Lease Payment and Drilling Penalty are to be received in monthly installments. As of December 31, 2018, $855,000 of the total approximately $957,000 has been received pursuant to the payment schedule. See separate disclosure of revenue recognized per period below.
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Lease income generated by the annual lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the guaranteed lease term. For the years December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, lease income of approximately $807,000,  $807,000, and $1.1 million was recognized, respectively. There can be no assurance that the oil exploration lease will be extended beyond the expiration of the current term of September 22, 2019 or, if extended, the terms or conditions of such extension.

 During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, the Company also received oil royalties from operating oil wells on 800 acres under a separate lease with a separate operator. Production volume from these oil wells was 39,186 barrels in 2018, 60,287 barrels in 2017, and 50,441 barrels in 2016, resulting in revenues received from oil royalties of approximately $72,000, $86,000, and $50,000, respectively.
 The Company is not prohibited from selling any or all of its Subsurface Interests. The Company may release surface entry rights or other rights upon request of a surface owner for a negotiated release fee typically based on a percentage of the surface value. Should the Company complete a transaction to sell all or a portion of its Subsurface Interests or complete a release transaction, the Company may utilize the like-kind exchange structure in acquiring one or more replacement investments including income-producing properties. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company completed a transaction releasing our surface entry rights on approximately 600 acres in exchange for approximately $185,000 in cash and fee title to approximately 40 additional acres in Hendry County, valued at approximately $320,000. Including the non-cash value received, the gain from the transaction totaled approximately $435,000, or $0.06 per share, after tax. Additional cash payments for the release of surface entry rights during 2018 totaled approximately $73,000. Cash payments for the release of surface entry rights totaled approximately $493,000 during the year ended December 31, 2016, while there were no releases of surface entry rights during the year ended December 31, 2017.
 In addition, the Company generated revenue of approximately $250,000 during the year ended December 31, 2016 from fill dirt excavation agreements, with no such revenue generated during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.
 GOLF OPERATIONS
 The Company owns the LPGA International Golf Club (the “Club”), a semi-private golf club consisting of two 18-hole championship golf courses, one designed by Rees Jones and the other designed by Arthur Hills, with a three-hole practice facility also designed by Rees Jones, a clubhouse facility, food and beverage operations, and a fitness facility. The Club is managed by a third party and is located within the LPGA International mixed-use residential community on the west side of Interstate 95 in the City. 
 Prior to January 2017, the Company leased from the City a large portion of the land underlying the Club (the “Golf Course Lease”). In July 2012, the Company entered into an agreement with the City to, among other things, amend the lease payments under the Golf Course Lease (the “Lease Amendment”). Under the Lease Amendment, the base rent payment, which was scheduled to increase from $250,000 to $500,000 as of September 1, 2012, remained at $250,000 for the remainder of the lease term and any extensions would have been subject to an annual rate increase of 1.75% beginning September 1, 2013. On January 24, 2017, the Company acquired the approximately 690 acres of land and improvements covered by the Golf Course Lease, for approximately $1.5 million (the “Golf Course Land Purchase”). In conjunction with the Golf Course Land Purchase, the Golf Course Lease was terminated. Therefore, during the first quarter of 2017, the Company eliminated the remaining accrued liability of approximately $2.2 million, resulting in the recognition of approximately $0.40 per share in non-cash earnings, or $0.24 per share after tax, which comprises the Golf Course Lease termination in the consolidated statements of operations. The $2.2 million consisted of approximately $1.7 million which reflects the acceleration of the remaining amount of accrued rent that was no longer owed to the City as a result of the Lease Amendment, which prior to the Golf Course Land Purchase was being recognized into income over the remaining lease term which was originally to expire in 2022. The remaining approximately $500,000 reflects the amount of rent accrued pursuant to the Golf Course Lease, as amended, which will no longer be owed to the City due to the lease termination on January 24, 2017. 
 As a part of the Golf Course Land Purchase, the Company donated to the City three land parcels totaling approximately 14.3 acres located on the west side of Interstate 95 that are adjacent to the City’s Municipal Stadium. The Company had a cost basis of effectively $0 in the donated land and paid approximately $100,000 to satisfy the community development district bonds associated with the acreage. Other terms of the Golf Course Land Purchase include the following:

· | The Company is obligated to pay the City additional consideration in the form of an annual surcharge of $1 per golf round played at the Club each year (the “Per-Round Surcharge”) with an annual minimum Per-Round Surcharge of $70,000 and a maximum aggregate amount of the Per-Round Surcharges paid equal to $700,000. The maximum amount of $700,000 represents contingent consideration and was recorded as an increase in Golf Buildings, Improvements, and Equipment and Accrued and Other Liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The first annual payment was made in January 2018, leaving a remaining commitment of approximately $630,000 as of December 31, 2018;

· | If the Company sells the Club within six years of the closing of the Golf Course Land Purchase, the Company will be obligated to pay the City an amount equal to 10% of the difference between the sales price, less closing costs and any other costs required to be incurred in connection with the sale, and $4.0 million.

  During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company wrote down the value of the golf assets comprising the Club, which resulted in a corresponding impairment charge of approximately $1.1 million, or $0.15 per share, after tax. The write-down of the golf operation assets to approximately $3.1 million and the related $1.1 million impairment charge were the result of the Company’s assessment of certain triggering events, including activities related to a review of strategic alternatives for the golf operations, occurring during the third quarter of 2018, which required an assessment of the carrying value of the golf assets comprising the Club. In the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company commenced efforts to pursue the monetization of the golf operations and assets comprising the Club. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the golf assets comprising the Club have been classified as held for sale in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the results of golf operations have been classified as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the loss from golf operations, excluding capital expenditures, totaled approximately $906,000. Should the Company complete the sale of the golf operations, it could favorably impact cash flows. 
 COMMERCIAL LOAN INVESTMENTS
 Our investments in commercial loans or similar structured finance investments, such as mezzanine loans or other subordinated debt, have been and are expected to continue to be secured by commercial or residential real estate or the borrower’s pledge of its ownership interest in the entity that owns the real estate. The first mortgage loans we invest in or originate are generally for commercial real estate located in the United States and its territories, and are current or performing with either a fixed or floating rate. Some of these loans may be syndicated in either a pari-passu or senior/subordinated structure. Commercial first mortgage loans generally provide for a higher recovery rate due to their senior position in the underlying collateral. Commercial mezzanine loans are typically secured by a pledge of the borrower’s equity ownership in the underlying commercial real estate. Unlike a mortgage, a mezzanine loan is not secured by a lien on the property. An investor’s rights in a mezzanine loan are usually governed by an intercreditor agreement that provides holders with the rights to cure defaults and exercise control on certain decisions of any senior debt secured by the same commercial property.
 The Company purchased the variable rate B-Note (the “B-Note”), secured by real estate located in Sarasota, Florida in May 2014. On June 13, 2018, the B-Note held by the Company matured and was repaid by the borrower. The proceeds of approximately $9.0 million were used to pay down the Company’s Credit Facility. 
 On August 10, 2018, the $3.0 million fixed rate first mortgage loan held by the Company and secured by real estate located in Daytona Beach Shores, Florida, matured and was repaid by the borrower. 
 As of December 31, 2018, the Company had no commercial loan investments.
 COMPETITION
 The real estate business generally is highly competitive. Our business plan is focused on investing in commercial real estate that produces income primarily through the leasing of assets to tenants. To identify investment opportunities in income-producing real estate assets and to achieve our investment objectives, we compete with numerous companies and organizations, both public as well as private, of varying sizes, ranging from organizations with local operations to organizations with national scale and reach, and in some cases, we compete with individual real estate investors. In all the markets in which we compete to acquire income properties, price is the principal method of competition, with transaction structure and certainty of execution also being significant considerations for potential sellers. As of December 31, 2018, our total income property portfolio, including our single-tenant and multi-tenant properties, consists of forty-seven income properties located in the following states: (i) Arizona, (ii) California, (iii) Colorado, (iv) Florida, (v) Georgia, (vi) Maryland, (vii) Massachusetts, (viii) Nevada, (ix) New Mexico, (x) North Carolina, (xi) Oregon, (xii) Texas, (xiii) Virginia and (xiv) Washington. Should we need to re-lease our single-tenant income properties or space(s) in our multi-

tenant properties, we would compete with many other property owners in the local market based on, among other elements, price, location of our property, potential tenant improvements, and lease term.
 Our real estate operations are comprised primarily of (i) our land holdings, which are largely used for agricultural purposes today and are substantially located in Daytona Beach, Florida; and (ii) the Subsurface Interests. The parties typically interested in acquiring our land holdings are both residential and commercial developers as well as commercial businesses. These interested parties typically base their decision to acquire land on, among other things, price, location, land use or optionality of land use, ability to obtain zoning, entitlements, and permitting, and may also consider other development activities in the surrounding area.
 Our business plan may also focus on investing in commercial real estate through the acquisition or origination of mortgage financings secured by commercial real estate. Competition for investing in commercial mortgage loans and similar financial instruments can include financial institutions such as banks, life insurance companies, institutional investors such as pension funds and other lenders including mortgage REITs, REITs, and high wealth investors. The organizations that we compete with are of varying sizes, ranging from organizations with local operations to organizations with national scale and reach. Competition from these interested parties is based on, amongst other things, pricing or rate, financing structure, and other elements of the typical terms and conditions of a real estate financing.
 Our golf operations consist of the Club. The operation of the Club also includes private event sales for golf events and events held at the clubhouse. The primary competition for our golf operations comes from other private and public golf operations in the local market. Competition for our golf operation is largely based on price, service level, and product quality. We attempt to differentiate our golf operations product on the basis of the condition and quality of the courses and practice facilities, our private event capacity and capabilities, service level, the quality and experience of the food and beverage amenities and other amenities.
