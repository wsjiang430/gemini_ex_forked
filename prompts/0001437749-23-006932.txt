ITEM 1. BUSINESS. 
 
See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for a discussion of our business.
 
Regulation and Laws 
 
The coal mining and electricity generation industries are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local authorities on matters such as:
 

● | employee health and safety; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | mine permits and other licensing requirements; 
● | air quality standards; 
● | water quality standards; 
● | storage of petroleum products and substances that are regarded as hazardous under applicable laws or that, if spilled, could reach waterways or wetlands; 
● | plant and wildlife protection that could limit or prohibit mining or exploration; 
● | restricting the types, quantities and concentration of materials that can be released into the environment in the performance of mining or exploration and production activities;
● | discharge of materials; 
● | storage and handling of explosives; 
● | wetlands protection; 
● | surface subsidence from underground mining; and 
● | the effects, if any, that mining has on groundwater quality and availability. 

 
Failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal sanctions, including monetary penalties, the imposition of strict, joint and several liability, investigatory and remedial obligations, and the issuance of injunctions limiting or prohibiting some or all of the operations on our properties. The regulatory burden on fossil fuel industries increases the cost of doing business and consequently affects profitability. The trend in environmental regulation has been to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment, and thus, any changes in environmental laws and regulations or re-interpretation of enforcement policies that result in more stringent and costly obligations could increase our costs and adversely affect our performance.  In addition, the utility industry is subject to extensive regulation regarding the environmental impact of its power generation activities, which has adversely affected demand for coal. It is possible that new legislation or regulations may be adopted, or that existing laws or regulations may be interpreted differently or more stringently enforced, any of which could have a significant impact on our mining operations or our customers’ ability to use coal. For more information, please see risk factors described in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” below.
 
We are committed to conducting mining operations in compliance with applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations. However, because of the extensive and detailed nature of these regulatory requirements, particularly the regulatory system of the Mine Safety and Health Administration (“MSHA”) where citations can be issued without regard to fault, and many of the standards include subjective elements, it is not reasonable to expect any coal mining company to be free of citations. When we receive a citation, we attempt to remediate any identified condition immediately. While we have not quantified all of the costs of compliance with applicable federal and state laws and associated regulations, those costs have been and are expected to continue to be significant. Compliance with these laws and regulations has substantially increased the cost of coal mining for domestic coal producers.
 
Expenditures for environmental matters have not been material in recent years. We have accrued for the present value of the estimated cost of asset retirement obligations and mine closings, including the cost of treating mine water discharge, when necessary. The accruals for asset retirement obligations and mine closing costs are based upon permit requirements and the estimated costs and timing of asset retirement obligations and mine closing procedures. Although management believes it has made adequate provisions for all expected reclamation and other costs associated with mine closures, future operating results would be adversely affected if these accruals were insufficient.

Mining Permits and Approvals 
 
Numerous governmental permits or approvals are required for mining operations. Applications for permits require extensive engineering and data analysis and presentation and must address a variety of environmental, health and safety matters associated with a proposed mining operation. These matters include the manner and sequencing of coal extraction, the storage, use and disposal of waste and other substances and impacts on the environment, the construction of water containment areas, and reclamation of the area after coal extraction. Meeting all requirements imposed by any of these authorities may be costly and may delay or prevent commencement or continuation of mining operations.
 The permitting process for certain mining operations can extend over several years and can be subject to administrative and judicial challenge, including by the public. Some required mining permits are becoming increasingly difficult to obtain in a timely manner, or at all. We cannot assure you that we will not experience difficulty or delays in obtaining mining permits in the future or that a current permit will not be revoked.
 
We are required to post bonds to secure performance under our permits. Under some circumstances, substantial fines and penalties, including revocation of mining permits, may be imposed under the laws and regulations described above. Monetary sanctions and, in severe circumstances, criminal sanctions may be imposed for failure to comply with these laws and regulations. Regulations also provide that a mining permit can be refused or revoked if the permit applicant or permittee owns or controls, directly or indirectly through other entities, mining operations that have outstanding environmental violations. Although like other coal companies, we have been cited for violations in the ordinary course of our business, we have never had a permit suspended or revoked because of any violation, and the penalties assessed for these violations have not been material.
 
Mine Health and Safety Laws 
 
The Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (“FMSHA”) and regulations adopted pursuant thereto, imposes extensive and detailed safety and health standards on numerous aspects of mining operations, including training of mine personnel, mining procedures, blasting, the equipment used in mining operations, and numerous other matters. MSHA monitors and rigorously enforces compliance with these federal laws and regulations. In addition, the states where we operate have state programs for mine safety and health regulation and enforcement. Federal and state safety and health regulations affecting the coal mining industry are perhaps the most comprehensive and rigorous system in the United States for the protection of employee safety and have a significant effect on our operating costs. Although many of the requirements primarily impact underground mining, our competitors in all of the areas in which we operate are subject to the same laws and regulations.
 
FMSHA has been construed as authorizing MSHA to issue citations and orders pursuant to the legal doctrine of strict liability or liability without fault, and FMSHA requires the imposition of a civil penalty for each cited violation. Negligence and gravity assessments, along with other factors can result in the issuance of various types of orders, including orders requiring withdrawal from the mine or the affected area, and some orders can also result in the imposition of civil penalties. FMSHA also contains criminal liability provisions. For example, criminal liability may be imposed upon corporate operators who knowingly and willfully authorize, order or carry out violations of the FMSHA or its mandatory health and safety standards.
 
The Federal Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006 (“MINER Act”) significantly amended the FMSHA, imposing more extensive and stringent compliance standards, increasing criminal penalties and establishing a maximum civil penalty for non-compliance, and expanding the scope of federal oversight, inspection, and enforcement activities. Following the passage of the MINER Act, MSHA has issued new or more stringent rules and policies on a variety of topics, including:
 

● | sealing off abandoned areas of underground coal mines; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | mine safety equipment, training, and emergency reporting requirements; 
● | substantially increased civil penalties for regulatory violations; 
● | training and availability of mine rescue teams; 
● | underground “refuge alternatives” capable of sustaining trapped miners in the event of an emergency; 
● | flame-resistant conveyor belts, fire prevention and detection, and use of air from the belt entry; and
● | post-accident two-way communications and electronic tracking systems. 

 
MSHA continues to interpret and implement various provisions of the MINER Act, along with introducing new proposed regulations and standards.
 
    5 

  

In 2014, MSHA began implementation of a finalized new regulation titled “Lowering Miner’s Exposure to Respirable Coal Mine Dust, Including Continuous Personal Dust Monitors.”  The final rule implemented a reduction in the allowable respirable coal mine dust exposure limits, requires the use of sampling data taken from a single sample rather than an average of samples, and increases oversight by MSHA regarding coal mine dust and ventilation issues at each mine, including the approval process for ventilation plans at each mine, all of which increase mining costs. The second phase of the rule began in February 2016 and requires additional sampling for designated and other occupations using the new continuous personal dust monitor technology, which provides real-time dust exposure information to the miner. Phase three of the rule began in August 2016 and resulted in lowering the current respirable dust level of 2.0 milligrams per cubic meter to 1.5 milligrams per cubic meter of air. Compliance with these rules can result in increased costs on our operations, including, but not limited to, the purchasing of new equipment and the hiring of additional personnel to assist with monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping obligations. MSHA published a request for information regarding engineering controls and best practices to lower miners’ exposure to respirable coal mine dust, and the comment period closed in July 2022. It is uncertain whether MSHA will present additional proposed rules, or revisions to the final rule, following the closing of the comment period.
 
MSHA has also published, and may continue to publish, various proposed rules or requests for information, which may result in additional rulemakings. For example, in June 2016, MSHA published a request for information on Exposure of Underground Miners to Diesel Exhaust. Following a comment period that closed in November 2016, MSHA received requests for MSHA and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health to hold a Diesel Exhaust Partnership to address the issues covered by MSHA's request for information. The comment period for the request for information closed in September 2020.
 
In August 2019, MSHA published a request for information regarding exposure to respirable crystalline silica, most commonly found in the mining environment through quartz. The request solicited information regarding best practices to protect miners' health from exposure to quartz, including examination of a new reduced permissible exposure limit, potential new or developing protective technologies, and/or technical and educational assistance. The comment period for the request for information closed in October 2019.
 
 In November 2020, MSHA published a proposed rule to revise Testing, Evaluation, and Approval of Electric Motor-Driven Mine Equipment and Accessories within underground mining environments. The comment period for the proposed rule closed in December 2020. 
 
In September 2021, MSHA published a proposed rule requiring that mine operators employing six or more miners develop and implement a written safety program for mobile and powered haulage equipment at surface mines and surface areas of underground mines (Safety Program for Surface Mobile Equipment). The comment period for the proposed rule closed in November 2021. However, MHSA reopened the rulemaking record for additional public comments. A virtual hearing was held in January 2022, and the comment period closed in February 2022.
 
It is uncertain whether MSHA will present a final rule addressing any of the above issues or any of the other various proposed rules or requests for information or whether any such rule would have material impacts on our operations or our costs of operation.
 
Subsequent to the passage of the MINER Act, Illinois, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia have enacted legislation addressing issues such as mine safety and accident reporting, increased civil and criminal penalties, and increased inspections and oversight. Additionally, state administrative agencies can promulgate administrative rules and regulations affecting our operations. Other states may pass similar legislation or administrative regulations in the future.
 
Some of the costs of complying with existing regulations and implementing new safety and health regulations may be passed on to our customers. Although we have not quantified the full impact, implementing and complying with these new federal and state safety laws and regulations have had, and are expected to continue to have, an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position.
 
Black Lung Benefits Act 
 
The Black Lung Benefits Act of 1977 and the Black Lung Benefits Reform Act of 1977, as amended in 1981 (“BLBA”), requires businesses that conduct current mining operations to make payments of black lung benefits to current and former coal miners with black lung disease, to some survivors of a miner who dies from this disease, and to a trust fund for the payment of benefits and medical expenses where no responsible coal mine operator has been identified for claims.  As of January 1, 2022, the trust fund was funded by an excise tax on production of up to $0.50 per ton for underground-mined coal and up to $0.25 per ton for surface-mined coal, but not to exceed 2% of the applicable sales price.  The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 raised the excise tax, effective October 1, 2022, up to $1.10 per ton of coal from underground mines and up to $0.55 per ton of coal from surface mines, neither amount to exceed 4.4% of the gross sales price.

Workers' Compensation and Black Lung
 
We provide income replacement and medical treatment for work-related traumatic injury claims as required by applicable state laws. Workers’ compensation laws also compensate survivors of workers who suffer employment-related deaths. We generally self-insure this potential expense using our actuary estimates of the cost of present and future claims. In addition, coal mining companies are subject to federal legislation and various state statutes for the payment of medical and disability benefits to eligible recipients related to coal workers' pneumoconiosis or black lung. We also provide for these claims through self-insurance programs. Our actuarial calculations are based on numerous assumptions, including disability incidence, medical costs, mortality, death benefits, dependents and discount rates.
 
The revised BLBA regulations took effect in January 2001, relaxing the stringent award criteria established under previous regulations and thus potentially allowing new federal claims to be awarded and allowing previously denied claimants to re-file under the revised criteria. These regulations may also increase black lung-related medical costs by broadening the scope of conditions for which medical costs are reimbursable and increase legal costs by shifting more of the burden of proof to the employer.
 
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act enacted in 2010 includes significant changes to the federal black lung program retroactive to 2005, including an automatic survivor benefit paid upon the death of a miner with an awarded black lung claim and establishes a rebuttable presumption with regard to pneumoconiosis among miners with 15 or more years of coal mine employment that are totally disabled by a respiratory condition. These changes could have a material impact on our costs expended in association with the federal black lung program.
 
Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act 
 
The Federal Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (“SMCRA”) and similar state statutes establish operational, reclamation and closure standards for all aspects of surface mining as well as many aspects of underground mining. Currently, ~96% of our production capacity involves underground room and pillar mining (no surface subsidence), and ~4% involves surface mining. We do not engage in either mountain top removal or long-wall mining. SMCRA nevertheless requires that comprehensive environmental protection and reclamation standards be met during the course of and upon completion of our mining activities.
 
SMCRA and similar state statutes require, among other things, that surface disturbance be restored in accordance with specified standards and approved reclamation plans. SMCRA requires us to restore affected surface areas to approximate the original contours as contemporaneously as practicable with the completion of surface mining operations. Federal law and some states impose on mine operators the responsibility for replacing certain water supplies damaged by mining operations and repairing or compensating for damage to certain structures occurring on the surface as a result of mine subsidence, a consequence of longwall mining and possibly other mining operations. We believe we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable regulations relating to reclamation.
 
In addition, the Abandoned Mine Lands Program, which is part of SMCRA, imposes a reclamation fee on all current mining operations, the proceeds of which are used to restore mines closed before 1977.  The fee expired on September 30, 2021, and was reauthorized through September 30, 2034, under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act which was signed on November 15, 2021. The fee, as reauthorized, for surface-mined and underground-mined coal is $0.224 per ton and $0.096 per ton, respectively, through September 30, 2034. We have accrued the estimated costs of reclamation and mine closing, including the cost of treating mine water discharge when necessary.  In addition, states from time to time have increased and may continue to increase their fees and taxes to fund reclamation or orphaned mine sites and acid mine drainage control on a statewide basis.
 
Under SMCRA, responsibility for unabated violations, unpaid civil penalties and unpaid reclamation fees of independent contract mine operators and other third parties can be imputed to other companies that are deemed, according to the regulations, to have “owned” or “controlled” the third-party violator. Sanctions against the “owner” or “controller” are quite severe and can include being blocked from receiving new permits and having any permits revoked that were issued after the time of the violations or after the time civil penalties or reclamation fees became due. We are not aware of any currently pending or asserted claims against us relating to the “ownership” or “control” theories discussed above. However, we cannot assure you that such claims will not be asserted in the future.
 
In April 2015, the United States Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") finalized rules on coal combustion residuals ("CCRs"); however, the final rule does not address the placement of CCRs in minefills or non-minefill uses of CCRs at coal mine sites. The Federal Office of Surface Mining ("OSM ") has announced their intention to release a proposed rule to regulate placement and use of CCRs at coal mine sites, but to date, no further action has been taken. These actions by OSM potentially could result in additional delays and costs associated with obtaining permits, prohibitions or restrictions relating to mining activities, and additional enforcement actions.
     7 

  
Bonding Requirements 
 
Federal and state laws require bonds to secure our obligations to reclaim lands used for mining, and to satisfy other miscellaneous obligations. These bonds are typically renewable on a yearly basis. It has become increasingly difficult for our competitors and us to secure new surety bonds without posting collateral, and in some cases, it is unclear what level of collateral will be required. In addition, surety bond costs have increased while the market terms of surety bonds have generally become less favorable to us. It is possible that surety bond issuers may refuse to renew bonds or may demand additional collateral upon those renewals. Our failure to maintain or inability to acquire surety bonds that are required by federal and state laws would have a material adverse effect on our ability to produce coal, which could affect our profitability and cash flow.
 Air Emissions

 The Clean Air Act ("CAA") and similar state and local laws and regulations regulate emissions into the air and affect coal mining operations. The CAA directly impacts our coal mining and processing operations by imposing permitting requirements and, in some cases, requirements to install certain emissions control equipment, achieve certain emissions standards, or implement certain work practices on sources that emit various air pollutants. The CAA also indirectly affects coal mining operations by extensively regulating the air emissions of coal-fired electric power generating plants and other coal-burning facilities. There have been a series of federal rulemakings focused on emissions from coal-fired electric generating facilities. Installation of additional emissions control technology and any additional measures required under applicable federal and state laws and regulations related to air emissions will make it more costly to operate coal-fired power plants and possibly other facilities that consume coal and, depending on the requirements of individual state implementation plans (“SIPs”), could make fossil fuels a less attractive fuel alternative in the planning and building of power plants in the future. A significant reduction in fossil fuels’ share of power generating capacity could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
In addition to the greenhouse gas (“GHG”) issues discussed below, the air emissions programs that may affect our operations, directly or indirectly, include, but are not limited to, the following:
 

● | The EPA’s Acid Rain Program, provided in Title IV of the CAA, regulates emissions of sulfur dioxide from electric generating facilities. Sulfur dioxide is a by-product of coal combustion. Affected facilities purchase or are otherwise allocated sulfur dioxide emissions allowances, which must be surrendered annually in an amount equal to a facility’s sulfur dioxide emissions in that year. Affected facilities may sell or trade excess allowances to other facilities that require additional allowances to offset their sulfur dioxide emissions. In addition to purchasing or trading for additional sulfur dioxide allowances, affected power facilities can satisfy the requirements of the EPA’s Acid Rain Program by switching to lower-sulfur fuels, installing pollution control devices such as flue gas desulfurization systems, or “scrubbers,” or by reducing electricity generating levels. These requirements would not be supplanted by a replacement rule for the Clean Air Interstate Rule (“CAIR”), discussed below. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The CAIR calls for power plants in 28 states and Washington, D.C. to reduce emission levels of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide pursuant to a cap-and-trade program similar to the system in effect for acid rain. In June 2011, the EPA finalized the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (“CSAPR”), a replacement rule for CAIR, which would have required 28 states in the Midwest and eastern seaboard to reduce power plant emissions that cross state lines and contribute to ozone and/or fine particle pollution in other states. CSAPR has become increasingly irrelevant with continuing coal plant retirements making the nitrogen oxide ozone budget less stringent and lowering emission allowance prices to levels closer to average operating cost for many of our customers. The full impact of CSAPR is unknown at the present time due to the implementation of Mercury and Air Toxic Standards ("MATS"), discussed below, and the impact of the continuing coal plant retirements. 
● | In February 2012, the EPA adopted the MATS, which regulates the emission of mercury and other metals, fine particulates, and acid gases such as hydrogen chloride from coal and oil-fired power plants. In March 2013, the EPA finalized a reconsideration of the MATS rule as it pertains to new power plants, principally adjusting emissions limits to levels attainable by existing control technologies. In subsequent litigation, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the MATS rule based on the EPA’s failure to take costs into consideration. The D.C. Circuit Court allowed the current rule to stay in place until the EPA issued a new finding. In April 2016, the EPA issued a final supplemental finding upholding the rule and concluding that a cost analysis supports the MATS rule. In April 2017, the D.C Circuit Court of Appeals granted the EPA’s request to cancel oral arguments and ordered the case held in abeyance for an EPA review of the supplemental finding. In December 2018, the EPA issued a proposed Supplemental Cost Finding, as well as the CAA required "risk and technology review." In May 2020, EPA issued a final rule that reverses the Agency's prior determination from 2000 and 2016 that it was "appropriate and necessary" to regulate hazardous air pollutants ("HAP") from coal-fueled Electric Generating Units ("EGUs") under the MATS rule. However, in February 2022, EPA published a proposed rule proposing to revoke the May 2020 finding. The final rule remains pending. Although various issues surrounding the MATS rule remain subject to litigation in the D.C. Circuit, the MATS rule has forced generators to make capital investments to retrofit power plants and could lead to additional premature retirements of older coal-fired generating units.

 | The announced and possible additional retirements are likely to reduce the demand for coal. Apart from MATS, several states have enacted or proposed regulations requiring reductions in mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants, and federal legislation to reduce mercury emissions from power plants has been proposed. Regulation of mercury emissions by the EPA, states, or Congress may decrease the future demand for coal. We continue to evaluate the possible scenarios associated with CSAPR and MATS and the effects they may have on our business and our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The EPA is required by the CAA to periodically re-evaluate the available health effects information to determine whether the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (“NAAQS”) should be revised. Pursuant to this process, the EPA has adopted more stringent NAAQS for fine particulate matter (“PM”), ozone, nitrogen oxide, and sulfur dioxide. As a result, some states will be required to amend their existing SIPs to attain and maintain compliance with the new air quality standards and other states will be required to develop new SIPs for areas that were previously in “attainment” but do not attain the new standards. In addition, under the revised ozone NAAQS, significant additional emissions control expenditures may be required at coal-fired power plants. In March 2019, the EPA published a final rule that retained the current primary NAAQS for sulfur oxide. In December 2020, EPA published a final rule to retain the current NAAQS for both PM and ozone; however, various entities have filed litigation against one or both of these rulemakings, and the Biden Administration announced that it would reconsider and potentially revise the NAAQS. However, with respect to ozone, a draft assessment released in April 2022 indicates EPA staff have reached a preliminary conclusion that the December 2020 decision will stand, but uncertainty remains until a final decision is reached. New standards may impose additional emissions control requirements on new and expanded coal-fired power plants and industrial boilers. Because coal mining operations and coal-fired electric generating facilities emit particulate matter and sulfur dioxide, our mining operations and our customers could be affected when the new standards are implemented by the applicable states, and developments might indirectly reduce the demand for coal. 


● | The EPA’s regional haze program is designed to protect and improve visibility at and around national parks, national wilderness areas, and international parks. Under the program, states are required to develop SIPs to improve visibility. Typically, these plans call for reductions in sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from coal-fueled electric plants. In prior cases, the EPA has decided to negate the SIPs and impose stringent requirements through FIPs. The regional haze program, including particularly the EPA’s FIPs, and any future regulations may restrict the construction of new coal-fired power plants whose operation may impair visibility at and around federally protected areas and may require some existing coal-fired power plants to install additional control measures designed to limit haze-causing emissions. These requirements could limit the demand for coal in some locations. In September 2018, the EPA issued a memorandum that detailed plans to assist states as they develop their SIPs, which was followed by a supplemental memorandum in July 2021 for SIPs for the second implementation period.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The EPA’s new source review (“NSR”) program under the CAA in certain circumstances requires existing coal-fired power plants, when modifications to those plants significantly increase emissions, to install more stringent air emissions control equipment. The Department of Justice, on behalf of the EPA, has filed lawsuits against a number of coal-fired electric generating facilities alleging violations of the NSR program. The EPA has alleged that certain modifications have been made to these facilities without first obtaining certain permits issued under the program. Several of these lawsuits have been settled, but others remain pending. In October 2020, the EPA finalized a rule to clarify the process for evaluating whether the NSR permitting program would apply to a proposed modification of a source of air emissions. The EPA has announced that it will review the NSR program. Depending on the ultimate resolution of the EPA's litigation and review, demand for coal could be affected. 

 
GHG Emissions 
 
Combustion of fossil fuels, such as the coal we produce, results in the emission of GHGs, such as carbon dioxide and methane. Combustion of fuel for mining equipment used in coal production also emits GHGs. Future regulation of GHG emissions in the U.S. could occur pursuant to future U.S. treaty commitments, new domestic legislation or regulation by the EPA.  Although no comprehensive climate change regulation has been adopted at the federal level in the United States, President Biden has announced that climate change will be a focus of his administration. For example, in January 2021, President Biden issued an executive order that commits to substantial action on climate change, calling for, among other things, the increased use of zero-emissions vehicles by the federal government, the elimination of subsidies provided to the fossil-fuel industry, a doubling of electricity generated by offshore wind by 2030, and increased emphasis on climate-related risks across governmental agencies and economic sectors. Internationally, the Paris Agreement requires member states to submit non-binding, individually-determined emissions reduction targets. These commitments could further reduce demand and prices for fossil fuels. Although the United States had withdrawn from the Paris Agreement, President Biden recommitted the United States in February 2021 and, in April 2021, announced a new, more rigorous nationally determined emissions reduction level of 50-52% reduction from 2005 levels in economy-wide net GHG emissions by 2030. The international community gathered again in Glasgow in November 2021 at the 26th Conference to the Parties ("COP26") during which multiple announcements were made, including a call for parties to eliminate fossil fuel subsidies, among other measures.
     9 

  

Relatedly, the United States and European Union jointly announced at COP26 the launch of the Global Methane Pledge, an initiative committing to a collective goal of reducing global methane emissions by at least 30% from 2020 levels by 2030, including "all feasible reductions" in the energy sector. Also at COP26, more than forty countries pledged to phase out coal, although the United States did not sign the pledge. At COP27, countries reiterated the agreements from COP26 and were called upon to accelerate efforts toward the phase out of inefficient fossil fuel subsidies. The United States also announced, in conjunction with the European Union and other partner countries, that it would develop standards for monitoring and reporting methane emissions to help create a market for low methane-intensity natural gas. Although no firm commitment or timeline to phase out or phase down all fossil fuels was made at COP27, there can be no guarantees that countries will not seek to implement such a phase out in the future.  The impact of these actions remains unclear at this time. Moreover, many states, regions, and governmental bodies have adopted GHG initiatives and have or are considering the imposition of fees or taxes based on the emission of GHGs by certain facilities, including coal-fired electric generating facilities. Others have announced their intent to increase the use of renewable energy sources, displacing coal and other fossil fuels. Depending on the particular regulatory program that may be enacted, at either the federal or state level, the demand for coal could be negatively impacted, which would have an adverse effect on our operations.
 
Even in the absence of new federal legislation, the EPA has begun to regulate GHG emissions under the CAA based on the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2007 decision that the EPA has authority to regulate GHG emissions. Although the U.S. Supreme Court’s holding did not expressly involve the EPA’s authority to regulate GHG emissions from stationary sources, such as coal-fueled power plants, the EPA has determined on its own that it has the authority to regulate GHG emissions from power plants and issued a final rule which found that GHG emissions, including carbon dioxide and methane, endanger both the public health and welfare. Several rulemakings have been issued under the EPA's  New Source Performance Standards ("NSPS") that constrain the GHG emissions of fossil-fuel-fired power plants. In January 2021, the EPA published a final significant contribution finding for purposes of regulating source category of GHG emissions, confirming that such power plants are a source category for such regulations. However, this finding also excludes several sectors and may, therefore, be subject to revision, and future implementation of the NSPS is uncertain at this time. The EPA is expected to publish a notice of proposed rulemaking in Spring 2023.
 
In August 2015, the EPA issued its final Clean Power Plan ("CPP") rules that establish carbon pollution standards for power plants, called CO2 emission performance rates. Judicial challenges led the U.S. Supreme Court to grant a stay in February 2016 of the implementation of the CPP before the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ("Circuit Court") even issued a decision. Then, in October 2017 the EPA proposed to repeal the CPP.  The EPA subsequently proposed the Affordable Clean Energy ("ACE") rule to replace the CPP with a rule that utilizes heat rate improvement measures as the "best system of emission reduction." The ACE rule adopts new implementing regulations under the CAA to clarify the roles of the EPA and the states, including an extension of the deadline for state plans and EPA approvals; and the rule revises the NSR permitting program to provide EGUs the opportunity to make efficiency improvements without triggering NSR permit requirements. In June 2019, the EPA published the final repeal of the CPP and promulgation of the ACE rule.  On January 19, 2021 , the Circuit Court struck down the ACE rule and found the EPA's "repeal of the CPP rested critically on a mistaken reading of the CAA." On June 30, 2022, the Supreme Court of the United States reversed and remanded the Circuit Court's decision in West Virginia v. EPA and found that, in the promulgation of the CPP, the EPA had acted outside the bounds of the legal authority granted to the agency by Congress.
 
Notwithstanding the ACE rule, the CPP's requirements and impact during the pendency of the litigation led to premature retirements and could lead to additional premature retirements of coal-fired generating units and reduce the demand for coal. Congress has not currently adopted legislation to restrict carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plants and has not otherwise expanded the legal authority of the EPA following West Virginia v. EPA, including as it relates to authority to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from existing and modified power plants as proposed in the NSPS and CPP. We cannot predict whether such legislation will be signed into law in the future.
 
There have been numerous protests and challenges to the permitting of new fossil fuel infrastructure, including coal-fired power plants and pipelines, by environmental organizations and state regulators for concerns related to GHG emissions. For instance, various state regulatory authorities have rejected the construction of new coal-fueled power plants based on the uncertainty surrounding the potential costs associated with GHG emissions from these plants under future laws limiting the emissions of carbon dioxide. In addition, several permits issued to new coal-fueled power plants without limits on GHG emissions have been appealed to the EPA’s Environmental Appeals Board. In addition, over thirty states have currently adopted “renewable energy standards” or “renewable portfolio standards,” which encourage or require electric utilities to obtain a certain percentage of their electric generation portfolio from renewable resources by a certain date. Several states have announced their intent to have renewable energy comprise 100% of their electric generation portfolio. Other states may adopt similar requirements, and federal legislation is a possibility in this area. In December 2021, President Biden issued an executive order setting a goal for a carbon pollution-free electricity sector across the country by 2035.  To the extent these requirements affect our current and prospective customers, they may reduce the demand for fossil fuel energy, and may affect long-term demand for our coal. Finally, while the U.S. Supreme Court has held that federal common law provides no basis for public nuisance claims against utilities due to their carbon dioxide emissions, the Court did not decide whether similar claims can be brought under state common law. As a result, despite this favorable ruling, tort-type liabilities remain a concern.
     10 

  

In addition, environmental advocacy groups have filed a variety of judicial challenges claiming that the environmental analyses conducted by federal agencies before granting permits and other approvals necessary for certain coal activities do not satisfy the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”). These groups assert that the environmental analyses in question do not adequately consider the climate change impacts of these particular projects. In April 2022, the Council on Environmental Quality ("CEQ") issued a final rule revoking some of the modifications made to the NEPA regulations under the previous administration and reincorporated the consideration of direct, indirect and cumulative effects of major federal actions, including GHG emissions. And, in January 2023, the CEQ released guidance, effective immediately, to assist federal agencies in assessing the GHG emissions and climate change effects of their proposed actions under NEPA.
 
Many states and regions have adopted GHG initiatives, and certain governmental bodies have or are considering the imposition of fees or taxes based on the emission of GHG by certain facilities, including coal-fired electric generating facilities. For example, in 2005, ten Northeastern states entered into the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative agreement (“RGGI”), calling for the implementation of a cap and trade program aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions from power plants in the participating states. The members of RGGI have established in statutes and/or regulations a carbon dioxide trading program. Auctions for carbon dioxide allowances under the program began in September 2008. Since its inception, several additional states and Canadian provinces have joined RGGI as participants or observers, while Virginia has withdrawn from RGGI via executive order by its governor. Similar to RGGI, five western states launched the Western Regional Climate Initiative, although only California and certain Canadian provinces are currently active participants. We cannot predict what other regional greenhouse gas reduction initiatives may arise in the future.
 
It is possible that future international, federal and state initiatives to control GHG emissions could result in increased costs associated with fossil fuel production and consumption, such as costs to install additional controls to reduce carbon dioxide emissions or costs to purchase emissions reduction credits to comply with future emissions trading programs. Such increased costs for fossil fuel consumption could result in some customers switching to alternative sources of fuel, or otherwise adversely affect our operations and demand for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.  Finally, activists may try to hamper fossil fuel companies by other means, including pressuring financing and other institutions into restricting access to capital, bonding and insurance, as well as pursuing tort litigation for various alleged climate-related impacts.
 
Water Discharge 
 
The Federal Clean Water Act (“CWA”) and similar state and local laws and regulations regulate discharges into certain waters, primarily through permitting. Section 404 of the CWA imposes permitting and mitigation requirements associated with the dredging and filling of certain wetlands and streams. The CWA and equivalent state legislation, where such equivalent state legislation exists, affect coal mining operations that impact such wetlands and streams. Although permitting requirements have been tightened in recent years, we believe we have obtained all necessary permits required under CWA Section 404 as it has traditionally been interpreted by the responsible agencies. However, mitigation requirements under existing and possible future “fill” permits may vary considerably. For that reason, the setting of post-mine asset retirement obligation accruals for such mitigation projects is difficult to ascertain with certainty and may increase in the future.  Although more stringent permitting requirements may be imposed in the future, we are not able to accurately predict the impact, if any, of such permitting requirements.
 
In order for us to conduct certain activities, we may need to obtain a permit for the discharge of fill material from the United States Army Corps of Engineers ("Corps of Engineers") and/or a discharge permit from the state regulatory authority under the state counterpart to the CWA. Our coal mining operations typically require Section 404 permits to authorize activities such as the creation of slurry ponds and stream impoundments. The CWA authorizes the EPA to review Section 404 permits issued by the Corps of Engineers, and in 2009, the EPA began reviewing Section 404 permits issued by the Corps of Engineers for coal mining in Appalachia. Currently, significant uncertainty exists regarding the obtaining of permits under the CWA for coal mining operations in Appalachia due to various initiatives launched by the EPA regarding these permits.
 
The EPA also has statutory “veto” power over a Section 404 permit if the EPA determines, after notice and an opportunity for a public hearing, that the permit will have an “unacceptable adverse effect.”  In January 2011, the EPA exercised its veto power to withdraw or restrict the use of a previously issued permit for Spruce No. 1 Surface Mine in West Virginia, which is one of the largest surface mining operations ever authorized in Appalachia. This action was the first time that such power was exercised with regard to a previously permitted coal mining project which veto was subsequently upheld by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2013. Any future use of the EPA’s Section 404 “veto” power could create uncertainty with regard to our continued use of current permits, as well as impose additional time and cost burdens on future operations, potentially adversely affecting our coal revenues. In addition, the EPA initiated a preemptive veto prior to the filing of any actual permit application for a copper and gold mine based on a fictitious mine scenario. The implications of this decision could allow the EPA to bypass the state permitting process and engage in watershed and land use planning.
     11 

  

Total Maximum Daily Load (“TMDL”) regulations under the CWA establish a process to calculate the maximum amount of a pollutant that an impaired waterbody can receive and still meet state water quality standards and to allocate pollutant loads among the point and non-point pollutant sources discharging into that water body. Likewise, when water quality in a receiving stream is better than required, states are required to conduct an antidegradation review before approving discharge permits. The adoption of new TMDL-related allocations or any changes to antidegradation policies for streams near our coal mines could require more costly water treatment and could adversely affect our coal production.
 
Considerable legal uncertainty exists surrounding the standard for what constitutes jurisdictional waters and wetlands subject to the protections and requirements of the CWA. Rulemakings to establish the extent of such jurisdiction were finalized in 2015 and 2020, respectively, and both rulemakings have been subject to substantial litigation. Although the EPA and Corps of Engineers did not seek to vacate the 2020 rule on an interim basis, two federal district courts in Arizona and New Mexico vacated the 2020 rule in decisions announced during the third quarter of 2021. In December 2022, the EPA and Corps of Engineers released a final revised definition of "waters of the United States" ("WOTUS") founded upon a pre-2015 definition and including updates to incorporate existing Supreme Court decisions. However, continued uncertainty remains as to the government's jurisdictional reach as the rule is likely to be subject to legal challenge. Judicial developments further add to this uncertainty. In October 2022, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in Sackett v. EPA regarding the scope and authority of the CWA and the definition of WOTUS and is expected to release an opinion in this case in 2023, which could impact the regulatory definition and its implementation. To the extent any decision expands the scope of the EPA and the Corps of Engineers' jurisdiction under the CWA, we could face increased costs and delays due to additional permitting and regulatory requirements and possible challenges to permitting decisions.
 
Hazardous Substances and Wastes 
 
The Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), otherwise known as the “Superfund” law, and analogous state laws, impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of persons that are considered to have contributed to the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. These persons include the owner or operator of the site where the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site. Persons who are or were responsible for the release of hazardous substances may be subject to joint and several liability under CERCLA for the costs of cleaning up releases of hazardous substances and natural resource damages. Some products used in coal mining operations generate waste containing hazardous substances. We are currently unaware of any material liability associated with the release or disposal of hazardous substances from our past or present mine sites.
 
The Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and analogous state laws impose requirements for the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal, and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. Many mining wastes are excluded from the regulatory definition of hazardous wastes, and coal mining operations covered by SMCRA permits are by statute exempted from RCRA permitting. RCRA also allows the EPA to require corrective action at sites where there is a release of hazardous substances. In addition, each state has its own laws regarding the proper management and disposal of waste material. While these laws impose ongoing compliance obligations, such costs are not believed to have a material impact on our operations.
 
RCRA impacts the coal industry in particular because it regulates the disposal of certain coal combustion by-products (“CCB”). On April 17, 2015, the EPA finalized regulations under RCRA for the disposal of CCB. Under the finalized regulations, CCB is regulated as "non-hazardous" waste and avoids the stricter, more costly, regulations under RCRA's hazardous waste rules. While classification of CCB as a hazardous waste would have led to more stringent restrictions and higher costs, this regulation may still increase our customers' operating costs and potentially reduce their ability to purchase coal. The CCB rule was subject to legal challenge and ultimately remanded to the EPA. On August 28, 2020, the EPA published a final revised rule mandating closure of unlined impoundments, with deadlines to initiate closure between 2021 and 2028, depending on site specific circumstances. Certain provisions of the revised CCB rule were vacated by the D.C. Circuit in 2018. The EPA is expected to finalize additional rules addressing those specific provisions in June 2023. Meanwhile, on January 25, 2022, the EPA published determinations for 9 of 57 CCB facilities who sought approval to continue disposal of CCB and non-CCB waste streams until 2023, as opposed to the initial 2021 deadline for unlined impoundments prescribed by the current rule. While the EPA issued one conditional approval, the EPA is requiring the remaining facilities to cease receipt of waste within 135 days of completion of public comment or around July 2022. And, in January 2023, the EPA issued six proposed determinations to deny facilities' requests to continue disposal into unlined surface impoundments.  The current determinations, future determinations of the same nature, or similar actions in expected future rulemakings could lead to accelerated, abrupt, or unplanned suspension of coal-fired boilers. The combined effect of the CCB rules and Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards ("ELG") regulations (discussed below) has compelled power generating companies to close existing ash ponds and may force the closure of certain existing coal burning power plants that cannot comply with the new standards. Such retirements may adversely affect the demand for our coal.
 
    12 

  

On November 3, 2015, the EPA published the final rule, ELG,  revising the regulations for the Steam Electric Power Generating category which became effective on January 4, 2016. The rule sets the first federal limits on the levels of toxic metals in wastewater that can be discharged from power plants, based on technology improvements in the steam electric power industry over the last three decades. The combined effect of the CCB and ELG regulations has forced power generating companies to close existing ash ponds and will likely force the closure of certain older existing coal-burning power plants that cannot comply with the new standards. In November 2019, the EPA proposed revisions to the 2015 ELG rule and announced proposed changes to regulations for the disposal of coal ash in order to reduce compliance costs.  In October 2020, the EPA published a final rule. In August 2021, the EPA initiated supplemental rulemaking indicating that it intended to strengthen certain discharge limits. The EPA expects to issue a proposed rule for public comment in the summer of 2023.  It is unclear what impact these regulations will have on the market for our products.
 
Endangered Species Act 
 
The federal Endangered Species Act (“ESA”) and counterpart state legislation protect species threatened with possible extinction. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (the “USFWS”) works closely with the OSM and state regulatory agencies to ensure that species subject to the ESA are protected from potential impacts from mining-related activities. In October 2021, the Biden Administration proposed the rollback of new rules promulgated under the Trump Administration and, in June 2022, the USFWS and the National Marine Fisheries Service published a final rule rescinding the 2020 regulatory definition of "habitat." 
 
If the USFWS were to designate species indigenous to the areas in which we operate as threatened or endangered, or to re-designate a species from threatened to endangered, we could be subject to additional regulatory and permitting requirements, which in turn could increase operating costs or adversely affect our revenues.
 
Other Environmental, Health and Safety Regulation
 
In addition to the laws and regulations described above, we are subject to regulations regarding underground and above ground storage tanks in which we may store petroleum or other substances. Some monitoring equipment that we use is subject to licensing under the Federal Atomic Energy Act. Water supply wells located on our properties are subject to federal, state, and local regulations. In addition, our use of explosives is subject to the Federal Safe Explosives Act. We are also required to comply with the Federal Safe Drinking Water Act, the Toxic Substance Control Act, and the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act. The costs of compliance with these regulations should not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Climate Change Issues
 
Physical Climate Risks. Increased frequency of severe and extreme weather events associated with climate change could materially impact our facilities, energy sales, and results of operations. We are unable to predict these events. However, we perform ongoing assessments of physical risk, including physical climate risk, to our business. More extreme and volatile temperatures, increased storm intensity and flooding, and more volatile precipitation leading to changes in lake and river levels are among the weather events that are most likely to impact our business.
Transition Climate Risks. Future legislative and regulatory programs, at both the federal and state levels, could significantly limit allowed GHG emissions or impose a cost or tax on GHG emissions. Revised or additional future GHG legislation and/or regulation related to the generation of electricity or the extraction, production, distribution, transmission, storage and end use of natural gas could materially impact our gas supply, financial position, financial results and cash flows.
 
Regarding federal policies, we continue to monitor the implementation of any final and proposed climate change-related legislation and regulations, including the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, signed into law in November 2021; the development of the Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures, proposed by the SEC in March 2022; the Inflation Reduction Act ("IRA"), signed into law in August 2022; and the EPA's proposed methane regulations for the oil and natural gas industry, but we cannot predict their impact on our business at this time. We have identified potential opportunities associated with the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the IRA and are evaluating how they may align with our strategy going forward. The energy-related provisions of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act include new federal funding for power grid infrastructure and resiliency investments, new and existing energy efficiency and weatherization programs, electric vehicle infrastructure for public chargers and additional LIHEAP funding over the next five years. The IRA contains climate and energy provisions, including funding to decarbonize the electric sector.

Suppliers 
 
The main types of goods we purchase are mining equipment and replacement parts, steel-related (including roof control) products, belting products, lubricants, electricity, fuel, and tires. Although we have many long, well-established relationships with our key suppliers, we do not believe that we are dependent on any of our individual suppliers other than for purchases of electricity. The supplier base providing mining materials has been relatively consistent in recent years. Purchases of certain underground mining equipment are concentrated with one principal supplier; however, supplier competition continues to develop.
Illinois Basin (ILB) 
 
The coal industry underwent a significant transformation in the early 1990s, as greater environmental accountability was established in the electric utility industry. Through the U.S. Clean Air Act, acceptable baseline levels were established for the release of sulfur dioxide in power plant emissions. In order to comply with the new law, most utilities switched fuel consumption to low-sulfur coal, thereby stripping the ILB of over 50 million tons of annual coal demand. This strategy continued until mid-2000 when a shortage of low-sulfur coal drove up prices. This price increase combined with the assurance from the U.S. government that the utility industry would be able to recoup their costs to install scrubbers caused utilities to begin investing in scrubbers on a large scale. With scrubbers, the ILB re-opened as a significant fuel source for utilities and has enabled them to burn lower-cost high sulfur coal.
 
The ILB consists of coal mining operations covering more than 50,000 square miles in Illinois, Indiana, and western Kentucky. The ILB is centrally located between four of the largest regions that consume coal as fuel for electricity generation (East North Central, West South Central, West North Central, and East South Central). The region also has access to sufficient rail and water transportation routes that service coal-fired power plants in these regions as well as other significant coal consuming regions of the South Atlantic and Middle Atlantic.
 
U. S. Coal Industry 
 
The major coal production basins in the U.S. include Central Appalachia (CAPP), Northern Appalachia (NAPP), Illinois Basin (ILB), Powder River Basin (PRB), and the Western Bituminous region (WB). CAPP includes eastern Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia and southern West Virginia. NAPP includes Maryland, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and northern West Virginia. The ILB includes Illinois, Indiana, and western Kentucky. The PRB is located in northeastern Wyoming and southeastern Montana. The WB includes western Colorado, eastern Utah, and southern Wyoming. Hallador, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Sunrise Coal, LLC, mines coal exclusively in the ILB.
 
Coal type varies by basin. Heat value and sulfur content are important quality characteristics and determine the end-use for each coal type.
 
Coal in the U.S. is mined through surface and underground mining methods. The primary underground mining techniques are longwall mining and continuous (room-and-pillar) mining. The geological conditions dictate which technique to use. Our mines utilize the continuous mining technique. In continuous mining, rooms are cut into the coal bed leaving a series of pillars, or columns of coal, to help support the mine roof and control the flow of air. Continuous mining equipment cuts the coal from the mining face. Generally, openings are driven 20’ wide, and the pillars are rectangular in shape measuring 40’x 40’. As mining advances, a grid-like pattern of entries and pillars is formed. Roof bolts are used to secure the roof of the mine. Battery cars move the coal to the conveyor belt for transport to the surface. The pillars can constitute up to 50% of the total coal in a seam.
 
The United States coal industry is highly competitive, with numerous producers selling into all markets that use coal. We compete against large producers such as Peabody Energy Corporation (NYSE: BTU), Alliance Resource Partners (Nasdaq: ARLP), and other private producers.
 
Human Capital
 
As of December 31, 2022, Hallador Energy Company and its subsidiaries employed 980 full-time employees and temporary miners.  930 of those employees and temporary miners are directly involved in the coal mining or coal washing process.   Our workforce is entirely union-free.  To attract and retain top talent, we provide competitive wages, an annual bonus for all employees, excellent benefits, an employee health clinic, and a culture that is committed to health and safety at all levels. 
 
    14 

  

Employee health and safety is a top priority at Hallador Energy’s wholly owned subsidiary, Sunrise Coal, LLC.   With a robust safety department and safety standards that exceed mandated guidelines, we make safety the foundation of everything we do.  While every precaution is taken to prevent mine emergencies, Sunrise Coal has its own private mine rescue team.  This team is trained and ready to manage any emergency at a Sunrise Coal, LLC facility, but also ready and available to assist other mine rescue teams.  We continuously monitor safety data such as injury severity, violations per inspection day, and significant and substantial citations and compare to the national averages noting that in 2021 we were at or below the national averages in all three categories.  For more information about citations or orders for violations of standards under the FMSHA, as amended by the Miner Act, please see our Exhibit 95.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
While other companies have moved to high deductible health plans, Hallador Energy is committed to providing comprehensive affordable health insurance with low-cost deductibles and co-pays to take care of our employees and their families.  We believe in decreasing the barriers to healthcare, so employees and their dependents do not have to delay care.  Our employees and their families also have access to a private full-time health and wellness clinic, with free medications, no cost diagnostics, and a wellness coach. 
 
Beyond investing in the safety and health of its employees, Hallador Energy invests in educational opportunities for its employees.  All continuing education requirements and training are completely paid for by the company and tuition reimbursement programs are available to every employee companywide.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022 AND 2021
 

 (1)  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
   Basis of Presentation and Consolidation 
   The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Hallador Energy Company (hereinafter known as, “we, us, or our”) and its wholly owned subsidiaries Sunrise Coal, LLC ("Sunrise"), Hallador Power Company, LLC ("Hallador Power") and Hourglass Sands, LLC ("Hourglass"), as well as Sunrise and Hallador Power's wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Sunrise is engaged in the production of steam coal from mines located in western Indiana.   Segment Information 
   As the result of Hallador Power’s acquisition of the Merom one gigawatt power plant in Sullivan County, Indiana (the “Merom Power Plant”) from Hoosier Energy Rural Electric Cooperative, Inc. (“Hoosier”) on  October 21, 2022 (the “Merom Acquisition”), as further described in Note 16, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2022 we began to strategically view and manage our operations through two reportable segments:  Coal Operations and Electric Operations.  The remainder of our operations, which are not significant enough on a stand-alone basis to warrant treatment as an operating segment, are presented as "Corporate and Other" and primarily are comprised of unallocated corporate costs and activities, including a 50% interest in Sunrise Energy, LLC, a private gas exploration company with operations in Indiana, which we account for using the equity method, and our wholly-owned subsidiary Summit Terminal LLC, a logistics transport facility located on the Ohio River.  Prior periods have been recast to reflect Corporate and Other apart from Coal Operations which previously were aggregated into a single reportable segment.   The Coal Operations reportable segment includes currently operating mining complexes Oaktown 1 and 2 underground mines, Prosperity surface mine, Freelandville surface mine, and Carlisle wash plant.   The Electric Operations reportable segment includes electric power generation facilities of the Merom Power Plant.   Accounts Receivable
   The timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections results in accounts receivable from customers. Customers are invoiced as coal is shipped or as power is delivered or at periodic intervals in accordance with contractual terms. Invoices typically include customary adjustments for the resolution of price variability, such as coal quality thresholds. Payments are generally received within thirty days of invoicing.  Historically, credit losses have been insignificant. No charges for credit losses were recognized during the years ended  December 31, 2022 or 2021.
   Inventory and Parts and Supplies
   Inventory and parts and supplies are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value determined using the first-in first-out method. Inventory costs include labor, supplies, operating overhead, and other related costs incurred at or on behalf of the mining location or plant, including depreciation, depletion, and amortization of equipment, buildings, mineral rights, and mine development costs.   Contract Asset - Coal Purchase Agreement
   Contract Asset - Coal Purchase Agreement is the result of a coal purchase agreement with Hoosier whereby we are purchasing coal from Hoosier through  May 31, 2023 at fixed prices which were below market prices at the date we entered into the agreement.  This agreement was entered into as consideration in the Merom Acquisition.  The asset is being amortized to inventory as coal is purchased over the term of the agreement as the contract is fulfilled.  During the year ended  December 31, 2022, $14.7 million was amortized, of which $3.6 million was recognized in operating expenses on the consolidated statement of operations.  The Coal Purchase Agreement term is from  October 22, 2022 to  May 31, 2023.
   Prepaid Expenses 
   Prepaid expenses include prepaid insurance and other prepaid balances with vendors for various services paid for in advance of use.       52
  
  Advanced Royalties 
   Coal leases that require minimum annual or advance payments and are recoverable from future production are generally deferred and charged to expense as the coal is subsequently produced. Advance royalties are included in other assets.   Mining Properties and Plant Equipment
   Mining properties are recorded at cost. Interest costs applicable to major asset additions are capitalized during the construction period. Expenditures that extend the useful lives or increase the productivity of the assets are capitalized. The cost of maintenance and repairs that do not extend the useful lives or increase the productivity of the assets are expensed as incurred. Other than land and most mining equipment, mining properties are depreciated using the units-of-production method over the estimated recoverable reserves. Most surface and underground mining equipment is depreciated using estimated useful lives ranging from three to twenty-five years.   The values of the property, plant and equipment acquired as part of the Merom Acquisition are recorded at relative fair value based on the consideration paid upon closing of the acquisition of the plant in  October 2022.  Other equipment is recorded at cost.  Expenditures that extend the useful lives or increase the productivity of the assets are capitalized. The cost of maintenance and repairs that do not extend the useful lives or increase the productivity of the assets are expensed as incurred.  Most power plant equipment is depreciated using estimated useful lives ranging from four to nine years.   If facts and circumstances suggest that a long-lived asset  may be impaired, the carrying value is reviewed for recoverability. If this review indicates that the carrying value of the asset will not be recoverable through estimated undiscounted future net cash flows related to the asset over its remaining life, then an impairment loss is recognized by reducing the carrying value of the asset to its estimated fair value. See Note 2 for further discussion of impairments.   Mine Development 
   Costs of developing new mines, including asset retirement obligation assets, or significantly expanding the capacity of existing mines, are capitalized and amortized using the units-of-production method over estimated recoverable reserves.   Deferred Revenue
   Deferred revenue includes advance payments on electric capacity payments and prepayments on coal deliveries.  The deferred revenue for each will be reversed to revenue on a monthly pro-rata basis for the capacity payments and as coal is delivered for the coal prepayments based upon the underlying contractual terms.  All deferred revenue is expected to be recognized in revenue within one year.   Asset Retirement Obligations (ARO) – Reclamation 
   At the time they are incurred, legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets are reflected at their estimated fair value, with a corresponding charge to mine development. Obligations are typically incurred when we commence development of underground and surface mines and include reclamation of support facilities, refuse areas and slurry ponds.   Obligations are reflected at the present value of their future cash flows. We reflect accretion of the obligations for the period from the date they are incurred through the date they are extinguished. The ARO assets are amortized using the units-of-production method over estimated recoverable (proven and probable) reserves. We are using credit-adjusted risk-free discount rates ranging from 5.0% to 10% to discount the obligation, inflation rates anticipated during the time to reclamation, and cost estimates prepared by our engineers inclusive of market risk premiums.  Federal and state laws require that mines be reclaimed in accordance with specific standards and approved reclamation plans, as outlined in mining permits. Activities include reclamation of pit and support acreage at surface mines, sealing portals at underground mines, and reclamation of refuse areas and slurry ponds.   We review our ARO at least annually and reflect revisions for permit changes, changes in our estimated reclamation costs and changes in the estimated timing of such costs. The change in estimate for the year ended  December 31, 2021 was a result of a change in timing of expected reclamation of the Ace in the Hole Mine, Carlisle Mine, and Prosperity Mine and updates to inflation rates from when the liabilities were first projected. In the event we are not able to perform reclamation, we have surety bonds totaling $36.9 million to cover ARO.        53
  
  The table below (in thousands) reflects the changes to our ARO:

Long-term balance, end of year | $ | 17,254 | | | $ | 14,025 | 

     Contract Liabilities - Power Purchase Agreement and Capacity Payment Reduction
   Contract Liabilities - Power Purchase Agreement and Capacity Payment Reduction is the result of a power purchase agreement with Hoosier whereby we are selling power to Hoosier through 2025 at fixed prices which were below market prices at the date we entered into the agreement.  We also agreed to a reduction in future capacity payments as part of the acquisition consideration.  These agreements were entered into as consideration in the Merom Acquisition.  The power purchase agreement liability is amortized to electric sales revenue pro-rata over the term of the agreement as the contract is fulfilled.  During the year ended  December 31, 2022, amortization of the power purchase agreement contract liability totaled $23.3 million.  The Power Purchase Agreement term is from  October 22, 2022 to  December 31, 2025.  The Capacity Payment Reductions occur on  May 31, 2023 and  November 30, 2023 in the amount of $7.5 million each.   Interest Rate Swaps
   The Company generally utilizes derivative instruments to manage exposures to interest rate risk on long-term debt. The Company enters interest rate swaps in order to achieve a mix of fixed and variable rate debt that it deems appropriate. These interest rate swaps have not been designated as hedging instruments and are accounted for as an asset or a liability in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at their fair value.  Realized and unrealized gains and losses are classified as operating activities in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. As of  December 31, 2022, the Company is not a party to any interest rate swaps.   Commitments and Contingencies
   From time to time the Company is involved in legal proceedings and/or  may be subject to industry rulings that could bring rise to claims in the ordinary course of business.  The Company has concluded that the likelihood is remote that the ultimate resolution of any pending litigation or pending claims will be material or have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.   Statement of Cash Flows 
   Cash and cash equivalents include investments with maturities when purchased of three months or less.   Income Taxes 
   Income taxes are provided based on the liability method of accounting. The provision for income taxes is based on pretax financial income. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future expected tax consequences of temporary differences between income tax and financial reporting and principally relate to differences in the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts, using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which differences are expected to reverse.       54  Net Income (Loss) per Share 
   Basic earnings (loss) per share (“EPS”) are computed by dividing net earnings (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period.   Diluted EPS attributable to common shareholders is computed by adjusting net earnings by the weighted average number of common shares and potential common shares outstanding (if dilutive) during each period. Potential common shares include shares of restricted stock units as if the units issued by the Company were vested and convertible debt. The Company applied the treasury stock method to account for the dilutive impact of its restricted stock units and the if converted method for its convertible notes. Anti-dilutive securities are excluded from diluted EPS. As a result of determining the effect of potentially dilutive securities, in certain periods, diluted net loss per share is the same as the basic net loss per share for the periods presented.   Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements 
   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual amounts could differ from those estimates. The most significant estimates included in the preparation of the financial statements relate to: (i) deferred income tax accounts, (ii) coal reserves, (iii) depreciation, depletion, and amortization, (iv) estimates related to the Merom Acquisition, (v) estimates used in our impairment analysis and measurement of impairments, and (vi) estimates used in the calculation of our asset retirement obligations.   Long-term Contracts 
   As of  December 31, 2022, we are committed to supplying our customers up to a maximum of 14.8 million tons of coal through 2027 of which 10.8 million tons are priced.   For 2022, we derived 90% of our coal sales from five customers, each representing at least 10% of our coal sales. 86% of our coal operations accounts receivable was from four customers, each representing more than 10% of the  December 31, 2022 balance.  100% of our electric sales and accounts receivable were with one customer.   For 2021, we derived 95% of our coal sales from four customers, each representing at least 10% of our coal sales. 99% of our coal operations accounts receivable was from five customers, each representing more than 10% of the  December 31, 2021 balance.   For 2022, we derived 100% of our electric generation and capacity revenue from Hoosier.  As of   December 31, 2022,  we are committed to supply 100% of the plants energy and capacity to Hoosier through  May 31, 2023, reducing commitments to 22% of energy output and 32% of its capacity from  June 1, 2023 through  December 31, 2025.
   Stock-based Compensation 
   Stock-based compensation for restricted stock units is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the applicable vesting period of the stock award (generally two to four years) using the straight-line method.  (2)    LONG-LIVED ASSET IMPAIRMENTS
  Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of the assets  may not be recoverable.   Prosperity Mine 
   We recorded an impairment of $1.6 million as of  December 31, 2021 on assets consisting of the wash plant and rail facilities at the Prosperity Mine.  The wash plant was torn down and the remaining rail was pulled up in the fourth quarter of 2021.
  
 (3)  INVENTORY 
   Inventory is valued at lower of cost or net realizable value (NRV).  As of  December 31, 2022, and  December 31, 2021, coal inventory includes NRV adjustments of $4.9 million and $3.8 million, respectively.

Total other assets | $ | 7,585 | | $ | 8,372

 (5)  BANK DEBT 
   On  March 25, 2022, we executed an amendment to our credit agreement with PNC Bank, National Association (in its capacity as administrative agent, "PNC"), administrative agent for our lenders under our credit agreement.  The primary purpose of the amendment was to return the allowable leverage ratio and debt service coverage ratio to their  December 31, 2021 levels through  September 30, 2022, with the debt service coverage waived for  March 31, 2022.
   On  May 20, 2022, we executed an additional amendment to our credit agreement with PNC.  The primary purpose of this amendment was to modify the allowable leverage ratio and debt service coverage ratio through  June 30, 2022, to provide relief for current and anticipated covenant violations.   On  August 5, 2022, we executed an additional amendment to our credit agreement with PNC.  The primary purpose of this amendment was to modify the allowable leverage ratio and debt service coverage ratio through  September 30, 2022, to provide relief for anticipated covenant violations.   On  March 13, 2023, we executed an additional amendment to our credit agreement with PNC. The primary purpose of the amendment is to convert $35 million of the outstanding balance on the revolver into a new term loan with a maturity of  March 31, 2024 and extend the maturity date of the revolver to  May 31, 2024.  The amendment also reduced the total capacity under the revolver to $85 million and waives the maximum annual capital expenditure covenant for 2022 and increases the covenant for 2023 to $75 million.  Subsequent to  December 31, 2022, and prior to the effective date of this amendment, we had borrowed an additional $17.0 million under the revolver.   The interest rate per the amendment will transition from LIBOR to SOFR based pricing with ranges from SOFR plus 4.00% to SOFR plus 5.00%, depending on the Company’s leverage ratio. The Company expects the interest rate to be SOFR plus 4.00% for the majority of  2023.
   Bank debt was reduced by $26.5 million during the year ended  December 31, 2022.  Prior to the latest amendment, bank debt was comprised of term debt ($5.5 million as of  December 31, 2022) and a $120 million revolver ($79.7 million borrowed as of  December 31, 2022).  The term debt amortization was to conclude with the final payment in  March 2023.  The revolver was to mature in  September 2023. Under the provision of the latest amendment, bank debt is comprised of term debt ($40.5 million as of  December 31, 2022) and a $85 million revolver ($44.7 million borrowed as of  December 31, 2022). The term debt requires payment of $5.5 million in  March 2023 and $10 million each quarter thereafter in 2023 and $5.0 million by  March 31, 2024.  Our debt is recorded at amortized cost, which approximates fair value due to the variable interest rates in the agreement, and is collateralized primarily by our assets.   Liquidity 
   As of  December 31, 2022, we had additional borrowing capacity of $29.1 million under the revolver and total liquidity of $32.1 million.  Our additional borrowing capacity is net of $11.2 million in outstanding letters of credit as of  December 31, 2022 that were required to maintain surety bonds.  Liquidity consists of our additional borrowing capacity and cash and cash equivalents.   We entered new contracts during the three months ended  June 30, 2022, with significantly higher prices, that began shipping during the three months ended  September 30, 2022.  These contracts substantially increased our cash flow for the remainder of 2022 and 2023.
   Fees 
   Unamortized bank fees and other costs incurred in connection with the initial facility and subsequent amendments totaled $4.0 million as of  December 31, 2021. Additional costs incurred with the  March 25, 2022,  May 20, 2022, and  August 5, 2022 amendments totaled $2.1 million.  These costs were deferred and are being amortized over the term of the loan. Unamortized costs as of  December 31, 2022, and  December 31, 2021, were $2.5 million and $4.0 million, respectively.     56

Covenants 
   The credit facility includes a Maximum Leverage Ratio (consolidated funded debt / trailing twelve months adjusted EBITDA), calculated as of the end of each fiscal quarter for the trailing twelve months, not to exceed the amounts below:    
Fiscal Periods Ending | Ratio 
---------------------------------------------------+-------------
December 31, 2022 | 2.50 to 1.00
March 31, 2023, and each fiscal quarter thereafter | 2.25 to 1.00

    As of  December 31, 2022, our Leverage Ratio of 2.05 was in compliance with the requirements of the credit agreement.   Beginning  December 31, 2022, the credit facility requires a Minimum Debt Service Coverage Ratio (consolidated adjusted EBITDA/annual debt service) calculated as of the end of each fiscal quarter for the trailing 12 months of 1.25 to 1.00 through the maturity of the credit facility.   As of  December 31, 2022, our Debt Service Coverage Ratio of 1.49 was in compliance with the requirements of the credit agreement.   Interest Rate 
   The interest rate on the facility ranges from LIBOR plus 2.75% to LIBOR plus 4.00%, depending on our Leverage Ratio, with a LIBOR floor of 0.50%.  We entered into swap agreements to fix the LIBOR component of the interest rate at 2.92% on the declining term loan balance and on $52.7 million of the revolver.  The swap agreements matured in  May 2022.  On  December 31, 2022, we are paying LIBOR plus 4.0% on the outstanding bank debt.

   Paycheck Protection Program
    As previously reported in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on  April 16, 2020, we entered into a Paycheck Protection Program Promissory Note and Agreement on  April 15, 2020, evidencing an unsecured $10 million loan (the “PPP Loan”) under the Paycheck Protection Program (or “PPP”) made through First Financial Bank, N.A., (the "Lender"). The PPP was established under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) and is administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration (the “SBA”).       57
  
  Under the terms of the CARES Act, PPP loan recipients can apply for forgiveness. The SBA can grant forgiveness of all, or a portion of, loans made under the PPP if the recipients use the PPP loan proceeds for eligible purposes, including payroll costs, mortgage interest, rent or utility costs, and meet other requirements regarding, among other things, the maintenance of employment and compensation levels. The Company used the PPP Loan proceeds for qualifying expenses and applied for the forgiveness of the PPP Loan in accordance with the terms of the CARES Act.   On  July 23, 2021, we received a notification from the Lender that the SBA approved our PPP Loan forgiveness application for the entire PPP Loan balance of $10 million, together with interest accrued thereon. The Lender notified us that the forgiveness payment was received on  July 26, 2021.  The forgiveness of the PPP Loan is recognized as other income.   The SBA retains the right to review the Company's loan file for a period subsequent to the date the loan is forgiven, with the potential for the SBA to pursue legal remedies at its discretion.

 (7)   REVENUE 
   Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
   We account for a contract with a customer when the parties have approved the contract and are committed to performing their respective obligations, the rights of each party are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance, and it is probable substantially all of the consideration will be collected. We recognize revenue when we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring control of a good or service to a customer.   Coal operations
   Our coal revenue is derived from sales to customers of coal produced at our facilities. Our customers typically purchase coal directly from our mine sites or our rail facility in Princeton, Indiana, where the sale occurs and where title, risk of loss, and control pass to the customer at that point. Our customers arrange for and bear the costs of transporting their coal from our mines to their plants or other specified discharge points. Our customers are typically domestic utility companies. Our coal sales agreements with our customers are fixed-priced, fixed-volume supply contracts, or include a pre-determined escalation in price for each year. Price re-opener and index provisions  may allow either party to commence a renegotiation of the contract price at a pre-determined time. Price re-opener provisions  may automatically set a new price based on the prevailing market price or, in some instances, require us to negotiate a new price, sometimes within specified ranges of prices. The terms of our coal sales agreements result from competitive bidding and extensive negotiations with customers. Consequently, the terms of these contracts vary by customer.   Coal sales agreements will typically contain coal quality specifications. With coal quality specifications in place, the raw coal sold by us to the customer at the delivery point must be substantially free of magnetic material and other foreign material impurities and crushed to a maximum size as set forth in the respective coal sales agreement. Price adjustments are made and billed in the month the coal sale was recognized based on quality standards that are specified in the coal sales agreement, such as Btu factor, moisture, ash, and sulfur content, and can result in either increases or decreases in the value of the coal shipped.       58
  
  Electric operations
   The Company concluded that the definition of a contract and the criteria in ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ("ASC 606"), was met at the time the PPA was executed by the parties, as this is the point at which enforceable rights and obligations were established. Accordingly, the Company concluded that the PPA constitutes a valid contract under ASC 606.
   The Company will recognize revenue daily for the actual capacity made available as part of its stand-ready obligation to provide electricity for the contract capacity performance obligation and daily for the actual delivered electricity plus the amortization of the contract liability as a result of the APA with Hoosier, for the Delivered Energy performance obligation.   Disaggregation of Revenue 
   Revenue is disaggregated by primary geographic markets, as we believe this best depicts how the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of our revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors.   Coal operations
   74% and 73% of our coal revenue for the years ended  December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, was sold to customers in the State of Indiana with the remainder sold to customers in Florida, North Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama.   Electric operations
   100% of our electric revenue for the year ended  December 31, 2022 was sold to Hoosier in the State of Indiana.   Performance Obligations 
   Coal operations
   A performance obligation is a promise in a contract with a customer to provide distinct goods or services. Performance obligations are the unit of account for purposes of applying the revenue recognition standard and therefore determine when and how revenue is recognized. In most of our coal contracts, the customer contracts with us to provide coal that meets certain quality criteria. We consider each ton of coal a separate performance obligation and allocate the transaction price based on the base price per the contract, increased or decreased for quality adjustments.   We recognize revenue at a point in time as the customer does not have control over the asset at any point during the fulfillment of the contract. For substantially all of our customers, this is supported by the fact that title and risk of loss transfer to the customer upon loading of the truck or railcar at the mine. This is also the point at which physical possession of the coal transfers to the customer, as well as the right to receive substantially all benefits and the risk of loss in ownership of the coal.     We have remaining coal sales performance obligations relating to fixed priced contracts of approximately $593 million, which represent the average fixed prices on our committed contracts as of  December 31, 2022. We expect to recognize approximately 75% of this coal sales revenue in 2023, with the remainder recognized thereafter.   We have remaining performance obligations relating to coal sales contracts with price reopeners of approximately $166 million, which represents our estimate of the expected re-opener price on committed contracts as of  December 31, 2022. We expect to recognize all of this coal sales revenue beginning in 2024.
   The coal tons used to determine the remaining performance obligations are subject to adjustment in instances of force majeure and exercise of customer options to either take additional tons or reduce tonnage if such option exists in the customer contract.   Electric operations
   The Company concluded that each megawatt hour ("MWh") of delivered energy is capable of being distinct as a customer could benefit from each on its own by using/consuming it as a part of its operations.  The Company also concluded that the stand-ready obligation to be available to provide electricity to Hoosier is capable of being distinct as each unit of capacity provides an economic benefit to the holder and could be sold by Hoosier.       59
  
  Hallador shall sell, and Hoosier shall buy, at least 70% of the delivered energy quantities through 2025 at the contract price, which is $34.00 per MWh.   In addition to delivered energy, Hallador shall provide a stand-ready obligation to provide electricity, also known as contract capacity. The contract capacity that Hallador shall provide is 917 megawatts ("MW") for contract year 1, and 300 MW for contract years 2-4. Hoosier shall pay Hallador the capacity price of $5.80 per kilowatt month for the contract capacity.   Contract Balances 
   Under ASC 606, the timing of when a performance obligation is satisfied can affect the presentation of accounts receivable, contract assets, and contract liabilities. The main distinction between accounts receivable and contract assets is whether consideration is conditional on something other than the passage of time. A receivable is an entity’s right to consideration that is unconditional.   Under the typical payment terms of our contracts with customers, the customer pays us a base price for the coal, increased or decreased for any quality adjustments, electricity, or capacity. Amounts billed and due are recorded as trade accounts receivable and included in accounts receivable in our consolidated balance sheets. As of  January 1, 2021, accounts receivable for coal sales billed to customers was $12.8 million. We do not currently have any other contracts in place where we would transfer coal, electricity or capacity in advance of knowing the final price, and thus do not have any other contract assets recorded. Contract liabilities also arise when consideration is received in advance of performance.  (8)  INCOME TAXES

  Our effective tax rate ("ETR") for 2022 was 9% compared to (1%) for 2021. The tax rate for the years ended  December 31, 2022 and 2021 are not predictive of future tax rates. Our ETR differs from the statutory rate due to statutory depletion in excess of tax basis, PPP loan forgiveness, return to provision adjustments, and changes in the valuation allowance.  The deduction for statutory depletion does not necessarily change proportionately to changes in income before income taxes.   We recognize deferred tax assets to the extent that we believe that these assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making such a determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. Due to historical cumulative earnings over the prior 3 years as well as projected earnings  into the future, the Company believes that it is more likely than not that the benefit from certain federal and state deferred tax assets will be realized. As such, the Company has released a portion of its valuation allowance in the current year.  Due to federal NOL’s that are limited to 80% utilization to offset future federal tax liabilities reversing the Company continues to have a valuation against a portion of these NOL’s which it believes is not more likely than not to be realized.  In recognition of this, we have provided a valuation allowance of $3.7 million and $4.7 million on the deferred tax assets related to these NOL carryforwards as of  December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.   The federal NOLs generated in pre-2018 years and remaining of $40.3 million can offset 100% of future years' taxable income.  The federal NOLs generated in post 2017 years of $60.7 million can offset 80% of future years' taxable income.  The pre-2018 federal NOLs will expire in varying amounts from 2035 to 2037 if they are not utilized. Indiana NOLs have a 20-year carryforward period and will expire in the years 2034 to 2041 if they are not utilized.    We have analyzed our filing positions in all of the federal and state jurisdictions where we are required to file income tax returns, as well as all open tax years in these jurisdictions, to determine whether the positions will be more likely than not be sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are not recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. We identified our federal tax return and our Indiana state tax return as “major” tax jurisdictions. We believe that our income tax filing positions and deduction will be sustained on audit and do not anticipate any adjustments that will result in a material change to our consolidated financial position. While not material, we record any penalties and interest as general and administrative expense.   Tax returns filed with the IRS and state entities generally remain subject to examination for three years after filing.

      Of the amounts in the above table, $17.4 million and $15.2 million are recorded in operating expenses for 2022 and 2021, respectively with the remainder in general and administrative.   Our mine employees are also covered by workers’ compensation and such costs for 2022 and 2021, were approximately $4.9 million and $2.9 million, respectively, and are recorded in operating expenses. Workers’ compensation is a no-fault system by which individuals who sustain work-related injuries or occupational diseases are compensated. Benefits and coverage are mandated by each state which includes disability ratings, medical claims, rehabilitation services, and death and survivor benefits. We are partially self-insured for such claims, however, our operations are protected from these perils through stop-loss insurance policies. Our maximum annual exposure is limited to $1 million per occurrence with a $4 million aggregate deductible.  

 (11)  LEASES
   We have operating leases for office space and processing facilities with remaining lease terms ranging from less than one year to approximately five years. As most of the leases do not provide an implicit rate, we calculated the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities using our secured incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date. We currently do not have any finance leases outstanding.   Information related to leases was as follows as of  December 31 (in thousands):

 (14)  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
   We account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. We categorize each of our fair value measurements in one of these three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. These levels are:   Level 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities. We consider active markets as those in which transactions for the assets or liabilities occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. We have no Level 1 instruments.   Level 2: Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. We have no Level 2 instruments.   Level 3: Measured based on prices or valuation models that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and less observable from objective sources (i.e., supported by little or no market activity). Our Level 3 instruments are comprised of interest rate swaps and impairment measurements.  Although we utilize third-party broker quotes to assess the reasonableness of our prices and valuation, we do not have sufficient corroborating market evidence to support classifying these assets and liabilities as Level 2. The Company recorded an impairment during Q4 of 2021 which incorporates Level 3 non-recurring fair value measures as further discussed in Note 2.  Certain properties' asset retirement obligation liabilities use Level 3 non-recurring fair value measures as further discussed in Note 1. Lastly, Level 3 fair value measurements were also used in the determination of the fair values of assets acquired, liabilities assumed and considerations exchanged as part of the Merom Acquisition.   The following table summarizes our financial assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis at fair value at  December 31, 2022 and 2021 by respective level of the fair value hierarchy (in thousands):

 (15)  EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS 
   Sunrise Energy, LLC 
   We own a 50% interest in Sunrise Energy, LLC, which owns gas reserves and gathering equipment with plans to develop and operate such reserves. Sunrise Energy also plans to develop and explore for oil, gas, and coal-bed methane gas reserves on or near our underground coal reserves. The carrying value of the investment included in our consolidated balance sheets as of  December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $4.0 million and $3.5 million, respectively.     64 (16)  MEROM ACQUISITION
   On  February 14, 2022, Hallador Power signed an Asset Purchase Agreement (“APA”), with Hoosier, a rural electric membership corporation organized and existing under the laws of the state of Indiana.   Under the APA, Hallador acquired the Merom power plant, along with: equipment and machinery in the power plant; materials inventory; a coal purchase agreement; a coal combustion certified coal ash landfill, certain Generation Interconnection Agreements, and coal inventory (collectively, the “Acquired Assets”). Additionally, contemporaneous with entering into the APA, Hallador entered into three other agreements with Hoosier comprised of (1) a Power Purchase Agreement (the "PPA”), (2) a Coal Supply Purchase Agreement (the "Coal Purchase Agreement"), and (3) a Closing Side Letter agreeing to a reduction in future capacity payments of $15.0 million (“Capacity Payment Reduction”).  The purchase price for the Acquired Assets also consists of the assumption of the power plant’s closure and post-closure remediation, valued at approximately $7.2 million; no cash will be paid by Hallador to Hoosier to effectuate the APA other than payments totaling approximately $17.0 million for coal inventory on hand, with an initial payment of $5.4 million and subsequent periodic payments over time, subject to post-close adjustments based on actual on-site inventories. The acquisition closed on  October 21, 2022.
   The acquisition is being accounted for as an asset acquisition under ASC 805-50 as substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired are concentrated in a group of similar identifiable assets. As such, the total purchase consideration (which includes $2.9 million of transaction costs) are allocated to the assets acquired on a relative fair value basis.   The following table summarizes the final relative fair value allocation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and incurred as of the Merom acquisition date.

 (17)  CONVERTIBLE NOTES
   On  May 2, 2022, and  May 20, 2022, we issued senior unsecured convertible notes (the "Notes") to five parties, in the aggregate principal amount of $10 million, with $9 million being issued to related parties affiliated with independent members of our board of directors and the remainder to a non-affiliated party. The Notes were scheduled to mature on  December 29, 2028, and accrue interest at 8% per annum, with interest payable on the date of maturity. Pursuant to the terms of the Notes, the holders of the Notes  may convert the entire principal balance and all accrued and unpaid interest then outstanding during the period beginning  June 1, 2022, and ending on  May 31, 2027, into shares of the Company's common stock at a conversion price the greater of (i) $3.33 and (ii) the 30-day trailing volume-weighted average sales price for the common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market ending on and including the date on which this Note is converted. At any time on or after  June 1, 2025, the Company  may, at its option and upon 30 days' written notice provided to the holders, elect to redeem the Notes (in whole and not in part) and the holders shall be obligated to surrender the Notes, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the outstanding principal balance, together with any accrued but unpaid interest thereon to the redemption date. After receipt of such redemption notice from the Company, the holder  may, at its option, elect to convert the principal balance and accrued interest into the Company's common stock by giving written notice of such election to the Company no later than 5 days prior to the date fixed for redemption.   In  June 2022, the four holders of the $9 million related party Notes converted them into 1,965,841 shares of common stock of the Company and the one holder of the $1 million Note converted it into 231,697 shares of common stock pursuant to the terms of the notes and their related agreements.   On  July 29, 2022, we issued $5 million of a senior unsecured convertible note to a related party affiliated with an independent member of our board of directors.  The note carries an interest rate of 8% per annum with a maturity date of  December 29, 2028.  For the period  August 18, 2022 through  August 17, 2024, the holder has the option to convert the note into shares of the Company's common stock at a conversion price of $6.254.  Beginning  August 18, 2025, the Company  may elect to redeem the note and the holder shall be obligated to surrender the note at 100% of the outstanding principal balance together with any accrued unpaid interest.  Upon receipt of the redemption notice from the Company, the holder  may elect to convert the principal balance and accrued interest into the Company's common stock.   On  August 8, 2022, we issued $4 million of senior unsecured convertible notes to related parties affiliated with independent members of our board of directors.

  (18)  SEGMENTS OF BUSINESS
   At  December 31, 2022, our operations are divided into two primary reportable segments, the Coal Operations and Electric Operations segments.  The remainder of our operations, which are not significant enough on a stand-alone basis to warrant treatment as an operating segment, are presented as "Corporate and Other and Eliminations" and primarily are comprised of unallocated corporate costs and activities, including a 50% interest in Sunrise Energy, LLC, a private gas exploration company with operations in Indiana, which we account for using the equity method and our wholly-owned subsidiary Summit Terminal LLC, a logistics transport facility located on the Ohio River.
