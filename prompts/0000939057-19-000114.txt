General
 
Mid-Southern Bancorp, Inc., an Indiana corporation, is the savings and loan holding company of Mid-Southern Savings Bank, FSB (the "Bank" or "Mid-Southern Savings Bank"). On July 11, 2018, Mid-Southern Bancorp, Inc. completed a public offering and share exchange as part of the Bank's "second step" conversion from the mutual holding company structure and the elimination of Mid Southern M.H.C. (the "Conversion"). Upon consummation of the Conversion, the Company became the holding company for the Bank and now owns all of the issued and outstanding shares of the Bank's common stock. Concurrent with the offering, shares of Bank common stock owned by public stockholders were exchanged for 2.3462 shares of the Company's common stock, with cash being paid in lieu of issuing fractional shares.  All share and per share information in this report for periods prior to the Conversion has been adjusted to reflect the 2.3462:1 exchange ratio on publicly traded shares. See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this report for more information.
 
At December 31, 2018, the Company had total assets of $200.7 million, total deposits of $151.1 million and stockholders' equity of $48.8 million.

Lending Activities
 
General. Our historical principal lending activity has been originating one- to four-family residential real estate loans and, to a lesser extent, commercial real estate loans, commercial business loans, home equity lines of credit, construction and consumer loans. More recently, we have sought to increase our commercial real estate and commercial construction and commercial business lending in an effort to diversify our overall loan portfolio, increase the overall yield earned on our loans and assist in managing interest rate risk.
 
Our strategic plan continues to focus on residential real estate lending and to gradually increase our commercial lending. We generally retain in our portfolio all loans we originate.   We focus primarily on commercial real estate loans, commercial construction loans and on commercial business loans in our market area. As part of the commercial loan strategy, we seek to use our commercial relationships to grow our commercial transactional deposit accounts.

Largest Borrowing Relationships.   At December 31, 2018, the maximum amount under federal law that we could lend to any one borrower and the borrower's related entities was approximately $5.9 million.  Of our five largest borrowing relationships, three are primarily business relationships and two relationships have credit extended to both the individual borrower and their businesses. Our five largest relationships totaled $9.7 million in the aggregate, or 7.6% of our $127.8 million total loan portfolio, at December 31, 2018. The largest relationship at December 31, 2018 consisted of a $1.9 million in loans to a business collateralized by commercial real estate. Unfunded loan commitments to this relationship totaled $500,000. The next four largest lending relationships at December 31, 2018, were $2.3 million in loans to commonly owned businesses, collateralized by non-owner occupied one-to-four family residential property and commercial real estate; $1.8 million in loans to commonly owned businesses and individuals collateralized by one-to-four family residential property and commercial real estate with unfunded loan commitments to this relationship totaling $307,000; $2.0 million in loans to commonly owned businesses and individuals collateralized by commercial real estate with  unfunded loan commitments to this relationship totaling $34,000; and $1.8 million to commonly owned businesses collateralized by multi-family residential real estate. As of December 31, 2018, all of these loans were performing in accordance with their repayment terms.  At December 31, 2018, we had four other lending relationships that met or exceeded $1.6 million.  All of the loans in these four lending relationships were performing in accordance with their repayment terms as of December 31, 2018.
One- to Four-Family Real Estate Lending.  Our primary lending activity consists of the origination of loans secured by first mortgages on one- to four-family residences, substantially all of which are secured by property located in our geographic lending area.  We originate primarily adjustable-rate loans.
 
Most of our loans are written using generally accepted underwriting guidelines.  The one to four family loans we originate are generally retained in our portfolio.   Our pricing strategy for mortgage loans includes establishing interest rates that are competitive with other local financial institutions and consistent with our internal asset and liability management objectives.  During the year ended December 31, 2018, we originated $14.7 million and $323,000 of one- to four-family adjustable rate mortgage ("ARM") and fixed-rate mortgage loans, respectively. At December 31, 2018, one- to four-family residential mortgage loans totaled $80.3 million, or 62.9%, of our total loan portfolio, of which $74.9 million were ARM loans and $5.4 million, were fixed-rate loans.
 
Historically we have not sold loans on the secondary mortgage market as a large portion of the one- to four-family residential mortgage loans we originate consist of loans that would be considered "non-conforming" as it relates to the ability to sell to Fannie Mae or other secondary market purchasers.  Some of these loans are also originated to meet the needs of borrowers who cannot otherwise satisfy Fannie Mae credit requirements because of personal and financial reasons (i.e., divorce, bankruptcy, length of time employed, etc.), and other aspects, which do not conform to Fannie Mae's guidelines.  Such borrowers may have higher debt-to-income ratios, or the loans are secured by unique properties in rural markets for which there are no sales of comparable properties to support the value according to secondary market requirements.  We may require additional collateral or lower loan-to-value ratios to reduce the risk of these loans.  We believe that these loans satisfy a need in our market area.  As a result, subject to market conditions, we intend to continue to originate these types of loans. We have recently entered into an agreement with FHLB to begin selling loans under their MPP program.  We anticipate this to begin no earlier than second quarter of 2019.  We do not believe this program will materially change our existing balance sheet but offering this product will assist us in expanding our customer base in our existing markets.
 
We generally underwrite our one- to four-family loans based on the applicant's employment and credit history and the appraised value of the subject property.  We generally lend up to 80% of the lesser of the appraised value or purchase price for one- to four-family first mortgage loans and non-owner occupied first mortgage loans.  At December 31, 2018 we had $14.8 million of non-owner occupied first mortgage loans.  Properties securing our one- to four-family loans are generally appraised by independent fee appraisers who are selected in accordance with criteria approved by the board of directors.  It is Mid-Southern Savings Bank's policy to require title insurance policies on all mortgage real estate loans originated in the amount of $500,000 or more.  Homeowners, liability, fire and, if required, flood insurance policies are also required for one-to four-family loans. Our real estate loans generally contain a "due on sale" clause allowing us to declare the unpaid principal balance due and payable upon the sale of the security property.  The average size of our one- to four-family residential loans was approximately $78,000 at December 31, 2018.
 
 9 


Fixed-rate loans secured by one- to four-family residences have contractual maturities of up to 30 years, however, at December 31, 2018 we had no one- to four-family loans with an original contractual maturity in excess of 30 years.
 
ARM loans are offered with an initial fixed rate for five or seven years.  Adjustments and life-time rate caps that vary based on the product, generally with a maximum annual rate change of 2.25% and a maximum overall rate change of 6.00%.  We generally use the rate on the five-year Treasury Bills to re-price our ARM loans, however, as a consequence of using caps, the interest rates on ARM loans may not be as rate sensitive as our cost of funds. Furthermore, because loan indexes may not respond perfectly to changes in market interest rates, upward adjustments on loans may occur more slowly than increases in our cost of interest-bearing liabilities, especially during periods of rapidly increasing interest rates.  Because of these characteristics, yields on ARM loans may not be sufficient to offset increases in our cost of funds.
 
Included in our one- to four-family loans are manufactured home loans that are considered a permanent dwelling. We originate new and used manufactured home loans to borrowers who intend to use the home as a primary residence.  Our weighted average yield on manufactured home loans at December 31, 2018 was 4.90%, compared to 4.76% for one- to four-family mortgages.  At December 31, 2018, these loans totaled $8.1 million, or 6.4% of our total loan portfolio.  We underwrite these loans based on our review of creditworthiness of the borrower, including credit scores, and the value of the collateral, for which we hold a security interest under Indiana law.
 
Manufactured home loans are higher risk than loans secured by residential real property, though this risk is reduced if the owner also owns the land on which the home is located.  A small portion of our manufactured home loans involve properties on which we also have financed the land for the owner.  The primary additional risk in manufactured home loans is the difficulty in obtaining adequate value for the collateral due to the cost and limited ability to move the collateral.  In addition to the cost of moving a manufactured home, it is difficult for these borrowers to find a new location for their home.  First-time homebuyers of manufactured homes tend to be a higher credit risk than first-time homebuyers of single family residences, due to more limited financial resources.  We attempt to work out delinquent loans with the borrower and, if that is not successful, any repossessed manufactured homes are repossessed and sold.  At December 31, 2018, there was $147,000 in nonperforming manufactured home loans and no manufactured home properties in our other real estate owned ("OREO") or repossessed assets portfolio.
 
Home Equity Lending.  We originate home equity loans that consist of variable-rate lines of credit. We do not originate fixed-rate home equity loans. We originate home equity loans in amounts of up to 80% of the value of the collateral, minus any senior liens on the property. Home equity lines of credit are typically originated with an adjustable rate of interest, based on the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate plus a margin.  Home equity lines of credit generally have up to a ten year draw period, during which time the funds may be paid down and redrawn up to the committed amount.  Once the draw period has lapsed, the home equity line of credit matures with all moneys owed being due and payable.  At December 31, 2018, home equity lines of credit totaled $4.3 million, or 3.4% of our total loan portfolio. At December 31, 2018, unfunded commitments on these lines of credit totaled $3.8 million.
 
Commercial and Multifamily Real Estate Lending.  We offer a variety of commercial and multifamily loans.  Most of these loans are secured by commercial income producing properties, including retail centers, multifamily apartment buildings, warehouses, and office buildings located in our market area.  At December 31, 2018, commercial and multifamily loans totaled $34.2 million, or 26.8% of our total loan portfolio.
 
Our loans secured by commercial and multifamily real estate are generally originated with a variable interest rate, fixed for a five, seven or ten-year term and a 20-year amortization period.  At the end of the initial term, there is a balloon payment or the loan re-prices every one to five years during the remaining term based on an independent index matching the ongoing repricing term plus a margin of 1% to 4%.  Loan-to-value ratios on our commercial and multifamily loans typically do not exceed 80% of the lower of cost or appraised value of the property securing the loan at origination.
 
Loans secured by commercial and multifamily real estate are generally underwritten based on the net operating income of the property, global cash flow of the borrower, quality and location of the real estate, the credit history and financial strength of the borrower and the quality of management involved with the property.  The net operating income or global cash flow of the borrower must be sufficient to cover the payments related to the 
 
 10 

outstanding debt plus an additional coverage requirement.  We generally impose a minimum debt coverage ratio of approximately 1.2x for the borrower or 1.35x global cash flow.  The global cash flow takes into consideration the living expenses of the persons involved in the request and tax obligations.  For originated loans secured by income producing commercial properties, if the borrower is other than an individual, we generally require the personal guaranty of the borrower. We also generally require an assignment of rents or leases in order to be assured that the cash flow from the project will be used to repay the debt.  Appraisals on properties securing commercial and multifamily loans are performed by independent state certified or licensed fee appraisers and approved by the board Loan Committee. In order to monitor the adequacy of cash flows on income-producing properties, the borrower is required to provide, at a minimum, annual financial information.  From time to time we also acquire participation interests in commercial and multifamily loans originated by other financial institutions secured by properties located in our market area or in the general proximity of our market area.  During 2018 we did not purchase any commercial or multifamily loan participations. 
 
Historically, loans secured by commercial and multifamily properties generally involve different credit risks than one- to four-family properties, including because they cannot be sold as easily on the secondary market.  These loans typically involve larger balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers.  Because payments on loans secured by commercial and multifamily properties are often dependent on the successful operation or management of the properties, repayment of these loans may be subject to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy.  If the cash flow from the project is reduced, or if leases are not obtained or renewed, the borrower's ability to repay the loan may be impaired.  Commercial and multifamily loans also expose a lender to greater credit risk than loans secured by one-to four-family because the collateral securing these loans typically cannot be sold as easily as one-to four-family.  In addition, some of our commercial and multifamily loans are not fully amortizing and contain large balloon payments upon maturity.  Balloon payments may require the borrower to either sell or refinance the underlying property in order to make the payment, which may increase the risk of default or non-payment.  Our largest single commercial and multifamily borrowing relationship at December 31, 2018, totaled $2.4 million and is collateralized by two commercial real estate properties.  At December 31, 2018, these loans were performing in accordance with their repayment terms.
 
Construction Lending.  We originate construction loans secured by single-family residences and commercial and multifamily real estate.  We also originate land and lot loans, which are secured by raw land or developed lots on which the borrower intends to build a residence, and land acquisition and development loans.  At December 31, 2018, our construction loans totaled $5.1 million, or 4.0% of our total loan portfolio.  At December 31, 2018, unfunded construction loan commitments totaled $2.1 million.
 
We originate construction loans to individuals and contractors for the construction and acquisition of personal residences whether or not the collateral property underlying the loan is under contract for sale.  At December 31, 2018, construction loans to contractors for homes that were not pre-sold totaled $661,000 and are classified as commercial real estate construction loans.
 
Our residential construction loans generally provide for the payment of interest only during the construction phase, which is typically up to twelve months.  We typically convert construction loans to individuals to permanent loans on completion of construction but if Mid-Southern Savings Bank does not intend to provide the permanent financing we require a take-out financing commitment prior to origination. At the end of the construction phase, the construction loan generally either converts to a longer-term mortgage loan or is paid off through a permanent loan from another lender.  Residential construction loans are made up to the lesser of a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 90% of cost or 80% of appraised value at completion.
 
At December 31, 2018, we had no outstanding residential construction mortgage loans to individuals.   Before making a commitment to fund a residential construction loan, we require an appraisal of the subject property by an independent licensed appraiser.  During the construction phase, we make periodic inspections of the construction site and loan proceeds are disbursed directly to the contractors or borrowers as construction progresses. Typically, disbursements are made in monthly draws during the construction period. Loan proceeds are disbursed after inspection based on the percentage of completion method. We also require general liability, builder's risk hazard insurance, title insurance (loans in excess of $500,000), and flood insurance (as applicable, for properties located or to be built in a designated flood hazard area) on all construction loans.
 
 11 

We also originate developed lot and land loans to individuals intending to construct in the future a residence on the property.  We will generally originate these loans in an amount up to 80% of the lower of the purchase price or appraisal.  These lot and land loans are secured by a first lien on the property and have a fixed rate of interest with an initial term of five years of less and a maximum amortization of 20 years. At December 31, 2018, we had no lot and land loans.
 
We make land acquisition and development loans to experienced home builders or residential lot developers in our market area.  The maximum loan-to-value limit applicable to these loans is generally 80% of the appraised market value upon completion of the project.  We do not require any cash equity from the borrower if there is sufficient equity in the land being used as collateral.  Development plans are required from developers prior to making the loan.  Our loan officers are required to personally visit the proposed site of the development.  We require that developers maintain adequate insurance coverage.  Land acquisition and development loans generally are originated with a loan term up to 24 months, have adjustable rates of interest based on the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate and require interest only payments during the term of the loan.  Development loan proceeds are disbursed periodically in increments as construction progresses and as inspection by our approved inspectors warrant.  We also require these loans to be paid on an accelerated basis as the lots are sold, so that we are repaid before all the lots are sold.  At December 31, 2018, we had $2.3 million in land acquisition and development loans within our commercial real estate and construction loan portfolios.  At December 31, 2018, our largest land acquisition and development relationship consisted of six loans totaling $866,000, secured by single family residential lots located in our market area.  At December 31, 2018, this loan relationship was performing in accordance with its repayment terms. At December 31, 2018, unfunded loan commitments related to land acquisition and development totaled $993,000.
 
We also offer commercial and multifamily construction loans.  These loans are underwritten with construction financing for up to 12 months under terms similar to our residential construction loans.  On completion of the construction period the loan by its terms converts to a permanent commercial real estate loans with terms similar to our other permanent commercial and multifamily real estate loans. At December 31, 2018, we had $5.1 million in commercial and multifamily construction loans.
 
Construction and land financing is generally considered to involve a higher degree of credit risk than longer-term financing on improved, owner-occupied real estate.  Risk of loss on a construction loan depends largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the value of the property at completion of construction compared to the estimated cost (including interest) of construction and other assumptions.  If the estimate of construction costs is inaccurate, we may be required to advance funds beyond the amount originally committed in order to protect the value of the property and may have to hold the property for an indeterminate period of time.  Additionally, if the estimate of value is inaccurate, we may be confronted with a project that, when completed, has a value that is insufficient to generate full payment. Land loans also pose additional risk because of the lack of income being produced by the property and the potential illiquid nature of the collateral.  The value of the lots securing our loans may be affected by the success of the development in which they are located.  As a result, construction loans and land loans often involve the disbursement of funds with repayment dependent, in part, on the success of the ultimate project and the ability of the borrower to sell or lease the property or refinance the indebtedness, rather than the ability of the borrower or guarantor to repay principal and interest.  The nature of these loans is also such that they are generally more difficult to monitor.  In addition, speculative construction loans to a builder are often associated with homes that are not pre-sold, and thus pose a greater potential risk than construction loans to individuals on their personal residences.
 
Consumer Lending.  We offer a variety of secured consumer loans, including new and used manufactured homes, automobiles, boats and recreational vehicle loans, and loans secured by savings deposits.  We also offer unsecured consumer loans.  We originate our consumer loans primarily in our market area.  All of our consumer loans are originated on a direct basis.
 
We make loans on new and used automobiles.  Our automobile loan portfolio totaled $902,000 at December 31, 2018, or 41.0% of our consumer loan portfolio and 0.7% of our total loan portfolio.  Automobile loans may be written for a term of up to 72 months and have fixed rates of interest.  Loan-to-value ratios are generally up to 100% of the purchase price for qualified borrowers if the Fair Isaac and Company, Incorporated ("FICO"), credit score is 700 or greater of either the borrower or co-borrower and the debt to income ratio is 35% or 
 
 12 

less. Borrowers who do not meet these criteria but still qualify in accordance with our underwriting guidelines may borrow up to 80% of the purchase price.   We follow our internal underwriting guidelines in evaluating automobile loans, including credit scoring, verification of employment, reviewing debt to income ratios and valuation of the underlying collateral.
 
Our consumer loans also include loans secured by new and used manufactured homes not considered permanent dwellings, new and used boats, motorcycles and recreational vehicles, loans secured by deposits and unsecured personal loans, all of which, at December 31, 2018, totaled $1.3 million or 59.0% of our consumer loan portfolio and 1.0% of our total loan portfolio.  These loans typically have terms from five to ten years depending on the collateral and loan-to-value ratios up to 80% and have either fixed or adjustable interest rates.
 
Our unsecured consumer loans have either a fixed rate of interest generally for a maximum term of 36 months, or are revolving lines of credit of generally up to $25,000.  At December 31, 2018 there were no outstanding loans or unfunded commitments for unsecured consumer lines of credit.
 
Consumer loans (other than our manufactured homes) generally have shorter terms to maturity, which reduces our exposure to changes in interest rates.  In addition, management believes that offering consumer loan products helps to expand and create stronger ties to our existing customer base by increasing the number of customer relationships and providing cross-marketing opportunities.
 
Consumer loans generally entail greater risk than do one- to four-family residential mortgage loans, particularly in the case of consumer loans that are secured by rapidly depreciable assets, such as manufactured homes, automobiles, boats and recreational vehicles.  In these cases, any repossessed collateral for a defaulted loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance.  As a result, consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower's continuing financial stability and, thus, are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy.
 
Commercial Business Lending.  At December 31, 2018, commercial business loans totaled $5.9 million, or 4.6% of our total loan portfolio.  Substantially all of our commercial business loans have been to borrowers in our market area.  Our commercial business lending activities encompass loans with a variety of purposes and security, including loans to finance commercial vehicles and equipment.  Approximately $1.1 million of our commercial business loans at December 31, 2018 were unsecured.  Our commercial business lending policy includes credit file documentation and analysis of the borrower's background, capacity to repay the loan, the adequacy of the borrower's capital and collateral, as well as an evaluation of other conditions affecting the borrower.  Analysis of the borrower's past, present and future cash flows is also an important aspect of our credit analysis.  We generally require personal guarantees on both our secured and unsecured commercial business loans.  Nonetheless, commercial business loans are believed to carry higher credit risk than residential mortgage loans.
 
Our interest rates on commercial business loans are dependent on the type of lending.  Our secured commercial business loans typically have a loan to value ratio of up to 80% and are term loans ranging from three to five years.  Secured commercial business term loans generally have a fixed rated based on the average yield of the U.S. Treasury with a term similar to that of the length of the fixed rate commitment on the note.  In addition, we typically charge loan fees of 1/2% to 2% of the principal amount at origination, depending on the credit quality and account relationships of the borrower.  Business lines of credit are usually adjustable-rate and are based on the prime rate as reported in the Wall Street Journal plus 0% to 3%, and are generally originated with both a floor and ceiling to the interest rate.  Our business lines of credit have terms ranging from 12 months to 24 months and provide for interest-only monthly payments during the term.
 
Our commercial business loans are primarily made based on the cash flow of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower.  The borrowers' cash flow may be unpredictable, and collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value.  Most often, this collateral is accounts receivable, inventory, equipment or real estate.  In the case of loans secured by accounts receivable, the availability of funds for the repayment of these loans may be substantially dependent on the ability of the borrower to collect amounts due from its customers.  Other collateral securing loans may depreciate over time, may be difficult to appraise, may be illiquid and may fluctuate in value based on the specific type of business and equipment used.  As a result, the availability of 
 
 13 

funds for the repayment of commercial business loans may be substantially dependent on the success of the business itself (which, in turn, is often dependent in part upon general economic conditions).
 
Lending Authority.  Both our President and Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and Executive Vice President and Senior Loan Officer may individually approve unsecured loans up to $100,000 and all types of secured loans up to $200,000.   The Lending Group (defined as President and CEO, Senior Loan Officer and Chief Credit Officer) may approve unsecured loans up to $150,000 and all types of secured loans up to $1.0 million.  The Chief Credit Officer position was filled in August 2018.  The Director's Loan Committee approves unsecured loans up to $500,000 and secured loans up to $2.0 million.  Any loans over the Director's Loan Committee limit must be approved by the full board of directors.  All loan policy exceptions must be approved by the Director's Loan Committee, the CEO or the Senior Loan Officer up to the committee's, CEO's or Senior Loan Officer's lending authority.  All policy exception loans of $10,000 or more must be reported to the board of directors within 45 days.
Loan Originations, Purchases, Sales, Repayments and Servicing
 
We originate both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans.  Our ability to originate loans, however, is dependent upon customer demand for loans in our market area.  Over the past few years, we have continued to originate residential and consumer loans, and increased our emphasis on commercial and multifamily, construction and land, and commercial business lending.  Demand is affected by competition and the interest rate environment.  During the past few years, we, like many other financial institutions, have experienced significant prepayments on loans due to the low interest rate environment prevailing in the United States.  During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we did not acquire any loans.  We underwrite participations to the same standards as an internally-originated loan.
 
In addition to interest earned on loans and loan origination fees, we receive fees for loan commitments, late payments and other miscellaneous services.
 
Asset Quality
 
When a borrower fails to make a required payment on a one-to four-family loan, we attempt to cure the delinquency by contacting the borrower.  In the case of loans secured by a one-to four-family property, a late notice typically is sent 15 days after the due date, and the borrower is contacted by phone within 30 days after the due date.  Generally, a delinquency letter is mailed to the borrower.  All delinquent accounts are reviewed by a loan account executive or branch manager who attempts to cure the delinquency by contacting the borrower once the loan is 30 days past due.  If the account becomes 90 days delinquent and an acceptable repayment plan has not been agreed upon, we generally refer the account to legal counsel with instructions to prepare a notice of intent to foreclose.
 
Delinquent consumer loans, as well as delinquent home equity loans and lines of credit, are handled in a similar manner to one-to four-family loans, except that appropriate action may be taken to collect any loan payment that is delinquent for more than 15 days.  Once the loan is 90 days past due, it is classified as nonaccrual.  Generally, credits are charged-off at 120 days past due.  Our procedures for repossession and sale of consumer collateral are subject to various requirements under the applicable consumer protection laws as well as other applicable laws and the determination by us that it would be beneficial from a cost basis.
 
Delinquent loans are initially handled by the loan officer in charge of the loan, who is responsible for contacting the borrower.  In addition, management meets weekly and reviews past due and classified loans, as well as other loans that management feels may present possible collection problems, which are reported to the board on a monthly basis.  If an acceptable workout of a delinquent loan cannot be agreed upon, we generally initiate foreclosure or repossession proceedings on any collateral securing the loan.

Delinquent Loans.
 Nonperforming Assets.  The table below sets forth the amounts and categories of nonperforming assets in our loan portfolio.  Loans are placed on nonaccrual status when the collection of principal and/or interest become doubtful or when the loan is more than 90 days past due.  Foreclosed assets include assets acquired in settlement of loans.  We had no accruing loans 90 days or more delinquent for the periods reported.

For the year ended December 31, 2018, total interest income that would have been recorded had the nonaccrual loans been current in accordance with their original terms amounted to $31,000, all of which was excluded in interest income for the year ended December 31, 2018.
 
See Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Financial Condition at December 31, 2018 Compared to December 31, 2017 – Delinquencies and Nonperforming Assets" for more information on troubled assets.
 
Troubled Debt Restructured Loans.  Troubled debt restructurings, which are accounted for under Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 310-40, are loans which have renegotiated loan terms to assist borrowers who are unable to meet the original terms of their loans.  Such modifications to loan terms may include a lower interest rate, a reduction in principal, or a longer term to maturity.  All troubled debt restructurings are initially classified as impaired, regardless of whether the loan was performing at the time it was restructured.  Once a troubled debt restructuring has performed according to its modified terms for six months and the collection of principal and interest under the revised terms is deemed probable, we remove the troubled debt restructuring from nonperforming status.  At December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had $1.8 million and $1.9 million, respectively, of loans that were classified as troubled debt restructurings and still on accrual. Included in nonperforming loans at December 31, 2018 and 2017 were troubled debt restructured loans of $159,000 and $220,000 respectively.
Foreclosed Assets.   We owned no real estate owned or other repossessed assets at December 31, 2018.
 
Other Loans of Concern.   In addition to the nonperforming assets set forth in the table above, as of December 31, 2018, there were 21 loans totaling $2.0 million with respect to which known information about the possible credit problems of the borrowers have caused management to have doubts as to the ability of the borrowers to comply with present loan repayment terms and which may result in the future inclusion of such items in the nonperforming asset categories.  These loans have been considered individually in management's determination of our allowance for loan losses.  The largest loan relationship of concern at December 31, 2018, totaled $766,000 and was secured by single family residential and farm ground property located in Washington County, Indiana.  The remaining loans of concern consist of $397,000 in residential first mortgages, $347,000 in commercial real estate loans and $465,000 in commercial business loans. Loans of concern had specific loan loss reserves of $56,000 at December 31, 2018.
 
Classified Assets.  Federal regulations provide for the classification of loans and other assets, such as debt and equity securities considered by the OCC to be of lesser quality, as "substandard," "doubtful" or "loss."  An asset is considered "substandard" if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any.  "Substandard" assets include those characterized by the "distinct possibility" that the insured institution will sustain "some loss" if the deficiencies are not corrected.  Assets classified as "doubtful" have all of the weaknesses in those classified "substandard," with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make "collection or liquidation in full," on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values, "highly questionable and improbable."  Assets classified as "loss" are those considered "uncollectible" and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted.  Assets which do not currently expose Mid-Southern Savings Bank to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories but possess weaknesses are required to be designated as special mention.
 
When we classify problem assets as either substandard or doubtful, we may establish specific allowance for loan losses in an amount deemed prudent by management.  Our determination as to the classification of our assets and the amount of our valuation allowances is subject to review by the OCC and the FDIC, which may order the establishment of additional general or specific loss allowances.
 
We regularly review the problem assets in our portfolio to determine whether any assets require classification in accordance with applicable regulations.  On the basis of management's review of our assets, at December 31, 2018, we had classified $3.3 million of our assets as substandard, which represented a variety of outstanding loans.  Classified assets totaled $3.3 million, or 6.8% of our equity capital and 1.6% of our assets at 
 
 16 

December 31, 2018 and $4.9 million, or 20.3% of our equity capital and 2.8% of our assets at December 31, 2017.  We had no assets classified as special mention at December 31, 2018 compared to $50,000 at December 31, 2017.
 
Allowance for Loan Losses.  We maintain an allowance for loan losses to absorb probable loan losses in the loan portfolio.  The allowance is based on ongoing, monthly assessments of the estimated probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio.  In evaluating the level of the allowance for loan losses, management considers the types of loans and the amount of loans in the loan portfolio, peer group information, historical loss experience, adverse situations that may affect the borrower's ability to repay, estimated value of any underlying collateral, and prevailing economic conditions.  Large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans, such as one-to four-family, small commercial and multifamily, home equity and consumer loans, are evaluated in the aggregate using historical loss factors and peer group data adjusted for current economic conditions.
 
At December 31, 2018 and 2017, our allowance for loan losses was $1.5 million and $1.7 million, or 1.2% and 1.5% of our total loan portfolio, respectively.  Specific valuation reserves totaled $100,000 and $142,000 at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
 
Assessing the allowance for loan losses is inherently subjective as it requires making material estimates, including the amount and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans that may be susceptible to significant change.  In the opinion of management, the allowance, when taken as a whole, properly reflects estimated probable loan losses in our loan portfolio.  See Notes 1 and 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

The following table sets forth an analysis of our allowance for loan losses at the dates indicated:

Allowance as a percentage of nonperforming loans | | 116.1 | % | | | 91.7 | %
Allowance as a percentage of total loans (end of period) | | 1.2 | % | | | 1.5 | %

 
The increase in our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans between the years was primarily a result of the decreases in nonperforming loans and net charge-offs partially offset by the recapture of the provision for loan losses in 2018.  Nonperforming loans decreased to $1.3 million at December 31, 2018 from $1.9 million at December 31, 2017.  The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was 1.2% and 1.5% as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Investment Activities
 
Federal savings banks have the authority to invest in various types of liquid assets, including United States Treasury obligations, securities of various federal agencies, including callable agency securities, certain certificates of deposit of insured banks and savings institutions, certain bankers' acceptances, repurchase agreements and federal funds.  Subject to various restrictions, federal savings banks may also invest their assets in investment grade commercial paper and corporate debt securities and mutual funds whose assets conform to the investments that the institution is otherwise authorized to make directly.
 
Specific investment strategies are formulated by the ALCO committee.  The ALCO committee is composed of Mid-Southern Savings Bank's executive management team. The board of directors will review and approve these investment strategies and then can delegate the authority to execute to ALCO.  In addition to authorizing and approving the investment policy, the board of directors has the responsibility for the approval of strategies and for monitoring the investment portfolio of Mid-Southern Savings Bank. Investment activities will be conducted in accordance with Mid-Southern Savings Bank's policy and consistent with Mid-Southern Savings Bank's asset/liability management policy. The board of directors has the ultimate responsibility for establishing policy and monitoring management's compliance with the policy.  The President is responsible for all investment executions in the portfolio. Mid-Southern Savings Bank retains the services of an investment advisor to provide advice to and consult with the board and ALCO on various investment strategies.
 
The ALCO committee considers various factors when making strategic recommendations to the board of directors including the marketability, maturity and tax consequences of the proposed investment.  The maturity structure of investments will be affected by various market conditions, including the current and anticipated slope of the yield curve, the level of interest rates, the trend of new deposit inflows, and the anticipated demand for funds via deposit withdrawals and loan originations and purchases.
 
The general objectives of our investment portfolio will be to provide liquidity when loan demand is high, to assist in maintaining earnings when loan demand is low and to maximize earnings while satisfactorily managing risk, including credit risk, reinvestment risk, liquidity risk and interest rate risk.  Our investment quality will emphasize safer investments with the yield on those investments secondary to not taking unnecessary risk with the available funds.  See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Asset/Liability Management."
 
As a condition of membership at the FHLB, we are required to purchase and hold a certain amount of FHLB stock.  At December 31, 2018, we owned $778,000 in FHLB stock. Our stock purchase requirement is based, in part, upon the outstanding principal balance of advances from the FHLB.  Our FHLB stock has a par value of $100, and is carried at cost.
 
The composition of our investment securities portfolio at December 31, 2018, excluding FHLB stock, is as follows:  Federal agency mortgage-backed securities with an amortized cost of $24.7 million and a fair value of $24.4 million and municipal bonds with an amortized cost of $28.7 million and a fair value of $28.7 million.
 
We review investment securities on an ongoing basis for the presence of other-than-temporary impairment  ("OTTI") taking into consideration current market conditions, fair value in relationship to cost, extent and nature of the change in fair value, issuer rating changes and trends, whether we intend to sell a security or if it is likely that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of our amortized cost basis of the investment, which may be maturity, and other factors.  For debt securities, if we intend to sell the security or it is likely that we will be required to sell the security before recovering its cost basis, the entire impairment loss would be recognized in earnings as an OTTI.  If we do not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security but we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security, only the portion of the impairment loss representing credit losses would be recognized in earnings.  The credit loss on a security is measured as the difference between the amortized cost basis and the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected.
 

 20 

    Projected cash flows are discounted by the original or current effective interest rate depending on the nature of the security being measured for potential OTTI.  The remaining impairment related to all other factors, the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the fair value, is recognized as a charge to other comprehensive income.  Impairment losses related to all other factors are presented as separate categories within other comprehensive income.
 At December 31, 2018, we held no investment securities for which declines in value are considered other-than-temporary.  We do not intend to sell these securities and it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell the securities before anticipated recovery of the remaining amortized cost basis.  We closely monitor our investment securities for changes in credit risk. If market conditions deteriorate and we determine our holdings of these or other investment securities are OTTI, our future earnings, stockholders' equity, regulatory capital and continuing operations could be materially adversely affected.
 
The following table sets forth the composition of our securities portfolio and other investments at the dates indicated.  At December 31, 2018, our securities portfolio did not contain securities of any issuer with an aggregate carrying value in excess of 10% of our equity capital, excluding those issued by the United States Government or its agencies.

Maturity of Securities
 
The composition and contractual maturities of our investment portfolio at December 31, 2018, excluding Federal Home Loan Bank stock, are indicated in the following table. Weighted average yields on tax exempt securities are presented on a tax-equivalent basis using a federal marginal tax rate of 21%. Certain mortgage-backed securities, including collateralized mortgage obligations, have adjustable interest rates and will reprice annually within the various maturity ranges. These repricing schedules are not reflected in the table below.

Sources of Funds
 
General.  Our sources of funds are primarily deposits, borrowings, payments of principal and interest on loans and funds provided from operations.
 
Deposits.  We offer a variety of deposit accounts to both consumers and businesses having a wide range of interest rates and terms.  Our deposits consist of savings accounts, money market deposit accounts, demand accounts and certificates of deposit.  We solicit deposits primarily in our market area; however, at December 31, 2018, approximately 2.7% of our deposits were from persons outside the state of Indiana.  As of December 31, 2018, core deposits, which we define as our non-certificate or non-time deposit accounts, represented approximately 65.2% of total deposits, compared to 66.1% as of December 31, 2017, respectively.  We primarily rely on competitive pricing policies, marketing and customer service to attract and retain these deposits and we expect to continue these practices in the future.
 
The flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions, changes in money market and prevailing interest rates and competition.  The variety of deposit accounts we offer has allowed us to be competitive in obtaining funds and to respond with flexibility to changes in consumer demand.  We have become more susceptible to short-term fluctuations in deposit flows as customers have become more interest rate conscious.  We manage the pricing of our deposits in keeping with our asset/liability management, liquidity and profitability objectives, subject to competitive factors.  Based on our experience, we believe that our deposits are relatively stable sources of funds.  Despite this stability, our ability to attract and maintain these deposits and the rates paid on them has been and will continue to be significantly affected by market conditions.

Money market account increases were primarily a result of an increased emphasis on new business relationships, customers placing maturing certificate funds into money market accounts in light of the low interest rate environment and a preference in the marketplace for insured deposits over other investments.  As our commercial lending business increases, we anticipate increases in transaction and savings deposits from our commercial customers.  We are a public funds depository and as of December 31, 2018, we had $11.3 million in public funds.  These funds consisted of $8.9 million in certificates of deposit and savings accounts and $2.4 million in checking accounts at December 31, 2018.

Borrowings.  Although deposits are our primary source of funds, we may utilize borrowings as a cost-effective source of funds when they can be invested at a positive interest rate spread, for additional capacity to fund loan demand, or to meet our asset/liability management goals.  Our borrowings currently consist of advances from the FHLB.  See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.
 
We are a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis, which is part of the Federal Home Loan Bank System.  The eleven regional Federal Home Loan Banks provide a central credit facility for their member institutions.  We may use advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis to supplement our supply of investable funds. The FHLB functions as a central reserve bank providing credit for its member financial institutions. As a member, we are required to own capital stock in the FHLB and are authorized to apply for advances on the security of such stock and certain of our whole first mortgage loans and other assets (principally securities which are obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States), provided certain standards related to creditworthiness have been met. Advances are made under several different programs, each having its own interest rate and range of maturities. Depending on the program, limitations on the amount of advances are based either on a fixed percentage of an institution's net worth or on the FHLB's assessment of the institution's creditworthiness. At December 31, 2018, we had $25.0 million of available borrowing capacity with the FHLB and had no advances outstanding. Average short-term borrowings have not exceeded 30% of stockholders' equity in the past two years.

REGULATION
 
The following is a brief description of certain laws and regulations which are applicable to the Company and the Bank. The description of these laws and regulations, as well as descriptions of laws and regulations contained elsewhere herein, does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the applicable laws and regulations.
 
Legislation is introduced from time to time in the United States Congress ("Congress") that may affect the Company's and Bank's operations. In addition, the regulations governing the Company and the Bank may be amended from time to time by the OCC, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve Board or the SEC, as appropriate. Any such legislation or regulatory changes in the future could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. We cannot predict whether any such changes may occur.
 
General
 
As a federally chartered savings bank, the Bank is subject to extensive regulation, examination and supervision by the OCC, as its primary federal regulator, and the FDIC, as the insurer of its deposits. Additionally, the Company is subject to extensive regulation, examination and supervision by the Federal Reserve as its primary federal regulator. The Bank is a member of the FHLB System and its deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the DIF, which is administered by the FDIC. The Bank must file reports with the OCC concerning its activities and financial condition in addition to obtaining regulatory approvals prior to entering into certain transactions such as mergers with, or acquisitions of, other financial institutions. There are periodic examinations of the Bank by the OCC and of the Company by the Federal Reserve to evaluate safety and soundness and compliance with various regulatory requirements. This regulatory structure establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which the Bank may engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the DIF and depositors. The regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. Any change in such policies, whether by the OCC, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC or Congress, could have a material adverse impact on the Company and the Bank and their operations.
 
In connection with the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the "Dodd-Frank Act"), the laws and regulations affecting depository institutions and their holding companies have changed the bank regulatory structure and are affecting the lending, investment, trading and operating activities of depository institutions and their holding companies. Among other changes, the Dodd-Frank Act established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ("CFPB") as an independent bureau of the Federal Reserve Board. The CFPB assumed responsibility for the implementation of the federal financial consumer protection and fair lending laws and regulations and has authority to impose new requirements. The Bank is subject to consumer protection regulations issued by the CFPB, but as a smaller financial institution, the Bank is generally subject to supervision and enforcement by the FDIC with respect to its compliance with consumer financial protection laws and CFPB regulations.
 
 27 

On May 23, 2018, the President signed into law the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act passed by Congress (the "Act"). The Act contains a number of provisions extending regulatory relief to banks and savings institutions and their holding companies. Some of these provisions may benefit the Company and the Bank, such as (1) a simplified capital ratio, called the Community Bank Capital Ratio, computed as the ratio of tangible equity capital to average consolidated total assets to be set by the federal banking regulators at not less than 8% and not more than 10%, which for most institutions with less than $10 billion in consolidated assets will replace the leverage and risk-based capital ratios under current regulations; (2) an option for federal savings institutions to operate as national banks with respect to limits on lending, investments, and subsidiaries, without changing their charters to national bank charters; and (3) a lower risk weight on certain loans currently classified as high volatility commercial real estate exposures. A number of the provisions in the Act require rulemaking or other action by the federal banking regulators and so may not have an immediate impact on the Company and the Bank.  
 
Federal Regulation of Savings Institutions
 
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.  The OCC has extensive authority over the operations of savings institutions. As part of this authority, the Bank is required to file periodic reports with the OCC and is subject to periodic examinations by the OCC. The OCC also has extensive enforcement authority over all savings institutions, including the Bank. This enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, issue cease-and-desist or removal orders and initiate prompt corrective action orders. In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. Other actions or inactions may provide the basis for enforcement action, including misleading or untimely reports filed with the OCC. Except under certain circumstances, public disclosure of final enforcement actions by the OCC is required by law.
 
All savings institutions are required to pay assessments to the OCC to fund the agency's operations. The general assessments, paid on a semi-annual basis, are determined based on the savings institution's total assets, including consolidated subsidiaries. The Bank's OCC assessment for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 was $76,000.
 
The Bank's general permissible lending limit for loans to one borrower is equal to the greater of $500,000 or 15% of unimpaired capital and surplus (except for loans fully secured by certain readily marketable collateral, in which case this limit is increased to 25% of unimpaired capital and surplus). At December 31, 2018, the Bank's lending limit under this restriction was $5.9 million.  We have no loans in excess of our lending limit.
 
The OCC's oversight of the Bank includes reviewing its compliance with the customer privacy requirements imposed by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 ("GLBA") and the anti-money laundering provisions of the USA Patriot Act. The GLBA privacy requirements place limitations on the sharing of consumer financial information with unaffiliated third parties. They also require each financial institution offering financial products or services to retail customers to provide such customers with its privacy policy and with the opportunity to "opt out" of the sharing of their personal information with unaffiliated third parties. The USA Patriot Act significantly expands the responsibilities of financial institutions in preventing the use of the U.S. financial system to fund terrorist activities. Its anti-money laundering provisions require financial institutions operating in the U.S. to develop anti-money laundering compliance programs and due diligence policies and controls to ensure the detection and reporting of money laundering. These compliance programs are intended to supplement requirements under the Bank Secrecy Act and the regulations of the Office of Foreign Assets Control.
 
The OCC, as well as the other federal banking agencies, has adopted guidelines establishing safety and soundness standards on such matters as loan underwriting and documentation, asset quality, earnings standards, internal controls and audit systems, interest rate risk exposure and compensation and other employee benefits. Any institution that fails to comply with these standards must submit a compliance plan.
 
Capital Requirements.  Federally insured savings institutions, such as the Bank, are required by the OCC to maintain minimum levels of regulatory capital, including a common equity Tier 1 ("CET1") capital to risk-based assets ratio, a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio, a total capital to risk-based assets ratio and a Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio. The capital standards require the maintenance of the following minimum capital ratios: (i) 
 
 28 

a CET1 capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6%; (iii) a total capital ratio of 8%; and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%.
 
Certain changes in what constitutes regulatory capital are subject to transition periods, including the phasing-out of certain instruments as qualifying capital. The Bank does not have any of these instruments. Mortgage servicing rights and certain deferred tax assets over designated percentages of CET1 are deducted from capital subject to a transition period which ended December 31, 2018. In addition, Tier 1 capital includes accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), which includes all unrealized gains and losses on available for sale debt and equity securities, subject to a transition period which ended December 31, 2018. Because of the Bank's asset size, the Bank elected to take a one-time option to permanently opt-out of the inclusion of unrealized gains and losses on available for sale debt and equity securities in its capital calculations.
 
The Bank also must maintain a capital conservation buffer consisting of additional CET1 capital greater than 2.5% of risk-weighted assets above the required minimum risk-based levels in order to avoid limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses. The capital conservation buffer requirement is subject to a phase in period beginning in January 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increasing each year until fully implemented in January 2019.
 
In order to be considered well-capitalized under the prompt corrective action regulations, the Bank must maintain a CET1 risk-based ratio of 6.5%, a Tier 1 risk-based ratio of 8%, a total risk-based capital ratio of 10% and a leverage ratio of 5%, and the Bank must not be subject to any of certain mandates by the OCC requiring it as an individual institution to meet any specified capital level.
 
As of December 31, 2018, the most recent notification from the OCC categorized the Bank as "well capitalized" under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. For additional information, see Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
 
Prompt Corrective Action.  An institution is considered adequately capitalized if it meets the minimum capital ratios described above. The OCC is required to take certain supervisory actions against undercapitalized savings institutions, the severity of which depends upon the institution's degree of undercapitalization. Subject to a narrow exception, the OCC is required to appoint a receiver or conservator for a savings institution that is critically undercapitalized. OCC regulations also require that a capital restoration plan be filed with the OCC within 45 days of the date a savings institution receives notice that it is undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized. In addition, numerous mandatory supervisory actions become immediately applicable to an undercapitalized institution, including, but not limited to, increased monitoring by regulators and restrictions on growth, capital distributions and expansion. Significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to more extensive mandatory regulatory actions. The OCC also can take a number of discretionary supervisory actions, including the issuance of a capital directive and the replacement of senior executive officers and directors. An institution that is not well-capitalized is subject to certain restrictions on deposit rates and brokered deposits. At December 31, 2018, the Bank has met the regulatory requirements described above under "Capital Requirements" to be considered well-capitalized.
Federal Home Loan Bank System.  The Bank is a member of the FHLB of Indianapolis, which is one of 11 regional Federal Home Loan Banks that administer the home financing credit function of savings institutions, each of which serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region. It is funded primarily from proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated obligations of the FHLB System. It makes loans or advances to members in accordance with policies and procedures established by the Board of Directors of the FHLB, which are subject to the oversight of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. All advances from the FHLB are required to be fully secured by sufficient collateral as determined by the FHLB. In addition, all long-term advances are required to provide funds for residential home financing. See "Business – Deposit Activities and Other Sources of Funds – Borrowings." As a member, the Bank is required to purchase and maintain stock in the FHLB. At December 31, 2018, the Bank held $778,000 in FHLB stock, which was in compliance with this requirement. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Bank did not purchase any FHLB stock.
 
The FHLB continues to contribute to low- and moderately-priced housing programs through direct loans or interest subsidies on advances targeted for community investment and low- and moderate-income housing projects. These contributions have adversely affected the level of FHLB dividends paid and could continue to do so in the 
 
 29 

future. These contributions could also have an adverse effect on the value of FHLB stock in the future. A reduction in value of the Bank's FHLB stock may result in a decrease in net income and possibly capital.
 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.  The DIF of the FDIC insures deposits in the Bank up to $250,000 per separately insured depositor. As insurer, the FDIC imposes deposit insurance premiums and is authorized to conduct examinations of and to require reporting by FDIC-insured institutions. The Bank's deposit insurance premiums for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 were $54,000.
 
Under its regulations, the FDIC sets assessment rates for established small institutions (generally, those with total assets of less than $10 billion) based on an institution's weighted average CAMELS component ratings and certain financial ratios. Total base assessment rates range from 1.5 to 16 basis points for institutions with CAMELS composite ratings of 1 or 2, 3 to 30 basis points for those with a CAMELS composite score of 3, and 11 to 30 basis points for those with CAMELS composite scores of 4 or 5, all subject to certain adjustments. Assessment rates are expected to decrease in the future as the reserve ratio increases in specified increments to the 1.35% ratio required by the Dodd-Frank Act. An institution that has reported on its Call Reports total assets of $10 billion or more for at least four consecutive quarters is considered a large institution and is assessed under a complex scorecard method employing many factors.
 
An institution that has reported on its Call Reports total assets of $10 billion or more for at least four consecutive quarters is considered a large institution and is assessed under a complex scorecard method employing many factors, including weighted average CAMELS ratings; a performance score; leverage ratio; ability to withstand asset-related stress; certain measures of concentration, core earnings, core deposits, credit quality, and liquidity; and a loss severity score and loss severity measure. Total base assessment rates for these institutions currently range from 1.5 to 40 basis points, subject to certain adjustments, and are expected to decrease in the future as the reserve ratio increases in specified increments.
 
The Dodd-Frank Act directs the FDIC to offset the effects of higher assessments due to the increase in the reserve ratio on established small institutions by charging higher assessments to large institutions. To implement this mandate, large and highly complex institutions must pay an annual surcharge of 4.5 basis points on their assessment base beginning July 1, 2016. If the DIF reserve ratio has not reached 1.35% by December 31, 2018, the FDIC plans to impose a shortfall assessment on large institutions on March 31, 2019. The FDIC may increase or decrease its rates by 2 basis points without further rule-making. In an emergency, the FDIC may also impose a special assessment.
 
Since established small institutions contribute to the DIF while the reserve ratio remains below 1.35% and large institutions are paying a surcharge, the FDIC will provide assessment credits to established small institutions for the portion of their assessments that contribute to the increase. When the reserve ratio reaches 1.35%, the FDIC will automatically apply an established small institution's assessment credits to reduce its regular deposit insurance assessments.
 
In addition to the FDIC assessments, the Financing Corporation is authorized to impose and collect, through the FDIC, assessments for anticipated payments, issuance costs and custodial fees on bonds issued in the 1980s to recapitalize the former Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. The bonds issued by the Financing Corporation are maturing in 2017 through 2019.
 
The FDIC also may prohibit any insured institution from engaging in any activity determined by regulation or order to pose a serious risk to the DIF. The FDIC may terminate the deposit insurance of any insured depository institution, including the Bank, if it determines after a hearing that the institution has engaged or is engaging in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, order or any condition imposed by an agreement with the FDIC. It also may suspend deposit insurance temporarily during the hearing process for the permanent termination of insurance, if the institution has no tangible capital. If insurance of accounts is terminated, the accounts at the institution at the time of the termination, less subsequent withdrawals, shall continue to be insured for a period of six months to two years, as determined by the FDIC. Management is not aware of any existing circumstances which would result in termination of the deposit insurance of the Bank.
 
 30 

Qualified Thrift Lender Test.  All savings institutions, including the Bank, are required to meet a qualified thrift lender ("QTL") test to avoid certain restrictions on their operations. This test requires a savings institution to have at least 65% of its total assets, as defined by regulation, in qualified thrift investments on a monthly average for nine out of every 12 months on a rolling basis. As an alternative, the savings institution may maintain 60% of its assets in those assets specified in Section 7701(a) (19) of the Internal Revenue Code ("Code"). Under either test, such assets primarily consist of residential housing related loans and investments.
 
Any institution that fails to meet the QTL test is subject to certain operating restrictions and may be required to convert to a national bank charter, and a savings and loan holding company of such an institution may become regulated as a bank holding company. As of December 31, 2018, the Bank met the QTL test.
 
Limitations on Capital Distributions. OCC regulations impose various restrictions on savings institutions with respect to their ability to make distributions of capital, which include dividends, stock redemptions or repurchases, cash-out mergers and other transactions charged to the capital account. Generally, savings institutions, such as the Bank, that before and after the proposed distribution are well-capitalized, may make capital distributions during any calendar year equal to up to 100% of net income for the year-to-date plus retained net income for the two preceding years. However, an institution deemed to be in need of more than normal supervision by the OCC may have its dividend authority restricted by the OCC. If the Bank, however, proposes to make a capital distribution when it does not meet its capital requirements (or will not following the proposed capital distribution) or that will exceed these net income-based limitations, it must obtain the OCC's approval prior to making such distribution. In addition, the Bank must file a prior written notice of a dividend with the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve or the OCC may object to a capital distribution based on safety and soundness concerns. Additional restrictions on Bank dividends may apply if the Bank fails the QTL test. In addition, as noted above, if the Bank does not have the required capital conservation buffer, its ability to pay dividends to the Company would be limited, which may limit the ability of the Company to pay dividends to its stockholders.
 
Activities of Associations and their Subsidiaries.  When a savings institution establishes or acquires a subsidiary or elects to conduct any new activity through a subsidiary that the savings institution controls, the savings institution must file a notice or application with the OCC and, in certain circumstances with the FDIC, and receive regulatory approval or non-objection. Savings institutions also must conduct the activities of subsidiaries in accordance with existing regulations and orders.
 
With respect to subsidiaries generally, the OCC may determine that investment by a savings institution in, or the activities of, a subsidiary must be restricted or eliminated based on safety and soundness or legal reasons.
 
Transactions with Affiliates. The Bank's authority to engage in transactions with affiliates is limited by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act as implemented by the Federal Reserve's Regulation W. The term affiliates for these purposes generally mean any company that controls or is under common control with an institution except subsidiaries of the institution. The Company and its non-savings institution subsidiaries are affiliates of the Bank. In general, transactions with affiliates must be on terms that are as favorable to the institution as comparable transactions with non-affiliates. In addition, certain types of transactions are restricted to an aggregate percentage of the institution's capital. In addition, savings institutions are prohibited from lending to any affiliate that is engaged in activities that are not permissible for bank holding companies and no savings institution may purchase the securities of any affiliate other than a subsidiary. FDIC-insured institutions are subject, with certain exceptions, to certain restrictions on extensions of credit to their parent holding companies or other affiliates, on investments in the stock or other securities of affiliates and on the taking of such stock or securities as collateral from any borrower. Collateral in specified amounts must be provided by affiliates in order to receive loans from an institution. In addition, these institutions are prohibited from engaging in certain tying arrangements in connection with any extension of credit or the providing of any property or service.
 
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 ("Sarbanes-Oxley Act") generally prohibits a company that makes filings with the SEC from making loans to its executive officers and directors. That act, however, contains a specific exception for loans by a depository institution to its executive officers and directors, if the lending is in compliance with federal banking laws. Under such laws, the Bank's authority to extend credit to executive officers, directors and 10% stockholders ("insiders"), as well as entities which such persons control, is limited. The law restricts both the individual and aggregate amount of loans the Bank may make to insiders based, in part, on the Bank's capital 
 
 31 

position and requires certain Board approval procedures to be followed. Such loans must be made on terms substantially the same as those offered to unaffiliated individuals and not involve more than the normal risk of repayment. There is an exception for loans made pursuant to a benefit or compensation program that is widely available to all employees of the institution and does not give preference to insiders over other employees. There are additional restrictions applicable to loans to executive officers.
 
Community Reinvestment Act and Consumer Protection Laws. Under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 ("CRA"), every FDIC-insured institution has a continuing and affirmative obligation consistent with safe and sound banking practices to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution's discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community, consistent with the CRA. The CRA requires the OCC, in connection with the examination of the Bank, to assess the institution's record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications, such as a merger or the establishment of a branch, by the Bank. The OCC may use an unsatisfactory rating as the basis for the denial of an application. Similarly, the Federal Reserve is required to take into account the performance of an insured institution under the CRA when considering whether to approve an acquisition by the institution's holding company. Due to the heightened attention being given to the CRA in the past few years, the Bank may be required to devote additional funds for investment and lending in its local community.
 
In connection with its deposit-taking, lending and other activities, the Bank is subject to a number of federal laws designed to protect consumers and promote lending to various sectors of the economy and population. The CFPB issues regulations and standards under these federal consumer protection laws, which include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Truth-in-Lending Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act. Through its rulemaking authority, the CFPB has promulgated several proposed and final regulations under these laws that will affect our consumer businesses. Among these regulatory initiatives are final regulations setting "ability to repay" and "qualified mortgage" standards for residential mortgage loans and establishing new mortgage loan servicing and loan originator compensation standards. The Bank devotes substantial compliance, legal and operational business resources to ensure compliance with these consumer protection standards. In addition, the OCC has enacted customer privacy regulations that limit the ability of the Bank to disclose nonpublic consumer information to non-affiliated third parties. The regulations require disclosure of privacy policies and allow consumers to prevent certain personal information from being shared with non-affiliated parties.
 
Enforcement.  The OCC has primary enforcement responsibility over federally-chartered savings institutions and has the authority to bring action against all "institution-affiliated parties," including shareholders, and any attorneys, appraisers and accountants who knowingly or recklessly participate in wrongful action likely to have an adverse effect on an insured institution. Formal enforcement action may range from the issuance of a capital directive or cease and desist order to removal of officers or directors, receivership, conservatorship or termination of deposit insurance. Civil penalties cover a wide range of violations and can range up to $2.0 million per day. The FDIC has the authority to recommend to the OCC that enforcement action be taken with respect to a particular savings institution. If action is not taken by the OCC, the FDIC has authority to take such action under certain circumstances. Federal law also establishes criminal penalties for certain violations.
 
Standards for Safety and Soundness. As required by statute, the federal banking agencies have adopted interagency guidelines prescribing standards for safety and soundness. The guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. If the OCC determines that a savings institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, the OCC may require the institution to submit an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard.
 
Federal Reserve System. The Federal Reserve requires that all depository institutions maintain reserves on transaction accounts or non-personal time deposits. These reserves may be in the form of cash or non-interest-bearing deposits with the regional Federal Reserve Bank. Interest-bearing checking accounts and other types of accounts that permit payments or transfers to third parties fall within the definition of transaction accounts and are subject to Regulation D reserve requirements, as are any non-personal time deposits at a bank. At December 31,

2018, the Bank was in compliance with these reserve requirements. The balances maintained to meet the reserve requirements imposed by the Federal Reserve Board may be used to satisfy any liquidity requirements that may be imposed by the OCC.
 
Commercial Real Estate Lending Concentrations.  The federal banking agencies have issued guidance on sound risk management practices for concentrations in commercial real estate lending. The particular focus is on exposure to commercial real estate loans that are dependent on the cash flow from the real estate held as collateral and that are likely to be sensitive to conditions in the commercial real estate market (as opposed to real estate collateral held as a secondary source of repayment or as an abundance of caution). The purpose of the guidance is not to limit a bank's commercial real estate lending but to guide banks in developing risk management practices and capital levels commensurate with the level and nature of real estate concentrations. The guidance directs the FDIC and other bank regulatory agencies to focus their supervisory resources on institutions that may have significant commercial real estate loan concentration risk. A bank that has experienced rapid growth in commercial real estate lending, has notable exposure to a specific type of commercial real estate loan, or is approaching or exceeding the following supervisory criteria may be identified for further supervisory analysis with respect to real estate concentration risk:

• | Total reported loans for construction, land development and other land represent 100% or more of the bank's capital; or
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Total commercial real estate loans (as defined in the guidance) represent 300% or more of the bank's total capital or the outstanding balance of the bank's commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased 50% or more during the prior 36 months.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



The guidance provides that the strength of an institution's lending and risk management practices with respect to such concentrations will be taken into account in supervisory guidance on evaluation of capital adequacy.
 
Environmental Issues Associated with Real Estate Lending. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act ("CERCLA"), is a federal statute that generally imposes strict liability on all prior and present "owners and operators" of sites containing hazardous waste. However, Congress acted to protect secured creditors by providing that the term "owner and operator" excludes a person whose ownership is limited to protecting its security interest in the site. Since the enactment of the CERCLA, this "secured creditor exemption" has been the subject of judicial interpretations which have left open the possibility that lenders could be liable for cleanup costs on contaminated property that they hold as collateral for a loan. To the extent that legal uncertainty exists in this area, all creditors, including the Bank, that have made loans secured by properties with potential hazardous waste contamination (such as petroleum contamination) could be subject to liability for cleanup costs, which could substantially exceed the value of the collateral property.
Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering Laws. The Bank is subject to the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including the USA Patriot Act of 2001. These laws and regulations require the Bank to implement policies, procedures, and controls to detect, prevent, and report money laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the identity of their customers. Violations of these requirements can result in substantial civil and criminal sanctions. In addition, provisions of the USA Patriot Act require the federal financial institution regulatory agencies to consider the effectiveness of a financial institution's anti-money laundering activities when reviewing mergers and acquisitions.
Other Consumer Protection Laws and Regulations.  The Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB and empowered it to exercise broad regulatory, supervisory and enforcement authority with respect to both new and existing consumer financial protection laws. The Bank is subject to consumer protection regulations issued by the CFPB, but as a financial institution with assets of less than $10 billion, the Bank is generally subject to supervision and enforcement by the OCC with respect to compliance with consumer financial protection laws and CFPB regulations.
 
The Bank is subject to a broad array of federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations that govern almost every aspect of its business relationships with consumers. While the following list is not exhaustive, these include the Truth-in-Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Fund Transfers Act, the Expedited

Funds Availability Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Right to Financial Privacy Act, the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act, the Fair Credit Billing Act, the Homeowners Protection Act, the Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act, laws governing flood insurance, laws governing consumer protections in connection with the sale of insurance, federal and state laws prohibiting unfair and deceptive business practices, and various regulations that implement some or all of the foregoing. These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with customers when taking deposits, making loans, collecting loans, and providing other services. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations can subject the Bank to various penalties, including but not limited to, enforcement actions, injunctions, fines, civil liability, criminal penalties, punitive damages, and the loss of certain contractual rights.
 
Savings and Loan Holding Company Regulations
 
General. The Company is a unitary savings and loan holding company subject to regulatory oversight of the Federal Reserve. Accordingly, the Company is required to register and file reports with the Federal Reserve and is subject to regulation and examination by the Federal Reserve. In addition, the Federal Reserve has enforcement authority over the Company and its non-savings institution subsidiaries, which also permits the Federal Reserve to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to present a serious risk to the subsidiary savings institution. In accordance with the Dodd-Frank Act, the federal banking regulators must require any company that controls an FDIC-insured depository institution to serve as a source of strength for the institution, with the ability to provide financial assistance if the institution suffers financial distress. These and other Federal Reserve policies, as well as the capital conservatism buffer requirement, may restrict the Company's ability to pay dividends.
 
Capital Requirements. For a savings and loan holding company, such as the Company, the capital regulations apply on a consolidated basis. The Act raised the maximum amount of consolidated assets a qualifying holding company may have to $3 billion under the Federal Reserve's "Small Bank Holding Company and Savings and Loan Holding Company Policy Statement" pursuant to which the Company is generally not subject to the Federal Reserve's capital regulations, which are generally the same as the capital regulations applicable to the Bank. A major result of this change is to exclude most such holding companies from the minimum capital requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Federal Reserve made this change effective August 30, 2019. The Federal Reserve expects the holding company's subsidiary banks to be well capitalized under the prompt corrective action regulations. If the Company were subject to regulatory guidelines for bank holding companies with $3.0 billion or more in assets at December 31, 2018, the Company would have exceeded all regulatory requirements. See "Federal Regulation of Savings Institutions-- Capital Requirements" above.
 
Activities Restrictions. The GLBA provides that no company may acquire control of a savings association after May 4, 1999 unless it engages only in the financial activities permitted for financial holding companies under the law or for multiple savings and loan holding companies. Further, the GLBA specifies that, subject to a grandfather provision, existing savings and loan holding companies may only engage in such activities. The Company qualifies for grandfathering and is therefore not restricted in terms of its activities. Upon any non-supervisory acquisition by the Company of another savings association as a separate subsidiary, the Company would become a multiple savings and loan holding company and would be limited to activities permitted by Federal Reserve regulation.
Mergers and Acquisitions. The Company must obtain approval from the Federal Reserve before acquiring more than 5% of the voting stock of another savings institution or savings and loan holding company or acquiring such an institution or holding company by merger, consolidation or purchase of its assets. In evaluating an application for the Company to acquire control of a savings institution, the Federal Reserve would consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the Company and the target institution, the effect of the acquisition on the risk to the DIF, the convenience and the needs of the community and competitive factors.
 
 34 

The Federal Reserve may not approve any acquisition that would result in a multiple savings and loan holding company controlling savings institutions in more than one state, subject to two exceptions; (i) the approval of interstate supervisory acquisitions by savings and loan holding companies and (ii) the acquisition of a savings institution in another state if the laws of the state of the target savings institution specifically permit such acquisitions. The states vary in the extent to which they permit interstate savings and loan holding company acquisitions.
 
Acquisition of the Company. Any company, except a bank holding company, that acquires control of a savings association or savings and loan holding company becomes a "savings and loan holding company" subject to registration, examination and regulation by the Federal Reserve and must obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve under the Savings and Loan Holding Company Act before obtaining control of a savings association or savings and loan holding company. A bank holding company must obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve under the Bank Holding Company Act before obtaining control of a savings association or savings and loan holding company and remains subject to regulation under the Bank Holding Company Act. The term "company" includes corporations, partnerships, associations, and certain trusts and other entities. "Control" of a savings association or savings and loan holding company is deemed to exist if a company has voting control, directly or indirectly, of more than 25% of any class of the savings association's voting stock or controls in any manner the election of a majority of the directors of the savings association or savings and loan holding company, and may be presumed under other circumstances, including, but not limited to, holding in certain cases 10% or more of a class of voting securities. In addition, a savings and loan holding company must obtain Federal Reserve approval prior to acquiring voting control of more than 5% of any class of voting stock of another savings association or another savings association holding company. A similar provision limiting the acquisition by a bank holding company of 5% or more of a class of voting stock of any company is included in the Bank Holding Company Act.
 
Accordingly, the prior approval of the Federal Reserve would be required:
 
 
• | before any savings and loan holding company or bank holding company could acquire 5% or more of the common stock of the Company; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | before any other company could acquire 25% or more of the common stock of the Company and may be required for an acquisition of as little as 10% of such stock.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



In addition, persons that are not companies are subject to the same or similar definitions of control with respect to savings and loan holding companies and savings associations and requirements for prior regulatory approval by the Federal Reserve in the case of control of a savings and loan holding company or by the OCC in the case of control of a savings association not obtained through control of a holding company of such savings association.
 
Dividends and Stock Repurchases.  The Federal Reserve's policy statement on the payment of cash dividends applicable to savings and loan holding companies expresses its view that a savings and loan holding company must maintain an adequate capital position and generally should not pay cash dividends unless the company's net income for the past year is sufficient to fully fund the cash dividends and that the prospective rate of earnings appears consistent with the company's capital needs, asset quality, and overall financial condition. The Federal Reserve policy statement also indicates that it would be inappropriate for a company experiencing serious financial problems to borrow funds to pay dividends. In addition, a savings and loan holding company is required to give the Federal Reserve prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding twelve months, is equal to 10% or more of its consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve order or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve. The capital conservation buffer requirement may also limit or preclude dividends payable by the Company.

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.  The Sarbanes-Oxley Act was enacted in 2002 in response to public concerns regarding corporate accountability in connection with recent accounting scandals. The stated goals of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act are to increase corporate responsibility, to provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies and to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures pursuant to the securities laws. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act generally applies to all companies, both U.S. and non-U.S., that file or are required to file periodic reports with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including the Company.
 
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act includes very specific additional disclosure requirements and new corporate governance rules, and requires the SEC and securities exchanges to adopt extensive additional disclosure, corporate governance and related rules. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act represents significant federal involvement in matters traditionally left to state regulatory systems, such as the regulation of the accounting profession, and to state corporate law, such as the relationship between a board of directors and management and between a board of directors and its committees.
 
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010.  On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law. The Dodd-Frank-Act imposes new restrictions and an expanded framework of regulatory oversight for financial institutions, including depository institutions and implements new capital regulations discussed above under "- Regulation and Supervision of the Bank - Capital Requirements." In addition, among other changes, the Dodd-Frank Act requires public companies, such as the Company, to (i) provide their shareholders with a non-binding vote (a) at least once every three years on the compensation paid to executive officers and (b) at least once every six years on whether they should have a "say on pay" vote every one, two or three years; (ii) have a separate, non-binding shareholder vote regarding golden parachutes for named executive officers when a shareholder vote takes place on mergers, acquisitions, dispositions or other transactions that would trigger the parachute payments; (iii) provide disclosure in annual proxy materials concerning the relationship between the executive compensation paid and the financial performance of the issuer; and (iv) amend Item 402 of Regulation S-K to require companies to disclose the ratio of the Chief Executive Officer's annual total compensation to the median annual total compensation of all other employees. For certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, the implementing regulations have not been promulgated, so the full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on public companies cannot be determined at this time.
