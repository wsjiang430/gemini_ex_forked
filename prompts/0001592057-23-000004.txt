ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
This Annual Report on Form 10-K presents information for Enviva Inc., a Delaware corporation. References to “Enviva,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our,” or similar expressions refer to Enviva Inc. and its subsidiaries. Please read Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements beginning on page 1 and Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for information regarding certain risks inherent in our business.
Overview
We are a growth-oriented company originally formed in 2013 as a limited partnership that converted to a corporation on December 31, 2021. We develop, construct, acquire, and own and operate, fully contracted wood pellet production plants where we aggregate a natural resource, wood fiber, and process it into dry, densified, uniform pellets that can be effectively stored and transported around the world. We primarily sell our wood pellets through long-term, take-or-pay off-take contracts with creditworthy customers in the United Kingdom (the “U.K.”), the European Union (the “EU”), and Japan, who use our pellets to displace coal and other fossil fuels to generate power and heat as part of their efforts to accelerate the energy transition away from conventional energy sources. Our wood pellets meet the criteria put forth by the European Union’s Renewable Energy Directive II (“RED II”) which includes biomass in its definition of renewable energy. The wood pellets we produce are viewed by our customers as a critical component of their efforts to reduce life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions in their core energy generation or industrial manufacturing processes and to mitigate the impact of climate change. We believe that our pellets also have potential applicability to hard-to-abate sectors as bio-based raw material feedstock to industrial processes formerly provided by fossil fuels where their use could reduce greenhouse gas emissions on a lifecycle basis and to generate process steam and heat in heavy industrial manufacturing like lime, sugar, steel, and cement, and to generate aviation fuels and other liquids.
We own and operate ten plants (collectively, “our plants”) with a combined production capacity of approximately 6.2 million metric tons per year (“MTPY”) of wood pellets in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, and Mississippi, the production of which is fully contracted with a few of our contracts extending well into the 2040s. We export our wood pellets to global markets through our deep-water marine terminal at the Port of Chesapeake, Virginia, terminal assets at the Port of Wilmington, North Carolina, and the Port of Pascagoula, Mississippi, and from third-party deep-water marine terminals in Savannah, Georgia, Mobile, Alabama, and Panama City, Florida. In 2022, we commenced construction of our fully contracted wood pellet production plant in Epes, Alabama (the “Epes plant”) which is designed and permitted to produce more than one million MTPY of wood pellets. Additionally, in 2022, we commenced the development of a wood pellet production plant in Bond, Mississippi (the “Bond plant”) which is designed to produce one million MTPY of wood pellets. All of our facilities are located in geographic regions with low input costs and favorable transportation logistics. Owning these cost-advantaged assets in a rapidly expanding industry provides us with a platform to generate stable cash flows. Our plants are sited in robust fiber baskets providing stable pricing for the low-grade fiber used to produce wood pellets. Our raw materials are byproducts of the sawmilling process or traditional timber harvesting, principally low-value wood materials, such as trees generally not suited for sawmilling or other manufactured forest products, tree tops and limbs, understory, brush, and slash that are generated in a harvest.
Our primary sales strategy is to fully contract the wood pellet production from our plants under long-term, take-or-pay off-take contracts with a diversified and creditworthy customer base. Our long-term off-take contracts typically provide for fixed-price deliveries that often include provisions that escalate the price over time and provide for other margin protection. For 2022, our production capacity from our wood pellet production plants was contracted under our existing long-term, take-or-pay off-take contracts. In addition to generating durable cash flow from long-term take-or-pay off-take contracts, we monitor sustained dislocations in the marketplace, and opportunistically transact when pricing dynamics and contract flexibility provide avenues to generate incremental gross margin. Furthermore, our off-take contracts generally provide us with the opportunity to flex a certain percentage of contracted shipments up or down. That flexibility, enabled by our multi-plant profile, multi-deep water marine terminals and our long-term shipping contracts, can create opportunities to optimize our gross margin when we sell under short-term contracts in times when spot market prices are elevated or, conversely, when we purchase third-party volumes during times when spot market prices are depressed.
Our volumes under our firm and contingent long-term, take-or-pay off-take contracts provide for a product sales backlog of $23.5 billion and our contracts have a total weighted-average remaining term of 13.7 years from January 1, 2023.
Due to the uninterruptible nature of our customers’ fuel and other raw material consumption, our customers require a reliable supply of wood pellets that meet stringent product specifications. We have built our operations and assets to deliver and 

certify the highest levels of product quality and our track record of reliable deliveries enables us to charge premium prices for this certainty.
Our Production Plants, Logistics and Storage Capabilities
We procure low-grade wood fiber and process it into utility-grade wood pellets and load the finished wood pellets into railcars, trucks, and barges for transportation to deep-water marine terminals, where we receive, store, and ultimately load our products onto dry bulk cargo oceangoing vessels for delivery to our customers.
We own and operate ten industrial-scale wood pellet production plants strategically located in the Mid-Atlantic and Gulf Coast regions of the United States, geographic areas in which wood fiber resources are plentiful and readily available. We employ a “build-and-copy” approach to the construction of new capacity, which allows for efficiencies in the engineering, design, construction, and operation of our facilities. Furthermore, our multi-plant profile and scale provide us with flexibility under our portfolio of off-take contracts that enhances the reliability of our deliveries and provides for opportunities for optimization as detailed above.
Our facilities are designed to operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year, although we schedule up to 15 days of planned maintenance for our wood pellet production plants during each calendar year. There are no regularly required major turnarounds or overhauls.
The following table describes our wood pellet production plants, all of which we wholly own:

Wood Fiber Procurement and Sustainability
We and our customers are subject to stringent requirements regarding the sustainability of the fuels we procure. In addition to our internal sustainability policies and initiatives like our Responsible Sourcing Policy, our wood fiber procurement is conducted in accordance with leading forest certification standards, and we maintain multiple forest certifications. Our fiber supply chains are routinely audited by independent third parties, and we maintain the traceability of, and make public, information concerning the primary wood that is delivered to us directly from forests via our proprietary Track & Trace® system.
Our wood fiber demand is complementary to, rather than in competition with, demand for high-grade wood from most other forest-related industries, such as lumber and furniture. Demand for the non-merchantable fiber, waste products, or byproducts that we use is generally low; accordingly, the tops, limbs, and other low-grade wood fiber we purchase would otherwise generally be left unused, impeding reforestation, or burned.
Our fleet of production plants is sited in robust fiber baskets in the southeast United States that sustainably support our growing operations with low-grade fiber. As a result of the fragmented nature of tract ownership in our sourcing areas, we procure raw materials from hundreds of landowners, loggers, and timber industry participants, with no individual landowner representing a material fraction of any of our plants’ needs. Our wood fiber is procured under a variety of arrangements, including (1) logging contracts for the thinnings, pulpwood, and other unmerchandised low-grade fiber, (2) in-woods chipping contracts, (3) contracts with timber dealers, and (4) purchases from sawmills.
Port Operations
The following table describes our owned and leased ports. Wood pellets are exported from our owned or leased deep-water, marine terminals and are stored in domes, barges, and warehouses at the ports. Our terminals operate 24 hours per day, seven days per week.

Port Location | Throughput Capacity (MTPY) | StorageCapacity (MT) | | Storage Facility Typeat Port Location | Terminal FacilityOwn/Lease

Savannah, Georgia | 1,500,000 | | 50,000 | | Third-party domes | Leased terminal assets
Total | 10,895,000 | | 397,000 | | | 

Our Contracts and Marketing Activities
We refer to the structure of our long-term sales contracts as “take-or-pay” because they include a firm obligation of the customer to take a fixed quantity of product at a stated price and provides for us to be compensated in the event of the customer’s failure to accept all or a part of the contracted volumes or for termination of a contract by the customer.
We also have entered into several other contracts that have smaller off-take quantities than the contracts described above. In total, as of January 1, 2023, our backlog of fully contracted volumes under our existing take-or-pay contracts is $23.5 billion with a weighted-average remaining contract term of 13.7 years. Included in the backlog are contracts with 18 customers in jurisdictions ranging from the U.K., Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, Japan, and the United States of America.
In some cases, we may purchase shipments of product from third-party suppliers and resell them in back-to-back transactions.
Industry Overview
Our product, utility-grade wood pellets, is used in an increasing variety of applications around the world to help reduce the life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions generated by our customers in energy generation and industrial processes.
For many of our customers, our wood pellets are used as a substitute for coal in both dedicated and co-fired power generation and combined heat and power plants. It enables major power, heat or combined heat and power generators (“generators”) to profitably generate electricity and heat in a manner that reduces the overall cost of compliance with certain mandatory greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions limits and renewable energy targets while also allowing companies to diversify their secure sources of renewable feedstock supply.
Unlike intermittent sources of renewable generation like wind and solar power, wood pellet-fired plants are capable of meeting baseload electricity demand and are dispatchable (that is, power output can be switched on or off or adjusted based on demand). As a result, utilities and major generators in Europe, Asia, and other areas have made and continue to make long-term, profitable investments in power plant conversions and new builds of generating assets that either co-fire wood pellets with coal or are fully dedicated wood pellet-fired plants. Such developments help generators maintain and increase baseload generating capacity and comply with binding climate change regulations and other emissions reduction targets.
The capital costs required to convert a coal plant to co-fire biomass, or to burn biomass exclusively, are a fraction of the capital costs associated with implementing offshore wind and most other renewable technologies. Furthermore, the relatively quick process of converting coal-fired plants to biomass-fired generation can be an attractive benefit for generators whose generation assets are no longer viable as coal plants due to the expiration of operating permits, regulatory phase-out of coal-fired power generation, the introduction of taxes, or other restrictions on fossil fuel usage or emissions of GHGs and other pollutants. Additionally, the European Union’s Emissions Trading System continues to demonstrate a durable, constructive market for carbon, which assists biomass in being more cost effective for energy generation than carbon-intensive feedstocks such as coal and natural gas, even in markets where there are no direct incentives or subsidies for renewable energy generation.

There also continues to be significant demand growth in Europe and Asia for wood pellets as a preferred fuel source and renewable alternative to fossil fuels for district heating loops, residential and commercial heating, and the production of heat for industrial sites.
Our wood pellets also have potential applicability to hard-to-abate sectors as bio-based raw material feedstock to displace inputs to industrial processes formerly provided by fossil fuels, where their use could reduce greenhouse gas emissions on a lifecycle basis. In addition to the customer applications outlined above, we have long-term, take-or-pay off-take contracts in place with customers who intend to utilize our wood pellets as a raw material input in the refinement of bio-liquids like biodiesel and sustainably produced aviation fuel as well as to generate process steam and heat in heavy industrial manufacturing like lime, sugar, etc. As these markets further develop, we believe we will continue to have opportunities to serve this growing material demand beyond our current product sales backlog.
Competition
We compete with other utility-grade wood pellet producers for long-term, take-or-pay off-take contracts with major power and heat generation customers, trading houses, and increasingly with customers in hard-to-abate sectors. Competition in our industry is based on the price, quantity, quality, and consistency of the wood pellets produced, the reliability and scale of wood pellet deliveries and the producer’s ability to verify and document, through customer and third-party audits, that their wood pellets meet the regulatory sustainability, and use requirements of a particular customer.
Most of the world’s current wood pellet production plants are owned by small, private companies, with few companies owning or operating multiple plants. Few companies have the scale, production, technical expertise, access to sustainable fiber baskets, or commercial infrastructure necessary to supply utility-grade wood pellets under large, long-term off-take contracts to creditworthy counterparties. We are the largest producer by production capacity and consider other companies with production capacity, technical expertise, or commercial infrastructure to be our competitors, including Drax Biomass Inc., AS Graanul Invest, Fram Renewable Fuels, LLC, An Viet Phat Energy Co., LTD, and Highland Pellets LLC.
Development and Construction Projects
Demand for our product continues to exceed available supply, industry-wide. To meet growing demand, our development strategy is to identify potentially attractive new locations for wood pellet production, and deep-water terminal operations, and secure control or ownership of these sites. The process of developing these sites includes permitting, designing, engineering, and ultimately constructing, commissioning, and operating new wood pellet production or terminaling capacity consistent with our “build and copy” strategy, whereby we replicate production, and terminaling assets consistent with the design and equipment selection of our then-current operating assets. We are currently constructing the Epes plant, developing the Bond plant, and maintain a portfolio of additional sites under development or consideration.
Governmental Regulations
Our operations are subject to stringent and comprehensive federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing matters including protection of the environment and natural resources, occupational health and safety, and the release or discharge of materials into the environment, including air emissions. Such laws and regulations may require us to obtain permits, limit or avoid certain operational practices, and incur costs for compliance or remediation. Failure to comply with such laws may also result in substantial liabilities, including possible fines and penalties, for unpermitted emissions or discharges from our operations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil, and criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory and remedial obligations, and the issuance of orders enjoining some or all of our operations in affected areas.
Moreover, the global trend in environmental regulation is towards increasingly broad and stringent requirements for activities that may affect the environment. Any changes in environmental laws and regulations or re‑interpretation of enforcement policies that result in more stringent and costly requirements could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial position. Although we monitor environmental requirements closely and budget for the expected costs, actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate spending. Moreover, certain environmental laws impose strict joint and several liability for costs to clean up and restore sites where pollutants have been disposed or otherwise spilled or released, potentially resulting in significant costs and liabilities for remediation of resulting damage to property, natural resources, or persons. Although we believe that our competitors face similar environmental requirements, market factors may prevent us from passing on any increased costs to our customers. Additionally, although we believe that continued compliance with existing requirements will not materially adversely affect us, there is no assurance that the current levels of regulation will continue in the future.

The following summarizes some of the more significant existing environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations applicable to our operations, the failure to comply with which could have a material adverse impact on our capital expenditures, results of operations and financial position.
Air Emissions
The federal Clean Air Act, as amended (the “CAA”), and state and local laws and regulations that implement and add to CAA requirements, regulate the emission of air pollutants from our facilities. The CAA and state and local laws and regulations impose significant monitoring, testing, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements for these emissions. These laws and regulations require us to obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions, obtain, and strictly comply with stringent air permit emission limits, and in certain cases utilize specific equipment or technologies to control and measure emissions. Obtaining these permits can be both costly and time intensive and has the potential to delay opening of new plants or significant expansion of existing plants; moreover, complying with these permits, including satisfying testing requirements, can be costly and time-intensive. Failure to comply with these laws, regulations and permit requirements may cause us to face fines, penalties, or injunctive orders in connection with air pollutant emissions from our operations.
The CAA requires that we obtain various construction and operating permits, including, in some cases, Title V air permits. In certain cases, the CAA requires us to incur capital expenditures to install air pollution control devices at our facilities. We are also required to control fugitive emissions from our operations and may face fines, penalties, or injunctive orders in connection with fugitive emissions. We have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, substantial administrative, operating and capital expenditures to maintain compliance with CAA requirements that have been promulgated or may be promulgated or revised in the future.
Climate Change and Greenhouse Gases
Our operations are subject to limited direct regulation with respect to emissions of GHGs. For example, at this time, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) requires certain large facilities to undergo CAA pre-construction review and obtain operating permits for their GHG emissions. Our operations are also indirectly affected by regulations regarding the carbon treatment of biomass. Several jurisdictions to which we ship our product have imposed regulations on the characterization of biomass as a carbon-neutral fuel, and any change that imposes more stringent regulations on the characterization of biomass as carbon-neutral could negatively impact demand for our products or require us to incur additional costs to achieve such characterization of our products. For more information, see our risk factor titled “Changes in the treatment of biomass could adversely impact our business.” Additionally, in March 2022, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) released a proposed rule that would establish a framework for reporting of climate risks, targets, and metrics. A final rule is anticipated in Q2 2023. Although the final form and substance of the rule is not yet known, it could result in additional compliance costs. Finally, scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the earth’s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as sea-level rise, increased frequency and severity of storms, floods, and other climatic events, including forest fires. If any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our operations.
Safety and Maintenance
We are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, including the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended (“OSHA”), and comparable state statutes, which are intended to protect the health and safety of employees and contractors. OSHA imposes various requirements, including safety-related training, policies, and programs. In addition, the OSHA Hazard Communication Standards and the EPA’s Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act statutes require that information be maintained concerning hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local governmental authorities and citizens. National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) standards require affected facilities to develop and implement plans and controls to minimize combustible dust. EPA regulations mandate the utilization of pollution control equipment such as cyclones, baghouses, and electronic precipitators to minimize regulated air emissions at affected facilities. Additionally, we continually strive to maintain compliance with applicable air, solid waste, and wastewater regulations as required by EPA regulations, state and local laws and ordinances. Our deep-water marine terminals are required to adhere to Homeland Security/U.S. Coast Guard regulations regarding physical security and emergency response plans.
Seasonality
Our business is affected by seasonal fluctuations. During the first half of the year, the cost of producing wood pellets tends to be higher because during the winter months, the cost of delivered raw materials are higher, primarily due to a reduction in 

accessibility during cold and wet weather conditions, which results in our need to extend the procurement radius around our plants. Our raw materials typically have higher moisture content during this period, resulting in lower production levels; moreover, the cost of drying wood fiber increases during periods of lower ambient temperatures given greater energy required in the process of heating. Our operating costs are primarily fixed, resulting in low fixed cost absorption or higher operating cost per metric ton (“MT”). Additionally, our customer contract price mix is typically higher during the second half of the year as we increase the sales volumes delivered to customers using wood pellets for heating.
Human Resources
Our employees are our greatest resource and keeping them safe is considered a moral obligation for all of us. We have been unrelenting in our commitment to our health and safety standards and processes. Moreover, we continue to build and foster diversity and inclusion among our employees and other stakeholders and making a long-lasting, positive impact in the communities in which we operate. As a company, we value keeping promises, acting with integrity, the determination to make a difference, and the qualities of openness, humility, and respect.
Through our human resources practices, we focus on attracting, developing, and retaining talent to help enable our growth consistent with our values. In addition, we apply a talent framework to support our human resources objectives of recruiting and nurturing top talent, strengthening our succession planning to develop a pipeline of future leaders for key roles and driving a culture of accountability through a robust performance management process.
We had 1,386 employees as of December 31, 2022. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any employment-related work stoppages, and we consider relations with our employees to be positive.
We maintain daily 24/7 operations and to do so, we bring Enviva’s best minds, systems, processes, and team back-up culture, together. Enviva finished 2022 with a Total Recordable Incident Rate of .76 compared to an industry average of 3.0. This incident rate is the second lowest in the company's history.
We focus on attracting, developing, and retaining a team of highly talented and motivated employees. We offer our employees competitive pay and benefits including paid time off, multiple healthcare and insurance coverage options including premium free offerings, paid company holidays, and a 401(k) retirement plan. Employee performance is measured in part based on goals that are aligned with our annual objectives, and we recognize that our success is based on the talents and dedication of those we employ. Additionally, we look to support our employees both on and off the job site by offering benefits such as paid parental leave, a wellness reimbursement program, FSA dependent care, paid disability (short term/long term), and educational assistance. All of our full-time employees are bonus eligible and 20% of our employees are currently eligible for equity-based awards under the Enviva Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “LTIP”). We evaluate these programs annually to ensure our employees are compensated fairly and competitively.
In 2022, our commitment to career growth and development led us to deploy various in-person and online courses and presentations to give employees the opportunity to learn new skills, hone existing ones and deepen their understanding of our business as well as expose them to new ideas that challenge their way of thinking. We offered 20 technical skill trainings for our operators in our plants. We hosted our annual program called Enviva Days which is a development initiative focused on driving career development and employee engagement. In 2022, this event included 15 learning sessions over the course of one week. More than 500 Enviva employees participated.
To achieve operational discipline in our hiring efforts, we follow a consistent hiring process across the organization. We recognize the need to fill roles and strive for a time-to-fill rate that aligns with internal benchmarks. Our current hiring process includes a pre-screen interview and cross-functional panel interview. Following recruitment, our onboarding program provides our new hires with the tools and information needed to succeed. These processes helped us maintain a total voluntary turnover rate of 31% against a very challenging labor market.
We are an equal opportunity employer with a commitment to diversity and inclusion. We believe in a workplace that promotes equality, transparency, and accountability. Our policies and procedures seek to foster these values through regular trainings and employee engagement, such as annual trainings for 100% of our employees on workplace conduct and non-discrimination. We strive to engage with the local communities where our operations are based so that we can locate and support a diverse talent pool.
Additional information regarding our human resources initiatives can be found under the “People” section of our 2021 Corporate Sustainability Report which can be found on our website in the Sustainability section.
