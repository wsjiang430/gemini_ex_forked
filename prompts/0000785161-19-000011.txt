Overview of the Company
General
We are a leading provider of integrated healthcare services, offering both facility-based and home-based patient care through our network of inpatient rehabilitation hospitals, home health agencies, and hospice agencies. As of December 31, 2018, our national footprint spans 36 states and Puerto Rico and includes 130 hospitals and 220 home health and 58 hospice locations. We are committed to delivering high-quality, cost-effective, integrated patient care across the healthcare continuum with a primary focus on the post-acute sector. Our home health and hospice agencies also serve patients without a preceding inpatient stay.
In 2018, we undertook a rebranding to reinforce our strategy and position as an integrated provider of facility-based and home-based patient care. As part of the rebranding, we changed our corporate name from HealthSouth Corporation to Encompass Health Corporation and the NYSE ticker symbol for our common stock from “HLS” to “EHC.” Our principal executive offices are located at 9001 Liberty Parkway, Birmingham, Alabama 35242, and the telephone number of the principal executive offices is (205) 967-7116. Our website address is www.encompasshealth.com.
In addition to the discussion here, we encourage the reader to review Item 1A, Risk Factors, Item 2, Properties, and Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, which highlight additional considerations about our company. 
We manage our operations in two operating segments which are also our reportable segments: (1) inpatient rehabilitation and (2) home health and hospice. The table below provides selected operating and financial data for our inpatient rehabilitation hospitals, home health agencies, and hospice agencies.

Inpatient Rehabilitation
We are the nation’s largest owner and operator of inpatient rehabilitation hospitals in terms of patients treated and discharged, revenues, and number of hospitals. We provide specialized rehabilitative treatment on predominantly an inpatient basis. We operate hospitals in 32 states and Puerto Rico, with concentrations in the eastern half of the United States and Texas. In addition to our hospitals, we manage five inpatient rehabilitation units through management contracts. 
Our inpatient rehabilitation hospitals offer specialized rehabilitative care across an array of diagnoses and deliver comprehensive, high-quality, cost-effective patient care services. As participants in the Medicare program, our hospitals must be licensed and certified and otherwise comply with various requirements that are discussed below in the “Sources of Revenues—Medicare Reimbursement—Inpatient Rehabilitation” section. Substantially all (90%) of the patients we serve are admitted from acute care hospitals following physician referrals for specific acute inpatient rehabilitative care. Most of those patients have experienced significant physical and cognitive disabilities or injuries due to medical conditions, such as strokes, hip fractures, and a variety of debilitating neurological conditions, that are generally nondiscretionary in nature and require rehabilitative healthcare services in a facility-based setting. Our teams of highly skilled nurses and physical, occupational, and speech therapists utilize proven technology and clinical protocols with the objective of restoring our patients’ physical and cognitive abilities. Patient care is provided by nursing and therapy staff as directed by physician orders while case managers monitor each patient’s progress and provide documentation and oversight of patient status, achievement of goals, discharge planning, and functional outcomes. Our hospitals provide a comprehensive interdisciplinary clinical approach to treatment that leverages innovative technologies and advanced therapies and leads to superior outcomes.
Home Health and Hospice
Our home health and hospice business is the nation’s fourth largest provider of Medicare-certified skilled home health services in terms of revenues. We operate home health and hospice agencies in 30 states, with concentrations in the Southeast and Texas. As participants in the Medicare program, our agencies must comply with various requirements that are discussed below in the “Sources of Revenues—Medicare Reimbursement—Home Health” and “—Hospice” sections. We acquired a significant portion of our home health and hospice business when we purchased EHHI Holdings, Inc. (“EHHI”) on December 31, 2014. In the acquisition, we acquired 83.3% of the issued and outstanding equity interests of EHHI, and certain members of EHHI management, including April Anthony, its chief executive officer, acquired the remaining interests. See Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, “Liquidity and Capital Resources” for further discussion of the ownership structure of our home health and hospice business.
Our home health agencies provide a comprehensive range of Medicare-certified home care services. These services include, among others, skilled nursing, physical, occupational and speech therapy, medical social work, and home health aide services. We also offer evidence-based specialty programs related to post-operative care, fall prevention, chronic disease management, and transitional care. Home health patients are frequently referred to us following a stay in an acute care or inpatient rehabilitation hospital or other facility, but many patients are referred from primary care settings and specialty physicians without a preceding inpatient stay. Our patients are typically older adults with three or more chronic conditions and significant functional limitations, and require greater than ten medications. Our team of registered nurses, licensed practical nurses, physical, speech and occupational therapists, medical social workers, and home health aides work closely with patients and their families and physicians to deliver patient-centered care plans focused on their needs and their goals. 
We also provide hospice services to terminally ill patients and their families. These in-home services address patients’ physical needs, including pain control and symptom management, and provide emotional and spiritual support. Our hospice care teams consist of physician medical directors, nurses, social workers, chaplains, therapists, home health aides, and volunteers.   
Competitive Strengths
We believe we differentiate ourselves from our competitors based on, among other things, the quality of our clinical outcomes, our cost-effectiveness, our financial strength, and our extensive application of technology. We also believe our competitive strengths discussed below give us the ability to adapt and succeed in a healthcare industry facing the movement toward integrated delivery models and value-based care. For example, we are well-positioned to treat all types of post-acute patients by leveraging our operational expertise across our network of facility- and home-based assets in the event multiple or all post-acute settings (long-term acute care, inpatient rehabilitation, skilled nursing, and home health) transition in the future to site neutral patient criteria. Our hospitals have the physical construct (including aspects such as the therapy gym and training areas), clinical staffing, and operating expertise to address the broad spectrum of needs for higher acuity post-acute patients needing inpatient care. Our home health agencies can often treat patients leaving our or other inpatient facilities who need 
 2

additional post-acute care services in lieu of skilled nursing facility-based care. Additionally, those agencies can serve the lower acuity patients that do not require facility-based care.

• | People. We believe our employees share a steadfast commitment to providing outstanding care to our patients. We undertake significant efforts to ensure our clinical and support staff receives the education and training necessary to provide the highest quality care in the most cost-effective manner. We also have hospital staff trained for all patient acuity levels faced in the post-acute setting. We embrace the Encompass Health Way by setting the standard, leading with empathy, doing what's right, focusing on the positive and ensuring we are stronger together.


• | Change Agility. We have a demonstrated ability to adapt in the face of numerous and significant regulatory and legislative changes. For example, we successfully managed through the significant regulatory, financial, and other challenges associated with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) rule commonly referred to as the “75% Rule” in 2004, reimbursement rate reductions associated with the shift from the 75% Rule to the “60% Rule” in 2007, sequestration beginning in 2013, multiple reimbursement rate reductions associated with healthcare reform and otherwise, introduction of significantly more quality reporting requirements beginning in 2013, and implementation of both voluntary and mandatory alternative payment models in recent years.


• | Strategic Relationships. We have a long and successful history of building strategic relationships with major healthcare systems. Our experience will be important in growing the Company as the industry evolves toward integrated delivery models. We entered into our first joint venture in 1991 with a nationally prominent university’s acute care hospital. We have never unwound a joint venture. Approximately one-third of our inpatient rehabilitation hospitals currently operate as joint ventures with acute care hospitals or systems. Joint ventures with market leading acute care hospitals establish a solid foundation for operating our business within integrated delivery and alternative payment models.

Our combined platform of facility- and home-based services provides us with an opportunity to succeed in value-based purchasing programs and to participate in more coordinated care and integrated delivery payment models, such as accountable care organizations (“ACOs”) and bundled payment arrangements. We believe clinical collaboration between our hospitals and home health agencies offers an excellent means to deliver the quality of care and the cost effectiveness the healthcare partners in these new models seek. We have focused, and will continue to focus, on increasing this collaboration. For additional discussion of our participation in these models, including the Bundled Payments for Care Improvement Advanced initiative, see Item 1A, Risk Factors, and Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, “Executive Overview.”
In 2017, we formed the Post-Acute Innovation Center in collaboration with Cerner Corporation, a global leader in health information technology, to develop enhanced tools to manage patients across the continuum of care. The objective of the Innovation Center is to develop clinical decision support tools and other initiatives that enhance the effective and efficient management of patients across multiple care settings by facilitating high-quality patient care, enhanced care coordination, post-acute network performance and cost management across the post-acute continuum. 
In 2017, we also entered into a three-year strategic sponsorship with the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association on a nationwide basis to increase patient independence after a stroke and reduce stroke mortality through community outreach and information campaigns. This strategic sponsorship is intended to be a three-year project beginning in 2019 to accelerate adoption of the new AHA/ASA Stroke Rehabilitation Guidelines, increase patient awareness of their post-stroke options, and provide practical support to patients and their families to improve recovery outcomes. These Guidelines recommend, among other things, that stroke patients be treated at an inpatient rehabilitation facility, or “IRF,” rather than a skilled nursing facility. In 2018, we worked with the AHA/ASA to develop events and patient, caregiver, and provider tools as well as educational programs to achieve the goals of this joint effort. We expect to implement these events, tools, and educational programs nationwide beginning in 2019.

• | Clinical Expertise and High-Quality Outcomes. We have extensive facility-based and home-based clinical experience from which we have developed best practices and protocols. We believe these clinical best practices and protocols, particularly as leveraged with industry-leading technology, help ensure the delivery of consistently high-quality healthcare services. We have developed a program called “TeamWorks,” which is a series of operations-focused initiatives using identified best practices to reduce inefficiencies and improve performance across a spectrum of operational areas. We believe these initiatives have enhanced, and will continue to enhance,

 3

patient-employee interactions, clinical collaboration, and communication among the patient, the patient’s family, our treatment teams, other care providers, and payors, which, in turn, improves patient outcomes and satisfaction.
Our best practices and protocols have helped our hospitals consistently achieve patient outcomes, such as the rate of discharge to community, that exceed industry averages. Additionally, our hospitals participate in The Joint Commission's Disease-Specific Care Certification Program. Under this program, Joint Commission accredited organizations, like our hospitals, may seek certification for chronic diseases or conditions such as brain injury, stroke, or hip fracture rehabilitation by complying with Joint Commission standards, effectively using evidence-based, clinical practice guidelines to manage and optimize patient care, and using an organized approach to performance measurement and evaluation of clinical outcomes. Obtaining such certifications demonstrates our commitment to excellence in providing disease-specific care. As of December 31, 2018, 114 of our hospitals hold one or more disease-specific certifications, including 112 hospitals with stroke-specific certifications.
In home health, we place a significant emphasis on technology for the purpose of furthering clinical excellence and consistency. We have also developed programs to, among other things, create physician-specific custom treatment protocols and provide care transition from inpatient facilities to home for higher acuity patients. We consistently achieve an acute care readmission rate lower than the industry average along with an average quality of patient care star rating above the industry average. 
Clinical collaboration between our inpatient rehabilitation hospitals and home health agencies furthers our pursuit of quality patient outcomes and improved patient experiences. Institutional programs and advanced treatment protocols connect facility- and home-based care and allow seamless transition of patients across the healthcare continuum. An important component of clinical collaboration has been to place care transition coordinators in markets where we operate both inpatient rehabilitation hospitals and home health agencies, which we refer to as “overlap markets.” These highly skilled professionals collaborate with clinicians and case managers in our hospitals to assess patients who may require home health services and prepare these patients for the care they will receive at home. The coordinators also work with patients’ families to ensure those family members are prepared to bring their loved ones home safely. We believe our clinical collaboration efforts contributed to reductions in discharges to skilled nursing facilities, higher discharges to home, and improved patient satisfaction.

• | Cost Effectiveness. Our size, data-driven business practices, and culture help us provide facility-based and home-based healthcare services on a cost-effective basis. For example, our inpatient rehabilitation hospitals historically have received, on average, a lower per discharge payment from Medicare than the industry average payment while also treating patients with higher average acuity. Additionally, our hospitals historically have received, on average, significantly less Medicare high cost outlier reimbursement than other inpatient rehabilitation providers have. High cost outlier payments are supplemental payments from Medicare intended to cover high cost cases in excess of a fixed-loss threshold amount.

Specifically, we can leverage our comprehensive IT capabilities and centralized administrative functions, identify best practices, utilize proven staffing models, and take advantage of supply chain efficiencies across our extensive platform of operations. At the location level, we also enjoy economies of scale as our hospitals are often larger (more beds) than industry average. Also, we target patient density in the home health markets we serve, which is central to our ability to deliver an efficient cost per visit. In addition, our proprietary information systems, discussed below, aggregate data from our business into a comprehensive reporting package and database used by management in the field and in the home office. Our information systems allow users to analyze data and trends and create custom reports on a timely basis.
With a significant presence in both facility-based and home-based healthcare services, we have the opportunity to take advantage of the broader industry focus on reducing costs. Home-based services, which typically have significantly lower cost structures than facility-based care settings, have increasingly been serving larger populations of higher acuity patients than in the past. Home-based services provide a cost-effective alternative to facility-based care in cases where patient acuities do not require a hospital stay.
In 2018, we furthered several initiatives leveraging our clinical expertise, technology, large post-acute datasets and strategic partnerships in order to further develop our post-acute value proposition for acute care hospitals and payors. We populated and deployed a longitudinal patient record and a community care management platform that we began piloting in one market. These initiatives assist care navigators in the management of patients across the post-acute continuum of care, by following a patient throughout an episode of care and identifying the most appropriate care setting for an individual patient. The longitudinal patient record deployed in our pilot market incorporates daily patient data from our acute care partner’s system as well as our rehabilitation-specific 
 4

electronic clinical information system (“ACE-IT”) and Homecare HomebaseSM and provides our care navigators the capability to assess patient condition and to develop appropriate community care plans. We also developed a 90-day post-acute readmission prediction model that is being piloted in one market in conjunction with our community care management platform. Additionally, we deployed in all of our hospitals ReAct, a program that uses predictive modeling and an extensive proprietary database of our IRF patients in an effort to identify patients at risk for acute care transfer and to implement intervention strategies in the plans of care.

• | Financial Resources. We have a proven track record of generating strong cash flows from operations that have allowed us to successfully pursue our growth strategy, reduce our financial leverage, and make significant shareholder distributions. As of December 31, 2018, we have a strong, well-capitalized balance sheet, including ownership of approximately 70% of our hospital real estate, no significant debt maturities prior to 2022, and ample availability under our revolving credit facility, which along with the cash flows generated from operations should, we believe, provide sufficient support for our business strategy.


• | Advanced Technology. We are focused on developing technology-enabled real-time strategies for the next generation of integrated healthcare. Our digital health strategy is based on leveraging our clinical expertise, our exceptionally large post-acute datasets, and our proven capabilities in enterprise-level electronic medical record technologies, data analytics, data integration, and predictive analytics to drive value-based performance across the healthcare continuum for our patients, our partners, and our payors. We have devoted substantial effort and expertise to leveraging technology to improve patient care and operating efficiencies. We have developed and implemented information technology, such as ACE-IT and our internally developed management reporting system described above (“BEACON”), which we then leverage to enhance our clinical and business processes. ACE-IT allows us to interface with the clinical information systems of acute care hospitals to facilitate patient transfers, reduce readmissions, and enhance patient outcomes. We believe also ACE-IT will improve patient care and safety, streamline operating efficiencies, and enhance staff recruitment and retention, making it a key competitive differentiator. BEACON gives us the ability to build from disparate data sources clinical and business dashboards that contribute to our ability to make data driven decisions in the day-to-day operation of our business and clinical care of our patients. For example, we have a physician dashboard that helps us implement our quality, patient satisfaction, opioid dispensing and other initiatives at the individual physician and patient level.

Members of our home health management team also internally developed Homecare HomebaseSM, an industry-leading, comprehensive information platform designed to manage the entire patient work flow and allow home health providers to process clinical, compliance, financial, and marketing information as well as analyze data and trends for management purposes using custom reports on a timely basis. Our knowledge of Homecare Homebase, of which we are now a licensee, as well as the thorough integration of it into the operating culture allow us to optimize the system’s capability to drive superior clinical, operational, and financial outcomes. Additionally, we offer a number of evidence-based home health specialty programs, including post-operative care, fall prevention, chronic disease management and transitional care.
We believe our information systems allow us to collect, analyze, and share information on a timely basis making us an ideal partner for other healthcare providers in a coordinated care delivery environment. Systems such as ACE-IT and Homecare Homebase allow for interoperability with referral sources and other providers coordinating care. Homecare Homebase also allows us to share valuable data with payors to promote better patient outcomes on a more cost-effective basis. Additionally, we will continue to design and implement information systems to improve our clinical care, including clinical decision support tools and home health care plan optimization tools. 
Patients and Demographic Trends
Demographic trends, such as population aging, should increase long-term demand for the services we provide. While we treat patients of all ages, most of our patients are 65 and older, and the number of Medicare enrollees is expected to grow approximately 3% per year for the foreseeable future. We believe the demand for the services we provide will continue to increase as the U.S. population ages. We believe these factors align with our strengths in, and focus on, post-acute services. In addition, we believe we can address the demand for facility-based and home-based post-acute care services in markets where we currently do not have a presence by constructing or acquiring new hospitals and by acquiring or opening home health and hospice agencies in those extremely fragmented industries.

Strategic Priorities
In 2018, we focused on the following strategic priorities:

• | providing high-quality, cost-effective care to patients in our existing markets;


• | achieving organic growth at our existing inpatient rehabilitation hospitals, home health agencies, and hospice agencies;


• | expanding our services to more patients who require these services by constructing and acquiring hospitals in new markets and acquiring and opening home health and hospice agencies in new markets;


• | making shareholder distributions via common stock dividends and repurchases of our common stock; and


• | positioning the Company for success in the evolving healthcare delivery system.

Total hospital discharges grew 4.6% from 2017 to 2018. Our same-store discharges grew 2.8% during 2018 compared to 2017. Our home health agencies experienced same-store admissions growth of 5.6% in 2018 as well. We entered new inpatient rehabilitation markets and enhanced our geographic coverage in existing markets in 2018 by adding 4 new hospitals, including 2 joint ventures, with 169 licensed beds to our portfolio. We also expanded existing hospitals by 26 licensed beds. Likewise, we added 23 home health locations and 22 hospice locations.
In 2018, we further positioned ourselves for the healthcare industry’s movement to integrated delivery payment models, value-based purchasing, and post-acute site neutrality. We recently completed our company-wide rebranding and name change initiative to reflect and reinforce our expanding national footprint and our strategy to deliver high-quality, cost-effective care across the post-acute continuum. We increased the clinical collaboration rate between our inpatient rehabilitation hospitals and home health locations. We developed and piloted a longitudinal patient record to manage patients across the post-acute continuum and a 90-day post-acute readmission prediction model. We began using patient care navigators to follow a patient throughout an episode of care. We also refined and expanded use of clinical data analytics to further improve patient outcomes and lower cost of care.
Many of our quality and outcome measures remained above both inpatient rehabilitation and home health industry averages. Not only did we treat more patients and enhance outcomes, we did so in a cost-effective manner. For additional discussion of the pursuit of our 2018 strategic priorities, including operating results, growth, and shareholder distributions, as well as our 2019 priorities and business outlook, see Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, “Executive Overview,” “Results of Operations,” and “Liquidity and Capital Resources.”
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 30,060 individuals, of whom approximately 18,280 were full-time employees, in our inpatient rehabilitation business and approximately 10,270 individuals, of whom approximately 7,490 were full-time employees, in our home health and hospice business. We are subject to various state and federal laws that regulate wages, hours, benefits, and other terms and conditions relating to employment. Except for approximately 63 employees at one hospital (approximately 16% of that hospital’s workforce), none of our employees are represented by a labor union as of December 31, 2018. As with most healthcare providers, our labor costs are rising faster than the general inflation rate. In some markets, the lack of availability of medical personnel is a significant operating issue facing healthcare providers. To address this challenge, we will continue to focus on maintaining the competitiveness of our compensation and benefit programs and improving our recruitment, retention, and productivity. Shortages of nurses and other medical personnel, including therapists, may, from time to time, require us to increase use of more expensive temporary personnel, which we refer to as “contract labor,” and other types of premium pay programs.
Competition
Inpatient Rehabilitation. The inpatient rehabilitation industry, outside of our leading position, is highly fragmented. Our inpatient rehabilitation hospitals compete primarily with rehabilitation units, most of which are within acute care hospitals, in the markets we serve. For a list of our markets by state, see the table in Item 2, Properties. There are several privately held companies that compete with us primarily in select geographic markets. In addition, there is a public company that is primarily focused on other post-acute care services but also operates approximately 26 inpatient rehabilitation hospitals. Other providers of post-acute care services may attempt to compete. For example, nursing homes may market themselves as offering certain rehabilitation services even though those nursing homes are not required to offer the same level of care, and are not licensed, as hospitals. Also, acute care hospitals, including those owned or operated by large public companies or not-for-profits that have 
 6

dominant positions in specific markets, may choose to expand their post-acute rehabilitation services. The primary competitive factors in any given market include the quality of care and service provided, the relationship and reputation with managed care and other private payors and the acute care hospitals in the market, and the regulatory barriers to entry in certificate of need states. The ability to work as part of an integrated delivery payment model with other providers, including the ability to deliver quality patient outcomes and cost-effective care, is likely to become an increasingly important factor in competition. See the “Regulation—Relationships with Physicians and Other Providers” and “Regulation—Certificates of Need” sections below for further discussion of some of these factors.
Home Health and Hospice. The home health and hospice services industries are also highly competitive and fragmented. There are more than 11,800 home health agencies and approximately 4,500 hospice agencies nationwide certified to participate in Medicare. We are the fourth largest provider of Medicare-certified skilled home health services in the United States. For a list of our home health markets by state, see the table in Item 2, Properties. Our primary competition comes from locally owned private home health companies or acute care hospitals with adjunct home health services and typically varies from market to market. Providers of home health and hospice services include both not-for-profit and for-profit organizations. There are five public companies, including us, with significant presences in the Medicare-certified home health industry. There are also two large insurance companies with affiliated home health businesses, one of which is one of the largest providers of Medicare-certified skilled home health services. The primary competitive factors in any given market include the quality of care and service provided, the treatment outcomes achieved, the relationship and reputation with managed care and other private payors and the acute care hospitals, physicians, or other referral sources in the market, and the regulatory barriers to entry in certificate of need states. The ability to work as part of an integrated care delivery model with other providers is likely to become an increasingly important factor in competition. For example, we are currently the preferred home health provider in two ACOs serving approximately 24,000 patients. Home health providers with scale, which include the other public companies and insurance companies, may have competitive advantages, including professional management, efficient operations, sophisticated information systems, brand recognition, and large referral bases. 
Regulatory and Reimbursement Challenges
Healthcare is a highly regulated industry facing many well-publicized regulatory and reimbursement challenges. The industry also is facing uncertainty associated with the efforts to identify and implement workable coordinated care and integrated delivery payment models as well as post-acute site neutrality in Medicare reimbursement. The Medicare reimbursement systems for both inpatient rehabilitation and home health are subject to potentially significant changes in the next two years. The future of many aspects of healthcare regulation remains uncertain. Any regulatory or legislative changes impacting the healthcare industry ultimately may affect, among other things, reimbursement of healthcare providers, consumers’ access to coverage of health services, including among non-Medicare aged population segments within commercial insurance markets and Medicaid enrollees, and competition among providers. Changes may also affect the delivery of healthcare services to patients by providers and the regulatory compliance obligations associated with those services.
 Successful healthcare providers are those able to adapt to changes in the regulatory and operating environments, build strategic relationships across the healthcare continuum, and consistently provide high-quality, cost-effective care. We believe we have the necessary capabilities — change agility, strategic relationships, quality of patient outcomes, cost effectiveness, and ability to capitalize on growth opportunities — to adapt to and succeed in a dynamic, highly regulated industry, and we have a proven track record of doing so. For more in-depth discussion of the primary challenges and risks related to our business, particularly the changes in Medicare reimbursement (including the impact of alternative payment models, value-based purchasing initiatives and site neutrality), increased federal compliance and enforcement burdens, and changes to our operating environment resulting from healthcare reform, see “Sources of Revenues—Medicare Reimbursement” and “Regulation” below in this section as well as Item 1A, Risk Factors, and Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, “Executive Overview—Key Challenges.”
Sources of Revenues
We receive payment for patient care services from the federal government (primarily under the Medicare program), managed care plans and private insurers, and, to a considerably lesser degree, state governments (under their respective Medicaid or similar programs) and directly from patients. Revenues and receivables from Medicare are significant to our operations. The federal and state governments establish payment rates as described in more detail below. We negotiate the payment rates with non-governmental group purchasers of healthcare services that are included in “Managed care” in the tables below, including private insurance companies, employers, health maintenance organizations (“HMOs”), preferred provider organizations (“PPOs”), and other managed care plans. Patients are generally not responsible for the difference between established gross charges and amounts reimbursed for such services under Medicare, Medicaid, and other private insurance plans, HMOs, or PPOs but are responsible to the extent of any exclusions, deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance features of 
 7

their coverage. Medicare, through its Medicare Advantage program, offers Medicare-eligible individuals an opportunity to participate in managed care plans. Revenues from Medicare and Medicare Advantage represent approximately 85% of total revenues.
The following tables identify the sources and relative mix of our revenues for the periods stated for each of our business segments:

Medicare Reimbursement
Medicare is a federal program that provides certain hospital and medical insurance benefits to persons aged 65 and over, some disabled persons, and persons with end-stage renal disease. Medicare, through statutes and regulations, establishes reimbursement methodologies and rates for various types of healthcare providers, facilities, and services. Each year, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (“MedPAC”), an independent agency that advises the United States Congress on issues affecting Medicare, makes payment policy recommendations to Congress for a variety of Medicare payment systems including, among others, the inpatient rehabilitation facility prospective payment system (the “IRF-PPS”), the home health prospective payment system (“HH-PPS”), and the hospice prospective payment system (the “Hospice-PPS”). Congress is not obligated to adopt MedPAC recommendations, and, based on outcomes in previous years, there can be no assurance Congress will adopt MedPAC’s recommendations in a given year. However, MedPAC’s recommendations have, and could in the future, become the basis for subsequent legislative or, as discussed below, regulatory action.
The Medicare statutes are subject to change from time to time. For example, in March 2010, President Obama signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (as subsequently amended, the “2010 Healthcare Reform Laws”). In December 2018, a federal district court in Texas invalidated the 2010 Healthcare Reform Laws in their entirety but postponed enforcement of that decision pending appeal. With respect to Medicare reimbursement, the 2010 Healthcare Reform Laws provided for specific reductions to healthcare providers’ annual market basket updates. In August 2011, President Obama signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011 providing for an automatic 2% reduction, or “sequestration,” of Medicare program payments for all 
 8

healthcare providers. Sequestration took effect April 1, 2013 and will continue through 2027 unless Congress and the President take further action. The future of the 2010 Healthcare Reform Laws as well as the nature and substance of any replacement reform legislation enacted remain uncertain. On February 9, 2018, President Trump signed into law the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (the “2018 Budget Act”), which includes several provisions affecting Medicare reimbursement. Among those changes, the 2018 Budget Act mandates the adoption of a new Medicare payment model for home health providers to be effective in 2020. In the future, concerns about the federal deficit and national debt levels could result in enactment of further federal spending reductions, further entitlement reform legislation affecting the Medicare program, or both.
From time to time, Medicare regulations, including reimbursement methodologies and rates, can be further modified by CMS. CMS, subject to its statutory authority, may make some prospective payment system changes, including in response to MedPAC recommendations. For example, CMS recently instituted a rebasing adjustment in the HH-PPS consistent with a MedPAC recommendation. In some instances, CMS’s modifications can have a substantial impact on healthcare providers. In accordance with Medicare laws and statutes, CMS makes annual adjustments to Medicare payment rates in prospective payment systems, including the IRF-PPS and HH-PPS, by what is commonly known as a “market basket update.” CMS may take other regulatory action affecting rates as well. For example, under the 2010 Healthcare Reform Laws, CMS requires IRFs to submit data on certain quality of care measures for the IRF Quality Reporting Program. A facility’s failure to submit the required quality data results in a two percentage point reduction to that facility’s annual market basket increase factor for payments made for discharges in a subsequent Medicare fiscal year. IRFs began submitting quality data to CMS in October 2012. All of our inpatient rehabilitation hospitals have met the reporting deadlines to date resulting in no corresponding reimbursement reductions. Similarly, home health and hospice agencies are also required to submit quality data to CMS each year, and the failure to do so in accordance with the rules will result in a two percentage point reduction in their market basket update. For 2019, we expect no more than six of our home health and hospice agencies will incur a reduction in their reimbursement rates.
We cannot predict the adjustments to Medicare payment rates Congress or CMS may make in the future. Congress, MedPAC, and CMS will continue to address reimbursement rates for a variety of healthcare settings. Any additional downward adjustment to rates or limitations on reimbursement for the types of facilities we operate and services we provide could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. For additional discussion of the risks associated with our concentration of revenues from the federal government or with potential changes to the statutes or regulations governing Medicare reimbursement, including the 2018 Budget Act, see Item 1A, Risk Factors, and Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, “Executive Overview—Key Challenges.”
Although reductions or changes in reimbursement from governmental or third-party payors and regulatory changes affecting our business represent one of the most significant challenges to our business, our operations are also affected by other rules and regulations that indirectly affect reimbursement for our services, such as data coding rules and patient coverage rules and determinations. For example, Medicare providers like us can be negatively affected by the adoption of coverage policies, either at the national or local level, that determine whether an item or service is covered and under what clinical circumstances it is considered to be reasonable and necessary. Current CMS coverage rules require inpatient rehabilitation services to be ordered by a physician and be coordinated by an interdisciplinary team. The interdisciplinary team must meet weekly to review patient status and make any needed adjustments to the individualized plan of care. Qualified personnel must provide the rehabilitation nursing, physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech-language pathology, social services, psychological services, and prosthetic and orthotic services that may be needed. Medicare contractors processing claims for CMS make coverage determinations regarding medical necessity that can represent more restrictive interpretations of the CMS coverage rules. We cannot predict how future CMS coverage rule interpretations or any new local coverage determinations will affect us.
In the ordinary course, Medicare reimbursement claims made by healthcare providers, including inpatient rehabilitation hospitals as well as home health and hospice agencies, are subject to audit from time to time by governmental payors and their agents, such as the Medicare Administrative Contractors (“MACs”) that act as fiscal intermediaries for all Medicare billings, as well as the United States Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (the “HHS-OIG”), CMS, and state Medicaid programs. In addition to those audits conducted by existing MACs, CMS has developed and instituted various Medicare audit programs under which CMS contracts with private companies to conduct claims and medical record audits. Some contractors are paid a percentage of the overpayments recovered. The Recovery Audit Contractors (“RACs”) conduct payment reviews of claims, which can include coding errors, overall billing accuracy, and medical necessity reviews. When conducting an audit, the RACs receive claims data directly from MACs on a monthly or quarterly basis. 
CMS has also established contractors known as the Zone Program Integrity Contractors (“ZPICs”) to conduct audits with a focus on potential fraud and abuse issues. Like the RACs, the ZPICs conduct audits and have the ability to refer matters to the HHS-OIG or the United States Department of Justice. Unlike RACs, however, ZPICs do not receive a specific financial 
 9

incentive based on the amount of the error. CMS has announced its intention to rename ZPICs as Unified Program Integrity Contractors.
As a matter of course, we undertake significant efforts through training, education, and documentation to ensure compliance with coding and medical necessity coverage rules. Despite our belief that our coding and assessment of patients are accurate, audits may lead to assertions that we have been underpaid or overpaid by Medicare or submitted improper claims in some instances, require us to incur additional costs to respond to requests for records and defend the validity of payments and claims, and ultimately require us to refund any amounts determined to have been overpaid. We cannot predict when or how these audit programs will affect us. Any denial of a claim for payment, either as a result of an audit or ordinary course payment review by the MAC, is subject to an appeals process that is currently taking numerous years to complete. For additional discussion of these audits and the risks associated with them, see Item 1A, Risk Factors, and Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, “Executive Overview—Key Challenges.”
A basic summary of current Medicare reimbursement in our business segments follows:
Inpatient Rehabilitation. As discussed above, our inpatient rehabilitation hospitals receive a fixed payment reimbursement amount per discharge under IRF-PPS based on the patient’s rehabilitation impairment category established by the United States Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) and other characteristics and conditions identified by the attending clinicians. In order to qualify for reimbursement under IRF-PPS, our hospitals must comply with various Medicare rules and regulations including documentation and coverage requirements, or specifications as to what conditions must be met to qualify for reimbursement. These requirements relate to, among other things, pre-admission screening, post-admission evaluations, and individual treatment planning that all delineate the role of physicians in ordering and overseeing patient care. For example, a physician must admit each patient and in doing so determine that the patient’s IRF treatment is reasonable and necessary. In addition, to qualify as an IRF under Medicare rules, a facility must be primarily focused on treating patients with one of 13 specified medical conditions that typically require intensive therapy and supervision, such as stroke, brain injury, hip fracture, certain neurological conditions, and spinal cord injury. Specifically, at least 60% of a facility’s patients must suffer from at least one of these 13 conditions, which requirement is known as the “60% Rule.” Also, each patient admitted to an IRF must be able to tolerate a minimum of three hours of therapy per day and must have a registered nurse available 24 hours, each day of the week.
Under IRF-PPS, CMS is required to adjust the payment rates based on an IRF-specific market basket index. The annual market basket update is designed to reflect changes over time in the prices of a mix of goods and services used by IRFs. In setting annual market basket updates, CMS uses data furnished by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for price proxy purposes, primarily in three categories: Producer Price Indexes, Consumer Price Indexes, and Employment Cost Indexes. With IRF-PPS, our inpatient rehabilitation hospitals retain the difference, if any, between the fixed payment from Medicare and their operating costs. Thus, our hospitals benefit from being cost-effective providers.
On July 31, 2017, CMS released its notice of final rulemaking for the fiscal year 2018 IRF-PPS (the “2018 IRF Rule”). In accordance with the Medicare Access and CHIP (Children’s Health Insurance Program) Reauthorization Act of 2015 (“MACRA”), the 2018 Final IRF Rule implemented a net 1.0% market basket increase effective for discharges between October 1, 2017 and September 30, 2018. The 2018 IRF Rule also included other changes that impacted our hospital-by-hospital base rate for Medicare reimbursement. Such changes included, but were not limited to, revisions to the wage index values, changes to case mix-group relative weights and average length of stay values, and updates to the outlier fixed loss threshold. 
On July 31, 2018, CMS released its notice of final rulemaking for fiscal year 2019 IRF-PPS (the “2019 IRF Rule”). The 2019 Final IRF Rule implements a 2.9% market basket update that was reduced by 75 basis points under the requirements of the 2010 Healthcare Reform Laws. The 2010 Healthcare Reform Laws also require the market basket update to be reduced by a productivity adjustment on an annual basis. The productivity adjustments equal the trailing 10-year average of changes in annual economy-wide private nonfarm business multi-factor productivity. The productivity adjustment effective October 1, 2018 decreased the market basket update by 80 basis points.
The 2019 IRF Rule also includes the other hospital-by-hospital pricing changes noted above. Based on our analysis that utilizes, among other things, the acuity of our patients over the 12-month period prior to the 2019 IRF Rule’s release and incorporates other adjustments included in it, we believe the 2019 IRF Rule will result in a net increase to our Medicare payment rates of approximately 1.2% effective October 1, 2018. Additionally, the 2019 IRF Rule finalized a change to the IRF-PPS, effective October 1, 2019, that replaces the FIM™ assessment instrument with new patient assessment measures, commonly referred to as “CARE Tool” measures. This change in how patients are assessed and reported to CMS will require substantial changes to the case mix-group relative weights and average length of stay values, which will in turn impact reimbursement amounts. We and the IRF industry are still assessing the nature and magnitude of any impact this might have on 
 10

aggregate Medicare reimbursements, which impact will depend in part on additional data and updates to be included in future rulemaking by CMS. We will continue to educate and train our staff on the use of the CARE Tool, including the new documentation requirements.
Unlike our inpatient services, our outpatient services are primarily reimbursed under the physician fee schedule of Medicare Part B. On November 1, 2018, CMS released its final notice of rulemaking for the payment policies under the physician fee schedule and other revisions to Part B for calendar year 2019. The provisions of this rule, including the updates to the fee schedule, are not expected to be material to us.
Home Health. Medicare pays home health benefits for patients discharged from a hospital or patients otherwise suffering from chronic conditions that require ongoing but intermittent skilled care. As a condition of participation under Medicare, patients must be homebound (meaning unable to leave their home without a considerable and taxing effort), require intermittent skilled nursing, physical therapy or speech therapy services, or have a continuing need for occupational therapy, and receive treatment under a plan of care established and periodically reviewed by a physician. A physician must document that he or she or a qualifying nurse practitioner has had a face-to-face encounter with the patient and then certify to CMS that a patient meets the eligibility requirements for the home health benefit. Medicare currently pays home health providers under the HH-PPS for each 60-day period of care for each patient. Payments are adjusted based on each patient’s condition and clinical treatment, including the number of therapy visits. This is referred to as the case-mix adjustment. In addition to the case-mix adjustment, payments for periods of care may be adjusted for other reasons, including unusually large (outlier) costs, low-utilization patients (such as those requiring four or fewer visits), and geographic differences in wages. Payments are also made for non-routine medical supplies that are used in treatment. Home health providers typically receive either 50% or 60% of the estimated base payment for the full 60 days for each patient upon submission of the initial claim at the beginning of the episode of care. The estimate is based on the patient’s condition and treatment needs. The provider receives the remaining portion of the payment after the 60-day treatment period, subject to any applicable adjustments. If a patient remains eligible for care after that period, a new 60-day treatment period may begin. There are currently no limits to the number of home health treatment periods an eligible Medicare patient may receive. As discussed below, several changes to the HH-PPS will take place in calendar year 2020.
On November 1, 2017, CMS released its notice of final rulemaking for calendar year 2018 for home health agencies under the HH-PPS (the “2018 HH Rule”). This rule was effective for Medicare episodes ending in calendar year 2018 and provided for a net market basket update of 1.0% as required by MACRA. That update was substantially offset by a nominal case-mix coding intensity reduction of 90 basis points. The 2018 HH Rule also included other pricing changes, such as a reduction to the case-mix weights for certain cases, that impacted our Medicare reimbursement.
On October 31, 2018, CMS released its notice of final rulemaking for calendar year 2019 for home health agencies under the HH-PPS (the “2019 HH Rule”). CMS estimated the rule would increase Medicare payments to home health agencies by 2.2% in 2019. Specifically, the 2019 HH Rule provides for a market basket update of 3.0%, partially offset by a productivity adjustment reduction of 80 basis points and a change in the rural add-on program estimated to result in a reduction of 10 basis points but increased by an estimated 10 basis points associated with a change in outlier patient reimbursement. The 2019 HH Rule also includes other pricing changes, such as a reduction to the case-mix weights for certain cases, that impact our Medicare reimbursement. Based on our analysis, we believe the 2019 HH Rule will result in a net increase to our Medicare home health payment rates of approximately 1.5% effective for episodes ending in calendar year 2019. 
Additionally, pursuant to the requirements of the 2018 Budget Act, the 2019 HH Rule sets out significant changes to the HH-PPS that will be adopted effective for calendar year 2020. The new payment system, referred to as the Patient-Driven Groupings Model (“PDGM”), replaces the current 60-day episode of payment methodology with a 30-day unit of service for home health payment purposes and eliminates therapy usage as a factor in adjusting case-mix weighting. CMS previously proposed but has not yet adopted a 6.4% reduction in the base payment rate for 2020 intended to offset the provider behavioral changes that CMS assumes PDGM will drive. For additional discussion of PDGM, the proposed rate cut, and other regulatory and legislative initiatives that could impact our home health business, see Item 1A, Risk Factors, and Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, “Executive Overview—Key Challenges.”
Hospice. Medicare pays hospice benefits for patients with life expectancies of six months or less, as documented by the patient’s physician(s). Under Medicare rules, patients seeking hospice benefits must agree to forgo curative treatment for their terminal medical conditions. For each day a patient elects hospice benefits, Medicare pays an adjusted daily rate based on patient location, and payments represent a prospective per diem amount tied to one of four different categories or levels of care: routine home care, continuous home care, inpatient respite care, and general inpatient care. Medicare hospice reimbursements to each provider are also subject to two annual caps, one limiting total hospice payments based on the average annual payment per beneficiary and another limiting payments based on the number of days of inpatient care billed by the hospice provider. 
 11

There are currently no limits to the number of hospice benefit periods an eligible Medicare patient may receive, and a patient may revoke the benefit at any time.
On August 1, 2018, CMS released its notice of final rulemaking for fiscal year 2019 for hospice agencies under the hospice-PPS (the “2019 Hospice Rule”). The final rule impacts hospice payments between October 1, 2019 and September 30, 2019. The 2019 Hospice Rule provides for a net market basket update of 1.8%, and we believe that update is indicative of the change we will see in our Medicare hospice payment rates through September 30, 2019.
For additional discussion of matters and risks related to reimbursement, see Item 1A, Risk Factors.
Managed Care and Other Discount Plans
We negotiate payment rates with certain large group purchasers of healthcare services, including Medicare Advantage, managed care plans, private insurance companies, and third-party administrators. Managed care contracts typically have terms between one and three years, although we have a number of managed care contracts that automatically renew each year (with pre-defined rate increases) unless a party elects to terminate the contract. In 2018, typical rate increases for our inpatient rehabilitation contracts ranged from 2-4% and for our home health and hospice contracts ranged from 0-2%. We cannot provide any assurance we will continue to receive increases in the future. Our managed care staff focuses on establishing and re-negotiating contracts that provide equitable reimbursement for the services provided. 
Medicaid Reimbursement
Medicaid is a jointly administered and funded federal and state program that provides hospital and medical benefits to qualifying individuals who are deemed unable to afford healthcare. As the Medicaid program is administered by the individual states under the oversight of CMS in accordance with certain regulatory and statutory guidelines, there are substantial differences in reimbursement methodologies and coverage policies from state to state. Many states have experienced shortfalls in their Medicaid budgets and are implementing significant cuts in Medicaid reimbursement rates. Additionally, certain states control Medicaid expenditures through restricting or eliminating coverage of some services. Continuing downward pressure on Medicaid payment rates could cause a decline in that portion of our Net operating revenues. However, for the year ended December 31, 2018, Medicaid payments represented only 2.6% of our consolidated Net operating revenues. In certain states in which we operate, we are experiencing an increase in Medicaid patients, partially the result of expanded coverage consistent with the intent of the 2010 Healthcare Reform Laws. For additional discussion, see Item 1A, Risk Factors, “Changes in our payor mix or the acuity of our patients could adversely impact our revenues or our profitability.”
Cost Reports
Because of our participation in Medicare and Medicaid, we are required to meet certain financial reporting requirements. Federal and, where applicable, state regulations require the submission of annual cost reports covering the revenue, costs, and expenses associated with the services provided by inpatient hospital, home health, and hospice providers to Medicare beneficiaries and Medicaid recipients. These annual cost reports are subject to routine audits which may result in adjustments to the amounts ultimately determined to be due to us under these reimbursement programs. These audits are used for determining if any under- or over-payments were made to these programs and to set payment levels for future years. Medicare also makes retroactive adjustments to payments for certain low-income patients after comparing subsequently published statistical data from CMS to the cost report data. We cannot predict what retroactive adjustments, if any, will be made, but we do not anticipate these adjustments will have a material impact on us.
Regulation
The healthcare industry is subject to significant federal, state, and local regulation that affects our business activities by controlling the reimbursement we receive for services provided, requiring licensure or certification of our operations, regulating our relationships with physicians and other referral sources, regulating the use of our properties, and controlling our growth. We are also subject to the broader federal and state regulations that prohibit fraud and abuse in the delivery of healthcare services. Congress and DOJ have historically focused on fraud and abuse in healthcare. Since the 1980s, a steady stream of changes have stiffened penalties or made it easier for DOJ to impose liability on companies and individuals, and the pace of these changes has only been increasing. The 2018 Budget Act continues this emphasis by increasing the criminal and civil penalties that can be imposed for violating federal health care laws. As a healthcare provider, we are subject to periodic audits, examinations and investigations conducted by, or at the direction of, government investigative and oversight agencies. Failure to comply with applicable federal and state healthcare regulations can result in a provider’s exclusion from participation in government reimbursement programs and in substantial civil and criminal penalties.
 12

We undertake significant effort and expense to provide the medical, nursing, therapy, and ancillary services required to comply with local, state, and federal regulations, as well as, for most facilities, accreditation standards of The Joint Commission and, for some facilities, the Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities. We also maintain accreditation for our home health and hospice agencies where required and in other instances where it facilitates more efficient Medicare enrollment. The Community Health Accreditation Program is the most common accrediting organization for our agencies. Accredited facilities and agencies are subject to periodic resurvey to ensure the standards are being met.
We maintain a comprehensive ethics and compliance program to promote conduct and business practices that meet or exceed requirements under laws, regulations, and industry standards. The program monitors the Company’s performance on and raises awareness of various regulatory requirements among employees and emphasizes the importance of complying with governmental laws and regulations. As part of the compliance program, we provide annual compliance training to our employees, Board members, Medical Directors, vendors, and other non-employees that operate within our hospitals, and require all employees to report any violations to their supervisor or another person of authority or through a toll-free telephone hotline. Another integral part of our compliance program is a policy of non-retaliation against employees who report compliance concerns.
Licensure and Certification
Healthcare facility construction and operation are subject to numerous federal, state, and local regulations relating to, among other things, the adequacy of medical care, equipment, personnel, operating policies and procedures, acquisition and dispensing of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances, infection control, maintenance of adequate records and patient privacy, fire prevention, and compliance with building codes and environmental protection laws. Our inpatient rehabilitation hospitals are subject to periodic inspection and other reviews by governmental and non-governmental certification authorities to ensure continued compliance with the various standards necessary for facility licensure. All of our hospitals are required to be licensed.
In addition, inpatient rehabilitation hospitals must be certified by CMS to participate in the Medicare program and generally must be certified by Medicaid state agencies to participate in Medicaid programs. Certification and participation in these programs involve numerous regulatory obligations. For example, hospitals must treat at least 30 patients free-of-charge prior to certification and eligibility for Medicare reimbursement. Once certified by Medicare, hospitals undergo periodic on-site surveys and revalidations in order to maintain their certification. All of our inpatient hospitals participate in the Medicare program.
Our home health and hospice agencies are each licensed under applicable law, certified by CMS for participation in the Medicare program, and generally certified by the applicable state Medicaid agencies to participate in those programs.
Failure to comply with applicable certification requirements may make our hospitals and agencies, as the case may be, ineligible for Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement. In addition, Medicare or Medicaid may seek retroactive reimbursement from noncompliant providers or otherwise impose sanctions for noncompliance. Non-governmental payors often have the right to terminate provider contracts if the provider loses its Medicare or Medicaid certification.
The 2010 Healthcare Reform Laws added new screening requirements and associated fees for all Medicare providers. The screening of employees with patient access must include a licensure check and may include other procedures such as fingerprinting, criminal background checks, unscheduled and unannounced site visits, database checks, and other screening procedures prescribed by CMS.
We have developed operational systems to oversee compliance with the various standards and requirements of the Medicare program and have established ongoing quality assurance activities; however, given the complex nature of governmental healthcare regulations, there can be no assurance Medicare, Medicaid, or other regulatory authorities will not allege instances of noncompliance. A determination by a regulatory authority that a facility or agency is not in compliance with applicable requirements could also lead to the assessment of fines or other penalties, loss of licensure, exclusion from participation in Medicare and Medicaid, and the imposition of requirements that the offending facility or agency takes corrective action.
Certificates of Need
In some states and U.S. territories where we operate, the construction or expansion of facilities, the acquisition of existing facilities or agencies, or the introduction of new beds or inpatient, home health, and hospice services may be subject to review by and prior approval of state regulatory bodies under a “certificate of need,” or “CON,” law. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 52% of our licensed beds and 27% of our home health and hospice locations are in states or U.S. territories that 
 13

have CON laws. CON laws require a reviewing authority or agency to determine the public need for additional or expanded healthcare facilities and services. These laws also generally require approvals for capital expenditures involving inpatient rehabilitation hospitals if such capital expenditures exceed certain thresholds. In addition, CON laws in some states require us to abide by certain charity care commitments as a condition for approving a CON. Any instance where we are subject to a CON law, we must obtain it before acquiring, opening, reclassifying, or expanding a healthcare facility, starting a new healthcare program, or opening a new home health or hospice agency.
We potentially face opposition any time we initiate a project requiring a new or amended CON or seek to acquire an existing CON. This opposition may arise either from competing national or regional companies or from local hospitals, agencies, or other providers which file competing applications or oppose the proposed CON project. Opposition to our applications may delay or prevent our future addition of beds, hospitals, or agencies in given markets or increase our costs in seeking those additions. The necessity for these approvals serves as a barrier to entry and has the potential to limit competition for us (in markets where we hold a CON) and for other providers (in markets where we are seeking a CON). We have generally been successful in obtaining CONs or similar approvals, although there can be no assurance we will achieve similar success in the future, and the likelihood of success varies by locality and state.
False Claims
The federal False Claims Act (the “FCA”) prohibits the knowing presentation of a false claim to the United States government and provides for penalties equal to three times the actual amount of any overpayments plus up to $23,000 per claim. Federal civil penalties will be adjusted to account for inflation each year. In addition, the FCA allows private persons, known as “relators,” to file complaints under seal and provides a period of time for the government to investigate such complaints and determine whether to intervene in them and take over the handling of all or part of such complaints. The government and relators may also allege violations of the FCA for the knowing and improper failure to report and refund amounts owed to the government in a timely manner following identification of an overpayment. This is known as a “reverse false claim.” The government deems identification of the overpayment to occur when a person has, or should have through reasonable diligence, determined that an overpayment was received and quantified the overpayment.
Because we perform thousands of similar procedures a year for which we are reimbursed by Medicare and other federal payors and there is a relatively long statute of limitations, a billing error, cost reporting error or disagreement over physician medical judgment could result in significant civil or criminal penalties under the FCA. Many states have also adopted similar laws relating to state government payments for healthcare services. The 2010 Healthcare Reform Laws amended the FCA to expand the definition of false claim, to make it easier for the government to initiate and conduct investigations, to enhance the monetary reward to relators where prosecutions are ultimately successful, and to extend the statute of limitations on claims by the government. The federal government has become increasingly aggressive in asserting that incidents of erroneous billing or record keeping represent FCA violations and in challenging the medical judgment of independent physicians as the basis for FCA allegations. Furthermore, well-publicized enforcement actions indicate that the federal government has increasingly sought to use statistical sampling to extrapolate allegations to larger pools of claims or to infer liability without proving knowledge of falsity of individual claims. For additional discussion, see Item 1A, Risk Factors, and Note 17, Contingencies and Other Commitments, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Relationships with Physicians and Other Providers
Anti-Kickback Law. Various state and federal laws regulate relationships between providers of healthcare services, including management or service contracts and investment relationships. Among the most important of these restrictions is a federal law prohibiting the offer, payment, solicitation, or receipt of remuneration by individuals or entities to induce referrals of patients for services reimbursed under the Medicare or Medicaid programs (the “Anti-Kickback Law”). The 2010 Healthcare Reform Laws amended the federal Anti-Kickback Law to provide that proving violations of this law does not require proving actual knowledge or specific intent to commit a violation. Another amendment made it clear that Anti-Kickback Law violations can be the basis for claims under the FCA. These changes and those described above related to the FCA, when combined with other recent federal initiatives, are likely to increase investigation and enforcement efforts in the healthcare industry generally. In addition to standard federal criminal and civil sanctions, including imprisonment and penalties of up to $100,000 for each violation plus tripled damages for improper claims, violators of the Anti-Kickback Law may be subject to exclusion from the Medicare and/or Medicaid programs. Federal civil penalties will be adjusted to account for inflation each year. In 1991, the HHS-OIG issued regulations describing compensation arrangements that are not viewed as illegal remuneration under the Anti-Kickback Law. Those regulations provide for certain safe harbors for identified types of compensation arrangements that, if fully complied with, assure participants in the particular arrangement that the HHS-OIG will not treat that participation as a criminal offense under the Anti-Kickback Law or as the basis for an exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs or the imposition of civil sanctions. Failure to fall within a safe harbor does not constitute a violation of the Anti-Kickback Law, but the HHS-OIG has indicated failure to fall within a safe harbor may subject an arrangement to increased scrutiny. A violation of 
 14

the Anti-Kickback Law by us or one or more of our joint ventures could have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Even the assertion of a violation could have an adverse effect upon our stock price or reputation.
Some of our rehabilitation hospitals are owned through joint ventures with institutional healthcare providers that may be in a position to make or influence referrals to our hospitals. In addition, we have a number of relationships with physicians and other healthcare providers, including management or service contracts. Some of these investment relationships and contractual relationships may not fall within the protection offered by a safe harbor. Despite our compliance and monitoring efforts, there can be no assurance violations of the Anti-Kickback Law will not be asserted in the future, nor can there be any assurance our defense against any such assertion would be successful.
For example, we have entered into agreements to manage our hospitals that are owned by joint ventures. Most of these agreements incorporate a percentage-based management fee. Although there is a safe harbor for personal services and management contracts, this safe harbor requires, among other things, the aggregate compensation paid to the manager over the term of the agreement be set in advance. Because our management fee may be based on a percentage of revenues, the fee arrangement may not meet this requirement. However, we believe our management arrangements satisfy the other requirements of the safe harbor for personal services and management contracts and comply with the Anti-Kickback Law.
Physician Self-Referral Law. The federal law commonly known as the “Stark law” and CMS regulations promulgated under the Stark law prohibit physicians from making referrals for “designated health services” including inpatient and outpatient hospital services, physical therapy, occupational therapy, radiology services, and home health services, to an entity in which the physician (or an immediate family member) has an investment interest or other financial relationship, subject to certain exceptions. The Stark law also prohibits those entities from filing claims or billing Medicare for those referred services. Violators of the Stark law and regulations may be subject to recoupments, civil monetary sanctions (up to $25,000 for each violation and assessments up to three times the amount claimed for each prohibited service) and exclusion from any federal, state, or other governmental healthcare programs. The statute also provides a penalty of up to $162,000 for a circumvention scheme. Federal civil penalties will be adjusted to account for inflation each year. There are statutory exceptions to the Stark law for many of the customary financial arrangements between physicians and providers, including personal services contracts and leases. However, in order to be afforded protection by a Stark law exception, the financial arrangement must comply with every requirement of the applicable exception.
Under the 2010 Healthcare Reform Laws, the exception to the Stark law that currently permits physicians to refer patients to hospitals in which they have an investment or ownership interest has been dramatically limited by providing that only physician-owned hospitals with a provider agreement in place on December 31, 2010 are exempt from the general ban on self-referral. Existing physician-owned hospitals are prohibited from increasing the physician ownership percentage in the hospital after March 23, 2010. Additionally, physician-owned hospitals are prohibited from increasing the number of licensed beds after March 23, 2010, except when certain market and regulatory approval conditions are met. Currently, we have no hospitals that would be considered physician-owned under this law.
The complexity of the Stark law and the associated regulations and their associated strict liability provisions are a challenge for healthcare providers, who do not always have the benefit of significant regulatory or judicial interpretation of these laws and regulations. We attempt to structure our relationships to meet one or more exceptions to the Stark law, but the regulations implementing the exceptions are detailed and complex. Accordingly, we cannot assure that every relationship complies fully with the Stark law.
Additionally, no assurances can be given that any agency charged with enforcement of the Stark law and regulations might not assert a violation under the Stark law, nor can there be any assurance our defense against any such assertion would be successful or that new federal or state laws governing physician relationships, or new interpretations of existing laws governing such relationships, might not adversely affect relationships we have established with physicians or result in the imposition of penalties on us. A violation of the Stark law by us could have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Even the assertion of a violation could have an adverse effect upon our stock price or reputation.
HIPAA
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, commonly known as “HIPAA,” broadened the scope of certain fraud and abuse laws by adding several criminal provisions for healthcare fraud offenses that apply to all health benefit programs. HIPAA also added a prohibition against incentives intended to influence decisions by Medicare or Medicaid beneficiaries as to the provider from which they will receive services. In addition, HIPAA created new enforcement mechanisms to combat fraud and abuse, including the Medicare Integrity Program, and an incentive program under which 
 15

individuals can receive a monetary reward for providing information on Medicare fraud and abuse that leads to the recovery of at least Medicare funds. Penalties for violations of HIPAA include civil and criminal monetary penalties. The HHS Office of Civil Rights (“HHS-OCR”) implemented a permanent HIPAA audit program for healthcare providers nationwide in 2016. As of December 31, 2018, we have not been selected for audit.
HIPAA and related HHS regulations contain certain administrative simplification provisions that require the use of uniform electronic data transmission standards for certain healthcare claims and payment transactions submitted or received electronically. HIPAA regulations also regulate the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health-related information, whether communicated electronically, on paper, or orally. The regulations provide patients with significant rights related to understanding and controlling how their health information is used or disclosed and require healthcare providers to implement administrative, physical, and technical practices to protect the security of individually identifiable health information that is maintained or transmitted electronically.
With the enactment of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (“HITECH”) Act as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, the privacy and security requirements of HIPAA have been modified and expanded. The HITECH Act applies certain of the HIPAA privacy and security requirements directly to business associates of covered entities. The modifications to existing HIPAA requirements include: expanded accounting requirements for electronic health records, tighter restrictions on marketing and fundraising, and heightened penalties and enforcement associated with noncompliance. Significantly, the HITECH Act also establishes new mandatory federal requirements for notification of breaches of security involving protected health information. HHS-OCR is responsible for enforcing the requirement that covered entities notify any individual whose protected health information has been improperly acquired, accessed, used, or disclosed. In certain cases, notice of a breach is required to be made to HHS and media outlets. The heightened penalties for noncompliance range from $100 to $50,000 per violation for most violations. In the event of violations due to willful neglect that are not corrected within 30 days, penalties start at $50,000 per violation and are not subject to a per violation statutory maximum. All penalties are subject to a $1,500,000 cap for multiple identical violations in a single calendar year. Willful neglect could include the failure to conduct a security risk assessment or adequately implement HIPAA compliance policies.
On January 17, 2013, the HHS-OCR issued a final rule, with a compliance date of September 23, 2013, to implement the HITECH Act and make other modifications to the HIPAA and HITECH regulations. This rule expanded the potential liability for a breach involving protected health information to cover some instances where a subcontractor is responsible for the breaches and that individual or entity was acting within the scope of delegated authority under the related contract or engagement. The final rule generally defines “breach” to mean the acquisition, access, use or disclosure of protected health information in a manner not permitted by the HIPAA privacy standards, which compromises the security or privacy of protected health information. Under the final rule, improper acquisition, access, use, or disclosure is presumed to be a reportable breach, unless the potentially breaching party can demonstrate a low probability that protected health information has been compromised. 
In addition, there are numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives at the federal and state levels addressing patient privacy concerns. Healthcare providers will continue to remain subject to any federal or state privacy-related laws that are more restrictive than the privacy regulations issued under HIPAA. These laws vary and could impose additional penalties. HHS-OIG and other regulators have also increasingly interpreted laws and regulations in a manner as to increase exposure of healthcare providers to allegations of noncompliance. Any actual or perceived violation of privacy-related laws and regulations, including HIPAA and the HITECH Act, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
Civil Monetary Penalties Law
Under the Civil Monetary Penalties Law, HHS may impose civil monetary penalties on healthcare providers that present, or cause to be presented, ineligible reimbursement claims for services. The 2018 Budget Act increased the civil monetary penalties, which vary depending on the offense from $5,000 to $100,000 per violation, plus treble damages for the amount at issue and may include exclusion from federal health care programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. The penalties will be adjusted annually to account for inflation. HHS may seek to impose monetary penalties under this law for, among other things, offering inducements to beneficiaries for program services and filing false or fraudulent claims.
