Overview
 
Hancock Jaffe Laboratories, Inc. is a development stage company developing tissue based solutions that are designed to be life sustaining or life enhancing for patients with cardiovascular disease, and peripheral arterial and venous disease. HJLI’s products are being developed to address large unmet medical needs by either offering treatments where none currently exist or by substantially increasing the existing standards of care. Our two lead products which we are developing are the VenoValve®, a porcine based device to be surgically implanted in the deep venous system of the leg to treat a debilitating condition called chronic venous insufficiency (“CVI”), and the CoreoGraft®, a bovine based conduit to be used to revascularize the heart during coronary artery bypass graft (“CABG”) surgeries. Our third product is a Bioprosthetic Heart Valve (“BHV”) which has the potential to be used for pediatric heart valve recipients. All of our current products are being developed for approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). We currently receive tissue for our products from two domestic suppliers and one international supplier. Our current business model is to license, sell, or enter into strategic alliances with large medical device companies with respect to our products, either prior to or after FDA approval. For example, we developed, manufactured, and obtained FDA pre-market approval for the ProCol Vascular Bioprosthesis, a product for hemodialysis vascular access, which we sold to LeMaitre Vascular in March of 2016. Our current senior management team has been affiliated with more than 80 products that have received FDA approval or CE marking. We currently lease a 14,507 sq. ft manufacturing facility in Irvine, California, where we manufacture products for our clinical trials and which was FDA certified for commercial manufacturing of product.

VenoValve
 
Background
 
Chronic venous disease (“CVD”) is the world’s most prevalent chronic disease. CVD is generally classified using a standardized system known as CEAP (clinical, etiological, anatomical, and pathophysiological). The CEAP system consists of seven clinical classifications (C0 to C6) with C5 to C6 being the most severe cases of CVD.
 
Chronic Venous Insufficiency (“CVI”) is a subset of CVD and is generally used to describe patients with C4 to C6 CVD. CVI is a condition that affects the venous system of the leg causing pain, swelling, edema, skin changes, and ulcerations. The venous vasculature of the human leg includes the superficial venous system, the deep vein system, and the perforator system which connects the superficial veins and deep veins. In order for blood to return to the heart from the foot, ankle, and lower leg, the calf muscle pushes the blood up the veins of the leg and through a series of one-way valves. Each valve is supposed to open as blood passes through, and then close as blood moves up the leg to the next valve. CVI has two primary causes: obstruction, which occurs when a blood clot in the veins of the leg hardens and prevents the free flow of blood; and valvular incompetence which is usually the result of injury to the valves from blood clots, which occurs when the one-way valves in the leg do not close as they should, causing blood to flow in the wrong direction (reflux) and to pool in the lower leg, resulting in increased venous pressure (venous hypertension). CVI can occur in the superficial vein system, the deep vein system, or in both. The initial version of the VenoValve is being developed to treat CVI resulting from valvular incompetence in the deep vein system of the leg.
 
Estimates indicate that approximately 4.8 million people in the U.S. have C5 to C6 CVI including patients that develop venous leg ulcers from CVI (C6 patients). Over one million new severe cases of CVI occur each year in the U.S., mostly from patients who have experienced a deep venous blood clot. Of those patients suffering from severe CVI, approximately 55% (2.4 million) have reflux in the deep vein system, or both the deep vein system and the superficial vein system. The average patient seeking treatment of a venous ulcer spends as much as $30,000 a year on wound care, and the total direct medical costs from venous ulcer sufferers in the U.S. has been estimated to exceed $38 billion a year. Aside from the direct medical costs, severe CVI sufferers experience a significantly reduced quality of life. Daily activities such as preparing meals, housework, and personal hygiene (washing and bathing) become difficult due to reduced mobility. For many severe CVI sufferers, intense pain, which frequently occurs at night, prevents patients from getting adequate sleep. Severe CVI sufferers are known to miss about 40% more work days than the average worker. A high percentage of venous ulcer patients experience severe itching, leg swelling, and an odorous discharge. Wound dressing changes which occur several times a week can be extremely painful. In addition, venous ulcers are very difficult to heal, and a significant percentage of venous ulcers remain unhealed for more than a year. Even if healed, recurrence rates for venous ulcers are known to be high (20% to 40%) within the first year.

The Opportunity
 
The VenoValve is a porcine based valve developed at HJLI to be implanted in the deep vein system of the leg. By reducing reflux, and lowering venous hypertension, the VenoValve has the potential to reduce or eliminate the symptoms of deep venous, severe CVI, including venous leg ulcers. Initially, the VenoValve will be surgically implanted into the patient on an outpatient basis via a 5 to 6 inch incision in the upper thigh.
 
There are presently no medical or nonsurgical treatments for reflux occurring in the deep vein system. Compression garments or constant leg elevation address the symptoms, but ignore the underlying cause. Compliance with compression garments and leg elevation is extremely low, especially among the elderly. When CVI is isolated to the superficial veins, ablation or surgical excision of the affected saphenous vein is an option. For the deep vein system, valve transplants have been attempted but with very-poor results. Another potential option, the creation of valves using fibrous tissue, has only been performed in few centers worldwide. We believe that the reestablishment of proper direction of venous flow to the heart is the only reasonable remedy to the problem of reflux based CVI. Currently, however, there is no known devices or medicines available that would restore venous flow in the deep venous system.
 
The initial potential U.S. market for the first iteration of the VenoValve are the 2.6 million severe CVI sufferers with deep venous reflux. Future iterations of the VenoValve may also be appropriate for the superficial vein system, which would increase the potential market to all of the 4.8 million severe CVI sufferers with deep vein or superficial vein reflux.
 
Clinical Status
 
HJLI has had several Pre-FDA meetings to discuss the pre-clinical and clinical pathway for FDA approval for the VenoValve. Preclinical prototype testing, including in vivo animal studies, and in vitro hemodynamic studies, have demonstrated that the VenoValve mimics the function of a normal functioning venous valve. In preclinical studies, the VenoValve has passed the following areas: hemolysis, complement activation, platelet/leukocyte, thrombogenicity, cytotoxicity, and corrosion resistance. Moreover, the VenoValve has functioned normally in animals as shown by venograms as well as with intravascular ultrasound evaluations, and has also functioned normally under various conditions in hemodynamic testing. Ascending and descending venography of the VenoValve in pre-clinical studies has demonstrated competency of the valve as well as being open in appropriate flow patterns.
 
Based upon feedback from the FDA, we agreed to conduct a small first-in-human study of between 5 to 10 patients for the VenoValve overseas prior to initiating our pivotal U.S. trial. The first-in-human study will provide us with valuable feedback to make any necessary product modifications or adjustments to our surgical implantation procedures prior to conducting our U.S. pivotal trial.
 
In December of 2018, we received regulatory approval from Instituto Nacional de Vigilancia de Medicamentos y Alimentos (“INVIMA”), the Colombian equivalent of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, for our first-in-human trial for the VenoValve. On February 19, 2019, HJLI announced that the first VenoValve was successfully implanted in a patient in Bogota, Colombia, that the VenoValve appears to be functioning as it should, and that there were no signs of any early adverse events. After continuing to follow the first patient for a few weeks, additional implantations are scheduled to take place in Bogota in March of 2019. HJLI expects preliminary results from the first-in-human study to be made public in June of 2019, with additional study results to be made available in the fourth quarter of 2019.
 
Patients in the first-in-human trial will be monitored at regular intervals. Endpoints for the first-in-human VenoValve study will include improvements in reflux time, as well as rVCSS measurements, VAS scores, and VEINES scores, three well known clinical assessments for venous disease and assessments of improvement in the patient’s quality of life and reduction in pain. Duplex scans will be used to measure reflux time. A duplex scan, also known as a doppler test with ultrasound, is a non-invasive evaluation of blood flow through veins and arteries. On average, patients without CVI have reflux times of about 1 second, with reflux times increasing with the increasing severity of the disease. Improvements in reflux times will be expressed as a percentage of the original duplex measurement.

The rVCSS is used to measure changes in venous disease severity and response to treatment and includes ten descriptors or subcategories of venous disease which are rated from 0 to 3 by the clinician. Once an initial baseline rVCSS is established for each patient, changes in rVCSS scores will be tracked and may be expressed as a percentage change from the original or previous scoring. The VAS or Visual Analogue Scale is widely used in clinical research to measure intensity and frequency of pain. Scores are marked along a continuum between “no pain” and “worst pain”. VEINES is a disease specific, quality of life measurement associated with venous ulcers. The VEINES instrument consists of 35 items in two categories that generate two summary scores: a quality-of-life questionnaire (VEINES-QOL) comprising of 25 items that quantify disease effect on quality of life; and a symptom questionnaire (VEINES-Sym) which consists of 10 items that measure physical symptoms. In addition to being painful, prone to infection, and hampering mobility, venous ulcers are known to impact work capacity, social activity, self-care and personal hygiene, and to cause depression, anxiety, and social isolation.
 
Once HJLI has accumulated sufficient positive data from the first-in-human VenoValve trial, we will present the data to the FDA and apply for an investigational device exemption (“IDE”) to conduct the U.S. pivotal trial. The U.S. pivotal trial is expected to take approximately one year.
 
CoreoGraft
 
Background
 
Heart disease is the leading cause of death among men and women in the U.S. accounting for about 1 in every 4 deaths. Coronary heart disease is the most common type of heart disease, killing over 370,000 people each year. Coronary heart disease occurs when arteries around the heart become blocked or occluded, in most cases by plaque. Although balloon angioplasty with or without cardiac stents have become the norm if one or two arteries are blocked, coronary artery bypass surgery remains the treatment of choice for patients with multiple blocked arteries. Approximately 200,000 coronary artery bypass graft (“CABG”) surgeries take place each year in the U.S. In the U.S., CABG surgeries are the most commonly performed cardiac procedure. CABG surgeries alone account for 54% of all cardiac surgeries, and CABG surgeries when combined with valve replacement surgeries account for approximately 62% of all cardiac surgeries. The next largest category accounts for 10% of cardiac surgeries. The number of CABG surgeries are expected to increase as the population continues to age. On average, 3 to 4 grafts are used for each CABG surgery.
 
Although CABG surgeries are invasive, improved surgical techniques over the years have lowered the fatality rate from CABAG surgeries to between 1% and 3% prior to discharge from the hospital. Arteries around heart are accessed via an incision along the sternum known as a sternotomy. Once the incision is made, the sternum (chest) is divided (“cracked”) to access the heart and its surrounding arteries. Traditionally, the patient’s heart was stopped prior to the graft procedure and the patient was placed on a heart-lung bypass machine. Once the grafts are in place, the art was restarted using electric shock. In recent years, some doctors have begun to perform the CABG procedure “off -pump”, meaning that CABG surgeries are performed without stooping the patient’s heart and without the need for the heart lung bypass machine. In 2016, approximately 13% of the CABG surgeries were performed off-pump.
 
CABG surgery is relatively safe and effective. In most instances, doctors prefer to use the left internal memory artery (“LIMA”), an artery running inside the ribcage and close to the sternum, to re-vascularize the left side of the heart. Use of the LIMA to revascularize the left descending coronary artery (known as the “widow maker”) has become the gold standard for revascularizing the left side of the heart during CABG surgeries. For the right side of the heart, and where additional grafts are needed on the left side, the current standard of care is to harvest the saphenous vein from the patient’s leg to be cut into pieces and used as bypass grafts around the heart. Unfortunately, saphenous vein grafts (“SVGs”) are not nearly as effective as the LIMA for revascularizing the heart. In fact, SVGs continue to be the weak link for CABG surgeries.

The saphenous vein harvest procedure is itself invasive. Either a long incision is made along the inner leg of the patient to harvest the vein, or the saphenous vein is extracted endoscopically. Regardless of the type of bypass procedure, bypass graft harvest remains an invasive and complication prone aspect of the CABG procedure. Present standard-of-care complications are described in recent published reports in major medical journals. The percentage of complications from the harvest procedure can be as high as 24%. This is mainly due to non-healing of the saphenous wound or development of infection in the area of the saphenous vein harvest site.
 
While the LIMA is known for excellent short term and long term patency rates, studies indicate that between 10% and 40% percent of saphenous vein grafts that are used as conduits for CABAG surgeries fail within the first year after the CABG surgery. A significant percentage fail within the first 30 days. At 10 years, the SVG failure rate can be as high as 75%. When a graft fails, it becomes blocked or occluded, depriving the heart of blood flow. Mortality during the first year after bypass graft failure is very high, between 5% and 9%. For purposes of comparison, a 3% threshold is considered to be a high cardiac risk. In fact, a relatively recent study in Denmark has reported that mortality rates at 8 to 10 years after CABG surgery are as high as 60% to 80%. While a life expectancy of 8 to 10 years following CABG surgery may have been acceptable in the past, expectations have changed and with people now generally living longer, additional focus is now being placed on extending life expectancies following CABG surgeries.
 
Researchers have determined that there are two main causes of SVG failure: size mismatch, and a thickening of the interior of the SVG that begins immediately following the harvest procedure. Size mismatch occurs because the diameter of SVGs is often significantly larger than the diameter of the coronary arteries around the heart. This size mismatch causes flow disturbances, leading to graft thromboses and graft failure. The thickening of the cell walls of SVGs occurs when a layer of endothelial cells on the inner surface of the SVG is disturbed beginning at the harvesting procedure, starting a chain reaction which causes the cells to thicken and the inside of the graft to narrow, resulting in blood clots and graft failure.
 
The Opportunity
 
The CoreoGraft is a bovine based off the shelf conduit that could potentially be used to revascularize the heart, instead of harvesting the saphenous vein from the patient’s leg. In addition to avoiding the invasive and painful SVG harvest process, HJLI’s CoreoGraft closely matches the size of the coronary arteries, hopefully eliminating graft failures that occur due to size mismatch. In addition, with no graft harvest needed, the CoreoGraft could also reduce or eliminate the inner thickening that burdens and leads to failure of SVGs.
 
In addition to providing an alternative to SVGs, the CoreoGraft could be used when making grafts from the patients’ own arteries and veins is not an option. For example, patients with significant arterial and vascular disease often do not have suitable vessels to be used as grafts. For other patients, such as women who have undergone radiation treatment for breast cancer and have a higher incidence of heart disease, using the LIMA may not be an option if it was damaged by the radiation. Another example are patients undergoing a second CABG surgery. Due in large part to early SVG failures, patients may need a second CABG surgery. If the SVG was used for the first CABG surgery, the patient may have insufficient veins to harvest. While the CoreoGraft may start out as a product for patients with no other options, if the CoreoGraft establishes good short term and long term patency rates, it could become the graft of choice for all CABG patients in addition to the LIMA.

Clinical Status
 
Several years ago HLJI obtained CE Mark certification for the CoreoGraft and the CoreoGraft was implanted in several CABG patients in Europe on a humanitarian basis. These were patients that had no other viable graft options. Although not performed under clinical conditions or as part of a controlled study, the overall impression of the CoreoGraft was very positive, and several patients lived more than one year. The CE Mark has since expired.
 
In October of 2018, HJLI announced a sponsored research agreement with the Texas Heart Institute with respect to the CoreoGraft. Founded in 1962 by world renowned cardiovascular surgeon Dr. Denton A. Cooley, the Texas Heart Institute is recognized internationally for research programs in cardiology, cardiovascular surgery, stem cell and gene therapy, and regenerative medicine, and is dedicated to reducing the devastating toll of cardiovascular disease through innovative and progressive programs in research, education and improved patient care.
 
In December of 2018, we announced our first pre-clinical trial for the CoreoGraft at the Texas Heart Institute.
 
The first CoreoGraft animal study will focus on short term graft patency and graft viability. Five CoreoGrafts will be surgically implanted over a three-week period and continuously monitored for thirty days for flow rates and patency using transonic probes. The implantable probe will verify flows and patency of the grafts. Following the monitoring part of the trial, the CoreoGrafts will undergo pathology examinations to look for evidence of cellular abnormalities that might lead to failure or impact graft performance.
 
HJLI expects to provide an update after the first implantation. The performance results of the study and the pathology are expected to be released in the second quarter 2019. Provided that the study is successful, Hancock Jaffe would then seek a Pre-FDA meeting to discuss the additional pre-clinical testing that will be necessary for in-human trials.

Bioprosthetic Heart Valve
 
Background
 
In addition to our two lead products under development, HJLI has a third product, the Bioprosthetic Heart Valve (“BHV”), that is a porcine based heart valve designed to function like a native heart valve and designed to provide a patient greater functional performance. Early pre-clinical testing has demonstrated improved function over existing surgically implanted devices and, due to these study results, we believe BHV may be suitable for the pediatric population as it accommodates its performance concomitant with the growth of the patient.
The Opportunity
 
We believe that pediatric patients requiring the smallest valve sizes, typically 19 to 21 mm in diameter, are not adequately treated by current market devices. The primary challenge for these patients is to provide adequate blood flow during growth and development. Typically, this requires more complex procedures or multiple successive surgeries to provide a larger valve replacement. The patient outgrows the valve size several times between ages two and twenty, requiring several surgeries before adulthood, also referred to as patient prosthetic mismatch.
 
Congenital heart defects are serious and common conditions that have significant impact on morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs in children and adults. The most commonly reported incidence of congenital heart defects in the United States is between 4 and 10 per 1,000, clustering around 8 per 1,000 live births. We believe these patients could benefit from the BHV, potentially resulting in fewer follow-on surgeries.
 
Clinical Status
 
Heart valves are developed in accordance with ISO Standard 5840, as well as other international and regulatory standards. HJLI is undergoing an audit of the previous pre-clinical studies that were conducted for the BHV to determine the next steps for BHV testing. Once the audit results are complete the HJLI Board of Directors will determine whether to continue the development of the BHV.

Government Regulation
 
Our product candidates and our operations are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA, and other federal and state authorities in the United States, as well as comparable authorities in foreign jurisdictions. Our product candidates are subject to regulation as medical devices in the United States under the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FFDCA”), as implemented and enforced by the FDA. The FDA regulates the development, design, non-clinical and clinical research, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, installation, servicing, recordkeeping, premarket clearance or approval, import, export, adverse event reporting, advertising, promotion, marketing and distribution, and import and export of medical devices to ensure that medical devices distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses and otherwise meet the requirements of the FFDCA.
FDA Pre-market Clearance and Approval Requirements
 
Unless an exemption applies, each medical device commercially distributed in the United States requires either FDA clearance of a 510(k) pre-market notification, or approval of a FDA Premarket Approval (“PMA”) application. Under the FFDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes—Class I, Class II or Class III—depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of manufacturer and regulatory control needed to ensure its safety and effectiveness. Class I includes devices with the lowest risk to the patient and are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to the FDA’s General Controls for medical devices, which include compliance with the applicable portions of the FDA’s Quality System Regulation, or QSR, registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events, and truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising and promotional materials. Class II devices are subject to the FDA’s General Controls, and special controls as deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. These special controls can include performance standards, post market surveillance, patient registries and FDA guidance documents. While most Class I devices are exempt from the 510(k) pre-market notification requirement, manufacturers of most Class II devices are required to submit to the FDA a pre-market notification under Section 510(k) of the FFDCA requesting permission to commercially distribute the device. The FDA’s permission to commercially distribute a device subject to a 510(k) pre-market notification is generally known as 510(k) clearance. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risks, such as life sustaining, life supporting or some implantable devices, or devices that have a new intended use, or use advanced technology that is not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed device, are placed in Class III, requiring approval of a PMA.
510(k) Marketing Clearance Pathway
 
The 510(k) clearance process is for proposed medical devices that are “substantially equivalent” to a predicate device already on the market. A predicate device is a legally marketed device that is not subject to premarket approval, i.e., a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976 (pre-amendments device) and for which a PMA is not required, a device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or I, or a device that was found substantially equivalent through the 510(k) process. Because each of our two lead products are unique, and we believe are not substantially equivalent to products already on the market, and because we believe that that the VenoValve and the CoreoGraft are Class III medical devices, we do not anticipate that the VenoValve or the CoreoGraft would be appropriate for 510(k) approval.
PMA Approval Pathway
 
Class III devices require PMA approval before they can be marketed although some pre-amendment Class III devices for which FDA has not yet required a PMA are cleared through the 510(k) process. The PMA process is more demanding than the 510(k) premarket notification process. In a PMA the manufacturer must demonstrate that the device is safe and effective, and the PMA must be supported by extensive data, including data from preclinical studies and human clinical trials. The PMA must also contain a full description of the device and its components, a full description of the methods, facilities and controls used for manufacturing, and proposed labeling. Following receipt of a PMA, the FDA determines whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. If FDA accepts the application for review, it has 180 days under the FDCA to complete its review of a PMA, although in practice, the FDA’s review often takes significantly longer, and can take several years. An advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. The FDA may or may not accept the panel’s recommendation. In addition, the FDA will generally conduct a pre-approval inspection of the applicant or its third-party manufacturers’ or suppliers’ manufacturing facility or facilities to ensure compliance with the QSR. The FDA will approve the new device for commercial distribution if it determines that the data and information in the PMA constitute valid scientific evidence and that there is reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended use(s). The FDA may approve a PMA with post-approval conditions intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution, and collection of long-term follow-up data from patients in the clinical study that supported PMA approval or requirements to conduct additional clinical studies post-approval. The FDA may condition PMA approval on some form of post-market surveillance when deemed necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and efficacy data for the device in a larger population or for a longer period of use. In such cases, the manufacturer might be required to follow certain patient groups for a number of years and to make periodic reports to the FDA on the clinical status of those patients. Failure to comply with the conditions of approval can result in material adverse enforcement action, including withdrawal of the approval. Certain changes to an approved device, such as changes in manufacturing facilities, methods or quality control procedures, or changes in the design performance specifications, which affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, require submission of a PMA supplement. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as a PMA, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original PMA and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel. Certain other changes to an approved device require the submission of a new PMA, such as when the design change causes a different intended use, mode of operation and technical basis of operation, or when the design change is so significant that a new generation of the device will be developed, and the data that were submitted with the original PMA are not applicable for the change in demonstrating a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. We believe that the VenoValve and the CoreoGraft will require the approval of a PMA.

Clinical Trials in Support of PMA
 
Clinical trials are almost always required to support a PMA and are sometimes required to support a 510(k) submission. All clinical investigations of devices to determine safety and effectiveness must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s investigational device exemption (“IDE”) regulations, which govern investigational device labeling, prohibit promotion of the investigational device and specify an array of recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators. If the device presents a “significant risk,” to human health, as defined by the FDA, the FDA requires the device sponsor to submit an IDE application to the FDA, which must become effective prior to commencing human clinical trials. A significant risk device is one that presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety or welfare of a patient and either is implanted, used in supporting or sustaining human life, substantially important in diagnosing, curing, mitigating or treating disease or otherwise preventing impairment of human health, or otherwise presents a potential for serious risk to a subject. We believe that both the VenoValve and the CoreoGraft will require IDE applications prior to human testing in the United States.
 
An IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory test results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless the FDA notifies the company that the investigation may not begin. If the FDA determines that there are deficiencies or other concerns with an IDE for which it requires modification, the FDA may permit a clinical trial to proceed under a conditional approval. In addition, the study must be approved by, and conducted under the oversight of, an Institutional Review Board, or IRB, for each clinical site. The IRB is responsible for the initial and continuing review of the IDE, and may pose additional requirements for the conduct of the study. If an IDE application is approved by the FDA and one or more IRBs, human clinical trials may begin at a specific number of investigational sites with a specific number of patients, as approved by the FDA. Acceptance of an IDE application for review does not guarantee that the FDA will allow the IDE to become effective and, if it does become effective, the FDA may or may not determine that the data derived from the trials support the safety and effectiveness of the device or warrant the continuation of clinical trials. An IDE supplement must be submitted to, and approved by, the FDA before a sponsor or investigator may make a change to the investigational plan that may affect its scientific soundness, study plan or the rights, safety or welfare of human subjects. During a study, the sponsor is required to comply with the applicable FDA requirements, including, for example, trial monitoring, selecting clinical investigators and providing them with the investigational plan, ensuring IRB review, adverse event reporting, record keeping and prohibitions on the promotion of investigational devices or on making safety or effectiveness claims for them. The clinical investigators in the clinical study are also subject to FDA’s regulations and must obtain patient informed consent, rigorously follow the investigational plan and study protocol, control the disposition of the investigational device and comply with all reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Additionally, after a trial begins, we, the FDA or the IRB could suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the anticipated benefits.
 
Post-market Regulation
 
After a device is cleared or approved for marketing, numerous and pervasive regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include: establishing registration and device listing with the FDA; QSR requirements, which require manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the design and manufacturing process; labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of investigational products, or “off-label” uses of cleared or approved products; requirements related to promotional activities; clearance or approval of product modifications that could significantly affect safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in intended use of one of our cleared devices; medical device reporting regulations, which require that a manufacturer report to the FDA if a device it markets may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned and the device or a similar device that it markets would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, if the malfunction were to recur; correction, removal and recall reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health; the FDA’s recall authority, whereby the agency can order device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulations; and post-market surveillance activities and regulations.

Regulation Outside of the U.S.
 
Each country or territory outside of the U.S. has its own rules and regulations with respect to the manufacture, marketing and sale of medical devices. For example, in December of 2018, we received regulatory approval from Instituto Nacional de Vigilancia de Medicamentos y Alimentos (“INVIMA”), the Colombian equivalent of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, for our first-in-human trial for the VenoValve in Colombia. At this time, other than the first-in-human trial in Colombia, we have not determined which countries outside of the U.S., if any, for which we will seek approval for our product candidates.
 
Our Competitive Strengths
 
We believe we will offer the cardiovascular device market a compelling value proposition with the launch of our three product candidates, if approved, for the following reasons:

● | We have extensive experience of proprietary processing and manufacturing methodology specifically applicable to the design, processing, manufacturing and sterilization of our biologic tissue devices. We believe that our patents, which cover certain aspects of our devices and the processing methods of biologic valvular tissue as a “bioprosthetic” device, may provide an advantage over potential competitors. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | We operate a 14,507 square foot manufacturing facility in Irvine, California. Our facility is designed expressly for the manufacture of Class III tissue based implantable medical devices and is equipped for research and development, prototype fabrication, current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, and manufacturing and shipping for Class III medical devices, including biologic cardiovascular devices. 
● | We have attracted senior executives who are experienced in research and development and who have worked on over 80 medical devices that have received FDA approval or CE marking. We also have the advantage of an experienced board of directors and scientific advisory board who will provide guidance as we move towards market launch.

Intellectual Property
 
We possess an extensive proprietary processing and manufacturing methodology specifically applicable to the design, processing, manufacturing and sterilization of biologic devices. This includes FDA compliant quality control and assurance programs, proprietary tissue processing technologies demonstrated to eliminate recipient immune responses, decades long and trusted relationship with abattoir suppliers, and a combination of tissue preservation and gamma irradiation that enhances device functions and guarantees sterility. Our patents pertaining to the unique design advantages and processing methods of valvular tissue as a bioprosthetic device provide further functional advantages over potential competitors. The critical design components and function relationships unique to the BHV are protected by U.S. Patent No. 7,815,677, issued on October 19, 2010 and expiring on July 9, 2027. Two patent applications have been filed for the VenoValve with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.
