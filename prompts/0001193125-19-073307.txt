ITEM 1. | OUR BUSINESS
--------+-------------

 We, Medallion Financial Corp. or the Company, are a finance company, organized as a Delaware corporation, that includes Medallion Bank, our primary operating subsidiary. Effective April 2, 2018, following authorization by our shareholders, we withdrew our previous election to be regulated as a business development company, or BDC, under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the 1940 Act. Prior to such time, we were a closed-end, non-diversified management investment company that had elected to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. 
 As a result of this change in status, commencing with the three months ended June 30, 2018: 
 

 | we consolidated the results of Medallion Bank and our other subsidiaries in our financial statements, which, as an investment company, we were previously precluded from doing; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | with the consolidation of Medallion Bank, given its significance to our overall financial results, we now report as a bank holding company for accounting purposes under Article 9 and Guide 3 of Regulation S-X; but we are not a bank holding company for regulatory purposes.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 946  Financial Services  Investment Companies, we made this change to our financial reporting prospectively, and did not restate or revise periods prior to our change in status to a non-investment company effective April 2, 2018. Accordingly, in this report we refer to both accounting in accordance with US generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) applicable to bank holding companies (Bank Holding Company Accounting), which applies commencing April 2, 2018, and to that applicable to investment companies under the 1940 Act (Investment Company Accounting), which applies to prior periods.

 We historically have had a leading position in originating, acquiring, and servicing loans that finance taxicab medallions and various types of commercial businesses. Recently, our strategic growth has been through Medallion Bank which originates consumer loans for the purchase of recreational vehicles, boats, and trailers and to finance small-scale home improvements. Since Medallion Bank acquired a consumer loan portfolio and began originating consumer loans in 2004, it has increased its consumer loan portfolio at a compound annual growth rate of 16% (19% if there had been no loan sales during 2016, 2017, and 2018). In January 2017, we announced our plans to transform our overall strategy. We are transitioning away from medallion lending and placing our strategic focus on our growing consumer finance portfolio. Total assets under management and management of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, which includes our managed net investment portfolio, as well as assets serviced for third party investors and unconsolidated subsidiaries, were $1,522,000,000 as of December 31, 2018, and were $1,593,000,000 as of December 31, 2017, and have grown at a compound annual growth rate of 9% from $215,000,000 at the end of 1996. Since our initial public offering in 1996, we have paid/declared distributions in excess of $263,060,000, or $14.66 per share. 
 We conduct our business through various wholly-owned subsidiaries, including: 
 

 | Medallion Bank, or the Bank, an FDIC-insured industrial bank that originates consumer loans, raises deposits and conducts other banking activity and has a separate board of directors with a majority of independent directors;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Medallion Funding LLC, or Medallion Funding, a Small Business Investment Company, or SBIC, our primary taxicab medallion lending company;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Medallion Capital, Inc., or Medallion Capital, an SBIC which conducts a mezzanine financing business;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Freshstart Venture Capital Corp., or Freshstart, an SBIC which originates and services taxicab medallion and commercial loans; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Medallion Servicing Corp., or MSC, which provides loan services to the Bank.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our other consolidated subsidiaries are comprised of Medallion Fine Art, Inc., Medallion Taxi Media, Inc., CDI-LP Holdings, Inc., Medallion Motorsports, LLC, and RPAC Racing, LLC, or RPAC. In addition, we make both marketable and nonmarketable equity investments, primarily as a function of our mezzanine lending business. 
 Our Market 
 We provide loans to individuals and small to mid-size businesses, through our subsidiaries, in four segments: 
 

 | loans that finance consumer purchases of recreational vehicles, boats, and trailers;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | loans that finance consumer small scale home improvements;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


 | loans that finance commercial businesses; and
--+----------------------------------------------


 | loans that finance taxicab medallions.

 Consumer Loans 
 Consumer loans are originated by the Bank and consist of loans for the purchase of recreational vehicles, boats and trailers (recreation lending) and to finance home improvements such as replacement windows and roofs (home improvement lending). Combined consumer loans outstanding were $761,541,000 at December 31, 2018 and comprised 77% of our net loans receivable compared to $683,502,000 comprising 49% of our $1,380,054,000 managed net investment portfolio as of December 31, 2017. The managed net investment portfolio was all investments held by our consolidated and unconsolidated subsidiaries. We believe that the consumer loan portfolio is of acceptable credit quality given the high interest rates earned on the loans, which compensate for the higher degree of credit risk in the loan portfolio. 
 Recreation Lending. Recreation lending is a high-growth business focused on originating prime and non-prime recreation loans. The segment is a significant source of income, accounting for 71.0% of our interest income for the nine months ended December 31, 2018. All of our recreation loans are serviced by a third-party loan servicer, and we have used the same loan servicer since the businesss inception. 
 Through the Bank, we maintain non-exclusive relationships with more than 2,800 dealers and financial service providers (FSPs), not all of which are active at any one time. FSPs are entities that provide finance and insurance (F&I) services to small dealers that do not have the desire or ability to provide F&I services themselves. The ability of FSPs to aggregate the financing and relationship management for many small dealers makes them valuable to the Bank. We receive approximately half of our loan volume from dealers and the other half from FSPs. A dedicated sales team working from the Banks Salt Lake City headquarters manages our relationships with dealers and FSPs. Approximately 4% of recreation lendings new loan originations for the nine months ended December 31, 2018 were from our top ten dealer relationships and an additional 24% were from our top three FSP relationships. 
 The recreation lending portfolio consists of thousands of geographically distributed loans with an average loan size of approximately $13,500 as of December 31, 2018. The loans are fixed rate loans with an average loan term at origination of approximately 10 years. The weighted average remaining term of our loans outstanding at December 31, 2018 is 8.5 years. The size, geographic dispersion, source variety and collateral variety of the loans reduce risk to the Company. 
 Home Improvement Lending. Through the Bank, we work directly with contractors and an FSP to offer flexible customer financing for window, siding and roof replacement, swimming pool installation and solar system installation, and other home improvement projects. Our core product is a standard installment loan, which features affordable monthly payments and competitive interest rates for prime credit customers at no cost to the contractor. We also offer a variety of promotional loan options to help contractors close a challenging sale. Promotional loan options include same-as-cash, no interest and deferred payment features, which allow borrowers to reduce the total cost of financing or start repayments when it is most convenient. 
 Home improvement lending operates in a manner similar to recreation lending, with a few key differences. Through the Bank, we maintain a smaller number of non-exclusive relationships; the Bank currently has relationships with approximately 600 contractors. Most of our home improvement-financed sales take place in the borrowers home instead of a store, with the contractor presenting the borrower with a bid that includes a financing option. 
 A large proportion of our home improvement-financed sales are facilitated by contractor salespeople with limited financing backgrounds rather than by contractor employees who provide F&I services. The result is contractor demand for financing services that facilitate an in-home transaction (e.g., information technology and extended operating hours) and additional support for the salesperson throughout the financing process. The Banks contractor relationships are managed by a remote sales team with employees located in the geographical regions served. Approximately 59% of home improvement lendings new loan originations for the nine months ended December 31, 2018 were from our top ten contractors and our FSP relationship. 
 
5 


 We offer only fixed rate home improvement loans with an average loan term at origination of approximately 12 years. The weighted average remaining term of our loans outstanding is 10.2 years as of December 31, 2018. The average size of the loans in our home improvement portfolio is approximately $14,100, and geographic dispersion, source variety and collateral variety of home improvement loans reduce risk to the Company. 
 Commercial Loans 
 Commercial loans finance either the purchase of the equipment and related assets necessary to open a new business or the purchase or improvement of an existing business. From the inception of the commercial loan business in 1987 through December 31, 2018, we have originated more than $970,572,000 of commercial loans. Commercial loans of $64,083,000 comprised 7% of our net loans receivable as of December 31, 2018, compared to managed commercial loans of $91,783,000, or 7%, of our $1,380,054,000 net investment portfolio as of December 31, 2017. We have worked to increase our commercial loan activity in recent years, primarily because of the attractive higher yielding nature of most of this business. The increase since 1996 has been primarily driven by internal growth through the origination of additional commercial loans. We focus our marketing efforts on the manufacturing, professional, scientific, and technical services and other services. The majority of our commercial borrowers are located in the New York metropolitan area and the Midwest. We plan to continue expanding our commercial loan activities by developing a more diverse borrower base, with a wider geographic area of coverage, and by expanding targeted industries. 
 Mainly through our subsidiary Medallion Capital, we originate both senior and subordinated loans nationwide to businesses in a variety of industries, including manufacturing and various service providers, more than 51% of which are located in the Midwest and Northeast regions, with the rest scattered across the country. These commercial loans are primarily secured by a second position on all assets of the businesses and generally range in amount from $1,000,000 to $5,000,000 at origination. As a component of most of the transactions, a portion of the investment is an equity or partnership stake, and occasionally, we also receive warrants to purchase an equity interest in the borrowers or some other form of success fee or profit participation. 
 Commercial loans are generally secured by equipment, accounts receivable, real estate, or other assets, and have interest rates averaging 806 basis points over the prevailing prime rate at the end of 2018, up from 735 basis points over prime at the end of 2017. 
 Medallion Loans 
 Taxi medallion loans of $155,863,000 comprised 16% of our net loans receivable as of December 31, 2018, compared to managed taxi medallion loans of $388,001,000, or 28%, of our $1,380,054,000 managed net investment portfolio as of December 31, 2017. Including loans to unaffiliated investors and unconsolidated subsidiaries, the total amount of medallion loans under our management was $323,786,000 as of December 31, 2018, compared to $414,350,000 as of December 31, 2017. Since 1979, we have originated approximately $3,631,000,000 in medallion loans in New York City, Chicago, Boston, Newark, Cambridge, and other cities within the United States. In addition, our management has a long history of owning, managing, and financing taxicab fleets, taxicab medallions, and corporate car services, dating back to 1956. 
 Medallion loans collateralized by New York City taxicab medallions and related assets comprised 87% and 73% (81% on a managed basis) of the medallion loan portfolio as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. Based on taxi medallion values published by the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission, or TLC, and our cash flow analysis, we estimate that the total value of all of New York City taxicab medallions and related assets such as the vehicle, taximeter, and roof lights exceeded $2.7 billion as of December 31, 2018. We estimate that the total value of all taxicab medallions and related assets in our major US markets exceeded $3.1 billion as of December 31, 2018. 
 While medallion loans do become delinquent or in default, all of our medallion loans are secured by the medallion and enhanced with personal guarantees of the owners, shareholders or equity members. When a 
 
6 


  borrower defaults on a loan, we have the ability to restructure the underlying loan or repossess the medallion collateralizing that loan and sell it in the market or through a foreclosure auction and pursue the personal guarantees, all of which we have done. Given the current market conditions, we have recorded an allowance for loan losses against performing and nonperforming loans to mitigate potential future losses. 
 The New York City Market. A New York City taxicab medallion is the only permitted license to operate a taxicab and accept street hails in New York City, except as discussed below. As reported by the TLC, individual (owner-driver) medallions and corporate medallions sold for a wide variety of prices during the year. Our analysis of transaction activity combined with cash flow analysis of owners and operators supported our estimated value of $181,000, net of liquidation costs, as of December 31, 2018. The number of taxicab medallions is limited by law to 13,630 medallions outstanding as of December 31, 2018. A New York State law permits cars for hire to pick up street hails in the boroughs outside Manhattan. Pursuant to such law, the TLC began issuing Street Hail Livery licenses in June 2013. 
 A prospective medallion owner must qualify under the medallion ownership standards set and enforced by the TLC. These standards prohibit individuals with criminal records from owning medallions, require that the funds used to purchase medallions be derived from legitimate sources, and mandate that taxicab vehicles and meters meet TLC specifications. In addition, before the TLC will approve a medallion transfer, the TLC requires a letter from the sellers insurer stating that there are no outstanding claims for personal injuries in excess of insurance coverage. After the transfer is approved, the owners taxicab is subject to quarterly TLC inspections. 
 Most New York City medallion transfers are handled through approximately 20 medallion brokers licensed by the TLC. In addition to brokering medallions, these brokers also arrange for TLC documentation insurance, vehicles, meters, and financing. We have excellent relations with many of the most active brokers, and regularly receive referrals from them. 
 The Newark Market. We estimate that Newark medallions sold for approximately $147,000, net, as of December 31, 2018. The number of Newark medallions has been limited to 600 since 1950 by local law. We estimate that the total value of all Newark medallions and related assets is over $91,800,000 as of December 31, 2018. 
 The Chicago Market. We estimate that Chicago medallions sold for approximately $27,000, net, as of December 31, 2018. Pursuant to a municipal ordinance, the number of outstanding medallions is capped at 6,995 as of December 31, 2018. We estimate that the total value of all Chicago medallions and related assets is over $230,835,000 as of December 31, 2018. 
 Other Markets. We estimated that Boston and Cambridge medallions sold for approximately $43,000 and $22,000, net, as of December 31, 2018. These other markets make up 0.4% of our total medallion loans receivable. 
Our Strategy 
 Our core philosophy has been In niches there are riches. We try to identify markets that are profitable and where we can be an industry leader. Key elements of our strategy include: 
 Capitalize on our relationships with brokers and dealers. We are committed to establishing, building, and maintaining our relationships with our brokers and dealers. Our marketing efforts are focused on building relationships with dealers in the consumer markets as we work directly with dealerships, contractors and FSPs to offer quality financing for their customers, including those with past credit challenges. We believe that our relationships with dealers and brokers provide us with, in addition to potential investment opportunities, other significant benefits, including an additional layer of due diligence and additional monitoring capabilities. We have assembled a management team that has developed an extensive network of dealer and broker relationships 
 
7 


  in our target markets over the last 50 years. We believe that our management teams relationships with these dealers and brokers have and will continue to provide us with significant investment opportunities. In 2018, 100% of our consumer loans were generated by brokers and dealers, and there were few originations in the medallion or commercial lending space. 
 Focus on niche industries and our expertise in these niche fields. We specialize in providing consumer loans for the purchase of recreational vehicles (RVs), boats and trailers, and to finance home improvements through contractors and suppliers in the home improvement sector. We believe our focus on these niche areas provides us with an opportunity to realize favorable returns, with less competition. 
 Employ disciplined underwriting policies and maintain rigorous portfolio monitoring. We have an extensive loan underwriting and monitoring process. We conduct a thorough analysis of each potential loan portfolio and its prospects, competitive position, financial performance, and industry dynamics. We stress the importance of credit and risk analysis in our underwriting process. We believe that our continued adherence to this disciplined process will permit us to continue to generate a stable, diversified and increasing revenue stream of current income from our earning assets to enable us to make distributions to our shareholders. 
 Leverage the skills of our experienced management team. Our management team is led by our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Alvin Murstein, and our President, Mr. Andrew M. Murstein. Alvin Murstein has over 60 years of experience in the ownership, management, and financing of taxicab medallions and other commercial businesses, and Andrew M. Murstein is the third generation in his family to participate in the business and has over 30 years of experience in the ownership, management, and financing of taxicab medallions and other commercial businesses. The other members of our management team including Medallion Bank have broad investment backgrounds, with prior experience in banking and non-bank consumer lending, at specialty finance companies, middle market commercial banks, and other financial services companies. We believe that the experience and contacts of our management team will continue to allow us to effectively implement the key aspects of our business strategy. 
 Perform Strategic Acquisitions. In addition to increasing market share in existing lending markets and identifying new niches, we seek to acquire medallion financing businesses and related portfolios and specialty finance companies that make secured loans to small businesses which have experienced historically low loan losses similar to our own. Since our initial public offering in May 1996, we have acquired eight specialty finance companies, five loan portfolios, and three taxicab rooftop advertising companies.

 Loan/Investment Characteristics 
 Consumer Loans. Consumer loans generally require equal monthly payments covering accrued interest and amortization of principal over a negotiated term, generally around ten to twelve years. Interest rates offered are fixed. Borrowers may prepay consumer loans without any prepayment penalty. In general, Medallion Bank has established relationships with dealers, FSPs, and contractors in the industry, who are the sources for consumer loan volumes. The loans are made up of recreation loans and home improvement loans which were 76% and 24% of total consumer loans at December 31, 2018. 
 Our recreation loans are secured primarily by RVs, boats and trailers with a small proportion of loans secured by other collateral such as autos, motorcycles and boat motors. These loans, which together make up our largest and most profitable loan portfolio, have a weighted average yield of 16.88% at December 31, 2018. Our home improvement loans are secured by the personal property installed, and the security interest for a majority of these loans is perfected with a UCC fixture filing. As of December 31, 2018, these loans had a weighted average yield of 9.20%. 
 
9 


 Commercial Loans. We have typically originated commercial loans in principal amounts generally ranging from under $1,000,000 to $5,000,000, and occasionally have originated loans in excess of that amount. These loans are generally retained and typically have maturities ranging from three to ten years and require monthly payments ranging from full amortization over the loan term to fully deferred interest and principal at maturity, with multiple payment options in between. Substantially all loans may be prepaid, and in the first five years, a fee will be owed to us. The term of, and interest rate charged on, certain of our outstanding loans are subject to the regulations of the Small Business Administration, or the SBA. Under SBA regulations, the maximum rate of interest permitted on loans originated by us is 19%; however, terms and interest rates are subject to market competition for all loans. Unlike medallion loans, for which competition and market conditions preclude us from charging the maximum rate of interest permitted under SBA regulations, we are able to charge the maximum rate on certain commercial loans. 
 Medallion Loans. Our medallion loan portfolio consists of mostly fixed-rate loans, collateralized by first security interests in taxicab medallions and related assets (vehicles, meters, and the like). We estimate that the weighted average loan-to-value ratio of all of the medallion loans was 220% as of December 31, 2018, compared to 131% as of December 31, 2017. These ratios do not factor in the reserve on these loans of $27,743,000 as of December 31, 2018 and the unrealized depreciation on managed loans of $62,723,000 as of December 31, 2017. In addition, we have recourse against a vast majority of the owners of the taxicab medallions and related assets through personal guarantees. 
 Medallion loans generally require equal monthly payments covering accrued interest and amortization of principal over a five to twenty-five year schedule, subject to a balloon payment of all outstanding principal at maturity. Historically, we have originated loans with one-to-five year maturities where interest rates are adjusted and a new maturity period set. 
 Historically, we have retained the medallion loans we originate; however, from time to time, we participate or sell shares of some loans or portfolios to interested third party financial institutions. In these cases, we retain the borrower relationships and service the sold loans. 
 Marketing, Origination, and Loan Approval Process 
 We employ 78 personnel to originate, manage, service and collect on the consumer, commercial, and medallion loans. Each loan application is individually reviewed through analysis of a number of factors, including loan-to-value ratios, a review of the borrowers credit history, public records, personal interviews, trade references, personal inspection of the premises, and approval from the TLC, SBA, or other regulatory body, if applicable. Each medallion and commercial loan applicant is required to provide personal or corporate tax returns, premises leases, and/or property deeds. The Companys senior management establishes loan origination criteria. Loans that conform to such criteria may be processed by a loan officer with the proper credit authority, and non-conforming loans (other than those by the Bank) must be approved by the Companys Chief Executive Officer, President, and/or the Chief Credit Officer and the Investment Oversight Committee of the Companys Board of Directors. Loan criteria for loans originated with the Bank is established by the Banks board of directors and senior management. The Banks policies identify specific approval authorities for its recreation, home improvement, medallion and real estate loans. Policy exceptions are reported to the Banks board of directors. Both medallion and commercial loans are sourced from brokers with extensive networks of applicants, and commercial loans are also referred by contacts with banks, attorneys, and accounting firms. Consumer loans are primarily sourced through relationships which have been established with recreational vehicle and boat dealers, and home improvement contractors throughout our market area. 
Sources of Funds 
 We have historically funded our lending operations primarily through credit facilities with bank syndicates and, to a lesser degree, through equity or debt offerings or private placements, and fixed-rate, senior secured 
 
10 


  notes and long-term subordinated debentures issued to or guaranteed by the SBA. Since the inception of Medallion Bank, substantially all of Medallion Banks funding has been provided by FDIC insured brokered certificates of deposit. The determination of funding sources is established by our management, based upon an analysis of the respective financial and other costs and burdens associated with funding sources. Our funding strategy and interest rate risk management strategy is to have the proper structuring of debt to minimize both rate and maturity risk, while maximizing returns with the lowest cost of funding over an intermediate period of time. 
 The table below summarizes our sources of available funds and amounts outstanding under credit facilities and their respective end of period weighted average interest rates at December 31, 2018. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about each credit facility.

 We fund our fixed-rate loans with variable-rate credit lines and bank debt, and with fixed-rate SBA debentures and borrowings. The mismatch between maturities and interest-rate sensitivities of these balance sheet items results in interest rate risk. We seek to manage our exposure to increases in market rates of interest to an acceptable level by: 
 

 | Originating adjustable rate loans; and
--+---------------------------------------


 | Incurring fixed-rate debt.
--+---------------------------

 Nevertheless, we accept varying degrees of interest rate risk depending on market conditions. For additional discussion of our funding sources and asset liability management strategy, see Asset/Liability Management on page 65. 
 Competition 
 Banks, credit unions, and finance companies, some of which are SBICs, compete with us in originating medallion, commercial, and consumer loans. Many of these competitors have greater resources than we do and

  certain competitors are subject to less restrictive regulations than us. As a result, we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify and complete the financing transactions that will permit us to compete successfully. 
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2018 we employed 177 persons, including 75 at our Medallion Bank subsidiary. We believe that relations with our employees are good. 
 MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS 
 For our tax years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we have been taxed as a corporation and must pay corporate-level federal and state income taxes on our taxable income. Because we were taxed as a corporation under Subchapter C of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code) for the tax year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we are able to carry forward any net operating losses incurred to succeeding years. In addition, distributions will generally be taxable to our shareholders to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for U.S. federal tax purposes. Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits would be treated first as a return of capital to the extent of a shareholders tax basis, and any remaining distributions would be treated as a capital gain. Subject to certain limitations under the Code, corporate distributees would be eligible for the dividends received deduction. 
 On December 22, 2017, the U.S. Government signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which, starting in 2018, reduced the Companys corporate statutory income tax rate from 35% to 21%, but eliminated or increased certain permanent differences. 
 REGULATION 
 Exemption from the 1940 Act 
 In order to maintain our status as a non-investment company, we operate so as to fall outside the definition of an investment company or within an applicable exception. We expect to continue to fall within the exception from the definition of an investment company provided under Section 3(c)(6) of the 1940 Act as a company primarily engaged, directly or through majority-owned subsidiaries, in the business of, among other things, (i) banking, (ii) purchasing and otherwise acquiring notes, drafts, acceptances, open accounts receivable, and other obligations representing part or all of the sales price of merchandise, insurance and services, and (iii) making loans to manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers of, and to prospective purchasers of, specified merchandise, insurance, and services. We monitor our continued compliance with this exception, which we have met since April 2, 2018, and were compliant as of December 31, 2018. 
Regulation of Medallion Bank as an Industrial Bank 
 In May 2002, we formed Medallion Bank, which received approval from the FDIC for federal deposit insurance in October 2003. Medallion Bank, a Utah-chartered industrial bank, is a depository institution subject to regulatory oversight and examination for safety and soundness by both the FDIC and the Utah Department of Financial Institutions. Medallion Bank is examined annually by the FDIC and the Utah Department of Financial Institutions. Numerous other federal and state laws and regulations govern almost all aspects of Medallion Banks operations and, to some degree, our operations and those of our non-bank subsidiaries as institution-affiliated parties. Under its banking charter, Medallion Bank is empowered to make consumer and commercial loans, and may accept all FDIC-insured deposits other than demand deposits (checking accounts). Medallion Bank provides stable and low-cost bank deposit funding for our key lending business activities conducted through Medallion Bank. 
 In addition, the FDIC has regulatory authority to prohibit Medallion Bank from engaging in any unsafe or unsound practice in conducting its business.

 Medallion Bank is subject to risk-based and leverage capital standards issued by the federal banking regulators. These standards are designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banking organizations, to account for off-balance sheet exposure, to minimize disincentives for holding liquid assets, and to achieve greater consistency in evaluating the capital adequacy of major banks throughout the world. Under the risk-based capital standards, assets and off-balance sheet items are assigned to broad risk categories, each with designated weights, and the resulting capital ratios represent capital as a percentage of total risk-weighted assets and off-balance sheet items. 
 In July 2013, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency adopted the U.S. Basel III capital rules, which implement many aspects of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervisions Basel III capital framework and are aimed at increasing both the quantity and quality of regulatory capital. The requirements in the U.S. Basel III capital rules began to phase in on January 1, 2015, for many covered banking organizations, including Medallion Bank. Most requirements in the U.S. Basel III capital rules were fully phased in by January 1, 2019. Because Medallion Bank was already subject to a capital maintenance agreement with the FDIC that required it to hold capital in excess of the then applicable capital requirements, we do not believe that the U.S. Basel III capital rules will have a material impact on Medallion Banks business. 
 Under the U.S. Basel III capital rules, Medallion Bank is subject to the following minimum capital ratios: 
 

 | a new Common Equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.5%;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


 | a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6%;
--+-----------------------------------------


 | a Total risk-based capital ratio of 8%; and
--+--------------------------------------------


 | a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%.
--+-------------------------------

 In addition, Medallion Bank is subject to a Common Equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer on top of the minimum risk-based capital ratios. The implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on January 1, 2016 at the 0.625% level and increased by 0.625% each subsequent January 1 until January 1, 2019. Including the buffer, as of January 1, 2019, Medallion Bank is be required to maintain the following minimum capital ratios: a Common Equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of greater than 7.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of greater than 8.5% and a total risk-based capital ratio of greater than 10.5%. The new and highest form of capital, Common Equity Tier 1 capital, consists solely of common stock (plus related surplus), retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive income, and limited amounts of qualifying minority interests that are in the form of common stock. For Medallion Bank to pay a dividend, they would need to comply with these capital requirements. 
 The U.S. Basel III capital rules retain or modify certain deductions from and adjustments to regulatory capital and also provide for new ones. In addition, the U.S. Basel III capital rules provide for limited recognition in Common Equity Tier 1 capital, and deduction from Common Equity Tier 1 capital above certain thresholds, of three categories of assets: (i) deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences that cannot be realized through net operating loss carrybacks (net of related valuation allowances and of deferred tax liabilities), (ii) mortgage servicing assets (net of associated deferred tax liabilities) and (iii) investments in more than 10% of the issued and outstanding common stock of unconsolidated financial institutions (net of associated deferred tax liabilities). 
 For purposes of calculating the denominator of the three risk-based capital ratios, the assets of covered banking organizations are given risk weights that, under the U.S. Basel III capital rules, range from 0% to 1,250%, depending on the nature of the asset. Direct obligations of the U.S. Treasury or obligations unconditionally guaranteed by the U.S. government have a 0% risk weight, while general obligation claims on states or other political subdivisions of the United States are assigned a 20% risk weight, except for municipal or state revenue bonds, which have a 50% risk weight. Most first-lien residential mortgage exposures that are prudently underwritten and performing according to their original terms carry a 50% risk weight, with a 100% 
 
13 


  risk weight for other residential mortgage exposures. In addition, certain off-balance sheet items are assigned credit conversion factors to convert them to asset equivalent amounts to which an appropriate risk weight is applied. For example, the unused portion of unconditionally cancellable commitments is assigned a 0% conversion factor, while self-liquidating, transaction-related contingent items with an original maturity of one year or less and the amount of a commitment with an initial maturity of one year or less that is not unconditionally cancellable by the covered banking organization are converted at 20%. Transaction-related contingencies such as bid bonds and standby letters of credit backing nonfinancial obligations, as well as the amount of a commitment with an original maturity of more than one year that is not unconditionally cancellable, have a 50% conversion factor. General guarantees and standby letters of credit backing financial obligations are given a 100% conversion factor. 
 In addition, pursuant to provisions of the FDIC Improvement Act of 1991, or FDICIA, and related regulations with respect to prompt corrective action, FDIC-insured institutions such as Medallion Bank may only accept brokered deposits without FDIC permission if they meet specified capital standards, and are subject to restrictions with respect to the interest they may pay on deposits unless they are well capitalized. The U.S. Basel III capital rules revised the capital threshold to be well capitalized. Effective January 1, 2015, in order to qualify as well capitalized, an insured depository institution must maintain a Common Equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6.5%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8.0%, a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10.0%, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5.0%, and the bank must not be under any order or directive from the appropriate regulatory agency to meet and maintain a specific capital level. 
 Pursuant to a capital maintenance agreement with the FDIC, we and Medallion Bank have agreed that the capital levels of Medallion Bank will at all times meet or exceed the levels required for Medallion Bank to be considered well-capitalized under the FDIC rules and regulations, that Medallion Banks Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio will be maintained at not less than 15%, and that Medallion Bank will maintain an adequate allowance for loan and lease losses. As of December 31, 2018, Medallion Bank was in compliance with the above rules and tests. 
 Medallion Bank is also subject to certain federal laws that restrict and control its ability to extend credit and provide or receive services between affiliates. Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation W promulgated thereunder limit the transfer of funds by a depository institution to certain of its affiliates, including us, in the form of loans, extensions of credit, investments, or purchases of assets. Sections 23A and 23B and Regulation W also require generally that the depository institutions transactions with its affiliates be on terms no less favorable to Medallion Bank than comparable transactions with unrelated third parties. 
 The USA Patriot Act and the International Money Laundering Abatement and Anti-Terrorist Financing Act of 2001, or the Patriot Act, is intended to detect and prosecute terrorism and international money laundering. The Patriot Act establishes new standards for verifying customer identification incidental to the opening of new accounts. Medallion Bank has undertaken appropriate measures to comply with the Patriot Act and associated regulations. Other provisions of the Patriot Act provide for special information sharing procedures governing communications with the government and other financial institutions with respect to suspected terrorists and money laundering activity, and enhancements to suspicious activity reporting, including electronic filing of suspicious activity reports over a secure filing network. The compliance programs required by the Patriot Act are intended to supplement pre-existing compliance requirements that apply to financial institutions under the Bank Secrecy Act and the Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, regulations to which Medallion Bank is also subject. The Bank Secrecy Act requires all financial institutions, including banks, to, among other things, establish a risk-based system of internal controls reasonably designed to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism. The Bank Secrecy Act includes a variety of record-keeping and reporting requirements (such as cash and suspicious activity reporting), as well as due diligence/know-your-customer documentation requirements. Medallion Bank has in place policies, procedures and internal controls in order to comply with Bank Secrecy Act and OFAC laws and regulations. Bank regulators routinely examine institutions for compliance with these obligations and are required to consider compliance in connection with the regulatory review of applications. 
 
14 


 Federal and state banking agencies require Medallion Bank to prepare annual reports on financial condition and to conduct an annual audit of financial affairs in compliance with minimum standards and procedures. Medallion Bank must undergo regular on-site examinations by the appropriate banking agency, which will examine for adherence to a range of legal and regulatory compliance responsibilities. A bank regulator conducting an examination has complete access to the books and records of the examined institution. The results of the examination are confidential. The cost of examinations may be assessed against the examined institution as the agency deems necessary or appropriate. 
 Regulation by the SBA 
 Medallion Funding, Medallion Capital, and Freshstart are each licensed by the SBA to operate as SBICs, under the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, as amended, or the SBIA. The SBIA authorizes the organization of SBICs as vehicles for providing equity capital, long term financing, and management assistance to small business concerns. Under the regulations promulgated by the SBA a small business concern is defined as a business that is independently owned and operated, which does not dominate its field of operation, and which (i) has a tangible net worth, together with any affiliates, of $19.5 million or less and average annual net income after U.S. federal income taxes for the preceding two fiscal years of $6.5 million or less (average annual net income is computed without the benefit of any carryover loss), or (ii) satisfies alternative criteria under the Federal governments North American Classification System, or the NAICS, that assigns codes to the industry in which a small business is engaged and provides a small business size standard based either on the number of persons employed by the business or its gross revenues. In addition, at the end of each fiscal year, at least 25% of the total amount of loans made (after April 25, 1994) must be made in smaller businesses that have a net worth of $6.0 million or less, and average net income after federal income taxes for the preceding two years of $2.0 million or less. A business that meets the NAICS size standards also qualifies as a smaller business for purposes of meeting SBAs size standard regulations. 
 Investments by SBICs must be in active, primarily domestic businesses. SBIC regulations preclude investment in the following types of businesses: (1) financial companies whose principal business activity is as a relender or reinvestor (that is, directly or indirectly, providing funds to others, purchasing debt obligations, factoring, or long term leasing of equipment with no provision for maintenance or repair); (2) many kinds of real estate projects; (3) single purpose projects that are not continuing businesses; (4) companies located outside the U.S. intending to use the proceeds of the investment outside of the U.S. or companies that are located in the U.S. that have more than 50% of their employees or tangible assets located outside of the U.S.; (5) businesses that are passive and do not carry on an active trade or business; (6) businesses that use 50% or more of the funds to buy goods or services from an associated supplier; and (7) certain sin businesses such as gambling and the like. Nonetheless, the regulations provide an exception to (1) above for an SBIC that provides Venture Capital Financing investments (represented by common or preferred stock, a limited partnership interest or a similar partnership interest) to a Disadvantaged Business that is a relender or reinvestor (except banks or savings and loans insured by agencies of the Federal Government, and agricultural credit companies), so long as, without SBA prior approval, total outstanding financings do not exceed the SBICs regulatory capital at the end of its fiscal year. 
 Under current SBA regulations, the maximum rate of interest that Medallion Funding, Medallion Capital and Freshstart may charge may not exceed the higher of (i) 19% or (ii) the sum of (a) the higher of (i) that companys weighted average cost of qualified borrowings, as determined under SBA regulations, or (ii) the current SBA debenture rate, plus (b) 11%, rounded to the next lower eighth of one percent. As of December 31, 2018, the maximum rate of interest permitted on loans originated by Medallion Funding, Medallion Capital, and Freshstart was 19%. As of December 31, 2018, our outstanding medallion loans had a weighted average rate of interest 4.43% and our outstanding commercial loans had a weighted average rate of interest of 13.56%. Current SBA regulations also require that each loan originated by an SBIC has a term between one and 20 years. 
 In addition, SBICs are subject to periodic examination by the SBA, for which the SBA charges examination fees. SBICs are required to maintain certain minimum levels of capital and must maintain certain records and 
 
15 


  make them available for SBA examination. SBICs also are required to prepare valuations of their portfolio investments in accordance with prescribed valuation guidelines, to maintain certain minimum levels of capital, to file annual reports containing financial, management and other information and to file notices of certain material changes in their ownership and operations. We are examined by the SBA annually for compliance with applicable SBA regulations. 
 SBICs are precluded from making investments in a small business if it would give rise to a conflict of interest. Generally, a conflict of interest may arise if an associate of the SBIC has or makes an investment in the small business the SBIC is financing or serves as one of its officers or would otherwise benefit from the financing. A conflict of interest would also occur if an SBIC were to lend money to any of its officers, directors, and employees, or invest in any affiliates thereof. Joint investing with an associate (such as another fund controlled by affiliates of the general partner of the fund) may be made on identical terms or on terms that are fair to the SBIC. The SBA also prohibits, without prior SBA approval, a change of control or transfers which would result in any person (or group of persons acting in concert) owning 10% or more of any class of capital stock of an SBIC. A change of control is any event which would result in the transfer of the power, direct or indirect, to direct the management and policies of an SBIC, whether through ownership, contractual arrangements, or otherwise. 
 Under SBA regulations, without prior SBA approval, loans by licensees with outstanding SBA leverage to any single small business concern may not exceed 30% of an SBICs regulatory capital, as defined in the SBIA. 
 SBICs must invest idle funds that are not being used to make loans in investments permitted under SBA regulations. These permitted investments include direct obligations of, or obligations guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the government of the U.S. with a term of 15 months or less and deposits maturing in one year or less issued by an institution insured by the FDIC. These permitted investments must be maintained in (i) direct obligations of, or obligations guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the U.S., which mature within 15 months from the date of the investment; (ii) repurchase agreements with federally insured institutions with a maturity of seven days or less if the securities underlying the repurchase agreements are direct obligations of, or obligations guaranteed as to principal and interest by the U.S., and such securities must be maintained in a custodial account in a federally insured institution; (iii) mutual funds, securities, or other instruments that exclusively consist of, or represent pooled assets of, investments described in (i) or (ii) above; (iv) certificates of deposit with a maturity of one year or less, issued by a federally insured institution; (v) a deposit account in a federally insured institution, subject to withdrawal restriction of one year or less; (vi) a checking account in a federally insured institution; or (vii) a reasonable petty cash fund. 
 SBICs may purchase voting securities of small business concerns in accordance with SBA regulations. Although prior regulations prohibited an SBIC from controlling a small business concern except in limited circumstances, SBA regulations allow an SBIC to exercise control over a small business for a period of seven years from the date on which the SBIC initially acquires its control position. This control period may be extended for an additional period of time with the SBAs prior written approval. 
 If an SBIC defaults in its payment obligations to SBA under its outstanding debentures, fails to comply with any terms of its securities, or violates any law or regulation applicable to it, the SBA has the right to accelerate the maturity of all amounts due under its debentures. Additionally, the SBA can bring suit for the appointment of a receiver for the SBIC and for its liquidation in the event a default on payment of a SBICs debentures or for serious regulatory violations. 
 Other 
 Because Medallion Bank is an insured depository institution within the meaning of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and the Change in Bank Control Act and we are a financial institution holding company within the meaning of the Utah Financial Institutions Act, federal and Utah law and regulations prohibit any person or 
 
16 


  company from acquiring control of us and, indirectly, Medallion Bank, without, in most cases, prior written approval of the FDIC or the Commissioner of Utah Department of Financial Institutions, as applicable. Under the Change in Bank Control Act, control is conclusively presumed if, among other things, a person or company acquires 25% or more of any class of our voting stock. A rebuttable presumption of control arises if a person or company acquires 10% or more of any class of voting stock and is subject to a number of specified control factors as set forth in the applicable regulations. Although Medallion Bank is an insured depository institution within the meaning of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and the Change in Bank Control Act, your investment in Medallion Financial Corp. is not insured or guaranteed by the FDIC, or any other agency, and is subject to loss. Under the Utah Financial Institutions Act, control is defined as the power to vote 20% or more of any class of our voting securities by an individual or to vote more than 10% of any class of our voting securities by a person other than an individual. Investors are responsible for ensuring that they do not, directly or indirectly, acquire shares of our common stock in excess of the amount which can be acquired without regulatory approval. 
 In addition to the regulations detailed above, our operations are subject to supervision and regulation by other federal, state, and local laws and regulations. Additionally, our operations may be subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions. This oversight may serve to: 
 

 | regulate credit granting activities, including establishing licensing requirements, if any, in various jurisdictions;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | establish maximum interest rates, finance charges and other charges;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


 | require disclosures to customers;
--+----------------------------------


 | govern secured transactions;
--+-----------------------------


 | set collection, foreclosure, repossession and claims handling procedures and other trade practices;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | prohibit discrimination in the extension of credit and administration of loans; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | regulate the use and reporting of information related to a borrowers credit experience and other data collection.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Changes to laws of states in which we do business could affect the operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways. We cannot predict whether such changes will occur or, if they occur, the ultimate effect they would have upon our financial condition or results of operations.
