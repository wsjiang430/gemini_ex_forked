Item 1. Business
General
SandRidge Mississippian Trust I is a statutory trust formed under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act pursuant to a trust agreement, as amended and restated, by and among SandRidge, as Trustor, The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee (the “Trustee”), and The Corporation Trust Company, as Delaware Trustee (the “Delaware Trustee”) (such amended and restated trust agreement, as amended to date, the “trust agreement”). The Trust’s affairs are administered by the Trustee, which maintains its offices at 601 Travis Street, 16th Floor, Houston, Texas 77002. The Trust does not have any employees.
Copies of reports filed by the Trust under the Exchange Act are made available as soon as reasonably practicable after such materials are filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Certain information concerning the Trust and Trust units as well as a link to the Trust’s filings with the SEC may be obtained at the following website location: sdt.investorhq.businesswire.com. Any materials filed with the SEC may be accessed via the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. The Trust will also provide electronic or paper copies of its filings free of charge upon request to the Trustee.
Formation and Structure. The Trust holds Royalty Interests in specified oil and natural gas properties located in the Mississippian formation in Alfalfa, Garfield, Grant and Woods counties in Oklahoma (the “Underlying Properties”). The Royalty Interests were conveyed by SandRidge to the Trust concurrent with the initial public offering of the Trust’s common units (“Trust units”) in April 2011 pursuant to the terms set forth in conveyancing documents effective January 1, 2011 (the “conveyances”). As consideration for conveyance of the Royalty Interests, the Trust remitted the proceeds of the offering, along with 3,750,000 Trust units and 7,000,000 subordinated units of the Trust (“subordinated units”), to certain wholly owned subsidiaries of SandRidge. 
The Royalty Interests entitle the Trust to receive 90% of the proceeds (after deducting post-production costs and any applicable taxes) from the sale of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids (“NGL”) production attributable to SandRidge’s net revenue interest in 36 wells producing at December 31, 2010, and one additional well undergoing completion operations at that time (together, the “Initial Wells”), and 50% of the proceeds (after deducting post-production costs and any applicable taxes) from the sale of oil, natural gas and NGL production attributable to SandRidge’s net revenue interest in 123 development wells drilled (the “Trust Development Wells”) within an area of mutual interest (“AMI”) between January 1, 2011, the effective date of the conveyances, and June 30, 2013. Pursuant to a development agreement entered into between the Trust and SandRidge, SandRidge was obligated to drill, or cause to be drilled, the Trust Development Wells by December 31, 2015. SandRidge fulfilled this obligation in April 2013, and, as a result, the subordinated units converted to Trust units in July 2014. At December 31, 2018, SandRidge owned 7,528,063 Trust units, or approximately 26.9% of all Trust units.
SandRidge is obligated to act as a reasonably prudent operator under the same or similar circumstances as it would if it were acting with respect to its own properties, disregarding the existence of the Royalty Interests as burdens affecting such properties. The conveyances generally permit SandRidge to sell all or any part of its interest in the Underlying Properties, if the Underlying Properties are sold subject to and burdened by the Royalty Interests; however, SandRidge was prohibited from selling any of the Underlying Properties subject to the Royalty Interest in the Trust Development Wells until it had satisfied its drilling obligation pursuant to the terms of the development agreement discussed below.
The Trust is passive in nature and neither the Trust nor the Trustee has any control over, or responsibility for, any operating or capital costs related to the Underlying Properties. The business and affairs of the Trust are administered by the Trustee. However, the Trustee has no authority over or responsibility for, and no involvement with, any aspect of the oil and natural gas operations or other activities on the Underlying Properties. The trust agreement generally limits the Trust’s business activities to owning the Royalty Interests and certain activities reasonably related thereto, including activities required or permitted by the terms of the conveyances related to the Royalty Interests.
The Trust will dissolve and begin to liquidate on December 31, 2030 (the “Termination Date”), unless sooner terminated in accordance with the provisions of the trust agreement noted below, and will soon thereafter wind up its affairs and terminate. At the Termination Date, 50% of the Royalty Interests will revert automatically to SandRidge. The remaining 50% of the Royalty Interests will be sold at that time, and the net proceeds of the sale, as well as any remaining Trust cash reserves, will be distributed to the unitholders on a pro rata basis. SandRidge has a right of first refusal to purchase the Royalty Interests retained by the Trust at the Termination Date. The Trust will not dissolve until the Termination Date unless any of the following occurs: (a) the Trust sells all of the Royalty Interests; (b) cash available for distribution for any four consecutive quarters, on a cumulative basis, is less than $1.0 million; (c) Trust unitholders approve an earlier dissolution of the Trust; or (d) the Trust is
1


 judicially dissolved. In the case of any of the foregoing, the Trustee would then sell all of the Trust’s assets, either by private sale or public auction, and distribute the net proceeds of the sale to the Trust unitholders after payment, or reasonable provision for payment, of all Trust liabilities.
The Trust is highly dependent on its Trustor, SandRidge, for multiple services, including the operation of the Trust wells, remittance of net proceeds from the sale of associated production to the Trust, administrative services such as accounting, tax preparation, bookkeeping and informational services performed on behalf of the Trust. The ability to operate the properties depends on the Trustor’s future financial condition and economic performance, access to capital, and other factors, many of which are out of the control of the Trustor.  On May 16, 2016, the Trustor and certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries (collectively, the “Debtors”) filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas (the “Bankruptcy Court”) under the caption In re SandRidge Energy, Inc., et al. On September 20, 2016, the Bankruptcy Court entered an amended order confirming the Amended Joint Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization dated September 19, 2016 (the “Plan”), as modified by the Confirmation Order (the “Amended Confirmation Order”), and on October 4, 2016, the Plan became effective in accordance with its terms and the Debtors emerged from the Chapter 11 Cases. On September 23, 2016, an informal group of former SandRidge shareholders appealed the Amended Confirmation Order. On February 22, 2017, the district court before which the appeal was pending entered an order approving a stipulation to voluntarily dismiss the appeal with prejudice.
Income Tax Considerations. The Trust is treated as a partnership for federal and applicable state income tax purposes. Trust unitholders are treated as partners in that partnership. For United States (“U.S.”) federal income tax purposes, a partnership is not a taxable entity and incurs no U.S. federal income tax liability. With respect to state taxation, a partnership  typically is treated in the same manner as it is for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Each partner is required to take into account his or her share of items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit of the partnership in computing his or her federal income tax liability, regardless of whether cash distributions are made to him or her by the partnership. Distributions by a partnership to a partner generally are not taxable to the partner (but instead reduce tax basis but not below zero) unless the amount of cash distributed to such partner is in excess of the partner’s adjusted tax basis in his or her partnership interest.
Agreements with SandRidge
In conjunction with the conveyance of the Royalty Interests to the Trust, the Trust entered into the following agreements with SandRidge and/or one of its wholly owned subsidiaries:
Administrative Services Agreement. The Trust is party to an administrative services agreement with SandRidge that obligates the Trust to pay SandRidge an annual administrative services fee for accounting, tax preparation, bookkeeping and informational services to be performed by SandRidge on behalf of the Trust. For its services under the administrative services agreement, SandRidge receives an annual fee of $200,000, which is payable in equal quarterly installments and will remain fixed for the life of the Trust. SandRidge is also entitled to receive reimbursement for its out-of-pocket fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with the provision of any of the services under this agreement. The administrative services agreement will terminate on the earliest to occur of (i) the date the Trust shall have dissolved and commenced winding up in accordance with the trust agreement, (ii) the date that all of the Royalty Interests have been terminated or are no longer held by the Trust, (iii) pertaining to services to be provided with respect to any Underlying Properties transferred by SandRidge, the date that either SandRidge or the Trustee may designate by delivering 90-days’ prior written notice, provided that the transferee of such Underlying Properties assumes responsibility to perform the services in place of SandRidge and (iv) a date mutually agreed to by SandRidge and the Trustee.
Registration Rights Agreement. The Trust entered into a registration rights agreement for the benefit of SandRidge and certain of its affiliates and transferees, pursuant to which the Trust agreed to register the offering of the Trust units held by SandRidge and certain of its affiliates and permitted transferees upon request by SandRidge. Specifically, the Trust agreed:
•to use its reasonable best efforts to file a registration statement, including, if so requested, a shelf registration statement, with the SEC as promptly as practicable following receipt of a notice requesting the filing of a registration statement from holders representing a majority of the then outstanding registrable Trust units;
•to use its reasonable best efforts to cause the registration statement or shelf registration statement to be declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after the filing thereof; and
2


•to continuously maintain the effectiveness of the registration statement under the Securities Act for 90 days (or continuously if a shelf registration statement is requested) after the effectiveness thereof or until the Trust units covered by the registration statement have been sold pursuant to such registration statement or until all registrable Trust units:
•have been sold pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act if the transferee thereof does not receive “restricted securities”;
•have been sold in a private transaction in which the transferor’s rights under the registration rights agreement are not assigned to the transferee of the Trust units; or
•become eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144 (or any similar rule then in effect under the Securities Act).
The holders will have the right to require the Trust to file no more than five registration statements in aggregate, one of which has been filed to date. The Trust does not bear any expenses associated with such transactions.
Trust Agreement
The trust agreement provides that the Trust’s business activities are generally limited to owning the Royalty Interests and any activity reasonably related to such ownership, including activities required or permitted by the terms of the conveyances related to the Royalty Interests. As a result, the Trust is not permitted to acquire other oil and natural gas properties or royalty interests and is not able to issue any additional Trust units.
The beneficial interest in the Trust is divided into 28,000,000 Trust units. Each Trust unit represents an equal undivided beneficial interest in the property of the Trust.
Amendment of the trust agreement generally requires the vote of holders of (i) a majority of the Trust units (excluding Trust units owned by SandRidge and its affiliates) and (ii) a majority of the Trust units (including Trust units owned by SandRidge and its affiliates), in each case voting in person or by proxy at a meeting of such unitholders at which a quorum is present. At any time that SandRidge and its affiliates collectively own less than 10% of the total Trust units outstanding, however, the standard for approval will be the vote of the holders of a majority of the Trust units, including Trust units owned by SandRidge and its affiliates, voting in person or by proxy at a meeting of the unitholders at which a quorum is present. Abstentions and broker non-votes will not be deemed to be a vote cast. However, no amendment may:
•increase the power of the Trustee to engage in business or investment activities;
•alter the rights of the Trust unitholders as among themselves; or
•permit the Trustee to distribute the Royalty Interests in kind.
Amendments to the trust agreement’s provisions addressing the following matters may not be made without SandRidge’s consent:
•dispositions of the Trust’s assets;
•indemnification of the Trustee;
•reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses of SandRidge when acting as the Trust’s agent;
•termination of the Trust; and
•amendments of the trust agreement.
Certain amendments to the trust agreement do not require the vote of the Trust unitholders. See “Permitted Amendments” below.
The business and affairs of the Trust are managed by the Trustee. SandRidge operates 73% of the Initial Wells and 93% of the Development Wells, but has no ability to manage or influence the management of the Trust, except through its limited voting rights as a holder of Trust units.

Duties and Powers of the Trustee. The duties of the Trustee are specified in the trust agreement and by the laws of the State of Delaware, except as modified by the trust agreement. The Trustee’s principal duties consist of:
•collecting cash proceeds attributable to the Royalty Interests;
•paying expenses, charges and obligations of the Trust from the Trust’s assets;
•making cash distributions to the unitholders in accordance with the trust agreement;
•causing to be prepared and distributed a Schedule K-1 for each Trust unitholder and preparing and filing tax returns on behalf of the Trust; and
•causing to be prepared and filed reports required to be filed under the Exchange Act and under the rules of any securities exchange or quotation system on which the Trust units are listed or admitted to trading.
Except as set forth below, cash held by the Trustee as a reserve against future liabilities must be invested in:
•interest-bearing obligations of the United States government;
•money market funds that invest only in United States government securities;
•repurchase agreements secured by interest-bearing obligations of the United States government; or
•bank certificates of deposit.
Alternatively, cash held for distribution at the next distribution date may be held in a non-interest-bearing account.
The Trust may not acquire any asset except the Royalty Interests and cash and temporary cash investments, and it may not engage in any investment activity except investing cash on hand.
Merger or Consolidation of Trust. The Trust may merge or consolidate with or into, or convert into, one or more limited partnerships, general partnerships, corporations, business trusts, limited liability companies, or associations or unincorporated businesses if such transaction is agreed to by the Trustee and approved by the vote of the holders of (i) a majority of the Trust units excluding Trust units owned by SandRidge and its affiliates) and (ii) a majority of the Trust units (including Trust units owned by SandRidge and its affiliates), in each case voting in person or by proxy at a meeting of such holders at which a quorum is present and such transaction is permitted under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act and any other applicable law. At any time that SandRidge and its affiliates collectively own less than 10% of the total Trust units outstanding, however, the standard for approval will be the vote of the holders of a majority of the Trust units, including Trust units owned by SandRidge and its affiliates, voting in person or by proxy at a meeting of such holders at which a quorum is present.
Trustee’s Power to Sell Royalty Interests. The Trustee may sell the Royalty Interests under any of the following circumstances:
•the sale is requested by SandRidge in accordance with the provisions of the trust agreement; or
•the sale is approved by the vote of the holders of (i) a majority of the Trust units (excluding Trust units owned by SandRidge and its affiliates) and (ii) a majority of the Trust units (including Trust units owned by SandRidge and its affiliates), in each case voting in person or by proxy at a meeting of such holders at which a quorum is present; except that at any time that SandRidge and its affiliates collectively own less than 10% of the total Trust units outstanding, the standard for approval will be the vote of the holders of a majority of the Trust units, including Trust units owned by SandRidge and its affiliates, voting in person or by proxy at a meeting of such holders at which a quorum is present.
Upon dissolution of the Trust, the Trustee must sell the Royalty Interests. No Trust unitholder approval is required in this event. 
The Trustee will distribute the net proceeds from any sale of the Royalty Interests and other assets to the Trust unitholders after payment or reasonable provision for payment of the liabilities of the Trust.
4


Permitted Amendments. The Trustee may amend or supplement the trust agreement, the conveyances, the administrative services agreement, or the registration rights agreement, without the approval of the Trust unitholders, to cure ambiguities, to correct or supplement defective or inconsistent provisions, to grant any benefit to all Trust unitholders, to evidence or implement any changes required by applicable law or to change the name of the Trust, provided, however, that any such supplement or amendment does not adversely affect the interests of the Trust unitholders. Furthermore, the Trustee, acting alone, may amend the administrative services agreement without the approval of Trust unitholders if such amendment would not increase the cost or expense of the Trust or create an adverse economic impact on the Trust unitholders.
All other permitted amendments to the trust agreement and other agreements listed above may only be made by the vote of the holders of (i) a majority of the Trust units (excluding Trust units owned by SandRidge and its affiliates) and (ii) a majority of the Trust units (including units owned by SandRidge and its affiliates), in each case voting in person or by proxy at a meeting of such holders at which a quorum is present; except that at any time that SandRidge and its affiliates collectively own less than 10% of the total Trust units outstanding, the standard for approval will be the vote of the holders of a majority of the Trust units, including Trust units owned by SandRidge and its affiliates, voting in person or by proxy at a meeting of such holders at which a quorum is present. Abstentions and broker non-votes will not be deemed to be a vote cast.
Responsibility and Liability of the Trustee.  The duties and liabilities of the Trustee are set forth in the trust agreement and by the laws of the State of Delaware. The trust agreement provides that (a) the Trustee shall not have any duties or liabilities, including fiduciary duties, except as expressly set forth in the trust agreement and (b) the duties and liabilities of the Trustee as set forth in the trust agreement replace any other duties and liabilities, including fiduciary duties, to which the Trustee might otherwise be subject.
The Trustee will not make business decisions affecting the assets of the Trust. Therefore, substantially all of the Trustee’s functions under the trust agreement are ministerial in nature. The trust agreement, however, provides that the Trustee may:
•charge for its services as Trustee;
•retain funds to pay for future expenses and deposit them with one or more banks or financial institutions (which may include the Trustee to the extent permitted by law);
•lend funds at commercial rates to the Trust to pay the Trust’s expenses; and
•seek reimbursement from the Trust for its out-of-pocket expenses.
In discharging its duty to Trust unitholders, the Trustee may act in its discretion and will be liable to the Trust unitholders only for willful misconduct, bad faith or gross negligence. The Trustee will not be liable for any act or omission of its agents or employees unless the Trustee acted with willful misconduct, bad faith or gross negligence in its selection and retention. The Trustee will be indemnified individually or as the Trustee for any liability or cost that it incurs in the administration of the Trust, except in cases of willful misconduct, bad faith or gross negligence. The Trustee has a lien on the assets of the Trust as security for this indemnification and its compensation earned as Trustee. Trust unitholders will not be liable to the Trustee for any indemnification. The Trustee ensures that all contractual liabilities of the Trust are limited to the assets of the Trust. The Trustee has not loaned and does not intend to lend funds to the Trust.
Miscellaneous. The Trustee may consult with counsel (which may include counsel to SandRidge), accountants, tax advisors, geologists and engineers and other parties the Trustee believes to be qualified as experts on the matters for which advice is sought. The Trustee will be protected for any action it takes in good faith reliance upon the opinion of the expert.
The Delaware Trustee and the Trustee may resign at any time or be removed with or without cause at any time by the vote of the holders of a majority of the Trust units (excluding Trust units owned by SandRidge and its affiliates), voting in person or by proxy at a meeting of such holders at which a quorum is present; except that at any time that SandRidge and its affiliates collectively own less than 10% of the outstanding Trust units, the standard for approval will be the vote of the holders of a majority of the Trust units, including Trust units owned by SandRidge and its affiliates, voting in person or by proxy at a meeting of such holders at which a quorum is present. Abstentions and broker non-votes will not be deemed to be a vote cast. Any successor must be a bank or trust company meeting certain requirements including having combined capital, surplus and undivided profits of at least $20 million, in the case of the Delaware Trustee, and $100 million, in the case of the Trustee.

Distributions
The Trust makes quarterly cash distributions of substantially all of its cash receipts, after deducting amounts for the Trust’s administrative expenses and cash reserves withheld by the Trustee, on or about the 60th day following the completion of each quarter. Each distribution covers production for a three-month period. The amount of Trust revenues and cash distributions to Trust unitholders depends on:
•oil, natural gas and NGL prices received;
•volume of oil, natural gas and NGL produced and sold;
•post-production costs and any applicable taxes; and
•the Trust’s general and administrative expenses.
The amount of the quarterly distributions will fluctuate from quarter to quarter, depending on the factors discussed above. There is no minimum required distribution. See Note 4 to the financial statements contained in Item 8 of this report for further discussion of Trust distributions.
If at any time the Trust’s cash on hand (including available cash reserves) is not sufficient to pay the Trust’s ordinary course administrative expenses as they become due, the Trust may borrow funds from the Trustee or other lenders, including SandRidge, to pay such expenses. The Trustee has not loaned and does not intend to lend funds to the Trust. If such funds are borrowed, no further distributions will be made to Trust unitholders (except in respect of any previously determined quarterly distribution amount) until the borrowed funds have been repaid. SandRidge has agreed that, if at any time the Trust’s cash on hand (including available cash reserves) is not sufficient to pay the Trust’s ordinary course administrative expenses as they become due, SandRidge will, at the Trustee’s request, loan funds to the Trust necessary to pay such expenses. Any such loan will be on an unsecured basis, and the terms of such loan will be substantially the same as those which would be obtained in an arms’ length transaction between SandRidge and an unaffiliated third party. If SandRidge provides such funds to the Trust, it would become a creditor of the Trust and its interests as a creditor could conflict with the interests of other Trust unitholders.
Properties
As of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Trust’s properties consisted of Royalty Interests in (a) the Initial Wells and (b) 121 additional wells (equivalent to approximately 124 Trust Development Wells under the development agreement) that were drilled and perforated for completion between December 31, 2010 and June 30, 2013. SandRidge was credited for having drilled one full Trust Development Well if a well was drilled and perforated for completion with a minimum perforated length of 2,500 feet and SandRidge’s net revenue interest in the well is equal to 57.0%. For wells with a perforated length of less than 2,500 feet and for wells in which SandRidge had a net revenue interest greater or less than 57.0%, SandRidge received proportionate credit for such well. The Royalty Interests are in properties producing from the Mississippian formation in Oklahoma.
Proved Reserves. The following estimates of net proved oil, natural gas and NGL reserves are based on reserve reports prepared by Cawley, Gillespie & Associates, Inc. (“Cawley Gillespie”),  independent petroleum engineers. The PV-10 and Standardized Measure shown in the table below are not intended to represent the current value of estimated oil, natural gas and NGL reserves attributable to the Royalty Interests as of the dates shown. The reserve reports as of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were based on the average price during the 12-month periods ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, using first-day-of-the-month prices for each month. Refer to “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this report and “Trustee’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7 of this report in evaluating the reserve information presented below.
All of the oil, natural gas and NGL reserves in these reports were estimated by independent petroleum engineers. The process to review and estimate the reserves begins with a staff reservoir engineer collecting and verifying all pertinent data, including but not limited to well test data, production data, historical pricing, cost information, property ownership interests, reservoir data, and geosciences data. This data was reviewed by members of SandRidge’s Reservoir Engineering Department and various levels of SandRidge management for accuracy, before consultation with the independent petroleum engineers. Members of SandRidge’s Reservoir Engineering Department consulted regularly with the independent petroleum engineers during the reserve estimation process to review properties, assumptions, and any new data available. SandRidge’s internal reserve estimates and methodologies were compared to the independent petroleum engineers’ estimates and conclusions before
6


 the reserve estimates were included in the independent petroleum engineers’ reports. Additionally, SandRidge’s senior management reviewed and approved the reserve reports contained herein.
Internal Controls. SandRidge’s Senior Vice President - Reserves, Technology and Business Development is the technical person primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of the Trust’s reserve estimates. He has a Bachelor of Science degree in Petroleum Engineering with over 30 years of practical industry experience, including over 30 years of estimating and evaluating reserve information. In addition, he has also been a certified professional engineer in the state of Oklahoma since 2007 and a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers since 1980.
SandRidge’s Reservoir Engineering Department continually monitors asset performance, making reserves estimate adjustments, as necessary, to ensure the most current reservoir information is reflected in reserves estimates. Reserve information includes production histories as well as other geologic, economic, ownership and engineering data. The corporate Reservoir Engineering Department currently has a total of six full-time employees, consisting of four degreed engineers and two engineering and business analysts with a minimum of a four-year degree in mathematics, finance or other business or science field. SandRidge maintains a continuous education program for engineers and analysts on new technologies and industry advancements and also offers refresher training on basic skill sets.
In order to ensure the reliability of reserves estimates, SandRidge’s internal controls observed within the reserve estimation process include:
•No employee’s compensation is tied to the amount of reserves booked.
•Reserves estimates are prepared by experienced reservoir engineers or under their direct supervision.
•The Senior Vice President - Reserves, Technology and Business Development reports directly to SandRidge’s Chief Operating Officer.
•The Reservoir Engineering Department follows comprehensive SEC-compliant internal policies to determine and report proved reserves including:
•confirming that reserve estimates include all properties owned and are based upon proper working and net revenue interests;
•reviewing and using in the estimation process data provided by other departments within SandRidge such as Accounting; and
•comparing and reconciling internally generated reserve estimates to those prepared by third parties.
 The independent petroleum engineers estimated all of the proved reserve information in these reports, in accordance with the definitions and guidelines of the SEC and, with the exception of the exclusion of future income taxes to which the Trust is not subject, in conformity with the Accounting Standards Codification Topic 932, Extractive Activities-Oil and Gas. Neither Cawley Gillespie nor any member of the SandRidge Reservoir Engineering Department owns an interest in the Underlying Properties nor are they employed on a contingent basis. The qualifications of Cawley Gillespie’s technical personnel primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of the Trust’s reserves estimates included in this report include the following:
•more than 25 years of practical experience in the estimation and evaluation of petroleum reserves;
•a registered professional engineer in the state of Texas; and
•a Bachelor of Science Degree in Petroleum Engineering.
These qualifications meet or exceed the Society of Petroleum Engineers’ standard requirements to be a professionally qualified Reserve Estimator and Auditor.
Reporting of Natural Gas Liquids. Natural gas liquids, or NGL, are produced as a result of the processing of a portion of the Trust’s natural gas production stream. At December 31, 2018, NGL constituted approximately 23% of the Trust’s total proved reserves on a barrel equivalent basis and represented volumes to be produced from properties where contracts are in place for the extraction and separate sale of NGL. NGL are products sold by the gallon. In reporting proved reserves and
7


 production of NGL, production and reserves have been included in barrels. The extraction of NGL in the processing of natural gas reduces the volume of natural gas available for sale. All production information related to natural gas is reported net of the effect of any reduction in natural gas volumes resulting from the processing and extraction of NGL.
A summary of the Trust’s proved oil, natural gas and NGL reserves, all of which are located in the continental United States, is presented below:

(1) Determined using a 12-month average of the first-day-of-the-month index price without giving effect to derivative transactions. The prices used in the reserve report yield weighted average wellhead prices, which are based on first-day-of-the-month index prices and adjusted for transportation and regional price differentials. The index prices and the equivalent weighted average wellhead prices are shown in the table below.

 | Weighted average wellhead prices | | | | | | Index prices | | |

(2) Barrel of oil equivalent, determined using the ratio of six Mcf of natural gas to one Bbl of oil, which approximates the relative energy content of oil as compared to natural gas.
(3) PV-10 is the present value of estimated future net revenue to be generated from the production of proved reserves, discounted at 10% per annum to reflect timing of future cash flows and calculated without deducting future income taxes. PV-10 is a non-GAAP financial measure and generally differs from standardized measure of discounted net cash flows, or Standardized Measure, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, because it does not include the effects of income taxes on future net revenues. Neither PV-10 nor Standardized Measure are intended to represent an estimate of fair market value of the Royalty Interests. PV-10 is used by the industry as an arbitrary reserve asset value measure to compare the relative size and value of the proved reserves held by companies without regard to the specific tax characteristics of such entities and is equivalent to Standardized Measure presented above because the Trust is not subject to federal or state income taxes.

Proved reserves decreased from 3,398 MBoe at December 31, 2017 to 2,445 MBoe at December 31, 2018. This reserve reduction is due primarily from 2018 production totaling 345 MBoe and downward revisions of 630 MBoe of late life reserves due to an increase in the operator’s estimated future workover and improved recovery costs that shortened the economic lives of these properties. Additional reserve decreases amounting to 257 MBoe were the result of wells being shut-in during 2018, changes to the operator’s lease operating costs and other reserve parameters. Partially offsetting these reductions was a 279 MBoe increase associated with the increase in year-end SEC commodity pricing. 
Proved reserves are those quantities of oil, natural gas and NGL that, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations, prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for estimation. To be classified as proved reserves, the project to extract the oil or natural gas must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable period of time.
The area of a reservoir considered proved includes (i) the area identified by drilling and limited by fluid contacts, if any, and (ii) adjacent undrilled portions of the reservoir that can, with reasonable certainty, be judged to be continuous with the identified area and to contain economically producible oil or natural gas on the basis of available geoscience and engineering data. In the absence of data on fluid contacts, proved quantities in a reservoir are limited by the lowest known hydrocarbons as seen in a well penetration unless geoscience, engineering or performance data and reliable technology establish a lower contact with reasonable certainty.
Where direct observation from well penetrations has defined a highest known oil elevation and the potential exists for an associated gas cap, proved oil reserves may be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir only if geoscience, engineering or performance data and reliable technology establish the higher contact with reasonable certainty.
Reserves that can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques (such as fluid injection) are included in the proved classification when (i) successful testing by a pilot project in an area of the reservoir with properties no more favorable than in the reservoir as a whole, the operation of an installed program in the reservoir, or an analogous reservoir, or other evidence using reliable technology establishes the reasonable certainty of the engineering analysis on which the project or program was based and (ii) the project has been approved for development by all necessary parties and entities, including governmental entities.
Existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined. In determining the amount of proved reserves, the price used must be the average price during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the reserve report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding escalations based upon future conditions.
Proved Undeveloped Reserves. 
Under the terms of the development agreement, SandRidge was obligated to drill, or cause to be drilled, the Trust Development Wells by December 31, 2015. SandRidge fulfilled its drilling obligation to the Trust in April 2013. Accordingly, the Trust did not have any proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, no Trust Development Wells were drilled during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, and none will be drilled in the future.

Developed and Undeveloped Acreage
As of April 2013, SandRidge had drilled and perforated for completion approximately 124 equivalent Trust Development Wells, thus fulfilling its drilling obligation. Accordingly, the AMI terminated effective April 2013, and no additional wells have been or will be drilled for the Trust.
Drilling Activity
There were no wells drilled or completed during 2018 or 2017, and there were no wells subject to the Royalty Interests drilling or awaiting completion at December 31, 2018 or 2017.
Marketing and Customers
SandRidge has the responsibility to market, or cause to be marketed, the oil, natural gas and NGL production attributable to the Underlying Properties and is not permitted to charge any marketing fees when determining the net proceeds upon which the royalty payments are calculated, except for marketing fees and costs of non-affiliates. As a result, the net proceeds to the Trust from the sales of oil, natural gas and NGL production from the Underlying Properties are determined based on the same price (net of post-production costs) that SandRidge receives for oil, natural gas and NGL production attributable to SandRidge’s interest in the Underlying Properties.
SandRidge sells oil, natural gas and NGL from the Underlying Properties to a variety of customers, including oil and natural gas companies and trading and energy marketing companies. During each of 2018 and 2017, two customers individually accounted for more than 10% of total revenue attributable to the Royalty Interests. The number of readily available purchasers for the production from the Underlying Properties makes it unlikely that the loss of a single customer in the areas in which SandRidge sells oil, natural gas and NGL production from the Underlying Properties would materially affect the Trust’s revenue. The Trust is not committed under any existing contracts or agreements to provide fixed and determinable quantities of oil, NGL or natural gas in the future. See the table below for additional information on SandRidge’s major customers for the production from the Underlying Properties.

 | Sales | | % of Revenue | 
 | (in thousands) | | | 
2018 | | | | 
Targa Pipeline Mid-Continent West OK LLC | $ | 4,951 | 60.7 | %
Plains All American, Inc. | $ | 2,700 | 33.1 | %
2017 | | | | 
Targa Pipeline Mid-Continent West OK LLC | $ | 5,748 | 64.0 | %
Plains All American, Inc. | $ | 2,547 | 28.3 | %

Title to Properties
The Underlying Properties are subject to certain burdens that are described in more detail below. To the extent that these burdens and obligations affect SandRidge’s rights to production and the value of production from the Underlying Properties, they have been taken into account in calculating the Trust’s interest and in estimating the size and value of the reserves attributable to the Royalty Interests. SandRidge’s interests in the oil and natural gas properties comprising the Underlying Properties are typically subject, in one degree or another, to one or more of the following:
•royalties and other burdens, express and implied, under oil and natural gas leases;
•production payments and similar interests and other burdens created by SandRidge or its predecessors in title;
•a variety of contractual obligations arising under operating agreements, farmout agreements, production sales contracts and other agreements that may affect the properties or their titles;
•liens that arise in the normal course of operations, such as those for unpaid taxes, statutory liens securing unpaid suppliers and contractors and contractual liens under operating agreements that are not yet delinquent or, if delinquent, are being contested in good faith;
11


•pooling, unitization and communitization agreements, declarations and orders;
•easements, restrictions, rights-of-way and other matters that commonly affect real property;
•conventional rights of reassignment that obligate SandRidge to reassign all or part of a property to a third party if SandRidge intends to release or abandon such property; and
•rights reserved to or vested in the appropriate governmental agency or authority to control or regulate the Underlying Properties.
SandRidge believes that its title to the Underlying Properties and the Trust’s title to the Royalty Interest are good and defensible in accordance with standards generally accepted in the oil and natural gas industry, subject to such exceptions as are not so material as to detract substantially from the use or value of such properties or Royalty Interests. 
Competition and Markets
The production and sale of oil, natural gas and NGL is highly competitive. Competitors in northern Oklahoma and southern Kansas include major oil and gas companies, independent oil and gas companies, and individual producers and operators. There are numerous producers in the area, and competitive position in this area is affected by price, contract terms and quality of service.
Oil, natural gas and NGL compete with other forms of energy available to customers, primarily based on price. These alternate forms of energy include electricity, coal and fuel oils. Changes in the availability or price of oil, natural gas or other forms of energy, as well as business conditions, conservation, legislation, regulations and the ability to convert to alternate fuels and other forms of energy may affect the demand for oil, natural gas and NGL.
Future price fluctuations for oil, natural gas and NGL will directly impact Trust distributions, estimates of reserves attributable to the Royalty Interests and estimated and actual future net revenues to the Trust. Due to the many uncertainties that affect the supply and demand for oil, natural gas and NGL, reliable predictions of future oil, natural gas and NGL supply and demand, future product prices or the effect of future product prices on Trust distributions cannot be made. However, lower product prices will adversely affect Trust distributions. 
Seasonal Nature of Business
Generally, demand for oil, natural gas and NGL decreases during the summer months and increases during the winter months. Certain natural gas users utilize natural gas storage facilities and purchase some of their anticipated winter requirements during the summer, which can lessen seasonal demand fluctuations. Seasonal weather conditions and lease stipulations can limit producing activities and other oil and natural gas operations. These seasonal anomalies can increase competition for equipment, supplies and personnel during the spring and summer months, which could lead to shortages and increased costs or delay operations.
Insurance
Insurance is maintained by the operators of the Underlying Properties, in accordance with industry practice, against some, but not all, of the operating risks to which the operators are exposed. Generally, insurance policies include coverage for general liability (including sudden and accidental pollution), physical damage to certain oil and natural gas properties, auto liability, worker’s compensation and employer’s liability, among other things. 
SandRidge maintains general liability insurance coverage up to $1 million per occurrence, which includes sudden and accidental environmental liability coverage for the effects of pollution on third parties, arising from operations. General liability insurance policies contain aggregate policy limits and are subject to certain customary exclusions and limitations and deductibles that must be met prior to recovery. SandRidge maintains $100 million in excess liability coverage, which is in addition to and triggered if the general liability per occurrence limit is reached, and may be subject to a deductible that must be met prior to recovery. In addition, SandRidge maintains control of well/operators extra expense coverage with a limit of $15 million for any one occurrence.
All of SandRidge’s third-party contractors are required to sign master services agreements in which they agree to indemnify SandRidge for injuries and deaths of the service provider’s employees as well as contractors and subcontractors hired
12


 by the service provider. Similarly, SandRidge generally agrees to indemnify each third-party contractor against claims made by employees of SandRidge and SandRidge’s other contractors. Additionally, each party generally is responsible for damage to its own property.
The third-party contractors that perform hydraulic fracturing operations sign the master services agreements containing the indemnification provisions noted above. Currently there are no insurance policies in effect intended to provide coverage for losses solely related to hydraulic fracturing operations. 
SandRidge annually re-evaluates the purchase of insurance, coverage limits and deductibles. Future insurance coverage for the oil and natural gas industry could increase in cost and may include higher deductibles or retentions. In addition, some forms of insurance may become unavailable in the future or unavailable on terms that are economically acceptable. SandRidge may not be able to maintain insurance in the future at rates considered reasonable. Self-insurance or only catastrophic coverage may be elected for certain risks in the future. The Trust does not maintain any insurance policies or coverage against any of the risks of conducting oil and gas exploration and production or related activities.
Regulation
Oil and Natural Gas Regulations. The oil and natural gas industry is extensively regulated by numerous federal, state, local and regional authorities, as well as Native American tribes. Legislation affecting the oil and natural gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion, frequently increasing the regulatory burden. Also, numerous departments and agencies, both federal and state, and Native American tribes are authorized by statute to issue rules and regulations affecting the oil and natural gas industry and its individual members, some of which carry substantial penalties for noncompliance. Although the regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases the cost of doing business and, consequently, affects its profitability, these burdens generally do not affect SandRidge any differently or to any greater or lesser extent than they affect other companies in the industry with similar types, quantities and locations of production. The availability, terms and cost of transportation significantly affect sales of oil, natural gas and NGL. The interstate transportation and sale for resale of oil, natural gas and NGL is subject to federal regulation, including regulation of the terms, conditions and rates for interstate transportation, storage and various other matters, primarily by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”). Federal and state regulations govern the price and terms for access to oil and natural gas pipeline transportation. FERC’s regulations for interstate oil and natural gas transmission in some circumstances may also affect the intrastate transportation of oil and natural gas.
Sales of oil, natural gas and NGL are not currently regulated and are transacted at market prices. Although oil, natural gas and NGL prices are currently unregulated, Congress historically has been active in the area of oil and natural gas regulation. Whether new legislation to regulate oil, natural gas and NGL prices might be proposed, what proposals, if any, might actually be enacted by Congress or the various state legislatures, and what effect, if any, the proposals might have on the operations of the Underlying Properties cannot be predicted.
Production. Operations are subject to various types of regulation at federal, state, local and Native American tribal levels. These types of regulation include reports concerning operations. Most states, and some counties, municipalities and Native American tribal areas also regulate one or more of the following activities: the rates of production, or “allowables”, the use of surface or subsurface waters, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled, the plugging and abandoning of wells, and the notice to surface owners and other third parties.
State laws regulate the size and shape of drilling and spacing units or proration units governing the pooling of oil and natural gas properties. Some states allow forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases. In some instances, forced pooling or unitization may be implemented by third parties and may reduce SandRidge’s interest in the unitized properties. In addition, state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells, generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose requirements regarding the ratability of production. These laws and regulations may limit the amount of oil, natural gas and NGL production from its wells or limit the number of wells or the locations which can be drilled. Moreover, each state generally imposes a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil, natural gas and NGL within its jurisdiction.
Federal, state and local regulations provide detailed requirements for the abandonment of wells, closure or decommissioning of production facilities and pipelines, and for site restorations, in areas where the Underlying Properties are located. For example, the United States Army Corps of Engineers (“Corps”) and many other state and local authorities also have regulations for plugging and abandonment, decommissioning and site restoration.

Natural Gas Sales and Transportation.
The availability, terms and cost of transportation significantly affect sales of oil and natural gas. The interstate transportation and sale for resale of oil and natural gas is subject to federal regulation, including regulation of the terms, conditions and rates for interstate transportation, storage and various other matters, primarily by FERC. Federal and state regulations govern the price and terms for access to oil and natural gas pipeline transportation. FERC’s regulations for interstate oil and natural gas transmission in some circumstances may also affect the intrastate transportation of oil and natural gas. 
Historically, federal legislation and regulatory controls have affected the price of the natural gas SandRidge produces and the manner in which SandRidge markets its production. FERC has jurisdiction over the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce by natural gas companies under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978. Various federal laws enacted since 1978 have resulted in the removal of all price and non-price controls for sale of domestic natural gas sold in first sales, which include all of SandRidge’s sales of its own production. Under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, FERC has substantial enforcement authority to prohibit the manipulation of natural gas markets and enforce its rules and orders, including the ability to assess substantial civil penalties.
FERC also regulates interstate natural gas transportation rates and service conditions and establishes the terms under which SandRidge may use interstate natural gas pipeline capacity, which affects the marketing of natural gas that SandRidge produces, as well as the revenues it receives for sales of its natural gas and release of its natural gas pipeline capacity. Commencing in 1985, FERC promulgated a series of orders, regulations and rule makings that significantly fostered competition in the business of transporting and marketing gas. Currently, interstate pipeline companies are required to provide nondiscriminatory transportation services to producers, marketers and other shippers, regardless of whether such shippers are affiliated with an interstate pipeline company. FERC’s initiatives have led to the development of a competitive, open access market for natural gas purchases and sales that permits all purchasers of natural gas to buy gas directly from third-party sellers other than pipelines. However, the natural gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated; therefore, the less stringent regulatory approach currently pursued by FERC and Congress might not continue indefinitely into the future. SandRidge is unable to determine what effect, if any, future regulatory changes might have on SandRidge’s natural gas related activities.
Under FERC’s current regulatory regime, transmission services must be provided on an open-access, nondiscriminatory basis at cost-based rates or at market-based rates if the transportation market at issue is sufficiently competitive. Gathering service, which occurs upstream of jurisdictional transmission services, is regulated by the states onshore and in-state waters. Although its policy is still in flux, in the past FERC has reclassified certain jurisdictional transmission facilities as non-jurisdictional gathering facilities, which has the tendency to increase the cost of transporting gas to point-of-sale locations.
Oil Price Controls and Transportation Rates.
Sales prices of oil and NGL are not currently regulated and are made at market prices. Sales of these commodities are, however, subject to laws and to regulations issued by the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) prohibiting manipulative or fraudulent conduct in the wholesale petroleum market. The FTC holds substantial enforcement authority under these regulations, including the ability to assess substantial civil penalties. 
The price received from the sale of these products may be affected by the cost of transporting the products to market. Some transportation of oil, natural gas and NGL is through interstate common carrier pipelines. Effective as of January 1, 1995, FERC implemented regulations generally grandfathering all previously approved interstate transportation rates and establishing an indexing system for those rates by which adjustments are made annually based on the rate of inflation, subject to certain conditions and limitations. FERC’s regulation of crude oil and natural gas liquids transportation rates may tend to increase the cost of transporting crude oil and natural gas liquids by interstate pipelines, although the annual adjustments may result in decreased rates in a given year. Every five years, FERC must examine the relationship between the annual change in the applicable index and the actual cost changes experienced in the oil pipeline industry. SandRidge is not able at this time to predict the effects of these regulations or FERC proceedings, if any, on the transportation costs associated with crude oil production from crude oil producing operations.
Environmental and Occupational Safety and Health Regulation. Oil, natural gas and NGL exploration, development and production operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, state, tribal, regional and local laws and regulations governing worker safety and health, the discharge and disposal of substances into the environment, and the protection of the environment and natural resources. Numerous governmental entities, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and analogous state and local agencies, (and, under certain laws, private individuals) have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and any permits issued under them. These laws and regulations may, among other things; (i) require permits to conduct exploration, drilling, water withdrawal, wastewater disposal and other production related
14


 activities; (ii) govern the types, quantities and concentrations of substances that may be disposed or released into the environment or injected into formations in connection with drilling or production activities, and the manner of any such disposal, release or injection; (iii) limit or prohibit construction or require formal mitigation measures in sensitive areas such as wetlands, wilderness areas or areas inhabited by endangered or threatened species; (iv) require investigatory and remedial actions to mitigate pollution conditions arising from SandRidge’s operations or attributable to former operations; (v) impose safety and health restrictions designed to protect employees from exposure to hazardous or dangerous substances; and (vi) impose obligations to reclaim and abandon well sites and pits. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory, remedial or corrective action obligations, the occurrence of delays or restrictions in permitting or performance of projects and the issuance of orders enjoining operations in affected areas. 
Since taking office, the Trump Administration has taken steps aimed at reducing federal regulatory burdens and costs for the oil and gas industry. Nevertheless, changes in environmental regulation may place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment. Any changes in or more stringent enforcement of these laws and regulations that result in delays or restrictions in permitting or development of projects, or more stringent or costly construction, drilling, water management or completion activities or waste handling, storage, transport, remediation, or disposal, emission or discharge requirements could have a material adverse effect on the Trust’s revenues. SandRidge may be unable to pass on such increased compliance costs to customers. Moreover, accidental releases, including spills, may occur in the course of operations on the Underlying Properties, and significant costs could be incurred as a result of such releases or spills, including third-party claims for damage to property and natural resources or personal injury. While SandRidge believes that compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations and that continued compliance with existing requirements will not materially affect it, SandRidge may incur substantial costs in the future related to revised or additional environmental regulations that could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, and results of operations. These costs could have an adverse effect on the value of the Royalty Interests and the Trust’s ultimate cash available for distribution, given that the Trust is highly dependent on SandRidge’s performance.
The following is a summary of the more significant existing and proposed environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations, as amended from time to time, to which SandRidge business operations are subject and for which compliance may have a material adverse impact on the Trust or operation of the Underlying Properties.
Hazardous Substances and Wastes. The federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) and comparable state laws may impose strict, joint and several liability, without regard to fault or legality of conduct on certain persons who are responsible for the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. These persons include current and prior owners or operators of the site where the release of a hazardous substance occurred as well as entities that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substance released at the site. Under CERCLA, these “responsible parties” may be liable for the costs of cleaning up sites where hazardous substances have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources resulting from the release and for the costs of certain environmental and health studies. Additionally, landowners and other third parties may file claims for personal injury and natural resource and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances into the environment. CERCLA also authorizes the EPA and, in some instances, third parties to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment from a hazardous substance release and to pursue steps to recover costs incurred for those actions from responsible parties. Despite the so-called “petroleum exclusion,” certain products used by SandRidge in the course of operations at the Underlying Properties may be regulated as CERCLA hazardous substances. To date, none of the Underlying Properties have been subject to CERCLA response actions. 
The federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state statutes and implementing regulations impose strict “cradle-to-grave” requirements on the generation, transportation, treatment, storage and disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. SandRidge and other operators of the Underlying Properties generate wastes that are subject to the requirements of RCRA and comparable state statutes. Drilling fluids, produced waters and other wastes associated with the exploration, production and/or development of oil and natural gas, including naturally-occurring radioactive material, if properly handled, are currently excluded from regulation as hazardous wastes under RCRA and, instead, are regulated under RCRA’s less stringent non-hazardous waste requirements. Nevertheless, it is possible that these wastes could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future. For example, in December 2016, the EPA and environmental groups entered into a consent decree to address the EPA’s alleged failure to timely assess its RCRA Subtitle D criteria regulations exempting certain exploration and production-related oil and natural gas wastes from regulation as hazardous wastes under RCRA. The consent decree requires the EPA to propose a rulemaking no later than March 15, 2019 for revision of certain Subtitle D criteria regulations pertaining to oil and natural gas wastes or to sign a determination that revision of the regulations is not necessary, and complete any revisions to the applicable RCRA regulations no later than July 15, 2021. While the EPA has not yet taken any action toward changing the status of oil and natural gas wastes under RCRA, any change in the exclusion for such wastes could potentially result in an increase in SandRidge’s costs to manage and dispose of those wastes. 
15


Air Emissions. The federal Clean Air Act (“CAA”) and comparable state laws and regulations restrict the emission of air pollutants through emissions standards, construction and operating permitting programs, and the imposition of other compliance requirements. These laws and regulations may require pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions, strict compliance with air permit requirements or the utilization of specific equipment or technologies to control emissions. The need to acquire such permits has the potential to delay or limit the development of oil and natural gas projects or require SandRidge to incur certain capital expenditures for air pollution control equipment or other air emissions-related issues. For example, the EPA in 2012 adopted federal New Source Performance Standards (“NSPS”) that require the reduction of volatile organic compound emissions from certain fractured and refractured natural gas wells for which well completion operations are conducted and further require that most wells use reduced emission completions, also known as “green completions.” These regulations also establish specific new requirements regarding emissions from production-related wet seal and reciprocating compressors, and from pneumatic controllers and storage vessels. In June 2016, the EPA published a final rule adopting additional NSPS requirements for new, modified, or reconstructed oil and gas facilities that require control of the greenhouse gas methane from affected facilities, including requirements to find and repair fugitive leaks of methane emissions at well sites (“Methane Rule”). Following the 2016 presidential election and change in administrations, the EPA in 2017 proposed to delay implementation of the Methane Rule, and also convened a reconsideration proceeding that resulted in two 2018 rulemaking projects aimed at rolling back certain Methane Rule requirements. These actions, like the Methane Rule itself, have been (or are likely to be) challenged in courts. The ultimate fate of the Methane Rule requirements is unclear. Nevertheless, regulations promulgated under the CAA may require SandRidge to incur development expenses to install and utilize specific equipment, technologies, or work practices to control emissions from its operations. 
The EPA also is charged with establishing ambient air quality standards, the implementation of which can indirectly impact SandRidge’s operations. For example, in October 2015, the EPA lowered the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (“NAAQS”), for ozone from 75 to 70 parts per billion. A number of state and industry petitioners filed suit in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, challenging the 2015 ozone NAAQS. The outcome of the litigation challenging the standard is unknown at this time. Although the EPA has designated all counties in which SandRidge operates as attainment areas for the 2015 ozone standard, these determinations may be revised in the future. State implementation of the revised NAAQS could result in stricter permitting requirements, delay or prohibit SandRidge’s ability to obtain such permits, and result in increased expenditures for pollution control equipment, the costs of which could be significant.
Compliance with these and other air pollution control and permitting requirements has the potential to increase SandRidge’s production costs, which costs could be significant. Additionally, violations of lease conditions or regulations related to air emissions can result in civil and criminal penalties, as well as potential court injunctions curtailing operations and canceling leases. Such enforcement liabilities can result from either governmental or citizen enforcement.
Water Discharges. The federal Clean Water Act (“CWA”) and analogous state laws and implementing regulations impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into waters of the United States and waters of the states, respectively. Pursuant to these laws and regulations, the discharge of pollutants to regulated waters is prohibited unless it is permitted by the EPA, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (“ACE”), or an analogous state or tribal agency. The discharge of wastewater from most onshore oil and gas exploration and production activities is currently prohibited east of the 98th meridian. Additionally, in June 2016, the EPA issued a final rule implementing wastewater pre-treatment standards that prohibit onshore unconventional oil and natural gas extraction facilities from sending wastewater directly to publicly owned treatment works (“POTW”). Unconventional extraction facilities can send wastewater to a private centralized wastewater treatment facility that can either discharge treated water or send it to a POTW. The EPA is conducting a study of the treatment and discharge of oil and gas wastewater. Any restriction of disposal options for hydraulic fracturing waste and other changes to CWA discharge requirements may result in increased costs. SandRidge does not presently discharge pollutants associated with the exploration, development and production of oil, natural gas and NGL on the Underlying Properties into federal or state waters.
In September 2015, new EPA and ACE rules defining the scope of the “waters of the United States,” and EPA’s and the ACE’s jurisdiction, became effective (“2015 Rule”). The 2015 Rule has been challenged in multiple courts on the grounds that it unlawfully expands the reach of CWA programs. Due to the status of pending litigation, the 2015 Rule is currently in effect in 22 states. In the remaining states, regulations in effect before promulgation of the 2015 Rule and guidance interpreting relevant United States Supreme Court rulings are in effect. On December 11, 2018, the heads of the EPA and ACE signed a proposed regulation that would revise the definition of waters of the United States to reduce its reach from the 2015 Rule (“2018 Pre-Proposal Rule”). The fates of the 2015 Rule and the 2018 Pre-Proposal Rule and applicability of the rules during current and future litigation are uncertain; however, to the extent the 2015 Rule is in effect, it expands the scope of CWA jurisdiction, and SandRidge could face increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for dredge and fill activities in wetland areas or other waters of the United States.

Finally, the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA”), which amends the CWA, establishes standards for prevention, containment and cleanup of oil spills into waters of the United States. The OPA requires measures to be taken to prevent the accidental discharge of oil into waters of the United States from onshore production facilities. Measures under the OPA and/or the CWA include inspection and maintenance programs to minimize spills from oil storage and conveyance systems; the use of secondary containment systems to prevent spills from reaching nearby waterbodies; proof of financial responsibility to cover environmental cleanup and restoration costs that could be incurred in connection with an oil spill; and the development and implementation of spill prevention, control and countermeasure (“SPCC”) plans to prevent and respond to oil spills. The OPA also subjects owners and operators of facilities to strict, joint and several liability for all containment and cleanup costs and certain other damages arising from a spill. SandRidge has developed and implemented SPCC plans for the Underlying Properties as required under the CWA.
Subsurface Injections. Underground injection operations performed by SandRidge are subject to the Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”), as well as analogous state laws and regulations. Under the SDWA, the EPA established the Underground Injection Control (“UIC”) program, which established the minimum program requirements for state and local programs regulating underground injection activities. The UIC program includes requirements for permitting, testing, monitoring, record keeping and reporting of injection well activities, as well as a prohibition against the migration of fluid containing any contaminant into underground sources of drinking water. State regulations require a permit from the applicable regulatory agencies to operate underground injection wells. Although SandRidge monitors the injection process of its wells, any leakage from the subsurface portions of the injection wells could cause degradation of fresh groundwater resources, potentially resulting in suspension of SandRidge’s UIC permit, issuance of fines and penalties from governmental agencies, incurrence of expenditures for remediation of the affected resource and imposition of liability by third-parties claiming damages for alternative water supplies, property damages and personal injuries. Some states have considered laws mandating flowback and produced water recycling. Other states have undertaken studies to assess the feasibility of recycling produced water on a large scale. For example, in July 2018, the EPA partnered with New Mexico to evaluate alternatives to injection of wastewater from exploration and production activities by reusing it or treating it for reintroduction into the hydrologic cycle or both, and to propose potential regulations related thereto. If laws mandating reuse and/or treatment in lieu of injection are adopted in areas where SandRidge conducts operations, SandRidge’s operating costs may increase significantly.
Furthermore, in response to recent seismic events near underground disposal wells used for the disposal by injection of produced water resulting from oil and natural gas activities, federal and some state agencies are investigating whether such wells have caused increased seismic activity, and some states have restricted, suspended or shut down the use of such disposal wells. For example, in Oklahoma, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission (“OCC”) has implemented a variety of measures including adopting the National Academy of Science’s “traffic light system,” pursuant to which the agency reviews new disposal well applications for proximity to faults, seismicity in the area and other factors in determining whether such wells should be permitted, permitted only with special restrictions, or not permitted. The OCC also evaluates existing wells to assess their continued operation, or operation with restrictions, based on location relative to such faults, seismicity and other factors, with certain of such existing wells required to make frequent, or even daily, volume and pressure reports. In addition, the OCC has issued rules requiring operators of certain saltwater disposal wells in the state to, among other things, conduct mechanical integrity testing or make certain demonstrations of such wells’ depth that, depending on the depth, could require the plugging back of such wells and/or the reduction of volumes disposed in such wells. As a result of these measures, the OCC from time to time has developed and implemented plans calling for wells within Areas of Interest where seismic incidents have occurred to restrict or suspend disposal well operations in an attempt to mitigate the occurrence of such incidents. For example, in February  2016, the OCC issued a plan to reduce disposal well volume in the Arbuckle formation by 40 percent, covering approximately 5,281 square miles and 245 disposal wells injecting wastewater into the Arbuckle formation. In the plan, the OCC identified 76 SandRidge-operated disposal wells, prescribed a four-stage volume reduction schedule and set April 30, 2016 as the final date for compliance with the tiered volume reduction plan. In March 2016, the OCC reduced the injection volume of additional Arbuckle disposal wells, including wells SandRidge operates. Following earthquakes in August, September and November 2016, the OCC and the EPA further limited the disposal volumes that can be disposed in Arbuckle wells, although these actions did not cover SandRidge’s disposal wells. While induced seismic events generally decreased in 2017, the OCC expanded restrictions on the use of existing Arbuckle disposal wells and imposed new reporting requirements related to disposal volumes on wells injecting produced water into the Arbuckle formation. In February 2018, the OCC instituted a new protocol to further address seismicity in the Sooner Trend Anadarko Basin Canadian and Kingfisher County and South Central Oklahoma Oil Province Plays which requires various actions, such as a pause in operations for several hours, when certain seismic data is observed. Such requirements may reduce the productivity of SandRidge’s operations in relevant areas. 

 Evaluation of seismic incidents and whether, or to what extent, those events are induced by the injection of saltwater into disposal wells continues to evolve, as governmental authorities consider new and/or past seismic incidents in areas where salt water disposal activities occur or are proposed to be performed. The adoption of any new laws, regulations, or directives that restrict SandRidge’s ability to dispose of saltwater generated by production and development activities on the Underlying Properties, whether by plugging back the depths of disposal wells, reducing the volume of salt water disposed in such wells,
17


 restricting disposal well locations, or by requiring SandRidge to shut down disposal wells, could significantly increase SandRidge’s costs to manage and dispose of this saltwater, which could negatively affect the economic lives of the Underlying Properties. In addition, SandRidge could be subject to third party lawsuits alleging damages resulting from seismic events that occur in its areas of operation.
Climate Change. In 2009, the EPA published its findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and certain other “greenhouse gases” (collectively, “GHGs”) present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to warming of the earth’s atmosphere and other climatic changes. The EPA has taken a number of steps aimed at gathering information about, and reducing the emissions of, GHGs from industrial sources, including oil and natural gas sources. The EPA has adopted rules requiring the reporting of GHG emissions from oil, natural gas and NGL production and processing facilities on an annual basis, as well as reporting GHG emissions from gathering and boosting systems, oil well completions and workovers using hydraulic fracturing. The EPA also has adopted and implemented regulations under existing provisions of the CAA that, among other things, establish Prevention of Significant Deterioration (“PSD”) construction and Title V operating permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources that already are potential major sources of certain principal, or criteria, pollutant emissions. Facilities required to obtain PSD permits for their GHG emissions also will be required to meet “best available control technology” standards that typically are established by the states. This rule could adversely affect SandRidge’s operations upon the Underlying Properties and restrict or delay its ability to obtain air permits for new or modified facilities that exceed GHG emission thresholds. In June 2016, the EPA published a final rule adopting New Source Performance Standards (“NSPS”) for new, modified, or reconstructed oil and gas facilities that require control of the GHG methane from affected facilities, including requirements to find and repair fugitive leaks of methane emissions at well sites (“Methane Rule”). Following the 2016 presidential election and change in administrations, the EPA in 2017 proposed to delay implementation of the Methane Rule, and also convened a reconsideration proceeding that resulted in two 2018 rulemaking projects aimed at rolling back certain Methane Rule requirements. These actions, like the Methane Rule itself, have been (or are likely to be) challenged in courts. The ultimate fate of the Methane Rule requirements is unclear. Nevertheless, regulations promulgated under the CAA may require SandRidge to incur development expenses to install and utilize specific equipment, technologies, or work practices to control emissions from its operations. In addition, in November 2016, the U.S. Department of the Interior Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) issued final rules to reduce methane emissions from venting, flaring, and leaks during oil and gas operations on federal and tribal lands that are substantially similar to the EPA’s Methane Rule. However, in December 2017, the BLM published a final rule to temporarily suspend or delay certain requirements contained in the November 2016 final rule until January 17, 2019, including those requirements relating to venting, flaring and leakage from oil and gas production activities. Further, in September 2018, the BLM published a final rule revising or rescinding certain provisions of the 2016 rule. Although the future implementation of the EPA and BLM rules aimed at controlling GHG emissions from oil and natural gas sources remains uncertain, future federal GHG regulations for the oil and gas industry remain a possibility given the long-term trend towards increasing regulation. Moreover, several states already have adopted rules requiring operators of both new and existing sources to develop and implement an LDAR program and to install devices on certain equipment to capture 95 percent of methane emissions. Compliance with these rules could require SandRidge to purchase pollution control equipment and optical gas imaging equipment for LDAR inspections, and to hire additional personnel to assist with inspection and reporting requirements. 
In addition, a number of state and regional efforts are aimed at tracking and/or reducing GHG emissions by means of cap-and-trade programs that typically require major sources of GHG emissions to acquire and surrender emission allowances in return for emitting those GHGs. On an international level, the United States is one of almost 200 nations that agreed in December 2015 to an international climate change agreement in Paris, France that calls for countries to set their own GHG emissions targets and be transparent about the measures each country will use to achieve its GHG emissions targets, (the “Paris Agreement”). However, the Paris Agreement does not impose any binding obligations on the United States. Moreover, in June 2017, President Trump announced that the United States would withdraw from the Paris Agreement, but may enter into a future international agreement related to GHGs. In August 2017, the U.S. State Department officially informed the United Nations of the intent of the United States to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. Such withdrawal has not yet been finalized, and whether the United States may reenter the Paris Agreement or a separately negotiated agreement is unclear at this time. Further, several states and local governments remain committed to the principles of the Paris Agreement in their effectuation of policy and regulations. It is not possible at this time to predict how or when the United States might impose restrictions on GHGs as a result of the Paris Agreement. The adoption and implementation of any laws or regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting emissions of GHGs from operations could require additional expenditures to reduce emissions of GHGs associated with operations or could adversely affect demand for the oil, natural gas and NGL production attributable to the Royalty Interests, and thus possibly have a material adverse effect on the Trust’s revenues. Recently, activists concerned about the potential effects of climate change have directed their attention at sources of funding for fossil-fuel energy companies, which has resulted in certain financial institutions, funds and other sources of capital restricting or eliminating their investment in oil and natural gas activities. Ultimately, this could make it more difficult to secure funding for exploration and production activities. Notwithstanding potential risks related to climate change, the International Energy Agency estimates that global energy demand will continue to rise and will not peak until after 2040 and that oil and gas will continue to represent a
18


 substantial percentage of global energy use over that time. Finally, to the extent increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth’s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, and floods and other climatic events, such events could have an adverse effect on assets and operations related to the Underlying Properties.
Endangered Species. The federal Endangered Species Act (“ESA”) restricts activities that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats without first obtaining an incidental take permit and implementing mitigation measures. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act. If endangered species are located in areas of the Underlying Properties where seismic surveys, development activities or abandonment operations may be conducted, the work could be prohibited or delayed or expensive mitigation may be required. In February 2016, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (“USFWS”) published a final policy which alters how it identifies critical habitat for endangered and threatened species. In July 2018, the USFWS proposed several changes to ESA regulations, including changes to the procedures and criteria for listing or removing species from the Lists of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants and for designating critical habitat. A critical habitat designation could result in further material restrictions to federal and private land use and could delay or prohibit land access or development. The designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas where operations on the Underlying Properties are located could cause SandRidge to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations on exploration and production activities that could have an adverse impact on the ability to develop and produce reserves from the Underlying Properties. SandRidge is an active participant on various agency and industry committees that are developing or addressing various ESA and other federal and state agency programs to minimize potential impacts to its business and the Underlying Properties.
Employee Health and Safety. The operations of SandRidge are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, including the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) and comparable state statutes, whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA Hazard Communication Standard requires SandRidge to maintain information concerning hazardous materials used or produced in its operations and to provide this information to employees. Pursuant to the Federal Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, facilities that store hazardous chemicals that are subject to OSHA’s Hazard Communication Standard above certain threshold quantities must submit information regarding those chemicals by March 1 of each year to state and local authorities in order to facilitate emergency planning and response. That information is generally available to employees, state and local governmental authorities, and the public. SandRidge has been submitting, and will continue to submit, this information to these authorities for the Underlying Properties each year.
State and Local Regulation. The Underlying Properties are subject to state and other local regulations applicable to the drilling for, and the production and gathering of, oil, natural gas and NGL, including requirements relating to drilling permits, the location, spacing and density of wells, unitization and pooling of interests, the method of drilling, casing and equipping of wells, the protection of fresh water sources, the orderly development of common sources of supply of oil, natural gas and NGL, the operation of wells, allowable rates of production, the use of fresh water in oil and natural gas operations, saltwater injection and disposal operations, the plugging and abandonment of wells and the restoration of surface properties, the prevention of waste of oil and natural gas resources, the protection of the correlative rights of oil and natural gas owners and, where necessary to avoid unfair, unjust or discriminatory service, the fees, terms and conditions for the gathering of natural gas. These regulations may affect the amounts of oil, natural gas and NGL that may be produced from the Underlying Properties. Realized prices for the first sale of oil, natural gas and NGL are not subject to state regulation in Oklahoma. Moreover, obtaining or renewing permits and other approvals for operating on Native American lands can take substantial amounts of time, and could result in increased costs or delays to operations.
Glossary of Oil and Natural Gas Terms
The following is a description of the meanings of some of the oil and natural gas industry terms used in this report.
Bbl. One stock tank barrel, or 42 U.S. gallons liquid volume, used in this report in reference to oil or other liquid hydrocarbons.
Boe. Barrels of oil equivalent, with six thousand cubic feet of natural gas being equivalent to one barrel of oil. Although an equivalent barrel of condensate or natural gas may be equivalent to a barrel of oil on an energy basis, it is not equivalent on a value basis as there may be a large difference in value between an equivalent barrel and a barrel of oil. For example, based on the commodity prices used to prepare the estimate of the Trust’s reserves at year-end 2018 of $65.56/ Bbl for oil and $3.10/ Mcf for natural gas, the ratio of economic value of oil to natural gas was approximately 21 to 1, even though the ratio for determining energy equivalency is 6 to 1.
19


Boe/d. Barrels of oil equivalent per day.
Btu or British thermal unit. The quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit.
Completion. The process of treating a drilled well followed by the installation of permanent equipment for the production of oil or natural gas, or in the case of a dry well, the reporting to the appropriate authority that the well has been abandoned.
Developed acreage. The number of acres that are assignable to productive wells.
Developed oil and natural gas reserves. Reserves of any category that can be expected to be recovered (i) through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well and (ii) through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means not involving a well.
Development well. A well drilled within the proved area of an oil or natural gas reservoir to the depth of a stratigraphic horizon known to be productive.
Gross wells. The total wells in which a working interest is owned.
MBbls. Thousand barrels of oil or other liquid hydrocarbons.
MBoe. Thousand barrels of oil equivalent.
MBoe/d. Thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day.
Mcf. Thousand cubic feet of natural gas.
MMBoe. Million barrels of oil equivalent.
MMBtu. Million British Thermal Units.
MMcf. Million cubic feet of natural gas.
Net wells. The sum of the fractional working interest owned in gross wells, as the case may be.
Net revenue interests. A share of production after all burdens, such as royalty and overriding royalty interest, have been deducted from the working interest.
NGL. Natural gas liquids, such as ethane, propane, butanes and natural gasolines that are extracted from natural gas production streams.
Plugging and abandonment. Refers to the sealing off of fluids in the strata penetrated by a well so that the fluids from one stratum will not escape into another or to the surface. Oklahoma regulations require plugging of abandoned wells.
Present value of future net revenues (“PV-10”). The present value of estimated future revenues to be generated from the production of proved reserves, before income taxes, calculated in accordance with SEC guidelines, net of estimated production and future development costs, using prices and costs as of the date of estimation without future escalation and without giving effect to hedging activities, non-property related expenses such as general and administrative expenses, debt service and depreciation, depletion and amortization. PV-10 is calculated using an annual discount rate of 10%.
Production costs. Costs incurred to operate and maintain wells and related equipment and facilities, including depreciation and applicable operating costs of support equipment and facilities and other costs of operating and maintaining those wells and related equipment and facilities that become part of the cost of oil, natural gas and NGL produced. 
Productive well. A well that is found to be capable of producing oil or natural gas in sufficient quantities to justify completion as an oil or natural gas well.
Proved developed reserves. Reserves that are both proved and developed.
20


Proved oil, natural gas and NGL reserves. Those quantities of oil, natural gas and NGL that, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations, prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for estimation. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time.
The area of a reservoir considered proved includes (i) the area identified by drilling and limited by fluid contacts, if any, and (ii) adjacent undrilled portions of the reservoir that can, with reasonable certainty, be judged to be continuous with it and to contain economically producible oil or natural gas on the basis of available geoscience and engineering data. In the absence of data on fluid contacts, proved quantities in a reservoir are limited by the lowest known hydrocarbons as seen in a well penetration unless geoscience, engineering or performance data and reliable technology establish a lower contact with reasonable certainty.
Where direct observation from well penetrations has defined a highest known oil elevation and the potential exists for an associated gas cap, proved oil reserves may be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir only if geoscience, engineering or performance data and reliable technology establish the higher contact with reasonable certainty.
Reserves that can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques (including, but not limited to, fluid injection) are included in the proved classification when (i) successful testing by a pilot project in an area of the reservoir with properties no more favorable than in the reservoir as a whole, the operation of an installed program in the reservoir, or an analogous reservoir, or other evidence using reliable technology establishes the reasonable certainty of the engineering analysis on which the project or program was based and (ii) the project has been approved for development by all necessary parties and entities, including governmental entities.
Existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined. The price shall be the average price during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding escalations based upon future conditions.
Proved undeveloped reserves. Reserves that are both proved and undeveloped.
PV-10. See “Present value of future net revenues” above.
Reserves. Estimated remaining quantities of oil, natural gas and NGL and related substances anticipated to be economically producible by application of development projects to known accumulations. In addition, there must exist, or there must be a reasonable expectation that there will exist, the legal right to produce or a revenue interest in the production, installed means of delivering oil, natural gas and NGL or related substances to market, and all permits and financing required to implement the project.
Reserves should not be assigned to adjacent reservoirs isolated by major, potentially sealing, faults until those reservoirs are penetrated and evaluated as economically producible. Reserves should not be assigned to areas that are clearly separated from a known accumulation by a non-productive reservoir (i.e. absence of reservoir, structurally low reservoir, or negative test results). Such areas may contain prospective resources (i.e. potentially recoverable resources from undiscovered accumulations).
Reservoir. A porous and permeable underground formation containing a natural accumulation of producible oil and/or natural gas that is confined by impermeable rock or water barriers and is individual and separate from other reservoirs.
Standardized measure or standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows. The present value of estimated future cash inflows from proved oil, natural gas and NGL reserves, less future development and production costs and future income tax expenses, discounted at 10% per annum to reflect timing of future cash flows and using the same pricing assumptions as were used to calculate PV-10. Standardized Measure differs from PV-10 because Standardized Measure includes the effect of future income taxes on future net revenues.
Undeveloped acreage. Lease acreage on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of economic quantities of oil or natural gas regardless of whether such acreage contains proved reserves.
21


Undeveloped oil, natural gas and NGL reserves. Reserves of any category that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.
(i) Reserves on undrilled acreage are limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, unless evidence using reliable technology exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distances.
(ii) Undrilled locations are classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless the specific circumstances justify a longer time.
(iii) Under no circumstances shall estimates for undeveloped reserves be attributable to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique is contemplated, unless such techniques have been proved effective by actual projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir or by other evidence using reliable technology establishing reasonable certainty.
Working interest. The operating interest that gives the owner the right to drill, produce and conduct operating activities on the property and receive a share of production and requires the owner to pay a share of the costs of drilling and production operations.
