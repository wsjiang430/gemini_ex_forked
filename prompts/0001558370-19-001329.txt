Item 1. Business. General Development of Business
 Liberty Media Corporation (“Liberty”, the “Company”, “we”, “us” and “our”) owns interests in subsidiaries and other companies which are engaged in the global media and entertainment industries. Our principal businesses and assets include our consolidated subsidiaries SIRIUS XM (defined below), Formula 1, Braves Holdings, LLC (“Braves Holdings”) and our equity affiliate Live Nation Entertainment, Inc. (“Live Nation”). 
 In September 2011, Liberty Interactive Corporation (“Liberty Interactive” and formerly named Liberty Media Corporation) completed the split-off of its former wholly-owned subsidiary (then known as Liberty Media Corporation) from its Liberty Interactive tracking stock group (the “Split-Off”). Liberty Interactive is now known as Qurate Retail, Inc. (“Qurate Retail”).
 During August 2012, the board of directors of Starz (now known as Starz Acquisition, LLC and formerly known as Liberty Media Corporation) authorized a plan to distribute to the stockholders of Starz shares of a wholly-owned subsidiary, Liberty (formerly known as Liberty Spinco, Inc.), that held, as of January 11, 2013, all of the businesses, assets and liabilities of Starz not associated with Starz, LLC (with the exception of the Starz, LLC office building) (the “Starz Spin-Off”). The transaction was effected as a pro-rata dividend of shares of Liberty to the stockholders of Starz. The businesses, assets and liabilities not included in Liberty were part of a separate public company which was renamed Starz.
 On January 18, 2013, Liberty, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, purchased 50,000,000 shares of the common stock (“SIRIUS XM Common Stock”), par value $0.001 per share, of SIRIUS XM Radio, Inc. (now known as Sirius XM Holdings Inc., “SIRIUS XM”). Additionally, on January 18, 2013 a subsidiary of the Company converted all of its remaining shares of SIRIUS XM’s Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series B-1, par value $0.001 per share, into 1,293,509,076 shares of SIRIUS XM Common Stock. As a result of these transactions, along with shares of SIRIUS XM Common Stock already held by the Company, the Company and its subsidiaries held more than 50% of the capital stock of SIRIUS XM entitled to vote. Therefore, Liberty began consolidating SIRIUS XM in the first quarter of 2013. SIRIUS XM, since the date of our investment, has repurchased approximately 2.7 billion SIRIUS XM shares for approximately $10.7 billion. As of December 31, 2018 our economic ownership interest in SIRIUS XM is approximately 73%. On February 1, 2019, SIRIUS XM issued shares of SIRIUS XM Common Stock in conjunction with its acquisition of Pandora Media, Inc. (“Pandora”), which reduced our economic ownership in SIRIUS XM to approximately 67% as of such date.
 During 2014, Liberty’s board of directors approved the issuance of shares of Series C Liberty Media Corporation common stock to holders of its Series A Liberty Media Corporation and Series B Liberty Media Corporation common stock, effected by means of a dividend. On July 23, 2014, holders of Series A and Series B Liberty Media Corporation common stock received a dividend of two shares of Series C Liberty Media Corporation common stock for each share of Series A or Series B Liberty Media Corporation common stock held by them as of July 7, 2014.
 On November 4, 2014, Liberty completed the spin-off to its stockholders of common stock of a newly formed company called Liberty Broadband Corporation (“Liberty Broadband”) (the “Broadband Spin-Off”). At the time of the Broadband Spin-Off, Liberty Broadband was comprised of, among other things, (i) Liberty’s former interest in Charter Communications, Inc. (“Charter”), (ii) Liberty’s former subsidiary TruePosition, Inc. (“TruePosition”) (now known as Skyhook Holding, Inc.), (iii) Liberty’s former minority equity investment in Time Warner Cable, Inc. (“Time Warner Cable”), (iv) certain deferred tax liabilities, as well as liabilities related to Time Warner Cable call options and (v) indebtedness, pursuant to margin loans, entered into prior to the completion of the Broadband Spin-Off. In September 2015, Liberty entered into a closing agreement with the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) which provided that the Broadband Spin-Off qualified for tax-free treatment. 
 During November 2015, Liberty’s board of directors authorized management to pursue a reclassification of the Company’s common stock into three new tracking stock groups, one to be designated as the Liberty Braves tracking stock, 

 
  I-1

 
one to be designated as the Liberty Media tracking stock and one to be designated as the Liberty SiriusXM tracking stock (the “Recapitalization”), and to cause to be distributed subscription rights related to the Liberty Braves tracking stock following the creation of the new tracking stocks. The Recapitalization was completed on April 15, 2016 and the newly issued shares commenced trading or quotation in the regular way on the Nasdaq Global Select Market or the OTC Markets, as applicable, on April 18, 2016. In May 2016, the IRS completed its review of the Recapitalization and notified Liberty that it agreed with the nontaxable characterization of the transaction.
 In the Recapitalization, each issued and outstanding share of Liberty’s existing common stock was reclassified and exchanged for (a) 1 share of the corresponding series of Liberty SiriusXM common stock, (b) 0.1 of a share of the corresponding series of Liberty Braves common stock and (c) 0.25 of a share of the corresponding series of Liberty Media common stock on April 15, 2016. Cash was paid in lieu of the issuance of any fractional shares.
 Following the creation of the tracking stocks, Series A, Series B and Series C Liberty SiriusXM common stock trade under the symbols LSXMA/B/K, respectively; Series A, Series B and Series C Liberty Braves common stock trade or are quoted under the symbols BATRA/B/K respectively; and Series A, Series B and Series C Liberty Media common stock traded or were quoted under the symbols LMCA/B/K, respectively. Shortly following the Second Closing (as defined below), the Liberty Media Group and Liberty Media common stock were renamed the Liberty Formula One Group (the “Formula One Group”) and the Liberty Formula One common stock, respectively, and the corresponding ticker symbols for the Series A, Series B and Series C Liberty Media common stock were changed to FWONA/B/K, respectively. Each series (Series A, Series B and Series C) of the Liberty SiriusXM common stock trades on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. Series A and Series C Liberty Braves common stock trade on the Nasdaq Global Select Stock Market and Series B Liberty Braves common stock is quoted on the OTC Markets. Series A and Series C Liberty Formula One common stock trade on the Nasdaq Global Select Market and the Series B Liberty Formula One common stock is quoted on the OTC Markets. Although the Second Closing (as defined below), and the corresponding tracking stock name and the ticker symbol change, were not completed until January 23 and January 24, 2017, respectively, historical information of the Liberty Media Group and Liberty Media common stock is referred to herein as the Formula One Group and Liberty Formula One common stock, respectively.
 In addition, following the creation of the new tracking stocks, Liberty distributed to holders of its Liberty Braves common stock subscription rights to acquire shares of Series C Liberty Braves common stock in order to raise capital to repay an intergroup note and for working capital purposes. The rights offering commenced on May 18, 2016, which was also the ex-dividend date for the distribution of the Series C Liberty Braves subscription rights. The rights offering expired on June 16, 2016 and was fully subscribed with 15,833,634 shares of Series C Liberty Braves common stock issued to those rightsholders exercising basic and, if applicable, oversubscription privileges. In September 2016, the IRS completed its review of the distribution of the Series C Liberty Braves subscription rights and notified Liberty that it agreed with the nontaxable characterization of the distribution.
 On September 7, 2016, Liberty, through its indirect wholly owned subsidiary Liberty GR Cayman Acquisition Company, entered into two definitive stock purchase agreements relating to the acquisition of Delta Topco Limited (“Delta Topco”), the parent company of Formula 1. The transactions contemplated by the first purchase agreement were completed on September 7, 2016, resulting in the acquisition of slightly less than a 20% minority stake in Formula 1 on an undiluted basis. On October 27, 2016 under the terms of the first purchase agreement, Liberty acquired an additional incremental equity interest in Delta Topco, maintaining Liberty’s investment in Delta Topco on an undiluted basis and increasing slightly to 19.1% on a fully diluted basis. Liberty acquired 100% of the fully diluted equity interests of Delta Topco, other than a nominal number of shares held by certain Formula 1 teams, in a closing under the second purchase agreement (and following the unwind of the first purchase agreement) on January 23, 2017 (the “Second Closing”). Liberty’s interest in Delta Topco and by extension, in Formula 1, along with existing Formula 1 cash and debt (which are non-recourse to Liberty), are attributed to the Formula One Group.
 A tracking stock is a type of common stock that the issuing company intends to reflect or “track” the economic performance of a particular business or “group,” rather than the economic performance of the company as a whole. While the Liberty SiriusXM Group, the Liberty Braves Group (the “Braves Group”) and Formula One Group have separate collections of businesses, assets and liabilities attributed to them, no group is a separate legal entity and therefore cannot own assets, issue securities or enter into legally binding agreements. Therefore, the Liberty SiriusXM Group, Braves Group 

 
  I-2

 
and Formula One Group do not represent separate legal entities, but rather represent those businesses, assets and liabilities that have been attributed to each respective group. Holders of tracking stock have no direct claim to the group’s stock or assets and therefore, do not own, by virtue of their ownership of a Liberty tracking stock, any equity or voting interest in a company, such as SIRIUS XM, Formula 1 or Live Nation, in which Liberty holds an interest and that is attributed to a Liberty tracking stock group, such as the Liberty SiriusXM Group or the Formula One Group. Holders of a tracking stock are also not represented by separate boards of directors. Instead, holders of a tracking stock are stockholders of the parent corporation, with a single board of directors and subject to all of the risks and liabilities of the parent corporation.
 The Liberty SiriusXM tracking stock is intended to track and reflect the separate economic performance of the businesses, assets and liabilities attributed to the Liberty SiriusXM Group: Liberty’s subsidiary SIRIUS XM, corporate cash, investments in debt securities, Liberty’s 2.125% Exchangeable Senior Debentures due 2048 and a margin loan obligation incurred by a wholly-owned special purpose subsidiary of Liberty. SIRIUS XM is the only operating subsidiary attributed to the Liberty SiriusXM Group. In the event SIRIUS XM were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, Liberty’s management would evaluate the circumstances at such time and take appropriate steps in the best interest of all of its stockholders, which may not be in the best interest of a particular group or groups when considered independently. In such a situation, Liberty’s management and its board of directors would have several approaches at their disposal, including, but not limited to, the conversion of the Liberty SiriusXM common stock into another tracking stock of Liberty, the reattribution of assets and liabilities among Liberty’s tracking stock groups or the restructuring of Liberty’s tracking stocks to either create a new tracking stock structure or eliminate it altogether. On February 1, 2019, SIRIUS XM acquired Pandora. See note 7 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the acquisition of Pandora.
 The Liberty Braves tracking stock is intended to track and reflect the separate economic performance of the businesses, assets and liabilities attributed to the Braves Group: its subsidiary, Braves Holdings, which indirectly owns the Atlanta Braves Major League Baseball Club (“ANLBC,” the “Atlanta Braves,” the “Braves,” the “club,” or the “team”) and certain assets and liabilities associated with ANLBC’s stadium and mixed use development project (the “Development Project”) and cash. The Formula One Group holds an intergroup interest in the Braves Group.
 The Liberty Formula One tracking stock is intended to track and reflect the separate economic performance of the businesses, assets and liabilities attributed to the Formula One Group which include all of the businesses, assets and liabilities of Liberty other than those specifically attributed to the Braves Group or the Liberty SiriusXM Group, including Liberty’s interests in Formula 1 and Live Nation, cash, Liberty’s 1.375% Cash Convertible Notes due 2023 and related financial instruments, Liberty’s 1% Cash Convertible Notes due 2023, Liberty’s 2.25% Exchangeable Senior Debentures due 2046 and Liberty’s 2.25% Exchangeable Senior Debentures due 2048. As part of the Recapitalization, the Formula One Group initially held a 20% intergroup interest in the Braves Group. As a result of the rights offering, the number of notional shares representing the intergroup interest held by the Formula One Group was adjusted to 9,084,940, representing a 15.1% intergroup interest in the Braves Group at December 31, 2018. The intergroup interest is a quasi-equity interest which is not represented by outstanding shares of common stock; rather, the Formula One Group has an attributed interest in the Braves Group which is generally stated in terms of a number of shares of Series C Liberty Braves common stock issuable to the Formula One Group with respect to its interest in the Braves Group. The intergroup interest may be settled, at the discretion of the board of directors, through the transfer of newly issued shares of Liberty Braves common stock, cash and/or other assets to the Formula One Group. The intergroup interest will remain outstanding until the cancellation of the outstanding interest, at the discretion of the Company’s board of directors, through transfer of securities, cash and/or other assets from the Braves Group to the Formula One Group.

 SIRIUS XM
 SIRIUS XM transmits music, sports, entertainment, comedy, talk, news, traffic and weather channels, as well as infotainment services, in the United States on a subscription fee basis through its two proprietary satellite radio systems. SIRIUS XM also transmits a larger set of music and other channels and video programming through its streaming service. SIRIUS XM’s streaming service is available online and through applications for mobile devices, home devices and other consumer electronic equipment. SIRIUS XM also provides connected vehicle services. SIRIUS XM’s connected vehicle services are designed to enhance the safety, security and driving experience for vehicle operators while providing marketing and operational benefits to automakers and their dealers.

  I-5

 


· | subscribers that have prepaid, including payments made or due from automakers for subscriptions included in the sale or lease price of a vehicle;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | subscribers to its streaming services who do not also have satellite radio subscriptions; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | certain subscribers to its weather, traffic and data services who do not also have satellite radio subscriptions.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  SIRIUS XM’s primary source of revenue is subscription fees, with most of its customers subscribing to monthly, quarterly, semi-annual or annual plans. SIRIUS XM offers discounts for prepaid subscription plans, as well as a multiple subscription discount. SIRIUS XM also derives revenue from certain fees, the sale of advertising on select non-music channels, the direct sale of satellite radios and accessories, and other ancillary services, such as its weather, traffic and data services. SIRIUS XM provides traffic services to approximately 8.6 million vehicles.
 SIRIUS XM’s satellite radios are primarily distributed through automakers, retailers and its website. SIRIUS XM has agreements with every major automaker to offer satellite radios in their vehicles, through which SIRIUS XM acquires the majority of its subscribers. SIRIUS XM also acquires subscribers through marketing to owners and lessees of previously-owned vehicles that include factory-installed satellite radios that are not currently subscribing to its services. Satellite radio services are also offered to customers of certain rental car companies.
 Programming
 SIRIUS XM offers a dynamic programming lineup of commercial-free music plus sports, entertainment, comedy, talk, and news, including:

· | an extensive selection of music genres, ranging from rock, pop and hip-hop to country, dance, jazz, Latin and classical;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | live play-by-play sports from major leagues and colleges;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


· | a multitude of talk and entertainment channels for a variety of audiences;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a wide range of national, international and financial news; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


· | exclusive limited run channels.
--+--------------------------------

  SIRIUS XM’s diverse programming, including its lineup of exclusive content, is a significant differentiator from terrestrial radio and other audio entertainment providers. SIRIUS XM makes changes to its programming lineup from time to time as it strives to attract new subscribers and offer content which appeals to a broad range of audiences and to existing subscribers. The channel line-ups for its services are available at siriusxm.com.
 Streaming Service
 SIRIUS XM streams select music and non-music channels over the Internet. Its streaming service includes channels that are not available on its satellite radio service. Access to its streaming service is currently offered to subscribers for a fee. SIRIUS XM also offers applications to allow consumers to access its streaming service on smartphones, tablets, computers, home devices and other consumer electronic equipment.
 SiriusXM Internet Radio offers listeners enhanced programming discovery and the ability to connect with content currently playing across SIRIUS XM’s commercial-free music, sports, comedy, news, talk and entertainment channels or available through SiriusXM On Demand. SiriusXM On Demand offers its streaming subscribers the ability to choose their favorite episodes from a catalog of content whenever they want.
 In 2018, SIRIUS XM launched a new platform and redesigned its mobile app to deliver an enhanced streaming experience. That experience includes expanded programming, greater discovery, more intuitive recommendations, the introduction of video programming and other features designed to increase consumer engagement with SIRIUS XM’s streaming product.  SIRIUS XM’s internet-based video offering currently features Howard Stern, arranged and presented 

 
  I-6

 
in an easy-to-view manner, with highlights from Howard Stern’s interviews with celebrity guests, musical performances in the Howard Stern studio, show clips, and show specials.  SIRIUS XM expects to expand its video offering in 2019 with, among other items, live segments of Howard Stern's show and video generated by SIRIUS XM’s hosts and guests.
 360L
 In 2018, SIRIUS XM introduced a user interface, which SIRIUS XM calls “360L,” that combines SIRIUS XM’s satellite and streaming services into a single, cohesive in-vehicle entertainment experience. SIRIUS XM’s 360L interface has been deployed in Dodge Ram trucks and is in the process of being introduced by several other automakers. 360L allows SIRIUS XM to take advantage of advanced in-dash infotainment systems. 360L is intended to leverage the ubiquitous signal coverage of SIRIUS XM’s satellite infrastructure and low delivery costs with the two-way communication capability of a wireless streaming service to provide consumers seamless access to SIRIUS XM’s content, including SIRIUS XM’s live channels, on demand service and even more personalized music services. The wireless streaming connection included in 360L enables enhanced search and recommendations functions, making discovery of SIRIUS XM’s content in the vehicle easier. 360L also allows consumers to manage aspects of their subscriptions directly through their vehicles’ equipment and provides SIRIUS XM important data to better enable it to understand how subscribers use SIRIUS XM’s service and how it can more effectively market its service to consumers.
 Distribution of Radios
 Automakers. SIRIUS XM distributes satellite radios through the sale and lease of new vehicles. SIRIUS XM has agreements with every major automaker to offer satellite radios in their vehicles. Satellite radios are available as a factory or dealer-installed option in substantially all vehicle makes sold in the United States. Most automakers include a subscription to SIRIUS XM’s service in the sale or lease of their new vehicles. In certain cases, SIRIUS XM receives subscription payments from automakers in advance of the activation of its service. SIRIUS XM shares with certain automakers a portion of the revenue it derives from subscribers using vehicles equipped to receive SIRIUS XM’s service. SIRIUS XM also reimburses various automakers for certain costs associated with the satellite radios installed in new vehicles, including in certain cases hardware costs, engineering expenses and promotional and advertising expenses.
 Previously Owned Vehicles. SIRIUS XM also acquires subscribers through the sale and lease of previously owned vehicles with factory-installed satellite radios. SIRIUS XM has entered into agreements with many automakers to market subscriptions to purchasers and lessees of vehicles which include satellite radios sold through their certified pre-owned programs. SIRIUS XM also works directly with franchise and independent dealers on programs for non-certified used vehicles. SIRIUS XM has developed systems and methods to identify purchasers and lessees of previously owned vehicles which include satellite radios and has established marketing plans to promote its services to these potential subscribers.
 Retail. SIRIUS XM sells satellite radios directly to consumers through its website. Satellite radios are also marketed and distributed through national, regional and internet retailers, such as amazon.com.
 SIRIUS XM’s Satellite Radio Systems
 SIRIUS XM’s satellite radio systems are designed to provide clear reception in most areas of the continental United States despite variations in terrain, buildings and other obstructions. SIRIUS XM continually monitors its infrastructure and regularly evaluates improvements in technology.
 SIRIUS XM’s satellite radio systems have three principal components: satellites, terrestrial repeaters and other satellite facilities; studios; and radios.
 Satellites, Terrestrial Repeaters and Other Satellite Facilities
 Satellites. SIRIUS XM provides its service through a fleet of five orbiting geostationary satellites, two in the Sirius system, FM‑5 and FM‑6, and three in the XM system, XM‑3, XM‑4 and XM‑5. SIRIUS XM’s XM‑5 satellite serves as a spare for both the XM and Sirius systems.

 
  I-7

 

 SIRIUS XM has entered into agreements for the design, construction and launch of two new satellites, SXM‑7 and SXM‑8, which it plans to launch into geostationary orbits in 2019 and 2020, respectively, as replacements for XM‑3 and XM‑4.
 Satellite Insurance. SIRIUS XM has procured insurance for SXM‑7 and SXM‑8 to cover the risks associated with each satellite’s launch and first year in orbit. SIRIUS XM does not have insurance policies covering its in-orbit satellites, as SIRIUS XM considers the premium costs to be uneconomical relative to the risk of satellite failure.
 Terrestrial Repeaters. In some areas with high concentrations of tall buildings, such as urban centers, signals from SIRIUS XM’s satellites may be blocked and reception of satellite signals can be adversely affected. In other areas with a high density of next generation wireless systems, SIRIUS XM’s service may experience interference. In many of these areas, SIRIUS XM has deployed terrestrial repeaters to supplement and enhance its signal coverage and in many other areas, SIRIUS XM is planning to deploy additional repeaters to reduce interference. SIRIUS XM operates over 1,000 terrestrial repeaters across the United States as part of its systems.
 Other Satellite Facilities. SIRIUS XM controls and communicates with its satellites from facilities in North America. Its satellites are monitored, tracked and controlled by a third party satellite operator.
 Studios
 SIRIUS XM’s programming originates from studios in New York City and Washington, D.C., and, to a lesser extent, from smaller studios in Los Angeles, Nashville and a variety of venues across the country. SIRIUS XM’s corporate headquarters is based in New York City.  Radios
 SIRIUS XM does not manufacture radios. SIRIUS XM has authorized manufacturers and distributors to produce and distribute radios, and has licensed its technology to various electronics manufacturers to develop, manufacture and distribute radios under certain brands. SIRIUS XM manages various aspects of the production of satellite radios. To facilitate the sale of radios, SIRIUS XM may subsidize a portion of the radio manufacturing costs to reduce the hardware price to consumers. Connected Vehicle Services
 SIRIUS XM also provides connected vehicle services to several automakers and directly to consumers through aftermarket devices. SIRIUS XM’s connected vehicle services are designed to enhance the safety, security and driving experience for vehicle operators while providing marketing and operational benefits to automakers and their dealers. SIRIUS XM offers a portfolio of location-based services through two-way wireless connectivity, including safety, security, convenience, maintenance and data services, remote vehicle diagnostics and stolen or parked vehicle locator services. 
 In 2017, Sirius XM purchased Automatic Labs Inc. ("Automatic"), a connected vehicle device and mobile application company.  Automatic offers a subscription service for consumers and auto dealers.  By pairing Automatic's install-it-yourself adapter and mobile application, most vehicles model year 1996 or later can be transformed into connected vehicles. Using the Automatic service, drivers have access to important services, such as crash alerts, roadside assistance, vehicle location monitoring and sharing, vehicle health and performance monitoring, and recall notifications and service reminders.  Auto dealers can also employ the Automatic service to, among other things, assist in managing vehicle inventory, monitoring the status of vehicles and delivering notifications and reminders to purchasers and lessees of vehicles.  The Automatic adapter collects detailed information about each vehicle's geolocation, use, operation, performance and maintenance status in order to operate, maintain, and provide the features and functionality of the Automatic service.
 Subscribers to SIRIUS XM’s connected vehicle services are not included in its subscriber count or subscriber-based operating metrics.

 SIRIUS XM Canada
 SIRIUS XM holds a 70% equity interest and 33% voting interest in SIRIUS XM Canada Holdings Inc. (“SIRIUS XM Canada”), with the remainder of the SIRIUS XM Canada voting and equity interests held by two shareholders.
 SIRIUS XM also entered into a Services Agreement and an Advisory Services Agreement with SIRIUS XM Canada. Each agreement has a thirty year term. Pursuant to the Services Agreement, SIRIUS XM Canada will pay SIRIUS XM 25% of its gross revenue on a monthly basis through December 31, 2021 and 30% of its gross revenue on a monthly basis thereafter. Pursuant to the Advisory Services Agreement, SIRIUS XM Canada pays SIRIUS XM 5% of its gross revenue on a monthly basis. 
 As of December 31, 2018, Sirius XM Canada had approximately 2.6 million subscribers. Sirius XM Canada’s subscribers are not included in SIRIUS XM’s subscriber count or subscriber-based operating metrics.
 Pandora 
 Pandora is a music discovery platform, offering a personalized experience for each of its listeners. Pandora is available as an ad-supported radio service, a radio subscription service called Pandora Plus and an on-demand subscription service called Pandora Premium. 
 On February 1, 2019, SIRIUS XM acquired Pandora in an all-stock transaction valued at $2.9 billion. In connection with the acquisition, each outstanding share of Pandora common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, was converted into the right to receive 1.44 shares of SIRIUS XM common stock, par value $0.001 per share. Pandora’s Series A convertible preferred stock (the “Series A Preferred Stock”) was cancelled upon completion of the acquisition. See note 7 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information related to SIRIUS XM’s acquisition of Pandora.
 On September 22, 2017, a subsidiary of SIRIUS XM completed a $480 million investment in Pandora’s Series A Preferred Stock. The Series A Preferred Stock, including accrued but unpaid dividends, represented an approximate 19% interest in Pandora’s outstanding common stock and an approximate 16% interest on an as-converted basis.

 
  I-9

 

 The Series A Preferred Stock was convertible at the option of the holders at any time into shares of common stock of Pandora (“Pandora Common Stock”) at an initial conversion price of $10.50 per share of Pandora Common Stock and an initial conversion rate of 95.2381 shares of Pandora Common Stock per share of Series A Preferred Stock, subject to certain customary anti-dilution adjustments. Holders of the Series A Preferred Stock were entitled to a cumulative dividend at the rate of 6.0% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears, if and when declared. Any conversion of Series A Preferred Stock could be settled by Pandora, at its option, in shares of Pandora Common Stock, cash or any combination thereof. However, unless and until Pandora’s stockholders had approved the issuance of greater than 19.99% of the outstanding Pandora Common Stock, the Series A Preferred Stock could not be converted into more than 19.99% of Pandora’s outstanding Pandora Common Stock as of June 9, 2017.
 The investment included a mandatory redemption feature on any date from and after September 22, 2022 and therefore the financial instrument was treated as a debt security. As the investment included a conversion option, SIRIUS XM elected to account for this investment under the fair value option. Any gains (losses) associated with the change in fair value were recognized in realized and unrealized gains (losses) on financial instruments, net in the consolidated statements of operations.
 Pursuant to an investment agreement with Pandora, SIRIUS XM appointed three of its senior executives or members of its Board of Directors to Pandora’s Board of Directors, one of whom served as the Chairman of Pandora’s Board of Directors. 
 Copyrights to Programming
 In connection with its music programming, SIRIUS XM must negotiate and enter into royalty arrangements with two sets of rights holders: holders of copyrights in musical works (that is, the music and lyrics) and holders of copyrights in sound recordings (that is, the actual recording of a work).
 Musical works rights holders, generally songwriters and music publishers, have been traditionally represented by performing rights organizations, such as the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (“ASCAP”), Broadcast Music, Inc. (“BMI”), and SESAC, Inc. (“SESAC”). The market for rights relating to musical works is changing rapidly. Songwriters and music publishers have withdrawn from the traditional performing rights organizations, particularly ASCAP and BMI, and new entities, such as Global Music Rights LLC (“GMR”) have been formed to represent rights holders. These organizations negotiate fees with copyright users, collect royalties and distribute them to the rights holders. SIRIUS XM has arrangements with ASCAP, SESAC and GMR, and is in negotiations with BMI for a new agreement. If SIRIUS XM is unable to reach an agreement with BMI, a court will determine the royalty SIRIUS XM will be required to pay BMI. The changing market for musical works may have an adverse effect on SIRIUS XM, including increasing its costs or limiting the musical works available to SIRIUS XM. 
 Sound recording rights holders, typically large record companies, are primarily represented by SoundExchange, Inc. (“SoundExchange”), an organization which negotiates licenses, and collects and distributes royalties on behalf of record companies and performing artists. SIRIUS XM may negotiate royalty arrangements with the owners of sound recordings, or, if negotiation is unsuccessful, the royalty rate is established by the Copyright Royalty Board (the “CRB”) of the Library of Congress.
 In December 2017, the CRB issued its determination regarding the royalty rate payable by SIRIUS XM under the statutory license covering the performance of sound recordings fixed after February 15, 1972 over its satellite radio service, and the making of ephemeral (server) copies in support of such performances, for the five-year period starting on January 1, 2018 and ending on December 31, 2022. Under the terms of the CRB’s decision, SIRIUS XM is required to pay a royalty of 15.5% of gross revenue, subject to exclusions and adjustments.
 The rates and terms contained in the CRB’s December 2017 determination permit SIRIUS XM to reduce the payment due each month by the percentage of SIRIUS XM’s transmissions of recordings that are directly licensed from copyright owners and the percentage of transmissions that comprise recordings fixed before February 15, 1972 that SIRIUS XM has licensed. The revenue subject to royalty includes subscription revenue from SIRIUS XM’s U.S. satellite digital audio radio subscribers and advertising revenue from channels other than those channels that make only incidental

performances of sound recordings. Exclusions from revenue subject to the statutory license fee include, among other things:

· | monies or other consideration attributable to the sale and/or license of equipment and/or other technology, including but not limited to bandwidth, sales of devices that receive SIRIUS XM’s satellite radio services and any shipping and handling fees therefor;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | royalties paid to SIRIUS XM for intellectual property rights;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


· | sales and use taxes;
--+---------------------


· | credit card, invoice, activation, swap and early termination fees charged to subscribers and reasonably related to the expenses to which they pertain;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | bad debt expense; and
--+----------------------


· | revenue attributable to SIRIUS XM’s current and future data services offered for a separate charge (such as weather, traffic, destination information, messaging, sports scores, stock ticker information, extended program associated data, video and photographic images, and such other telematics and/or data services as may exist from time to time); channels, programming, products and/or other services offered for a separate charge where such channels use only incidental performances of sound recordings; channels, programming, products and/or other services provided outside of the United States; and channels, programming, products and/or other services for which the performance of the recordings is exempt from any license requirement or is separately licensed, including by a statutory license.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  In 2018, the Copyright Act was amended by The Orrin G. Hatch-Bob Goodlatte Music Modernization Act (the “Music Modernization Act”).  Under the Music Modernization Act, the use of sound recordings fixed before February 15, 1972 is now subject to a royalty at the existing rate set by the CRB; the existing sound recording royalty rate was extended for five years, through December 31, 2027; and the law foreclosed SIRIUS XM’s ability to appeal the December 2017 determination of the CRB. Sound recordings that were fixed before February 15, 1972 were previously governed by state law.  During 2015 and 2016, SIRIUS XM settled suits with copyright owners for almost all of the pre-1972 sound recordings it uses and entered into direct licenses for their use.  
 The licensing of sound recordings for use on the Internet is also subject to the United States Copyright Act on terms established by the CRB. In 2018, SIRIUS XM paid a per performance rate for the streaming of certain sound recordings on the Internet of $0.0023. In accordance with the CRB’s decision, this royalty rate may increase through 2020 based on changes in the consumer price index.
 Trademarks
 SIRIUS XM registered, and intends to maintain, the trademarks “Sirius”, “XM”, “SiriusXM” and “SXM” with the United States Patent and Trademark Office in connection with the services it offers. SIRIUS XM is not aware of any material claims of infringement or other challenges to its right to use the “Sirius”, “XM”, “SiriusXM” or “SXM” trademarks in the United States. SIRIUS XM also has registered, and intends to maintain, trademarks for the names of certain of its channels. SIRIUS XM has also registered the trademarks “Sirius”, “XM” and “SiriusXM” in Canada. SIRIUS XM has granted a license to use certain of its trademarks in Canada to SIRIUS XM Canada. Formula 1
 Formula 1 holds the exclusive commercial rights with respect to the FIA Formula One World Championship (the “World Championship”), an annual, approximately nine-month long, motor race-based competition in which teams (the “Teams”) compete for the Constructors’ Championship and drivers compete for the Drivers’ Championship. The World Championship, which has been held every year since 1950 and takes place on high profile iconic circuits, is a global series with a varying number of events (“Events”) taking place in different countries around the world each season. For 2018, 21 Events took place in 21 countries across Europe, Asia-Pacific, the Middle East and North and South America. In 2018, the World Championship was followed by hundreds of millions of television viewers in over 200 territories, and Formula 1’s 

 
  I-11

 
largest Events have hosted live audiences in excess of 300,000 on race weekends. Formula 1 is responsible for the commercial exploitation and development of the World Championship, in the course of which it coordinates and transacts with the Fédération Internationale de l’Automobile (“FIA”), the governing body for world motor sport, the Teams, the race promoters that stage Events, various media organizations worldwide as well as advertisers and sponsors. Formula 1 also performs activities related to critical components of the World Championship, including filming Events, production of the international television feed and transport of its and the Teams’ equipment, ensuring high quality and reducing delivery risk around the World Championship. Additionally, Formula 1, pursuant to other agreements with the FIA, holds the exclusive right to promote and commercially exploit F2 and F3 through 2041.
 Formula 1 also generates revenue from a variety of other sources, including the operation of the Formula 1 Paddock Club hospitality program (the “Paddock Club”) at 18 Events, freight, logistical and travel related services for the Teams and other third parties, the F2 and F3 race series, which run principally as support races during Event weekends, various television production and post-production activities, digital and social media activities and revenue from other licensing of the commercial rights associated with the Formula 1 brand. 
 A significant majority of the race promotion, broadcasting and advertising and sponsorship contracts specify payments in advance and annual increases in the fees payable over the course of the contracts. Formula 1 recognizes the majority of its revenue and expenses in connection with Events that take place in different countries around the world throughout the year. The Events generally take place between March and November each year. As a result, the revenue and expenses recognized by Formula 1 are generally lower during the first quarter as compared to the rest of the quarters throughout the year.
 Primary Revenue
 Formula 1 derives its primary revenue from the commercial exploitation and development of the World Championship through a combination of entering into race promotion, broadcasting and advertising and sponsorship arrangements.
 Race Promotion. Race promotion revenue comprised 33.8%, 34.1% and 36.4% of Formula 1’s total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Formula 1 grants to race promoters the rights to host, stage and promote each Event pursuant to contracts that typically have an initial term of three to seven years. For established Events, the duration of subsequent renewals is more variable according to local market conditions. These contracts may allow for flat fees over the term, but more typically they include annual fee escalators over the life of the contract, which are typically based on annual movement in a selected consumer price index or fixed percentages of up to 5% per year.
 Race promoters are generally circuit owners, local and national automobile clubs, special event organizers or governmental bodies. Race promoters generate revenue from ticket sales and sometimes from concessions, secondary hospitality offerings (other than the Paddock Club), local sponsorship opportunities and on-site activations. Tickets are sold by the promoters for the entire Event weekend or individual days.
 Broadcasting.  Broadcasting revenue comprised 33.1%, 33.7% and 32.7% of Formula 1’s total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Formula 1 licenses rights to broadcast Events on television and other media platforms in specified countries or regions and in specified languages. These may also include rights to broadcast the race, practice and qualifying sessions, interactive television/digital services, repeat broadcasts and highlights. These contracts, which we refer to as television rights agreements (“TRAs”), typically have a term of three to five years. While annual fees from broadcasters may stay constant, they often increase each year during the term of the TRA by varying amounts. Formula 1’s broadcasting revenue is generated from: (a) free-to-air television broadcasts, which are received by the end user without charge (other than any television license fee), and non-premium cable, satellite and other broadcasts, which are received as part of a subscriber’s basic package (together, “free-to-air television”); and (b) premium and pay-per-view cable and satellite broadcasts, where the subscriber pays a premium fee to receive programming on a package or per-event basis (“pay television”). In 2018, Formula 1 had 16 free-to-air television agreements, eight pay television agreements and 24 agreements, including multi-territory agreements, covering both free-to-air and pay television. Formula 1’s key broadcasters include Sky (pay television) in the United Kingdom, RTL (free-to-air television) 

 
  I-12

 
in Germany, Sky Italia (pay television) in Italy, Movistar (pay television) in Spain, Fox Sports (pay television) in Pan Latin America, Canal+ (pay television) in France, Globo (free-to-air television) in Brazil, ESPN (pay television) in the United States, Fox Sports (pay television) in Pan Asia and beIn Sports (pay television) in the Middle East.
 Advertising and Sponsorship. Advertising and sponsorship revenue comprised 14.6%, 15.3% and 14.6% of Formula 1’s total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Formula 1 sells Event-based advertising and sponsorship in the form of trackside advertising and race title sponsorship packages. In addition, advertisers can acquire status as a Global Partner of Formula 1 and/or Official Supplier to Formula 1. These advertiser and sponsor contracts typically have a term of three to five years (but may on occasion be of longer duration). Payments often increase each year based on a fixed amount, a fixed percentage or in accordance with the United States or European consumer price index or another agreed metric. 
 Other Revenue
 The remainder of Formula 1’s revenue is generated from a variety of other sources including the operation of the Paddock Club race-based corporate hospitality program at most Events, freight and related logistical and travel services, support races at Events (either from the commercial exploitation of the F2 and F3 (formerly GP3) series or from the licensing of other third party series or individual race events), various television production and post-production activities, and other Formula 1 ancillary operations. Additionally, in 2018, Formula 1 launched F1TV Pro, a direct-to-consumer over-the-top broadcast product. Certain existing TRAs prevent F1TV Pro from being offered in the relevant territory, and the further global roll-out of the product will depend on the future renewal terms and/or negotiations of these TRAs.
 FIA and the Teams
 Formula 1’s business is built on a number of key relationships—those with the FIA, the Teams and Formula 1’s principal commercial partners. See “—Key Commercial Agreements” below for more information about Formula 1’s relationships with the FIA and the Teams.
 FIA
 The FIA is the governing body for world motor sport and as such, is solely responsible for regulating the sporting, technical and safety aspects of the World Championship, including race circuits to be used by race promotors, through the FIA’s F1 Commission and World Motor Sport Council. The FIA regulates all international motor sports, with the World Championship being the most prominent. The FIA owns the World Championship and has granted Formula 1 the exclusive commercial rights to the World Championship until the end of 2110 under the 100-Year Agreements. In addition, the FIA, through its World Motor Sport Council, approves the calendar for the World Championship each year based on the agreed race promotor contracts for the coming season. Under the 100-Year Agreements, Formula 1 is only permitted to enter into race promotion contracts that are substantially in the form agreed between Formula 1 and the FIA. Teams
 The Teams are the participants in the World Championship and its Events, competing for the annual Constructors’ Championship, and their drivers compete for the annual Drivers’ Championship. There were 10 Teams competing in the 2018 World Championship. To be eligible to compete, a Team is responsible for the design and manufacturing of certain key parts of its cars, including the chassis. Currently, the Teams are supplied race engines by one of Ferrari, Mercedes, Renault or Honda. Under the terms of the Current Concorde Arrangements (described below), Teams are entitled to receive significant team payments from a Formula 1 prize fund (the “Prize Fund”) based primarily on their results in prior years’ Constructors’ Championships. Formula 1 has no direct or indirect ownership interest in any Team, nor does it have any contractual arrangements with the drivers, who are all employed or contracted directly by the Teams. Each Team is responsible for securing its own drivers and funding the cost to race in the World Championship. They receive Team payments from Formula 1 (principally a share in the Prize Fund) as well as sponsorship and advertising revenue from their own partners. The Current Concorde Arrangements between Formula 1, the FIA and the Teams defines the terms of the Team’s participation in the World Championship (for further detail on these arrangements, see “—Key Commercial Agreements—Current Concorde Arrangements” below.)

 
  I-13

 

 Drivers
 One of the distinctive features of the World Championship is the celebrity and diversity of its drivers. Differences in nationalities, temperaments and racing styles form part of the attractive mosaic of Formula 1. The success of a local driver also impacts the television viewership and revenue generated from that country or region. High profile drivers from Germany (Vettel), the United Kingdom (Hamilton) and the Netherlands (Verstappen) have helped grow and sustain the Formula 1 business in those countries. For this reason, Formula 1 encourages the development of drivers from other strategic markets. F2 and F3 provide the training ground and stepping stones to Formula 1 for these drivers. All drivers are employed or contracted by the Teams and have no contractual relationship with Formula 1. Key Commercial Agreements
 100-Year Agreements
 Under the 100-Year Agreements entered into by Formula 1 and the FIA in 2001, Formula 1 was granted an exclusive license with respect to all of the commercial rights to the World Championship, including its trademarks. This license, which took effect on January 1, 2011 and expires on December 31, 2110, maintains Formula 1’s exclusive commercial rights to the World Championship which Formula 1 held under previous agreements with the FIA.
 The 100-Year Agreements also provide that Formula 1 may appoint a representative to the FIA, subject to the FIA’s approval, and that person will be a member of the FIA’s F1 Commission and World Motor Sport Council. The FIA may terminate the 100-Year Agreements and Formula 1’s exclusive license upon a change of control of Formula 1, unless either the FIA previously approved the transaction or the transaction falls within one of a number of exceptions. Formula 1 obtained the FIA’s approval of its acquisition by Liberty in January 2017 under the 100-Year Agreements.
 In addition, the FIA may terminate Formula 1’s license if (i) certain Delta Topco subsidiaries party to the 100-Year Agreements become insolvent; (ii) Formula 1 fails to pay an amount due to the FIA and such non-payment is not cured within 30 days of FIA’s demand for payment; (iii) arbitrators declare that Formula 1 materially breached the 100-Year Agreements and Formula 1 has not paid to the FIA certain penalties to cure such breach; or (iv) Formula 1 changes or removes certain of the FIA’s rights without its prior consent.
 Current Concorde Arrangements
 From 1981 until 2012, successive Concorde Agreements governed the relationship between Formula 1, the FIA and the Teams, including the regulation of the World Championship. After the previous Concorde Agreement expired on December 31, 2012, Formula 1 entered into a separate binding agreement with each Team (the “Team Agreements”), securing the relevant Team’s commitment to continue participating in the World Championship until December 31, 2020. In addition, Formula 1 entered into the 2013 Concorde Implementation Agreement with the FIA in 2013. The 2013 Concorde Implementation Agreement, in addition to making certain modifications to the 100-Year Agreements for the period to end 2030, provides that the FIA agrees to provide certain sporting governance arrangements and regulatory safeguards for the benefit of the Teams, to enter into a new Concorde Agreement for a term of eight years (from 2013 to 2020) reflecting those sporting governance arrangements and regulatory safeguards and to enter into a subsequent Concorde Agreement from 2021 to 2030 or to extend the sporting governance arrangements or regulatory safeguards agreed under the 2013 Concorde Implementation Agreement on substantially the same terms from 2021 to 2030. The Team Agreements and the 2013 Concorde Implementation Agreement (collectively, the “Current Concorde Arrangements”) together provide the contractual framework for the World Championship that was previously set out in the Concorde Agreements.
 Under the Current Concorde Arrangements, among other things, the Teams agree to participate in the World Championship during the term of the Current Concorde Arrangements and Formula 1 agrees to make certain Prize Fund payments to them based on their performance in the Constructors’ Championship and other principles (such as success, heritage and longevity in Formula 1) and measures of performance selected by Formula 1.

 
  I-14

 

 Team Agreements
 As discussed above, Formula 1 and each of the Teams have entered into separate Team Agreements that establish a Prize Fund, establish procedures for setting the World Championship calendar, give the Teams the right to nominate and, in some cases, appoint directors to Delta Topco’s board, and provide for certain termination rights. The Team Agreements establish the Prize Fund to be paid to the Teams that is funded with a certain percentage of Formula 1’s Prize Fund Adjusted EBITDA (defined by Formula 1 as operating profit adjusted to exclude certain specific, and largely non-cash items) plus additional amounts that Formula 1 expects to range from $120 million to $175 million. The majority of the Prize Fund is paid to individual Teams based on their results in prior Constructors’ Championships, and the balance paid to Teams that have achieved certain milestones based on Formula 1’s principles and measures of performance. Under the Team Agreements, the consent of a majority of certain Teams is required if there are more than 20 Events in a season or more than 17 Events are held in a season and the number of Events that are held outside Europe, the US or Canada exceeds 60% or more of the total number of Events in that season.
 The Team Agreements with McLaren and Mercedes grant the corporate parent of each of those Teams (McLaren Technology Group Limited and Daimler AG, respectively) the right to appoint a team director (a “Team Director”) until December 31, 2020 or the termination of the relevant Team Agreement, if earlier. Ferrari has an equivalent right, pursuant to a provision contained in all Team Agreements granting that right to the longest standing Team that has competed in the World Championship for the greatest number of seasons since 1950. Each of McLaren Technology Group Limited, Daimler AG and Ferrari has exercised the relevant right and appointed a Team Director. Ferrari’s Team Director is also entitled to be a member of Delta Topco’s Audit and Ethics and Nomination Committees. In addition, the Teams have certain consultation rights with respect to the appointment of two independent non-executive directors to Delta Topco’s board of directors, although Delta Topco does not require the consent of the Teams with respect to any such appointment.
 A Team Agreement may be terminated if the Team ceases to be a constructor, fails to participate in more than three Events in a season, fails to submit a valid entry for participation in the World Championship or becomes insolvent. Teams may also terminate their Team Agreements by written notice to Formula 1 under certain circumstances, including:

· | Formula 1 is unable to pay its debts when they become due;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


· | Formula 1 fails for three months to pay an aggregate amount due in excess of $10 million to the Team; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a controlling interest holder of Formula 1 is subject to sanctions imposed by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control or is on the Financial Sanctions List in the United Kingdom.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Circuit Rights Agreements
 Under circuit rights agreements (the “Circuit Rights Agreements”), Formula 1 acquires from race promoters certain rights to commercially exploit the Events, including the rights to sell trackside advertising and title sponsorship, a space in which to operate the Paddock Club (other than at three Events) and commercial use of the name of the Event and circuit. In a few cases a cash payment is made for the grant of these circuit rights and in others Formula 1 offers a commission or share of revenue to a race promoter where they have been instrumental in introducing a new sponsor from its territory that purchases a title sponsorship or trackside advertising. Circuit Rights Agreements typically have a term that is tied to the relevant race promoter contract. Intellectual Property
 Formula 1 is the registered owner of a portfolio of trade mark registrations and applications, including for the F1 logo, the World Championship logo (which is used only in sporting contexts), “Formula One”, “Formula 1”, “F1” and “Grand Prix” when used in connection with any of the aforementioned and most of the official Event titles where they are capable of registration.
 Formula 1 owns the copyright on footage of each Event since 1981 as well as footage related to a large number of pre-1981 Events. Ownership of this copyright enables Formula 1 to license that footage to broadcasters and to take legal action against infringers of that copyright. Under the Current Concorde Arrangements, Formula 1 also has the exclusive 

 
  I-15

 
right, subject to limited exceptions, to use each Team’s intellectual property rights (including image rights) to portray the World Championship and/or any Event in any visual form.
 Licenses and Permits
 Formula 1 is required to obtain permits for the allocation and use of radio frequencies which are necessary for the operation of live camera and other equipment used in the production of live television images and also in live radio communications used by Formula 1, the FIA, the Teams (including car to pit radio transmissions) and the emergency services. Such radio frequency permits are obtained by a dedicated unit in the television production team, with assistance from the local race promoter. Typically, such radio frequency permits are obtained from the relevant governmental authority responsible for licensing the use of radio frequencies in the host country of the relevant Event. The requirements and procedures for obtaining such permits vary by country and they may involve the completion of written formalities or the inspection by the relevant governmental authority of all equipment to be operated with a radio frequency. Permits are typically issued subject to conditions, which Formula 1 has generally been able to satisfy. Strategy
 Formula 1’s goal is to further broaden and increase the global scale and appeal of the World Championship in order to improve the overall value of Formula 1 as a sport and its financial performance. Key factors of this strategy include:
· | continuing to seek and identify opportunities to expand and develop the Event calendar and bring Events to attractive and/or strategically important new markets outside of Europe, which typically have higher race promotion fees, while continuing to build on the foundation of the sport in Europe;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | developing advertising and sponsorship revenue, including increasing sales of Event-based packages and under the Global Partner program, and exploring opportunities in underexploited product categories;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | capturing opportunities created by media’s evolution, including the growth of social media and the development of Formula 1’s digital media assets;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | building up the entertainment experience for fans and engaging with new fans on a global basis to further drive race attendance and television viewership; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | working with stakeholders within the sport to improve the sustainability and on-track competitive balance of the World Championship and the long term financial stability of the participating Teams.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Braves Holdings, LLC
 Braves Holdings (collectively with its subsidiaries) is the indirect owner and operator of the Major League Baseball (“MLB”) club, the Atlanta Braves, and certain assets and liabilities associated with the Braves’ stadium and Braves Holdings’ Development Project, The Battery Atlanta and as described in “Mixed-use development” below. We acquired the Braves from Time Warner, Inc. in 2007. Business Operations
 Braves Holdings derives revenue from both local and national sources. Team revenue includes revenue from ticket sales, broadcasting rights, shared revenue collected and distributed by MLB, merchandise sales, minor league teams, revenue sharing arrangements and other sources. Revenue related to the Braves’ facilities includes corporate sales and naming rights, concessions, advertising, suites and premium seat fees, parking and publications. Ticket sales and broadcasting rights are the team’s primary revenue drivers. Revenue is seasonal, with the majority of revenue recognized during the second and third quarters, which aligns with the baseball season. The Battery Atlanta derives revenue primarily from rental income (including overage rent and tenant reimbursements), parking and sponsorships throughout the year. 
 Television and Radio Broadcasting. Braves Holdings derives substantial revenue from the sale of broadcasting rights to the Braves’ baseball games. Each MLB club has the right to authorize the television broadcast within its home 

 
  I-16

 
television territory of games in which it participates, subject to certain exceptions. The Braves have a long-term local broadcasting agreement with Sportsouth Network II, LLC, the owner and operator of the SportSouth video programming service (“Fox SportSouth”). Nationally, the Braves participate in the revenue generated from the national broadcasting and radio arrangements negotiated by MLB on behalf of the 30 MLB clubs with ESPN, TBS, Fox and SIRIUS XM (the “National Broadcast Rights”). Under the rules and regulations adopted by MLB, as well as a series of other agreements and arrangements that govern the operation and management of an MLB club (collectively, the “MLB Rules and Regulations”), the Office of the Commissioner of Baseball (the “BOC”) has the authority, acting as the agent on behalf of all of the MLB clubs, to enter into and administer all contracts for the sale of National Broadcast Rights. Each MLB club also has the right to authorize radio broadcast, within the United States (or Canada, in the case of the Toronto Blue Jays), of its games, subject to certain restrictions. The Braves also have the second largest radio affiliate network in MLB, with approximately 140 local radio station affiliates broadcasting Braves games across the Southeast (the “Braves Radio Network”).
 Ticket Sales. The Braves offer single game tickets, as well as various season ticket packages. The per-ticket average price of 2018 full-season ticket plans ranged from $5 to $358, depending upon the seating area. In 2012, the Braves instituted a variable pricing strategy to help eliminate the perceived difference in value for certain games, which was often exploited in the secondary market. The club created six pricing tiers per seat, based upon various factors including the day of the week, date and opposing team. The Braves have also begun to encourage fans to use digital ticketing, which allows the club to track important data, put parameters on resales, and provide paperless benefits to its consumers.
 Advertising and Corporate Sponsorship. The Braves work with a variety of corporate sponsors to facilitate advertising and promotional opportunities at SunTrust Park. Advertising space is available on the main scoreboard, elsewhere throughout the ballpark and in programs sold at each game. The Braves also enter into long-term licensing agreements for advertising rights with respect to various suites and hospitality spaces. The Braves’ marketing department works closely with the club’s sponsors to offer contests, sweepstakes and additional entertainment and promotional opportunities during Braves home games, and the club allows the Braves name and logo to be used in connection with certain local promotional activities. The Braves also coordinate advertising placement through the Braves Radio Network, and has a cross-promotional sponsorship and marketing agreement with Fox SportSouth.
 Player Contracts and Salaries. The Collective Bargaining Agreement (the “CBA”) requires MLB clubs to sign players using the Uniform Player’s Contract. The minimum Major League contract salary for players during the 2018 season under the CBA was $545,000. If a player is injured or terminated by the team for lack of skill during the regular season, he is entitled to all of his salary under the contract for the remainder of the year. Contracts may cover one year or multiple years, but generally under multi-year contracts a player’s salary is guaranteed even if the contract is terminated by the team, or if the player dies or becomes ill, during the term of the contract. The Braves are not required to pay the remaining contract salaries of players who resign or refuse to play.
 Team
 Player Personnel. Under MLB Rules and Regulations, each team is permitted to have 40 players under contract, but is allowed to maintain only 25 players on its active roster (subject to limited exceptions) from the Opening Day of the season through August 31 of each year. During the remainder of the season, teams may keep an active roster consisting of 40 players under contract. The Braves’ roster reflects the team’s commitment to developing and securing talented young players, driving future on-field success.

 Player Development. The Braves are associated with six minor league teams located in the United States, five of which are owned by Braves Holdings. The club’s minor league affiliates are detailed below:

Team | Class | League | Location 
Gwinnett Stripers | AAA | International League | Lawrenceville, GA 
Mississippi Braves | AA | Southern League | Pearl, MS 
Florida Firefrogs* | A Adv. | Florida State League | Kissimmee, FL 
Rome Braves | A | South Atlantic League | Rome, GA 
Danville Braves | R | Appalachian League | Danville, VA 
GCL Braves | R | Gulf Coast League | Lake Buena Vista, FL


 * Not owned by Braves Holdings
 The Braves also operate a baseball academy in the Dominican Republic under the Dominican Summer League. Dominican players, and players from other Latin American countries, are an important source of talent for the Braves and other MLB clubs, but these players may not participate in the first-year draft process (which is limited to only residents of the United States, United States territories, and Canada, including international players who are enrolled in a high school or college in such locations). However, the Braves may enter into contracts with Latin American players, subject to certain MLB Rules and Regulations.
 Facilities
 SunTrust Park. Effective for the 2017 season, the Braves relocated to a new ballpark in Cobb County, Georgia. Braves Holdings (or its affiliates) has exclusive operating rights to the facility via a 30-year Stadium Operating Agreement with Cobb County and the Cobb-Marietta Coliseum and Exhibit Hall Authority (the “Authority”). In 2014, Braves Holdings, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, purchased 82 acres of land for the purpose of constructing a MLB facility and development of a mixed-use complex adjacent to the ballpark. The total cost of the ballpark was approximately $722 million, of which approximately $392 million was funded by a combination of Cobb County, the Cumberland Improvement District and the Authority and approximately $330 million was funded by Braves Holdings. Funding for ballpark initiatives by Braves Holdings has come from cash on hand and various debt instruments, as detailed in note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 
 We believe SunTrust Park is an industry-leading sports complex spanning approximately 1,100,000 square feet, with 41,200 seats, including 30 suites and 4,200 premium seats, multiple hospitality clubs and retail merchandise venues. The stadium also features concessions and restaurant spaces, administrative offices for team operations, sales and marketing, as well as a ticket office, team clubhouse and training rooms.
 Champion Stadium. Champion Stadium in Lake Buena Vista, Florida is the Braves’ spring training facility, and the playing facility of the Braves’ Rookie League affiliate GCL Braves. The stadium is part of the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex at Walt Disney World Resort, and features four luxury sky boxes and more than 9,500 seats. The Braves signed a 20-year lease agreement for the complex in 1997, which will expire after the last day of spring training in 2019. The club receives limited use of the stadium, four practice fields, a half-sized infield, clubhouse, temporary clubhouse space for minor league players and office space for both year-round and spring training operations. 
 CoolToday Park. Effective in March 2019, the Braves will relocate to a new spring training facility in North Port, Florida. Braves Holdings has exclusive operating rights to the facility via a 30-year Facility Operating Agreement with Sarasota County. The club will operate and maintain an 8,200 capacity stadium and clubhouse facilities for major and minor league players and staff, six practice fields, a half-sized field, agility field and batting cages. The park will also feature an academy for housing players, coaches and staff throughout the year. The academy is expected to open in February 2020 and include dining, meeting and auditorium spaces.

 Mixed-Use Development
 Braves Holdings, through affiliated entities and third party development partners, has developed a significant portion of the land around SunTrust Park for a mixed-use complex that features retail, residential, office, hotel and entertainment opportunities, known as The Battery Atlanta. Phase I of the project is complete and operational. Phase II is underway and will include developing a second parcel of land for additional mixed-use purposes. The estimated cost for Phase II is approximately $200 million, which Braves Holdings affiliated entities are expected to fund through a mix of approximately $55 million in equity and approximately $145 million of new debt. In October 2018, Braves Holdings sold the residential portion of the mixed-use complex, the proceeds from which are funding a portion of Phase II. See note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for debt information related to the mixed-use development. 
 MLB Rules and Regulations
 As the owner of a MLB franchise, Braves Holdings must comply with rules promulgated by the Commissioner of Baseball (the “Commissioner”) and MLB’s constitution and bylaws. Each franchise is required to share locally derived revenue with the other MLB franchises through MLB’s revenue sharing plan. Under MLB Rules and Regulations, each MLB franchise participates in the MLB Central Fund, which acts as a conduit of centrally derived revenue (primarily from National Broadcast Rights, national sponsorships and licensing deals, and the MLB All-Star Game) to the clubs, and funds certain expenses (such as contributions to the MLB Players Benefit Plan, administrative and operational expenses of the BOC, a reserve fund for the BOC, umpires expense and administrative expenses of the MLB Central Fund) on behalf of the MLB franchises. Each MLB franchise’s share of the MLB Central Fund is paid to each MLB franchise by the end of each year, unless otherwise determined by the Commissioner. Also under the MLB Rules and Regulations, each MLB franchise is required to participate in and contribute to certain profit sharing initiatives, such as MLB Advanced Media L.P., MLB’s interactive media and Internet company which runs MLB’s official website and all of the MLB teams’ websites.
 Live Nation 
 Live Nation is considered the world’s leading live entertainment company and seeks to innovate and enhance the live entertainment experience for artists and fans before, during and after the show. Live Nation has three business segments: Concerts, Sponsorship & Advertising and Ticketing. Live Nation’s Business Segments
 Concerts. Live Nation’s Concerts segment principally involves the global promotion of live music events in its owned or operated venues and in rented third-party venues, the operation and management of music venues, the production of music festivals across the world, the creation of associated content and the provision of management and other services to artists. Including its intersegment revenue, Live Nation’s Concerts business generated approximately $8.8 billion, or approximately 81%, of Live Nation’s total revenue during 2018. Live Nation promoted almost 35,000 live music and other events in 2018, including artists such as Beyoncé and Jay-Z, P!nk, Kevin Hart, Justin Timberlake, Imagine Dragons and Bruno Mars and through festivals such as Austin City Limits, Lollapolooza, Electric Daisy Carnival, Rock Werchter, Reading and Download. While its Concerts segment operates year-round, Live Nation generally experiences higher revenue during the second and third quarters due to the seasonal nature of shows at its outdoor amphitheaters and festivals, which primarily occur from May through October. Revenue is generally impacted by the number of events, volume of ticket sales and ticket prices. Event costs such as artist fees and production service expenses are included in direct operating expenses and are typically substantial in relation to the revenue.
     Sponsorship & Advertising. Live Nation’s Sponsorship & Advertising segment employs a sales force that creates and maintains relationships with sponsors, through a combination of strategic, international, national and local opportunities that allow businesses to reach customers through its concert, festival, venue, artist relationship and ticketing assets, including advertising on Live Nation websites. Live Nation works with its corporate clients to help create marketing programs that support their business goals and connect their brands directly with fans and artists. Live Nation also develops, books and produces custom events or programs for its clients’ specific brands, which are typically presented exclusively to the clients’ consumers. These custom events can involve live music events with talent and media, using both online and 

 
  I-19

 
traditional outlets. Including its intersegment revenue, Live Nation’s Sponsorship & Advertising business generated $504 million, or approximately 5%, of Live Nation’s total revenue during 2018. Live Nation typically experiences higher revenue in the second and third quarters as a large portion of sponsorships are typically associated with its outdoor venues and festivals which are primarily used or occur from May through October.
 Ticketing. Live Nation’s Ticketing segment is primarily an agency business that sells tickets for events on behalf of its clients and retains a fee, or service charge for these services. Live Nation sells tickets for its events and also for third-party clients across multiple live event categories, providing ticketing services for leading arenas, stadiums, amphitheaters, music clubs, concert promoters, professional sports franchises and leagues, college sports teams, performing arts venues, museums and theaters. Live Nation sells tickets through websites, mobile apps, ticket outlets and telephone call centers. During the year ended December 31, 2018, Live Nation sold 52%, 43%, 4% and 1% of primary tickets through these channels, respectively. Live Nation’s Ticketing segment also manages its online activities including enhancements to its websites and product offerings. Including its intersegment revenue, Live Nation’s Ticketing business generated approximately $1.5 billion, or approximately 14% of Live Nation’s total revenue during 2018, which excludes the face value of tickets sold and is net of the fees paid to its ticketing clients. Through all of its ticketing services, Live Nation sold 217 million tickets in 2018 on which Live Nation was paid fees for its services. In addition, approximately 265 million tickets were sold using Live Nation’s Ticketmaster systems, including through season seat packages, its venue clients’ box offices and other channels through which Live Nation does not receive a fee. Live Nation’s ticketing sales are impacted by fluctuations in the availability of events for sale to the public, which may vary depending upon event scheduling by its clients.
 Terms of Live Nation Investment
 At December 31, 2018, we beneficially owned approximately 69.6 million shares of Live Nation common stock, which represented approximately 33% of the issued and outstanding shares as of December 31, 2018.
 Under our stockholders agreement with Live Nation, we have the right to nominate two directors (one of whom must qualify as an independent director) to the Live Nation board of directors, currently comprised of 12 directors, for so long as our ownership interest provides us with not less than 5% of the total voting power of Live Nation’s equity securities. We also have the right to cause one of our nominees to serve on the audit committee and the compensation committee of the board, provided they meet the independence and other qualifications for membership on those committees. Live Nation has waived the director independence requirement with respect to our nominees to the Live Nation board of directors, and we have waived our right to cause one of our nominees to serve on the audit and compensation committees of the board.
 We have agreed under the stockholders agreement not to acquire beneficial ownership of Live Nation equity securities that would result in our having in excess of 35% of the voting power of Live Nation’s equity securities. That percentage is subject to decrease for specified transfers of our Live Nation stock. We have been exempted from the restrictions on business combinations set forth in Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, and Live Nation has agreed in the stockholders agreement not to take certain actions that would materially and adversely affect our ability to acquire Live Nation securities representing up to 35% of the voting power of Live Nation’s equity securities.
 Other Minority Investments
 We also own a portfolio of minority debt and equity investments in publicly traded media companies, including iHeart Media, Inc. and AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T). These are assets that were previously acquired (some in tax-efficient transactions) and are currently held as non-core assets. In the past we have entered into swaps, exchangeable debentures, and other derivatives to monetize these investments and mitigate balance sheet risk. We intend to continue to monetize these investments, which may include further derivative and structured transactions as well as public and private sales.

 Regulatory Matters
 Satellite Digital Audio Radio Services
 As an operator of a privately owned satellite system, SIRIUS XM is regulated by the FCC under the Communications Act of 1934, principally with respect to:

· | the licensing of its satellite systems;
--+----------------------------------------


· | preventing interference with or to other users of radio frequencies; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | compliance with FCC rules established specifically for U.S. satellites and satellite radio services.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Any assignment or transfer of control of SIRIUS XM’s FCC licenses must be approved by the FCC. The FCC’s order approving the merger of SIRIUS XM’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Vernon Merger Corporation, with and into XM Satellite Radio Holdings Inc. in July 2008 requires SIRIUS XM to comply with certain voluntary commitments it made as part of the FCC merger proceeding. SIRIUS XM believes it complies with those commitments.
 In 1997, SIRIUS XM was the winning bidder for FCC licenses to operate a satellite digital audio radio service and provide other ancillary services. SIRIUS XM’s FCC licenses for its Sirius satellites expire in 2022 and 2025. SIRIUS XM’s FCC licenses for its XM satellites expire in 2021, 2022 and 2026. The FCC has also granted SIRIUS XM licenses to construct, deploy and operate SXM-7 and SXM-8 as replacement satellites.  SIRIUS XM anticipates that, absent significant misconduct on its part, the FCC will renew its licenses to permit operation of its satellites for their useful lives, and grant licenses for any replacement satellites.
 In some areas, SIRIUS XM has installed terrestrial repeaters to supplement its satellite signal coverage. The FCC has established rules governing terrestrial repeaters and has granted SIRIUS XM a license through 2027 to operate its repeater network.
 In certain cases, SIRIUS XM obtains FCC certifications for satellite radios, including satellite radios that include FM modulators. SIRIUS XM believes its radios that are in production comply with all applicable FCC rules.
 SIRIUS XM also is subject to a royalty rate established by the CRB and must negotiate royalty arrangements with musical works and sound recording rights holders.  See “Copyrights to Programming” above.
 SIRIUS XM is required to obtain export licenses or other approvals from the United States government to export certain equipment, services and technical data related to its satellites and their operations. The transfer of such equipment, services and technical data outside the United States or to foreign persons is subject to strict export control and prior approval requirements from the United States government (including prohibitions on the sharing of certain satellite-related goods and services with China).
 Changes in law or regulations relating to communications policy or to matters affecting SIRIUS XM’s services could adversely affect its ability to retain its FCC licenses or the manner in which SIRIUS XM operates.
 Competition Laws and Formula 1
 The operations and business of Formula 1 are subject to European and national competition laws which require Formula 1 at all times to ensure its business practices and agreements are consistent with the operation of competitive markets. Following an investigation by the European Commission (“EC”) into the commercialization of Formula 1 and related agreements in 1999, Formula 1 modified certain of its business practices and changed the terms of a number of its commercial contracts with Teams, broadcasters, promoters and the FIA. In October 2001, the EC issued two comfort letters to Formula 1 stating that it was no longer under investigation. Comfort letters are not binding on the EC and if it believes that there has been a material change in circumstances, further enforcement action could be taken. The EC issued a press release in October 2003 stating that it was satisfied that Formula 1 had complied with the modified practices and terms that had led to its issuing the 2001 comfort letters and that it had ended its monitoring of Formula 1’s compliance.

 Competition
 SIRIUS XM faces significant competition for both listeners and advertisers in its satellite radio business, including from providers of radio and other audio services. SIRIUS XM’s services compete with traditional AM/FM radio. Traditional AM/FM radio has a well-established demand for its services and offers free broadcasts paid for by commercial advertising rather than by subscription fees. Many radio stations offer information programming of a local nature, such as local news and sports. The availability of traditional free AM/FM radio may reduce the likelihood that customers would be willing to pay for SIRIUS XM’s subscription services and, by offering free broadcasts, it may impose limits on what SIRIUS XM can charge for its services. Several traditional radio companies own large numbers of radio stations or other media properties. SIRIUS XM also faces competition from Internet-based competitors. Internet radio services often have no geographic limitations and provide listeners with radio programming from across the country and around the world. Major online providers make high fidelity digital streams available through the Internet for free or, in some cases, for less than the cost of a satellite radio subscription. Certain of these services include advanced functionality, such as personalization, and allow the user to access large libraries of content. For some consumers, these services may compete with SIRIUS XM’s services, at home, in vehicles, and wherever audio entertainment is consumed. In addition, nearly all automakers have deployed integrated multimedia systems in their vehicles, including in many cases Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. These systems combine control of audio entertainment from a variety of sources, including AM/FM/HD radio broadcasts, satellite radio, Internet radio, smartphone applications and stored audio, with navigation and other advanced applications. Internet radio and other data are typically connected to the system through an Internet-enabled smartphone or wireless modem installed in the vehicle, and the entire system may be controlled by touchscreen or voice recognition. These systems may enhance the attractiveness of Internet-based competitors by making such applications more prominent, easier to access, and safer to use in vehicles. SIRIUS XM also faces competition from a number of providers that offer specialized audio services through either direct broadcast satellite or cable audio systems. These services are targeted to fixed locations, mostly in-home. The radio service offered by direct broadcast satellite and cable audio is often included as part of a package of digital services with video service, and video customers generally do not pay an additional monthly charge for the audio service. In addition, the audio entertainment marketplace continues to evolve rapidly, with a steady emergence of new media platforms that compete with SIRIUS XM’s services now or that could compete with those services in the future. A number of providers compete with SIRIUS XM’s traffic services. In-dash navigation is threatened by smartphones that provide data services through a direct vehicle interface. Most of these smartphones offer GPS mapping with sophisticated data-based turn-by-turn navigation. SIRIUS XM’s connected vehicle services business operates in a highly competitive environment and competes with several providers, including Verizon Telematics, as well as products being developed by automakers for their vehicles. OnStar, a division of General Motors (“GM”), also offers connected vehicle services in GM vehicles. Sirius XM also competes with wireless devices such as mobile phones. SIRIUS XM competes against other connected vehicle service providers for automaker arrangements on the basis of innovation, service quality and reliability, technical capabilities and systems customization, scope of service, industry experience, past performance and price.
 With respect to Formula 1, the World Championship competes with many alternative forms of entertainment, such as other sporting and live events, for television viewership, live attendance and advertising. For example, Formula 1 competes for broadcasting and advertising revenue with other global and regional Tier 1 sports, including the Olympic Games, FIFA World Cup, Champions League and Premier League. Within national markets, Formula 1 competes with local racing events, such as the Indianapolis 500 race and NASCAR in the United States.
 Braves Holdings faces competition from many alternative forms of leisure entertainment. During the baseball season, Braves Holdings competes with other sporting and live events for game day attendance, which is integral to Braves Holdings’ ticket, concession and merchandise sales revenue. The broadcasting of the Atlanta Braves’ games, which is another significant source of revenue for Braves Holdings, competes against a multitude of other media options for viewers, including premium programming, home video, pay-per-view services, subscription video on-demand services, online activities, movies and other forms of news and information. In addition, Braves Holdings competes with the other MLB teams for a limited pool of player, coaching and managerial talent. This talent contributes to the Atlanta Braves’ record and league standings, which are critical components of Braves Holdings’ competitiveness.
 Live Nation faces competition in the live music industry, in attracting touring artists to the venues it owns and operates and from ticketing services primarily through online channels but also through phone, outlet and box office 

 
  I-22

 
channels. Competition in the live entertainment industry is intense. Live Nation believes that it competes primarily on the basis of its ability to deliver quality music events, sell tickets and provide enhanced fan and artist experiences. It believes that its primary strengths include the quality of service delivered to its artists, fans, ticketing clients and corporate sponsors, its track record in promoting and producing live music events and tours both domestically and internationally, artist relationships, its global footprint, ticketing software and services, its ecommerce site and associated database, diverse distribution platform (venues), the scope and effectiveness in its expertise of advertising and sponsorship programs and its financial stability.
