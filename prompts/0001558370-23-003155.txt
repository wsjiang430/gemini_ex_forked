----+-------------------------------

CompX believes all of its facilities are well maintained and satisfactory for their intended purposes.
Raw materials - The primary raw materials used in CompX’s manufacturing processes are:

● | Security Products - zinc and brass (for the manufacture of locking mechanisms).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Marine Components - stainless steel (for the manufacture of exhaust headers and pipes and wake enhancement systems), aluminum (for the manufacture of throttles and trim tabs) and other components.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These raw materials are purchased from several suppliers, are readily available from numerous sources and accounted for approximately 17% of our total cost of sales for 2022. Total material costs, including purchased components, represented approximately 47% of our cost of sales in 2022.
CompX occasionally enters into short-term commodity-related raw material supply arrangements to mitigate the impact of future price increases in commodity-related raw materials, including zinc, brass and stainless steel. These arrangements generally provide for stated unit prices based upon specified purchase volumes, which help CompX to stabilize its commodity-related raw material costs to a certain extent. At other times CompX may make spot market buys of larger quantities of raw materials to take advantage of favorable pricing or volume-based discounts. Prices for the primary commodity-related raw materials used in the manufacture of CompX’s locking mechanisms, primarily zinc and brass, generally increased throughout 2021 and the first half of 2022. Prices began to stabilize in the latter half of 2022, although at elevated levels. The prices for stainless steel, the primary raw material used for the manufacture of marine

​

exhaust headers and pipes and wake enhancement systems, experienced significant volatility during 2021 and 2022. Based on current economic conditions, CompX expects the prices for zinc, brass, stainless steel and other manufacturing materials in 2023 to be relatively stable, although at the elevated levels it experienced in the second half of 2022. When purchased on the spot market, each of these raw materials may be subject to sudden and unanticipated price increases. When possible, CompX seeks to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in these raw material costs on its margins through improvements in production efficiencies or other operating cost reductions. In the event CompX is unable to offset raw material cost increases with other cost reductions, it may be difficult to recover those cost increases through increased product selling prices or raw material surcharges due to the competitive nature of the markets served by its products. Consequently, overall operating margins can be affected by commodity-related raw material cost pressures. Commodity market prices are cyclical, reflecting overall economic trends, specific developments in consuming industries and speculative investor activities.
Patents and trademarks - CompX holds a number of patents relating to its component products, certain of which it believes to be important to CompX and its continuing business activity. Patents generally have a term of 20 years and CompX’s patents have remaining terms ranging from one year to 18 years at December 31, 2022.

Sales, marketing and distribution - A majority of CompX’s component sales are direct to large OEM customers through its factory-based sales and marketing professionals supported by engineers working in concert with field salespeople and independent manufacturer’s representatives. CompX selects manufacturer’s representatives based on special skills in certain markets or relationships with current or potential customers.
In addition to sales to large OEM customers, a substantial portion of CompX’s Security Products sales are made through distributors. CompX has a significant North American market share of cabinet lock security product sales as a result of the locksmith distribution channel. CompX supports its locksmith distributor sales with a line of standardized products used by the largest segments of the marketplace. These products are packaged and merchandised for easy availability and handling by distributors and end users.
CompX sells to a diverse customer base with only two customers representing 10% or more of its sales in 2022 (United States Postal Service representing 14% and Malibu Boats, LLC representing 12%). CompX’s largest ten customers accounted for approximately 52% of its sales in 2022.
Competition - The markets in which CompX participates are highly competitive. CompX competes primarily on the basis of product design, including space utilization and aesthetic factors, product quality and durability, price, on-time delivery, service and technical support. CompX focuses its efforts on the middle and high-end segments of the market, where product design, quality, durability and service are valued by the customer. CompX’s Security Products business competes against a number of domestic and foreign manufacturers. CompX’s Marine Components business competes with small domestic manufacturers and is minimally affected by foreign competitors.
Regulatory and environmental matters - CompX has a history of incorporating environmental management and compliance in its operations and decision making. CompX operates three low-emission manufacturing facilities and CompX’s production processes requiring waste-water discharge are consolidated at its Mauldin, South Carolina facility.

​

This facility has received a ReWa Gold Award from Renewable Water Resources, an organization which sets regulatory and water policies for the Mauldin facility’s geographic region, for multiple years for its exemplary performance. In addition, CompX operates extensive scrap metal recycling programs to reduce landfill waste.
CompX’s operations are subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, handling, generation, transportation, treatment, emission, discharge, disposal, remediation of and exposure to hazardous and non-hazardous substances, materials and wastes. CompX’s operations also are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to worker health and safety. CompX believes it is in substantial compliance with all such laws and regulations. To date, the costs of maintaining compliance with such laws and regulations have not significantly impacted its results. CompX currently does not anticipate any significant costs or expenses relating to such matters; however, it is possible future laws and regulations may require CompX to incur significant additional expenditures.
CHEMICALS - KRONOS WORLDWIDE, INC.
Business overview - Kronos is a leading global producer and marketer of value-added titanium dioxide pigments, or TiO2, a base industrial product used in a wide range of applications. Kronos, along with its distributors and agents, sells and provides technical services for its products to approximately 4,000 customers in 100 countries with the majority of sales in Europe, North America and the Asia Pacific region. Kronos believes it has developed considerable expertise and efficiency in the manufacture, sale, shipment and service of its products in domestic and international markets.
TiO2 is a white inorganic pigment used in a wide range of products for its exceptional durability and its ability to impart whiteness, brightness and opacity. TiO2 is a critical component of everyday applications, such as coatings, plastics and paper, as well as many specialty products such as inks, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. TiO2 is widely considered to be superior to alternative white pigments in large part due to its hiding power (or opacity), which is the ability to cover or mask other materials effectively and efficiently. TiO2 is designed, marketed and sold based on specific end-use applications.
TiO2 is the largest commercially used whitening pigment because it has a high refractive rating, giving it more hiding power than any other commercially produced white pigment. In addition, TiO2 has excellent resistance to interaction with other chemicals, good thermal stability and resistance to ultraviolet degradation. Although there are other white pigments on the market, Kronos believes there are no effective substitutes for TiO2 because no other white pigment has the physical properties for achieving comparable opacity and brightness or can be incorporated in as cost-effective a manner. Pigment extenders such as kaolin clays, calcium carbonate and polymeric opacifiers are used together with TiO2 in a number of end-use markets. However, these products are not able to duplicate the opacity performance characteristics of TiO2 and Kronos believes these products are unlikely to have a significant impact on the use of TiO2.
TiO2 is considered a “quality-of-life” product. Demand for TiO2 has generally been driven by worldwide gross domestic product and has generally increased with rising standards of living in various regions of the world. According to industry estimates, TiO2 consumption has grown at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 2% since 2000. Per capita consumption of TiO2 in Western Europe and North America far exceeds that in other areas of the world, and these regions are expected to continue to be the largest consumers of TiO2 on a per capita basis for the foreseeable future. Kronos believes that Western Europe and North America currently each account for approximately 16% of global TiO2 consumption. Markets for TiO2 are generally increasing in China, the Asia Pacific region, South America and Eastern Europe and Kronos believes these are significant markets which will continue to grow as economies in these regions develop and quality-of-life products, including TiO2, experience greater demand.
Products and end-use markets - Kronos, including its predecessors, has produced and marketed TiO2 in North America and Europe, its primary markets, for over 100 years. Kronos believes it is the largest TiO2 producer in Europe with 45% of its 2022 sales volumes attributable to markets in Europe. The table below shows Kronos’ estimated market share for its significant markets, Europe and North America, for the last three years.

​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​

​

Kronos offers its customers a broad portfolio of products that include over 40 different TiO2 pigment grades under the KRONOS® trademark, which provide a variety of performance properties to meet customers’ specific requirements. Kronos’ major customers include domestic and international paint, plastics, decorative laminate and paper manufacturers. Kronos ships TiO2 to its customers in either a dry or slurry form via rail, truck and/or ocean carrier. Sales of Kronos’ core TiO2 pigments represented approximately 92% of its net sales in 2022. Kronos and its agents and distributors primarily sell products in three major end-use markets: coatings, plastics and paper.
The following tables show Kronos’ approximate TiO2 sales volume by geographic region and end-use for the year ended December 31, 2022:

​
Some of the principal applications for Kronos’ products include the following:
TiO2 for coatings – Kronos’ TiO2 is used to provide opacity, durability, tinting strength and brightness in industrial coatings, as well as coatings for commercial and residential interiors and exteriors, automobiles, aircraft, machines, appliances, traffic paint and other special purpose coatings. The amount of TiO2 used in coatings varies widely depending on the opacity, color and quality desired. In general, the higher the opacity requirement of the coating, the greater the TiO2 content.
TiO2 for plastics – Kronos produces TiO2 pigments that improve the optical and physical properties of plastics, including whiteness and opacity. TiO2 is used to provide opacity to items such as containers and packaging materials, and vinyl products such as windows, door profiles and siding. TiO2 also generally provides hiding power, neutral undertone, brightness and surface durability for housewares, appliances, toys, computer cases and food packages. TiO2’s high brightness along with its opacity, is used in some engineering plastics to help mask their undesirable natural color. TiO2 is also used in masterbatch, which is a concentrate of TiO2 and other additives and is one of the largest uses for TiO2 in the plastics end-use market. In masterbatch, the TiO2 is dispersed at high concentrations into a plastic resin and is then used by manufacturers of plastic containers, bottles, packaging and agricultural films.
TiO2 for paper – Kronos’ TiO2 is used in the production of several types of paper, including laminate (decorative) paper, filled paper and coated paper to provide whiteness, brightness, opacity and color stability. Although Kronos sells its TiO2 to all segments of the paper end-use market, its primary focus is on the TiO2 grades used in paper laminates, where several layers of paper are laminated together using melamine resin under high temperature and pressure. The top layer of paper contains TiO2 and plastic resin and is the layer that is printed with decorative patterns. Paper laminates are used to replace materials such as wood and tile for such applications as counter tops, furniture and wallboard. TiO2 is beneficial in these applications because it assists in preventing the material from fading or changing color after prolonged exposure to sunlight and other weathering agents.
TiO2 for other applications – Kronos produces TiO2 to improve the opacity and hiding power of printing inks. TiO2 allows inks to achieve very high print quality while not interfering with the technical requirements of printing machinery, including low abrasion, high printing speed and high temperatures. Kronos’ TiO2 is also used in textile applications where TiO2 functions as an opacifying and delustering agent. In man-made fibers such as rayon and polyester, TiO2 corrects an otherwise undesirable glossy and translucent appearance. Without the presence of TiO2, these materials would be unsuitable for use in many textile applications.
Kronos produces high-purity sulfate process anatase TiO2 used to provide opacity, whiteness and brightness in a variety of cosmetic and personal care products, such as skin cream, lipstick, eye shadow and toothpaste. In pharmaceuticals, Kronos’ TiO2 is used commonly as a colorant in tablet and capsule coatings as well as in liquid medicines to provide uniformity of color and appearance. KRONOS® purified anatase grades meet the applicable requirements of the CTFA (Cosmetics, Toiletries and Fragrances Association), USP and BP (United States Pharmacopoeia and British Pharmacopoeia) and the FDA (United States Food and Drug Administration).

​

Kronos’ TiO2 business is enhanced by the following three complementary businesses, which comprised approximately 8% of its net sales in 2022:

● | Kronos owns and operates an ilmenite mine in Norway pursuant to a governmental concession with an unlimited term. Ilmenite is a raw material used directly as a feedstock by some sulfate-process TiO2 plants. Kronos supplies ilmenite to its sulfate plants in Europe. Kronos also sells ilmenite ore to third parties, some of whom are its competitors. Kronos also sells an ilmenite-based specialty product to the oil and gas industry. The mine has estimated ilmenite reserves that are expected to last at least 50 years.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Kronos manufactures and sells iron-based chemicals, which are co-products and processed co-products of sulfate and chloride process TiO2 pigment production. These co-product chemicals are marketed through its Ecochem division and are primarily used as treatment and conditioning agents for industrial effluents and municipal wastewater as well as in the manufacture of iron pigments, cement and agricultural products.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Kronos manufactures and sells other specialty chemicals, which are side-stream products from the production of TiO2. These specialty chemicals are used in applications in the formulation of pearlescent pigments, production of electroceramic capacitors for cell phones and other electronic devices and natural gas pipe and other specialty applications.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Manufacturing, operations and properties - Kronos produces TiO2 in two crystalline forms: rutile and anatase. Rutile TiO2 is manufactured using both a chloride production process and a sulfate production process, whereas anatase TiO2 is only produced using a sulfate production process. Manufacturers of many end-use applications can use either form, especially during periods of tight supply for TiO2. The chloride process is the preferred form for use in coatings and plastics, the two largest end-use markets. Due to environmental factors and customer considerations, the proportion of TiO2 industry sales represented by chloride process pigments has remained stable relative to sulfate process pigments, and in 2022, chloride process production facilities represented approximately 45% of industry capacity. The sulfate process is preferred for use in selected paper products, ceramics, rubber tires, man-made fibers, food products, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics. Once an intermediate TiO2 pigment has been produced by either the chloride or sulfate process, it is “finished” into products with specific performance characteristics for particular end-use applications through proprietary processes involving various chemical surface treatments and intensive micronizing (milling).

● | Chloride process – The chloride process is a continuous process in which chlorine is used to extract rutile TiO2. The chloride process produces less waste than the sulfate process because much of the chlorine is recycled and feedstock bearing higher titanium content is used. The chloride process also has lower energy requirements and is less labor-intensive than the sulfate process, although the chloride process requires a higher-skilled labor force. The chloride process produces an intermediate base pigment with a wide range of properties.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Sulfate process – The sulfate process is a batch process in which sulfuric acid is used to extract the TiO2 from ilmenite or titanium slag. After separation from the impurities in the ore (mainly iron), the TiO2 is precipitated and calcined to form an intermediate base pigment ready for sale or can be upgraded through finishing treatments.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Kronos produced 517,000, 545,000, and 492,000 metric tons of TiO2 in 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively. Kronos’ production volumes include its share of the output produced by its TiO2 manufacturing joint venture discussed below. Kronos’ average production capacity utilization rates were approximately 92% in 2020, full practical capacity in 2021 and 89% in 2022. Kronos’ production rates in 2020 were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic (primarily in the third quarter). In the fourth quarter of 2022 Kronos adjusted production levels to correspond with reduced customer demand in its European and export markets resulting from challenging economic conditions and geopolitical uncertainties.
Kronos operates facilities throughout North America and Europe, including the only sulfate process plant in North America and four TiO2 plants in Europe (one in each of Leverkusen, Germany; Nordenham, Germany; Langerbrugge, Belgium; and Fredrikstad, Norway). In North America, Kronos has a TiO2 plant in Varennes, Quebec, Canada and, through the manufacturing joint venture described below, a 50% interest in a TiO2 plant near Lake Charles, Louisiana.
As part of Kronos’ long-term strategy to increase chloride process production, Kronos phased-out sulfate production at its Leverkusen facility during 2020. Kronos’ chloride process production and remaining sulfate production capacity has increased by approximately 5% over the past ten years due to debottlenecking programs with only moderate

​

capital expenditures. Kronos operated its facilities at reduced capacities in the fourth quarter of 2022 and into 2023. Based on current assumptions about market performance and demand, Kronos expects to operate its TiO2 plants at 80% to 90% capacity in the first half of 2023 and near full practical capacity levels by the second half of 2023.
The following table presents the division of Kronos’ expected 2023 manufacturing capacity by plant location and type of manufacturing process:

(1) | The Leverkusen facility is located within an extensive manufacturing complex owned by Bayer AG. Kronos owns the Leverkusen facility, which represents about one-third of Kronos’ current TiO2 production capacity, but Kronos leases the land under the facility from Bayer under a long-term agreement which expires in 2050. Lease payments are periodically negotiated with Bayer for periods of at least two years at a time. A majority-owned subsidiary of Bayer provides some raw materials including chlorine, auxiliary and operating materials, utilities and services necessary to operate the Leverkusen facility under separate supplies and services agreements.
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | The Fredrikstad facility is located on public land and is leased until 2063.
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


(3) | Kronos operates the facility near Lake Charles through a joint venture with Venator Investments LLC (Venator Investments), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Venator Group, of which Venator Materials PLC (Venator) owns 100% and the amount indicated in the table above represents the share of TiO2 produced by the joint venture to which it is entitled. The joint venture owns the land and facility.
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Kronos owns the land underlying all of its principal production facilities unless otherwise indicated in the table above.
Kronos also operates an ilmenite mine in Norway pursuant to a governmental concession with an unlimited term. In addition, Kronos operates a rutile slurry manufacturing plant near Lake Charles, Louisiana, which converts dry pigment primarily manufactured for Kronos at the Lake Charles TiO2 facility into a slurry form that is then shipped to customers.
Kronos has corporate and administrative offices located in the U.S., Germany, Norway, Canada, Belgium, and France.
TiO2 manufacturing joint venture - Kronos Louisiana, Inc., one of Kronos’ subsidiaries, and Venator Investments each own a 50% interest in a manufacturing joint venture, Louisiana Pigment Company, L.P. (LPC). LPC owns and operates a chloride-process TiO2 plant located near Lake Charles, Louisiana. Kronos and Venator share production from the plant equally pursuant to separate offtake agreements, unless Kronos and Venator otherwise agree.
A supervisory committee directs the business and affairs of the joint venture, including production and output decisions. This committee is composed of four members, two of whom Kronos appoints and two of whom Venator appoints. Two general managers manage the operations of the joint venture acting under the direction of the supervisory committee. Kronos appoints one general manager and Venator appoints the other.

-10-




​

Kronos does not consolidate LPC because Kronos does not control it. Kronos accounts for its interest in the joint venture by the equity method. The joint venture operates on a break-even basis and therefore Kronos does not have any equity in earnings of the joint venture. Kronos is required to purchase one half of the TiO2 produced by the joint venture. All costs and capital expenditures are shared equally with Venator with the exception of feedstock (purchased natural rutile ore or chlorine slag) and packaging costs for the pigment grades produced. Kronos’ share of net costs is reported as cost of sales as the TiO2 is sold.
Raw materials - The primary raw materials used in chloride process TiO2 are titanium-containing feedstock (purchased natural rutile ore or chlorine slag), chlorine and petroleum coke. Chlorine is available from a number of suppliers, while petroleum coke is available from a limited number of suppliers. Titanium-containing feedstock suitable for use in the chloride process is available from a limited but increasing number of suppliers principally in Australia, South Africa, Sierra Leone, Canada and India. Kronos purchases feedstock for its chloride process TiO2 from the following primary suppliers for certain contractually specified volumes for delivery extending, in some cases, through 2026:

​​​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ 
--------------------------------+---+-----------------------------+---+---+--------------------------------
Supplier | ​ | Product | ​ | ​ | Renewal Terms 
Rio Tinto Iron and Titanium Ltd | ​ | Chloride process grade slag | ​ | ​ | Auto-renews bi-annually 
Rio Tinto Iron and Titanium Ltd | ​ | Upgraded slag | ​ | ​ | Auto-renews annually 
Eramet SA | ​ | Chloride process grade slag | ​ | | Renewal terms upon negotiations
Sierra Rutile Limited | ​ | Rutile ore | ​ | | Renewal terms upon negotiations
Iluka Resources Limited | ​ | Rutile ore | ​ | | Renewal terms upon negotiations
Saraf Agencies Private Limited | ​ | Chloride process grade slag | ​ | | Renewal terms upon negotiations

In the past Kronos has been, and expects it will continue to be, successful in obtaining short-term and long-term extensions to these and other existing supply contracts prior to their expiration. Kronos expects the raw materials purchased under these contracts, and contracts that it may enter into, will meet its chloride process feedstock requirements over the next several years. Contracts may be terminated with a 12-month written notice (generally for multi-year agreement terms) or based on certain defaults by either party or failure to agree on pricing as noted in the agreements.
The primary raw materials used in sulfate process TiO2 are titanium-containing feedstock, primarily ilmenite or purchased sulfate grade slag, and sulfuric acid. Sulfuric acid is available from a number of suppliers. Titanium-containing feedstock suitable for use in the sulfate process is available from a limited number of suppliers principally in Norway, Canada, Australia, India and South Africa. As one of the few vertically-integrated producers of sulfate process TiO2, Kronos operates a rock ilmenite mine in Norway, which provided all of the feedstock for its European sulfate process TiO2 plants in 2022. Kronos expects ilmenite production from its mine to meet its European sulfate process feedstock requirements for the foreseeable future. For Kronos’ Canadian sulfate process plant, it purchases sulfate grade slag primarily from Rio Tinto Fer et Titane Inc. under a supply contract that renews annually, subject to termination upon twelve months written notice. Kronos expects the raw materials purchased under this contract, and contracts that it may enter into, to meet its sulfate process feedstock requirements over the next several years.
Many of Kronos’ raw material contracts contain fixed quantities it is required to purchase or specify a range of quantities within which it is required to purchase. The pricing under these agreements is generally negotiated quarterly or semi-annually.
The following table summarizes Kronos’ raw materials purchased or mined in 2022.

Sales and marketing - Kronos’ marketing strategy is aimed at developing and maintaining strong relationships with new and existing customers. Because TiO2 represents a significant input cost for its customers, the purchasing decisions are often made by its customers’ senior management. Kronos works to maintain close relationships with the key decision makers through in-depth and frequent contact. Kronos endeavors to extend these commercial and technical relationships to multiple levels within its customers’ organizations using its direct sales force and technical service group to accomplish this objective. Kronos believes this helps build customer loyalty and strengthens its competitive position. Close cooperation and strong customer relationships enable Kronos to stay closely attuned to trends in its customers’ businesses. Where appropriate, Kronos works in conjunction with its customers to solve formulation or application problems by modifying specific product properties or developing new pigment grades. Kronos also focuses its sales and marketing efforts on those geographic and end-use market segments where it believes it can realize higher selling prices. This focus includes continuously reviewing and optimizing its customer and product portfolios.
Kronos also works directly with its customers to monitor the success of its products in their end-use applications, evaluate the need for improvements in its product and process technology and identify opportunities to develop new product solutions for its customers. Kronos’ marketing staff closely coordinates with its sales force and technical specialists to ensure the needs of its customers are met, and to help develop and commercialize new grades where appropriate.
Kronos sells a majority of its products through its direct sales force operating in Europe and North America. Kronos also utilizes sales agents and distributors who are authorized to sell its products in specific geographic areas. In Europe, Kronos’ sales efforts are conducted primarily through its direct sales force and its sales agents. Kronos’ agents do not sell any TiO2 products other than KRONOS® branded products. In North America, Kronos’ sales are made primarily through its direct sales force and supported by a network of distributors. Kronos has increased its marketing efforts over the last several years in export markets and Kronos’ sales are now made through its direct sales force, sales agents and distributors. In addition to Kronos’ direct sales force and sales agents, many of its sales agents also act as distributors to service its customers in all regions. Kronos offers customer and technical service to customers who purchase its products through distributors as well as to its larger customers serviced by its direct sales force.
Kronos sells to a diverse customer base with only one customer representing 10% or more of its net sales in 2022 (Behr Process Corporation – 10%). Kronos’ largest ten customers accounted for approximately 33% of net sales in 2022.
Neither Kronos’ business as a whole nor any of its principal product groups is seasonal to any significant extent. However, TiO2 sales are generally higher in the second and third quarters of the year, due in part to the increase in coatings production in the spring to meet demand during the spring and summer painting seasons. With certain exceptions, such as during the third quarter of 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and during the fourth quarter of 2022 as a result of reduced customer demand and unprecedently high energy costs, Kronos has historically operated its production facilities at near full capacity rates throughout the entire year, which among other things helps to minimize its per-unit production costs. As a result, Kronos normally builds inventories during the first and fourth quarters of each year in order to maximize its product availability during the higher demand periods normally experienced in the second and third quarters.
Competition - The TiO2 industry is highly competitive. Kronos competes primarily on the basis of price, product quality, technical service and the availability of high performance pigment grades. Since TiO2 is not traded through a commodity market, its pricing is largely a product of negotiation between suppliers and their respective customers. Price and availability are the most significant competitive factors along with quality and customer service for the majority of its product grades. Increasingly, Kronos is focused on providing pigments that are differentiated to meet specific customer requests and specialty grades that are differentiated from its competitors’ products. During 2022, Kronos had an estimated 7% share of worldwide TiO2 sales volume, and based on sales volume Kronos believes it is the leading seller of TiO2 in several countries, including Germany.
Kronos’ principal competitors are The Chemours Company, Tronox Incorporated, LB Group Co. Ltd. and Venator Materials PLC. The top five TiO2 producers (i.e. Kronos and its four principal competitors) account for approximately 52% of the world’s production capacity.

-12-




​

The following chart shows Kronos’ estimate of worldwide production capacity in 2022:
​

​ | ​ | ​ | ​
-------------------------------------+---+----+--
Worldwide production capacity – 2022
Chemours | | 15 | %
Tronox | | 12 | %
LB Group Co.Ltd. | | 11 | %
Venator | | 7 | %
Kronos | | 7 | %
Other | | 48 | %

​
Chemours has approximately one-half of total North American TiO2 production capacity and is Kronos’ principal North American competitor. LB Group. Ltd. previously announced it plans to add an additional 200,000 tons of chloride capacity which we expect will be added incrementally over the next several years.
 The TiO2 industry is characterized by high barriers to entry consisting of high capital costs, proprietary technology and significant lead times required to construct new facilities or to expand existing capacity. Therefore, over the past ten years, Kronos and its competitors increased industry capacity through debottlenecking projects, although this increase only partly compensated for the shut-down of various TiO2 plants throughout the world. Although overall industry demand is expected to increase in 2023, other than through debottlenecking projects and the LB Group Co. Ltd. expansion mentioned above, Kronos does not expect any significant efforts will be undertaken by Kronos or its principal competitors to further increase capacity and Kronos believes it is unlikely any new TiO2 plants will be constructed in Europe or North America for the foreseeable future. If actual developments differ from Kronos’ expectations, the TiO2 industry’s and Kronos’ performance could be unfavorably affected.
Research and development - Kronos employs scientists, chemists, process engineers and technicians who are engaged in research and development, process technology and quality assurance activities in Leverkusen, Germany. These individuals have the responsibility for improving Kronos’ chloride and sulfate production processes, improving product quality and strengthening Kronos’ competitive position by developing new products and applications. Kronos’ expenditures for these activities were approximately $16 million in 2020, $17 million in 2021 and $15 million in 2022. Kronos expects to spend approximately $17 million on research and development in 2023.
Kronos continually seeks to improve the quality of its grades and has been successful in developing new grades for existing and new applications to meet the needs of its customers and increase product life cycles. Since the beginning of 2017, Kronos has added nine new grades for pigments and other applications.
Patents, trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights - Kronos has a comprehensive intellectual property protection strategy that includes obtaining, maintaining and enforcing its patents, primarily in the United States, Canada and Europe. Kronos also protects its trademark and trade secret rights and has entered into license agreements with third parties concerning various intellectual property matters. Kronos has also from time to time been involved in disputes over intellectual property.
Patents – Kronos has obtained patents and has numerous patent applications pending that cover its products and the technology used in the manufacture of its products. Kronos’ patent strategy is important to it and its continuing business activities. In addition to maintaining its patent portfolio, Kronos seeks patent protection for its technical developments, principally in the United States, Canada and Europe. U.S. patents are generally in effect for 20 years from the date of filing. Kronos’ U.S. patent portfolio includes patents having remaining terms ranging from one year to 20 years.
Trademarks and trade secrets – Kronos trademarks, including KRONOS®, are covered by issued and/or pending registrations, including in Canada and the United States. Kronos protects the trademarks it uses in connection with the products it manufactures and sells and has developed goodwill in connection with its long-term use of its trademarks. Kronos conducts research activities in secret and it protects the confidentiality of its trade secrets through reasonable measures, including confidentiality agreements and security procedures, including data security. Kronos relies upon unpatented proprietary knowledge and continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain its competitive position. Kronos’ proprietary chloride production process is an important part of its technology and Kronos’ business could be harmed if it fails to maintain confidentiality of its trade secrets used in this technology.

​

Regulatory and environmental matters - Kronos’ operations and properties are governed by various environmental laws and regulations which are complex, change frequently and have tended to become stricter over time. These environmental laws govern, among other things, the generation, storage, handling, use and transportation of hazardous materials; the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground, air or water; and the health and safety of its employees. Certain of Kronos’ operations are, or have been, engaged in the generation, storage, handling, manufacture or use of substances or compounds that may be considered toxic or hazardous within the meaning of applicable environmental laws and regulations. As with other companies engaged in similar businesses, certain of Kronos’ past and current operations and products have the potential to cause environmental or other damage. Kronos has implemented and continues to implement various policies and programs in an effort to minimize these risks. Kronos’ policy is to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations at all its facilities and to strive to improve its environmental performance and overall sustainability. It is possible that future developments, such as stricter requirements in environmental laws and enforcement policies, could adversely affect its operations, including production, handling, use, storage, transportation, sale or disposal of hazardous or toxic substances or require Kronos to make capital and other expenditures to comply, and could adversely affect its consolidated financial position and results of operations or liquidity. During 2021, Kronos was notified by government authorities in Norway that the classification of a dam at its mine facilities was changed to the highest level for Norwegian classification of dam structures. As a result, its mine operations are subject to a higher degree of oversight and regulation than existed prior to this change in classification, and Kronos has increased its capital expenditures to adapt to the higher classification standards. 
Kronos has a history of identifying new ways to reduce consumption and waste by converting byproducts to co-products through its KRONOS ecochem® products. Annually Kronos updates and publishes its Safety, Environment, Energy and Quality Policy which is translated into local languages and distributed to all its employees and shared publicly via its website. Kronos has implemented rigorous procedures for incident reporting and investigation, including root cause analysis of environmental and safety incidents and near misses. Because TiO2 production requires significant energy input, Kronos is focused on energy efficiency at all production locations. Three of its five production facilities maintain certifications to the ISO 50001:2018 Energy Management standard and all locations have local energy teams in place. These teams are responsible for maintaining ISO 50001:2018 certifications (where applicable), performing regular reviews of local energy consumption, making recommendations regarding capital projects that reduce energy consumption and associated Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions or enhance efficiency. When possible, Kronos looks for opportunities to partner with local government authorities through grant opportunities to reduce energy consumption and associated GHG emissions. Kronos also actively manages potential water-related risks, including flooding and water shortages. Kronos’ manufacturing facilities are strategically located adjacent to sources of water, which it uses for process operations and for shipping and receiving raw materials and finished products. Water-critical processes are identified and ongoing efforts to minimize water use are incorporated into environmental planning.
Kronos’ U.S. manufacturing operations are governed by federal, state and local environmental and worker health and safety laws and regulations. These include the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, or RCRA, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, as amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act, or CERCLA, as well as the state counterparts of these statutes. Some of these laws hold current or previous owners or operators of real property liable for the costs of cleaning up contamination, even if these owners or operators did not know of, and were not responsible for, such contamination. These laws also assess liability on any person who arranges for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances, regardless of whether the affected site is owned or operated by such person. Although Kronos has not incurred and does not currently anticipate any material liabilities in connection with such environmental laws, Kronos may be required to make expenditures for environmental remediation in the future.
While the laws regulating operations of industrial facilities in Europe vary from country to country, a common regulatory framework is provided by the European Union, or the EU. Germany and Belgium are members of the EU and follow its initiatives. Norway is not a member but generally patterns its environmental regulatory actions after those of the EU.
From time to time, Kronos’ facilities may be subject to environmental regulatory enforcement under U.S. and non-U.S. statutes. Typically Kronos establishes compliance programs to resolve these matters. Occasionally, Kronos may pay penalties. To date, such penalties have not involved amounts having a material adverse effect on Kronos’ consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Kronos believes that all of its facilities are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws.

-14-




​

From time to time, new environmental, health and safety regulations are passed or proposed in the countries in which Kronos operates or sells its products, seeking to regulate its operations or to restrict, limit or classify TiO2. Kronos believes that it is in substantial compliance with laws applicable to the regulation of TiO2. However, increased regulatory scrutiny could affect consumer perception of TiO2 or limit the marketability and demand for TiO2 or products containing TiO2 and increase its regulatory and compliance costs.
On October 1, 2021, EU Regulation No. 1272/2008 classifying dry TiO2 and mixtures containing dry TiO2 as a suspected carcinogen via inhalation went into force. Kronos’ dry TiO2 products do not meet the criteria set forth in the regulation and therefore do not require classification labels. On November 23, 2022 the Court of Justice of the European Union annulled the classification of TiO2 as a suspected carcinogen in its entirety. 
Kronos’ capital expenditures related to ongoing environmental compliance, protection and improvement programs, including capital expenditures which are primarily focused on increasing operating efficiency but also result in improved environmental protection such as lower emissions from its manufacturing facilities, were $17.6 million in 2022 and are currently expected to be approximately $20 million in 2023.
ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE (ESG)
Through our subsidiaries and affiliates, we seek to operate our businesses in line with sound ESG principles that include corporate governance, social responsibility, sustainability, and cybersecurity. We believe ESG means conducting operations with high standards of environmental and social responsibility, practicing exemplary ethical standards, focusing on safety as a top priority, respecting human rights and supporting our local communities, and continuously developing our employees. At their facilities, Kronos and CompX undertake various environmental sustainability programs, and promote social responsibility and volunteerism through programs designed to support and give back to the local communities in which each operates. Each of Kronos’ and CompX’s locations maintain site-specific safety programs and disaster response and business continuity plans. All manufacturing facilities have detailed, site-specific emergency response procedures Kronos and CompX believe adequately address regulatory compliance, vulnerability to potential hazards, emergency response and action plans, employee training, alarms and warning systems and crisis communication.
At a corporate level, Kronos and CompX engage in periodic reviews of their cybersecurity programs, including cybersecurity risk and threats. Cybersecurity programs are built on operations and compliance foundations. Operations focus on continuous detection, prevention, measurement, analysis and response to cybersecurity alerts and incidents and on emerging threats. Compliance establishes oversight of our cybersecurity programs by creating risk-based controls to protect the integrity, confidentiality, accessibility and availability of company data stored, processed, or transferred. We periodically update our board of directors on cyber-related risks and cybersecurity programs. 
In an effort to align our non-employee directors’ financial interests with those of our stockholders, our Board established share ownership guidelines for our non-management directors.
Kronos has taken steps to integrate ESG considerations into operating decisions with other critical business factors. Kronos biennially publishes an ESG Report, which is available on its public website. The primary purpose of its ESG Report is to describe Kronos’ policies and programs in the area of ESG, including certain internal metrics and benchmarks related to various aspects of ESG. Kronos voluntarily developed these internal metrics and benchmarks, which Kronos uses to identify progress and opportunities for improvement. These metrics are not intended to be directly comparable to similar metrics utilized by other companies to track ESG performance, as the standards, methodologies and assumptions used to determine these metrics vary by company and jurisdiction.
 HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES
Employees - We operate through our subsidiaries and affiliate and through our intercorporate services agreement with Contran (see Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements). We have no direct employees. Our operating results depend in part on Kronos’ and CompX’s ability to successfully manage their human capital resources, including attracting, identifying and retaining key talent. Kronos and CompX each have a well-trained labor force with a substantial number of long-tenured employees. Kronos and CompX provide competitive compensation and benefits to their employees, some of which for Kronos are offered under collective bargaining agreements. In addition to salaries, these programs, which vary by country/region, can include annual bonuses, a defined benefit pension plan (for Kronos), a defined contribution plan 

-15-




​

with employer matching opportunities, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, family care resources, employee assistance programs, and tuition assistance.
As of December 31, 2022, CompX employed 609 people, all in the United States.
As of December 31, 2022, Kronos employed the following number of people:

​ | ​ | ​ 
------------------+---+------
Europe | | 1,841
Canada | | 369 
United States (1) | | 56 
Total | | 2,266

(1)Excludes employees of Kronos’ LPC joint venture.

CompX believes its labor relations are good at all of its facilities. Certain employees at each of Kronos’ production facilities are organized by labor unions. Kronos strives to maintain good relationships with all its employees, including the unions and workers’ councils representing those employees. In Europe, Kronos’ union employees are covered by master collective bargaining agreements for the chemical industry that are generally renewed annually. At December 31, 2022, approximately 88% of Kronos’ worldwide workforce is organized under collective bargaining agreements. Kronos did not experience any work stoppages during 2022, although it is possible that there could be future work stoppages or other labor disruptions that could materially and adversely affect its business, results of operations, financial position or liquidity.
Health and safety – Kronos and CompX believe protecting the health and safety of their workforce, customers, business partners and the natural environment are core values. Kronos and CompX are committed to maintaining a strong safety culture where all workers meet or exceed required industry performance standards and continuously seek to improve occupational and process safety performance. Kronos and CompX conduct their businesses in ways that provide all personnel with a safe and healthy work environment and have established safety and environmental programs and goals to achieve such results. Kronos and CompX expect their manufacturing facilities to produce products safely and in compliance with local regulations, policies, standards and practices intended to protect the environment and people and have established global policies designed to promote such compliance. Kronos and CompX require employees to comply with such requirements. Kronos and CompX provide their workers with the tools and training necessary to make the appropriate decisions to prevent accidents and injuries. Each of Kronos’ and CompX’s operating facilities develops, maintains and implements safety programs encompassing key aspects of their operations. In addition, management reviews and evaluates safety performance throughout the year. 
CompX uses lost time incidents as a key measure of worker safety. CompX defines lost time incidents as work-related accidents where a worker sustains an injury that results in time away from work. CompX had lost time incidents of nil in 2020, one in 2021, and three in 2022. 
Kronos monitors conditions that could lead to a safety incident and keep track of injuries through reporting systems in accordance with laws in the jurisdictions in which it operates. With this data Kronos calculates incident frequency rates to assess the quality of its safety performance. Kronos also tracks overall safety performance at the global level. Each Kronos operating location is subject to local laws and regulations that dictate what injuries are required to be recorded and reported, which may differ from location to location and result in different methods of injury rate calculation. For internal global tracking, benchmarking and identification of opportunities for improvement, Kronos collects the location specific information and applies a U.S.-based injury rate calculation to arrive at a global total frequency rate, which is expressed as the number of incidents at its operating locations per 200,000 hours. This internal safety metric may not be directly comparable to a recordable incident rate calculated under U.S. law. Kronos’ global total frequency rate was 1.61 in 2020 (1.54 of the aggregate represents employees only), 1.08 in 2021(0.90 of the aggregate represents employees only) and 1.01 in 2022 (0.86 of the aggregate represents employees only).
Diversity and inclusion - We recognize that everyone deserves respect and equal treatment. Kronos and CompX embrace diversity and collaboration in their workforces and business initiatives. Kronos and CompX are equal opportunity employers and base employment decisions on merit, competence and qualifications, without regard to race, color, national origin, gender, age, religion, disability, sex, sexual orientation or other characteristics protected by applicable law in the jurisdictions in which they operate. Kronos and CompX promote a respectful, diverse and inclusive workplace in which all individuals are treated with respect and dignity.
