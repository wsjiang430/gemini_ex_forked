ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Our Company
WEX Inc. is a global leader in payment solutions, which began operations in 1983 as a Maine corporation where we continue to be headquartered. Over the past 35 years, we have simplified the complexities of payment systems across continents and industries. We incorporated in Delaware on February 16, 2005 (NYSE:WEX). 
We currently operate in three business segments: Fleet Solutions, Travel and Corporate Solutions, and Health and Employee Benefit Solutions, which are described in more detail below. The Company’s U.S. operations include WEX Inc. and our wholly-owned subsidiaries WEX Bank, WEX FleetOne, EFS and WEX Health. Our international operations include our wholly-owned operations, WEX Fuel Cards Australia, WEX Prepaid Cards Australia, WEX Canada, WEX New Zealand, WEX Asia, WEX Europe Limited, UNIK and a controlling interest in WEX Europe Services Limited and its subsidiaries.
WEX Bank, a Utah industrial bank incorporated in 1998, is a FDIC insured depository institution. The functions performed at WEX Bank contribute to the U.S. and Canadian operations of Fleet Solutions and the majority of operations of Travel and Corporate Solutions by providing a funding mechanism, among other services. With our ownership of WEX Bank, we have access to low-cost sources of capital. WEX Bank raises capital primarily through the issuance of brokered deposit accounts and provides the financing and makes credit decisions that enable the Fleet Solutions and Travel and Corporate Solutions segments to extend credit to customers. WEX Bank approves customer applications, maintains appropriate credit lines for each customer, is the account issuer, and is the counterparty for the customer relationships for most of our programs in the U.S. Operations such as sales, marketing, merchant relations, customer service, software development and IT are performed as a service within our organization

but outside of WEX Bank. WEX Bank’s primary regulators are Utah DFI and the FDIC. The activities performed by WEX Bank are integrated into the operations of our Fleet Solutions and Travel and Corporate Solutions segments. 
Developments
Our growth in the past several years has been primarily organic, supplemented by acquisitions in each of our three business segments: Fleet Solutions, Travel and Corporate Solutions and Health and Employee Benefit Solutions. Our acquisitions over the last five years include: 

• | On January 16, 2019, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Discovery Benefits, an employee benefits administrator, for total cash consideration of approximately $425 million, including $50 million which will be deferred until January of 2020. State Bankshares, Inc., the seller of Discovery Benefits, will also retain a 4.9% equity interest in the entity resulting from the combination of WEX Health and Discovery Benefits. This acquisition will provide our partners and customers with a more comprehensive suite of products and services and opens go-to-market channels to include consulting firms and brokers. The Company closed this transaction on March 5, 2019. 


• | On October 26, 2018, the Company entered into a definitive asset purchase agreement to acquire Chevron’s existing customer portfolio for $223.4 million, including $54.6 million for the carrying value of trade accounts receivable. Conversion of the acquired portfolio onto the Company’s payment processing platform started in the first quarter of 2019.


• | On October 22, 2018, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Noventis, an electronic payments network focused on optimizing payment delivery for bills and invoices to commercial entities, for approximately $310 million. This acquisition will expand our reach as a corporate payments supplier and provide more channels to billing aggregators and financial institutions. The Company closed on this transaction on January 24, 2019.


• | On October 18, 2017, we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of AOC, a provider of commercial payments technology, in order to broaden our capabilities, increase our pool of employees with payments platform experience and allow us to evolve with the needs of our customers and partners through the use of AOC’s payments processing technology platforms.


• | On July 1, 2016, we acquired EFS, a provider of customized payment solutions for fleet and corporate customers with a focus on the large and mid-sized over-the-road fleets, in order to expand our customer footprint and utilize EFS’s technology to better serve the needs of our fleet customers.


• | On November 18, 2015, our wholly-owned subsidiary Evolution1 acquired Benaissance, a provider of integrated SaaS technologies and services for COBRA and healthcare premium billing, payment and workflow management, to complement our healthcare payments products and services.


• | On August 31, 2015, we acquired the remaining 49 percent ownership in UNIK, a majority-owned subsidiary prior to this transaction.


• | On December 1, 2014, our majority owned subsidiary, WEX Europe Services Limited, acquired the assets of ExxonMobil’s European commercial fuel card program, which includes operations, funding, pricing, sales and marketing in nine countries in Europe.


• | On July 16, 2014, we acquired Evolution1, a provider of financial technology platform solutions within the healthcare industry.

Competition 
We have a strong competitive position in each of our segments. Our product features and extensive account management services are key factors behind our position in the fleet industry. We face competition in all of our segments. Our competitors vie with us for prospective direct fleet customers as well as for companies with which to form strategic relationships. We compete with companies that perform payment and transaction processing or similar services. Financial institutions that issue Visa, MasterCard and American Express credit and charge cards currently compete primarily with our Fleet Solutions and Travel and Corporate Solutions segments. We also compete with other healthcare payment service providers.
The most significant competitive factors include the breadth of features offered, functionality, servicing capability and price. For more information regarding risks related to competition, see the information in Item 1A, under the heading “Our industry continues to become increasingly competitive, which makes it more challenging for us to maintain profit margins at historical levels.”

We believe the following strengths distinguish us from our competitors: 

• | Our proprietary closed-loop fuel networks in the U.S. and Australia are among the largest in each country. We describe our fleet payment processing networks as “closed-loop” because we have a direct contractual relationship with both the merchant and the fleet, and only WEX transactions can be processed on these networks. We have built networks that management estimates to provide coverage to over 90 percent of fuel locations in the U.S. and Australia, as well as wide acceptance in Europe and Brazil. This provides our customers with the convenience of broad acceptance.


• | Our proprietary closed-loop fuel networks provide us with access to a higher level of fleet-specific information and control as compared to what is typically available on an open-loop network. This provides high-level purchase controls at the point-of-sale, including the flexibility of allowing fleets to restrict purchases and receive automated alerts. Additionally, we have the ability to refine the information reporting provided to our fleet customers and customers of our strategic relationships.


• | We offer a differentiated set of products and services, including security and purchase controls, to allow our customers and the customers of our strategic relationships to better manage their vehicle fleets. We provide customized analysis and reporting on the efficiency of fleet vehicles and the purchasing behavior of fleet vehicle drivers. We make this data available to fleet customers through both traditional reporting services and sophisticated web-based data analytics tools.


• | Our long-standing strategic relationships, multi-year contracts and high contract renewal rates have contributed to the stability and recurring nature of our revenue base. We believe that we offer a compelling value to our customers relative to our competitors given the breadth and quality of our products and services and our deep understanding of our customers’ operational needs. We have a large installed customer base, with more than 12.4 million vehicles serviced as of December 31, 2018 and co-branded strategic relationships with five of the largest U.S. fleet management providers and with dozens of oil companies that use our private label solutions. Our wide site acceptance, together with our private-label portfolios and value-added product and service offerings, drive high customer satisfaction levels, with a U.S. fleet retention rate in excess of 97 percent (based on the 2018 rate of voluntary customer attrition).


• | Our capabilities in the over-the-road segment of the market enhance our ability to serve fleet customers who operate both heavy duty trucks and cars or light duty vehicles in the U.S. and Canada as well as to blend the small fleet and private label businesses for greater scale. The July 2016 acquisition of EFS expanded our customer footprint within the over-the-road market segment.


• | Our purchase of ExxonMobil’s commercial fuel card program, which uses a closed-loop network in Europe, combined with the long term supply agreement to serve the current and future European Fleet business, provides us with a strong foundation in the large European fleet market.


• | Our travel and corporate payment products offer corporate customers enhanced security and control for complex payment needs, while the addition of the EFS Corporate Payment Solutions set of products expands our presence into the electronic accounts payable segment of the market. Our strategic relationships include four of the largest online travel agencies in the world. We continue to expand our online travel payment solution capabilities and geographies, which currently include North America, Europe, South America and Asia-Pacific. As of December 31, 2018, we settle transactions in over 20 different currencies.


• | The demand for our payment processing, account servicing and transaction processing services combined with significant operating scale has historically driven strong revenue growth and earnings potential. We have an extensive history of organic revenue growth driven by our various marketing channels, our extensive network of fuel and service providers, and our growth in transaction volume. Further, we have completed a number of strategic acquisitions to expand our product and service offerings, which have contributed to our revenue growth and diversification of our products and services.


• | WEX Health has become a leading provider of cloud-based healthcare payments technology, through the acquisition of Evolution1 in 2014 and Benaissance in 2015. Our large partner network expands our opportunities in the growing healthcare financial technology platform market. WEX Health benefits from both high retention rates and revenue predictability as a result of its SaaS business model.


• | We have an enterprise-wide risk management program that helps us identify and manage inherent risks related to our liquidity, extension of credit and interest rates. Our ownership of WEX Bank provides us with access to low cost sources of capital, which provide liquidity to fund our short-term card receivables. We have maintained a long record of low credit losses due to the short-term, non-revolving credit issued to our customer base. Our credit risk management program is enhanced by our proprietary scoring models, managing credit lines and early suspension policy. Interest rate risk is

5

managed through diversified funding sources at WEX Bank including interest bearing money market deposits and certificates of deposit with varying maturities. Some of our merchant contracts include some ability to raise rates if interest rates rise.

• | We have an experienced and committed management team that has substantial industry knowledge and a proven track record of financial success. The team has been successful in driving strong growth with consistent operating performance. We believe that our management team positions us well to continue successfully implementing our growth strategy and capturing operating efficiencies.

Strategy 
The Company’s performance during the year ended December 31, 2018, was shaped by the following previously established strategic priorities:  

• | Drive continued growth. We seek to capture organic growth opportunities across our segments through our product excellence, marketing capabilities, sales force productivity, and revenue management practices. Our acquisition strategy will complement our organic growth by enhancing scale and adding differentiation to our current offerings. 

During 2018, we continued to experience strong organic revenue growth. Additionally, during October 2018, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Noventis, which we expect will expand our reach as a corporate payments supplier and provide more channels to billing aggregators and financial institutions. The Company also entered into a definitive asset purchase agreement to acquire Chevron’s existing trade accounts receivable and customer portfolio during October 2018 in connection with a 2016 agreement with Chevron to issue and operate branded commercial fleet cards.

• | Lead through superior technology. We have built and differentiate ourselves in the marketplace on a distinctive set of technologies across our segments. As our markets continue to evolve, our ability to quickly and cost effectively innovate and deliver superior technological solutions continue to set us apart from our peers. 

During 2018, we adopted a cloud first development process and began migrating our fleet technology platform to a secure private cloud. In addition, we have begun migrating our U.S. travel operations onto an internal cloud-based virtual card platform that we acquired as part of the AOC acquisition.
We expect that these moves to the cloud will allow us to improve performance and stability, increase the pace of product development and eventually deliver cost savings.

• | Set standard for operational excellence. We stand apart in our segments by reliably delivering the best solutions to our partners and customers. We are continually optimizing our cost structure and capturing new revenue synergies across our lines of business. Gains in operational efficiency simplify our business, making us more nimble to capture market opportunities as they arise. 


• | Leveraging our culture to attract and retain the best employees. The Company was certified as a Great Place to Work® in the U.S. in both 2018 and 2017 by Great Place to Work®. During 2018, the Company launched the WEX Compassion Fund, which will support WEX employees with grants designed to alleviate financial stress from qualified, personal disasters. The fund will be administered by the WEX Cares Foundation, Inc., a separate non-profit entity that was established for this purpose.

FLEET SOLUTIONS SEGMENT 
Overview
Our Fleet Solutions segment is a leader in fleet vehicle payment processing services specifically designed for the needs of small business, large fleets, government fleets and over-the-road carriers. As of December 31, 2018, over 12.4 million vehicles use our payment solutions for fleet management.
Products and Services 
Payment processing transactions are the primary revenue source in Fleet Solutions and are based on a percentage of the aggregate dollar amount of the customer’s purchase, a fixed amount per transaction or a combination of both. In a domestic payment processing transaction, we extend short-term credit to the fleet cardholder and pay the merchant on average within ten days for the purchase price, less the fees we retain and record as revenue. Revenue from our WEX Europe Services operations is primarily 
6

derived from the difference between the negotiated price of the fuel from the supplier and the price charged to the fleet customer. In both types of transactions, we collect the total purchase price from the fleet customer, normally within 30 days from the billing date. In 2018, we processed approximately 459 million payment processing transactions, compared to 430 million payment processing transactions in 2017.    
The following illustration depicts our business process for a typical closed-loop domestic fuel payment processing transaction and a breakdown of the related Fleet Solutions revenue streams:
At the point-of-sale, we identify an array of information including the amount of the expenditure, the driver, the vehicle, the odometer reading, the fuel or vehicle maintenance provider and the items purchased. We provide standard and customized information to customers through monthly vehicle analysis reports, custom reports and our websites. We also alert customers of unusual transactions or transactions that fall outside of pre-established parameters. Customers can access their account information through our website including account history and recent transactions and download the related details. In addition, fleet managers can elect to be notified by email when limits are exceeded in specified purchase categories, including limits on transactions within a time range and gallons per day. 
In the over-the-road space, we offer customizable payment solutions including real-time interactive interfaces delivering data integrity through a seamless user interface, alternative payment and money transfer options, comprehensive settlement solutions, real-time reports and analytics for compliance and cost-optimization and fuel reconciliation and mobile optimization tools.
In addition to revenue derived from payment processing transactions, we recognize account servicing revenue, finance fee revenue and other revenue through the following products and services: 

• | Customer service, account activation and account retention: We offer customer service, account activation and account retention services to fleets and fleet management companies and the fuel and vehicle maintenance providers on our network. Our services include promoting the adoption and use of our products and programs and account retention programs on behalf of our customers and partners.


• | Authorization and billing inquiries and account maintenance: We handle authorization and billing questions, account changes and other issues for fleets through our dedicated customer contact centers, which are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Fleet customers also have self-service options available to them through our websites.


• | Premium fleet services: We assign designated account managers to businesses and government agencies with large fleets. These representatives have in-depth knowledge of both our programs and the operations and objectives of the fleets they service.


• | Credit and collections services: We have developed proprietary account approval, credit management and fraud detection programs. Our underwriting model produces a proprietary score, which we use to predict the likelihood of an account becoming delinquent within 12 months of activation. We also use a credit maintenance model to manage ongoing accounts, which helps us to predict the likelihood of account delinquency over an ongoing 18-month time horizon. We have developed

7

a collections scoring model that we use to rank and prioritize past due accounts for collection activities. We also employ fraud specialists who monitor accounts, alert customers and provide case management expertise to minimize losses and reduce program abuse. 

• | Merchant services: Our representatives work with fuel and vehicle maintenance providers to enroll these providers in our network, test all network and terminal software and hardware, and to provide training on our sale, transaction authorization and settlement processes.


• | ClearView analytics platform: We provide customers with access to a web-based data analytics platform that offers insights to fleet managers, including integrating and analyzing business fleet fuel purchases to uncover fraud, manage product type controls and identify cost saving opportunities.


• | SmartHub mobile app: This mobile application gives business managers access to their account information anytime and anywhere, including the ability to view and make bill payments, access transaction details and control the status of driver fuel cards. As a result, this offering helps customers improve efficiencies, reduce late fees, gain valuable insights and control unauthorized driver spending.

Marketing Channels 
We market our fleet products and services both directly and indirectly to commercial and government vehicle fleet customers with small, medium and large fleets, and over-the-road, long haul fleets. Our product suite includes payment processing and transaction processing services, WEX branded fleet cards in North America and Motorpass/Motorcharge-branded fleet cards in Australia. As of December 31, 2018, our direct line of business serviced 4.4 million vehicles. As of the same period, our over-the-road line of business serviced 1.1 million vehicles, marketed under the EFS, EFS Transportation Services, T-Chek and Fleet One brands. 
We also market our products and services indirectly through co-branded and private label relationships. With a co-branded relationship product, we market our products and services for, and in collaboration with, both fuel providers and fleet management companies using their brand names and our logo on a co-branded fleet card. These companies seek to offer our payment processing and information management services as a component of their total offering to their fleet customers. As of December 31, 2018, our co-branded marketing channel serviced 2.4 million vehicles. 
Our private label programs market our products and services for, and in collaboration with, fuel retailers, using only their brand names. The fuel retailers with which we have formed strategic relationships offer our payment processing and information management products and services to their fleet customers in order to establish and enhance customer loyalty. These fleets use these products and services to purchase fuel at locations of the fuel retailer with whom we have the private label relationship. As of December 31, 2018, our private label marketing channel serviced 4.5 million vehicles. 
TRAVEL AND CORPORATE SOLUTIONS SEGMENT 
Overview
Our Travel and Corporate Solutions segment provides innovative corporate purchasing and payment capabilities that can be integrated with our customers’ internal systems to streamline their corporate payments, accounts payable and reconciliation processes. 
Products and Services 
The Travel and Corporate Solutions segment allows businesses to centralize purchasing, simplify complex supply chain processes and eliminate the paper check writing associated with traditional purchase order programs. Our product suite includes electronic payments and corporate cards offered across travel, insurance & warranty and other industries. 
Our electronic payments product includes virtual payments and integrated payables. Our virtual payments program is used for transactions where no physical card is presented, including transactions conducted over the telephone, by mail, by fax or on the Internet or for transactions that require pre-authorization, such as hotel reservations. Under our virtual payments program, each transaction is assigned a unique account number with a customized credit limit and expiration date. These controls are in place to limit fraud and unauthorized spending. The unique account number limits purchase amounts and tracks, settles and reconciles purchases more easily, creating efficiencies and cost savings for our customers. Our electronic accounts payable solution is a cloud-based web platform that manages and optimizes all accounts payable disbursements, regardless of type. Automated clearing house, virtual cards, electronic funds transfer and check payments are streamlined and automated through our centralized application.

We offer a variety of corporate cards, designed to combine all of a customer’s purchasing needs into a single integrated card, streamline the procure-to-pay process with a single card and control travel and entertainment spending and provide employees with greater flexibility.
Additionally, WEX Prepaid Card Australia offers prepaid and gift card products, which provide secure payment and financial management solutions with single card options, access to open or closed loop redemption, load limits and variable expirations.
The following illustration depicts our business process for a typical travel virtual card product transaction:
 1  Guest books a hotel through a travel website owned by an online travel company
 2  Online travel company reserves room at hotel through reservation system using a WEX VCN to reserve the room 
 3  Upon checkout, hotel authorizes payment using the WEX VPN
 4  The WEX virtual card restricts charge to predetermined cost of room, incidental expenses are paid for by guest
 5  Online travel company pays WEX. WEX earns fee by retaining percentage of the online travel company reimbursement payment
Marketing Channels 
We market our Travel and Corporate Solutions segment products and services both directly and indirectly to new and existing customers. Our products are marketed to commercial and government organizations and we use existing open-loop networks. 
HEALTH AND EMPLOYEE BENEFIT SOLUTIONS SEGMENT 
Overview
Our Health and Employee Benefit Solutions segment is comprised of our healthcare payment products and SaaS platforms with which we provide simplified payment capabilities in a complex healthcare market as well as employee benefit products in Brazil. 
Products and Services 
With our healthcare payment products, we provide consumer-directed payments in the complex healthcare market. We partner with employers, health plans, third-party administrators, financial institutions, payroll companies and the public sector to provide a SaaS product to support healthcare benefit programs and administer COBRA, flexible spending, health saving and reimbursement accounts, and other healthcare related employee and dependent benefits. 
We currently have relationships with approximately 343,000 employers, reaching 28 million consumers. Revenue is generated primarily from SaaS based monthly fees to partners and interchange fees from spending on customer debit cards issued under flexible spending, health savings and reimbursement accounts. Cards are branded with either Visa or MasterCard and operate on a restricted open loop network.
Our benefit products are offered through our wholly-owned subsidiary, WEX Latin America. Employees using our benefit products have access to salary advances payable in up to 24 monthly installments which are secured by future salary earnings. These advances are funded primarily through securitization of the corresponding receivables.
Health and Employee Benefit Solutions segment revenues are generated primarily from platform usage subscription fees and interchange fees from spending on the WEX Health payment cards.
The following illustration depicts our business process and parties involved in our health care benefits solution:

BPO: Business Process Outsourcing
Marketing Channels 
We market our Health and Employee Benefit Solutions products and services to consumers through an extensive partner network, which includes health plans, third-party administrators, financial institutions, payroll companies and software providers. Our employee benefit products are marketed to consumers through employers in Brazil.
OTHER ITEMS 
Employees 
As of December 31, 2018, WEX Inc. and its subsidiaries had more than 3,700 employees, of which approximately 3,000 were located in the United States. None of our U.S.-based employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. In Europe, certain employees are members of trade unions or works councils. In Brazil, certain employees are members of unions. The Company believes that its relations with its employees, unions and work councils are generally satisfactory. 
Technology 
We believe that investment in technology is crucial in maintaining and enhancing our competitive position in the marketplace. Our data center network and infrastructure is supported by secure data centers with redundant locations. We have data centers in various locations in the United States including South Portland, Maine and Aurora, Colorado. We also have data centers and infrastructure located in various locations throughout Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Brazil. 
Our fleet fuel-based closed-loop proprietary platforms capture detailed information from the fuel and maintenance locations within our network. Operating a proprietary network not only enhances our value proposition, it also enables us to limit dependence on third-party processors and to respond rapidly to changing customer needs with system upgrades, while maintaining a more secure environment than an open-loop network typically allows. Our virtual card open-loop network uses internally developed software and third-party processors. Our infrastructure has been designed around industry-standard architectures to reduce downtime in the event of outages or catastrophic occurrences. At WEX Health, we maintain an integrated multi-account payment platform, including a mobile application. In Australia, New Zealand, Brazil and the United Kingdom, we use standalone platforms to support operations. 
10

Our secure networks are designed to isolate our databases from unauthorized access. We use security protocols among all applications, and our employees access critical components on a need-to-know basis. As of December 31, 2018, we have not experienced any material incidents in network, application or data security. We are continually improving our technology to enhance customer relationships and to increase efficiency and security. We also review technologies and services provided by others in order to maintain the high level of service expected by our customers and continue to invest in our infrastructure. 
For information regarding technology related risks, see the information in Item 1A under the headings “Our business is regularly subject to cyberattacks and attempted security and privacy breaches and we may not be able to adequately protect our information systems, including the data we collect about our customers, which could subject us to liability and damage our reputation”, “Our failure to effectively implement new technology could jeopardize our position as a leader in our industry,” “We are dependent on technology systems and electronic communications networks managed by third parties, which could result in our inability to prevent service disruptions” and “If the technologies we use in operating our business and interacting with our customers fail, are unavailable, or do not operate to expectations, or we fail to successfully implement technology strategies and capabilities in connection with our outsourcing arrangements, our business and results of operation could be adversely impacted.”
Seasonality
Our businesses are affected by seasonal variations. For example, fuel prices are typically higher during the summer and online travel sales are typically higher during the third quarter. In addition, we experience seasonality in our Health and Employee Benefit Solutions segment as consumer spend is correlated with insurance deductibles, typically resulting in higher spend in the early part of the year and until employees meet their deductibles.
Intellectual Property 
We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, confidentiality procedures, contractual provisions and other similar measures to protect the proprietary information and technology used in our business. We generally enter into agreements with clients, consultants, service providers and other partners, whether current or prospective, that contain provisions restricting use and disclosure of our proprietary information and technology. Operationally, we have implemented certain safeguards designed to control access to and distribution of our proprietary information and technology. Despite these efforts, unauthorized parties may attempt to access or use our proprietary information and technology, and third parties may develop similar and/or competing technology independently. We pursue registration and protection of certain trademarks in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate or plan to operate. We market our products and services using the WEX brand name globally, as well as other brand names such as Fleet One, EFS and WEX Health Cloud in the U.S., and Motorpass in Australia. 
Regulation - United States 
The Company and its affiliates are subject to certain state and federal laws and regulations, which govern insured depository institutions and their affiliates as well as our operations in the healthcare market. WEX Bank is subject to supervision and examination by both the Utah DFI and the FDIC. The Company and its affiliates are subject to certain limitations on transactions with affiliates set forth in the FRA. The Company is subject to anti-tying provisions in the Bank Holding Company Act. State and Federal laws and regulations limit the loans WEX Bank may make to one borrower and the types of investments WEX Bank may make. 
Below is a description of the material elements of the laws, regulations, policies and other regulatory matters affecting the operations of WEX in the United States. 
Exemption from Certain Requirements of the Bank Holding Company Act 
As an industrial bank organized under the laws of Utah that does not accept demand deposits that may be withdrawn by check or similar means, WEX Bank meets the criteria for exemption from the definition of “bank” under the Bank Holding Company Act. As a result, the Company is generally, except as stated above, not subject to the Bank Holding Company Act. 
Restrictions on Intercompany Borrowings and Transactions 
Sections 23A and 23B of the FRA and the implementing regulations limit the extent to which the Company can borrow or otherwise obtain credit from or engage in other “covered transactions” with WEX Bank. “Covered transactions” include loans or extensions of credit, purchases of or investments in securities, purchases of assets, including assets subject to an agreement to repurchase, acceptance of securities as collateral for a loan or extension of credit, or the issuance of a guarantee, acceptance, or letter of credit. Although the applicable rules do not serve as an outright ban on engaging in “covered transactions,” they do limit the amount of covered transactions WEX Bank may have with any one affiliate and with all affiliates in the aggregate. The applicable rules also require that the Company engage in such transactions with WEX Bank only on terms and under circumstances that are substantially the same, or at least as favorable to WEX Bank, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with 
11

nonaffiliated companies. Furthermore, with certain exceptions, each loan or extension of credit by WEX Bank to the Company or its other affiliates must be secured by collateral with a market value ranging from 100 percent to 130 percent of the amount of the loan or extension of credit, depending on the type of collateral. 
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 
The Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB to regulate the offering of consumer financial products or services under the federal consumer financial laws. In addition, the CFPB was granted general authority to prevent covered persons or service providers from committing or engaging in unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices under federal law in connection with any transaction with a consumer for a consumer financial product or service. The CFPB has broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws. The legislation also gives the state attorneys general the ability to enforce applicable federal consumer protection laws. 
In addition, the Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act provided that interchange fees that a card issuer or payment network receives or charges for debit transactions will now be regulated by the Federal Reserve and must be “reasonable and proportional” to the cost incurred by the card issuer in authorizing, clearing and settling the transaction. Payment network fees may not be used directly or indirectly to compensate card issuers in circumvention of the interchange transaction fee restrictions. In July 2011, the Federal Reserve published the final rules governing debit interchange fees. Effective in October 2011, with certain exemptions, debit interchange rates were capped at $0.21 per transaction with an additional component of five basis points of the transaction’s value to reflect a portion of the issuer’s fraud losses plus, for qualifying issuing financial institutions, an additional $0.01 per transaction in debit interchange for fraud prevention costs.
On January 25, 2018, the CFPB released final amendments to its October 5, 2016 final rule amending Regulations E and Z to create comprehensive consumer protections for prepaid financial products. Among other things, the rule establishes requirements for the treatment of funds on lost or stolen cards, error resolution and investigation, upfront fee disclosures, access to account information, and overdraft features if offered in conjunction with prepaid accounts. The rule becomes effective on April 1, 2019. 
Brokered Deposits 
Under FDIC regulations, depending upon their capital classification, banks may be restricted in their ability to accept brokered deposits. “Well capitalized” banks are permitted to accept brokered deposits, but banks that are not “well capitalized” are not permitted to accept such deposits. The FDIC may, on a case-by-case basis, permit banks that are “adequately capitalized” to accept brokered deposits if the FDIC determines that acceptance of such deposits would not constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice. 
Other Financial Regulatory Requirements 
WEX Bank must monitor and report unusual or suspicious account activity, as well as transactions involving amounts in excess of prescribed limits, as required by the Bank Secrecy Act and Internal Revenue Service regulations. The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 substantially broadened the scope of U.S. anti-money laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant new compliance and due diligence obligations, identifying new crimes and penalties and expanding the extra-territorial jurisdiction of the United States. The United States Treasury Department has proposed and, in some cases, issued a number of implementing regulations which impose obligations on financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies, procedures and controls to detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the identity of their customers. Certain of those regulations impose specific due diligence requirements on financial institutions that maintain correspondent or private banking relationships with non-U.S. financial institutions or persons. For instance, in August 2018, new due diligence requirements established by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network became effective, requiring financial institutions to adopt enhanced anti-money laundering procedures for purposes of determining the control and ownership stakes of business customers. Failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution. 
The U.S. federal government has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals and others. These sanctions, which are administered by the OFAC, take many different forms but generally include one or more of the following elements: (i) restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country, including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on “U.S. persons” engaging in financial transactions relating to making investments in, or providing investment-related advice or assistance to, a sanctioned country; and (ii) a blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest, by prohibiting transfers of property subject to U.S. jurisdiction (including property in the possession or control of U.S. persons). Blocked assets (for example, property and bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences.

Under the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999, also referred to as the “Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act” (or “GLBA”), the Company and WEX Bank are required to maintain a comprehensive written information security program that includes administrative, technical and physical safeguards relating to customer information. However, this requirement does not generally apply to information about companies or about individuals who obtain financial products or services for business, commercial, or agricultural purposes. The GLBA also requires the Company and WEX Bank to provide initial and annual privacy notices to customers that describe in general terms their information sharing practices. If the Company and WEX Bank intend to share nonpublic personal information about customers with affiliates and/or nonaffiliated third parties, they must provide customers with a notice and a reasonable period of time for each consumer to “opt out” of any such disclosure. In addition to U.S. federal privacy laws, states also have adopted statutes, regulations and other measures governing the collection and distribution of nonpublic personal information about customers. In some cases these state measures are preempted by federal law, but if not, the Company and WEX Bank must monitor and comply with such laws in the conduct of its business. 
Escheat Laws
We are subject to unclaimed or abandoned property state laws in the United States and in certain foreign countries that require us to transfer to certain government authorities the unclaimed property of others that we hold when that property has been unclaimed for a certain period of time. Moreover, we are subject to audit by state and foreign regulatory authorities with regard to our escheatment practices.
Restrictions on Dividends 
WEX Bank is subject to various regulatory requirements relating to the payment of dividends, including requirements to maintain capital above regulatory minimums. A banking regulator may determine that the payment of dividends would be inappropriate and could prohibit payment. Further, WEX Bank may not pay a dividend if it is undercapitalized or would become undercapitalized as a result of paying the dividend. Utah law permits WEX Bank to pay dividends out of the net profits of the industrial bank after providing for all expenses, losses, interest, and taxes accrued or due, but if WEX Bank’s surplus account is less than 100 percent of its capital stock, WEX Bank must transfer up to 10 percent of its net profits to the surplus account prior to the payment of any dividends. 
 Company Obligations to WEX Bank 
Any non-deposit obligation of WEX Bank to the Company is subordinate, in right of payment, to deposits and other indebtedness of WEX Bank. In the event of the Company’s bankruptcy, any commitment by the Company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of WEX Bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment. 
Restrictions on Ownership of WEX Inc. Common Stock 
WEX Bank, and therefore the Company, is subject to bank regulations that impose requirements on entities that might control WEX Bank through control of the Company. These requirements are discussed in Item 1A under the heading “If any entity controls 10 percent or more of our common stock and such entity has caused a violation of applicable banking laws by its failure to obtain any required approvals prior to acquiring that common stock, we have the power to, and may be required to, restrict such entity’s ability to vote shares held by it.” 
Healthcare Regulation
The federal and state governments in the U.S. continue to enact and consider many broad-based legislative and regulatory proposals that could materially impact various aspects of our health-related business. The plans that our partners administer feature consumer accounts that pay for out-of-pocket expenses incurred by employees and qualified dependents. These accounts include CDH accounts such as HSAs, FSAs and HRAs, as well as wellness incentives, commuter benefits, and other account-based arrangements. Most of these accounts are tax-advantaged under the appropriate law. 
Employers are continuing to use CDH approaches to manage the rate of increase in healthcare expenditures and to enable employees to make decisions about the use of their healthcare savings. CDH programs provide consumers with visibility of and control over payment for healthcare expenses.
The products that WEX Health’s software and payment solutions support are subject to various state and federal laws, including the Affordable Care Act, and regulations promulgated by the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Labor, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and similar state laws. As such, changes in the status of tax-advantaged CDH accounts could affect the attractiveness of these products.

In addition to tax-related regulation, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively referred to as “Health Care Reform”) mandated broad changes affecting insured and self-insured health benefit plans that impact our current business model, including our relationships with current and future customers, producers and health care providers, products, services, processes and technology. Health Care Reform left many details to be established through regulations. While federal agencies have published proposed and final regulations with respect to most provisions, some issues remain uncertain. The 2017 Tax Act repealed certain provisions of Health Care Reform, including reducing to zero the tax penalty for individuals who decline to obtain Health Care Reform-compliant healthcare coverage. The current U.S. Administration has signaled its desire to significantly modify or completely repeal Health Care Reform and the associated implementing regulations. It is unclear what, if any, additional legislative or regulatory actions may be taken in this regard. Accordingly, there may be an extended period of uncertainty and unpredictability in the U.S. health care market, which may materially affect the availability and cost of health coverage, the viability of health care providers and health benefit plans, the proportion of persons in the U.S. who have health insurance; the distribution between privately funded and government funded health insurance; and the future demand for, and profitability of, the offerings of our health-related business under our current business model.
In connection with the processing of data, we frequently undertake or are subject to specific compliance obligations under privacy and data security-related laws, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, GLBA, and similar state and federal laws governing the collection, use, protection and disclosure of nonpublic personally identifiable information, including individually identifiable health information.
HIPAA and its implementing regulations, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or the HITECH Act, impose requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HIPAA, as amended by the HITECH Act, and its implementing regulations, subjects us to regulations and contractual obligations that impose privacy and security standards and breach notification and reporting requirements. 
In addition to tax, federal data privacy, security laws and regulations, we are subject to state laws governing confidentiality and security of personally identifiable information and additional state-imposed breach notification and reporting requirements.
