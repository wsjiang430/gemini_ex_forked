ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Overview and History
BGSF, Inc. (“BGSF,” “we,” or the “Company”) is a leading national provider of consulting, managed services, and professional workforce solutions with continuing operations that, along with its wholly owned subsidiaries, operate primarily within the U.S. in two industry segments Real Estate and Professional, with discontinued operations in the Light Industrial segment. We provide field talent to a variety of client partners that are seeking to match their workforce requirements to their business needs. Our client partners operate across a diverse set of industries.
We employ a diverse operating model, both from a skill set and a geographic standpoint, which we believe mitigates downside revenue risk. 
Our workforce solutions consist of on-demand or short-term assignments, consulting services, managed services, and on-site management administration. Short-term workforce solutions assist employers in dealing with field talent demands caused by such factors as seasonality, fluctuations in client partner demand, vacations, illnesses, parental leave, and special projects without incurring the ongoing expense and administrative responsibilities associated with recruiting, hiring and retaining permanent field talent. As more and more companies focus on effectively managing variable costs and reducing fixed overhead, the use of short-term workforce solutions allows companies to utilize a contingent approach for their personnel needs, thereby converting a portion of their fixed personnel costs to a variable expense.
Our consulting workforce solutions place field talent with client partners for extended time-periods or for an indefinite time period. This type of arrangement may involve outsourcing an entire department in a large corporation or providing the workforce for a large project. 
Managed services are a combination of both workforce solutions and fixed fee arrangements. Field talent is placed with the client partner and services are performed over a given period of time as determined with the client partner. Generally services are provided under a contractual agreement.
In an on-site management arrangement, we place an experienced manager on-site at a client partner’s place of business. The manager is responsible for conducting all recruiting, candidate screening, interviewing, drug testing, hiring and placement for field talent at the client partner’s facility for a long-term or indefinite period.
Management believes that these solutions and the field talent performing these workforce solutions are, and will remain, an integral part of the labor market in local, regional and national economies in which we operate. 
BGSF, Inc. is the successor by conversion to LTN Staffing, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company that was formed on August 27, 2007. In 2011, we began doing business as BG Staffing. LTN Staffing, LLC converted into a Delaware corporation, BG Staffing, Inc., following the merger of LTN Acquisition, LLC (the former parent of LTN Staffing, LLC) with and into LTN Staffing, LLC. The conversion was completed on November 3, 2013. In 2021, we changed our name to BGSF, Inc.
We commenced operations on October 17, 2007 and since 2009 have began an on-going growth and diversification initiative. Since 2010, we have acquired thirteen businesses:
•In June 2010, we purchased the interests of BG Personnel Services, LP and BG Personnel, LP, and purchased the common stock of B G Staff Services, Inc. Shortly after the purchase, we relocated our home office to Dallas, Texas. We operate under the BG Multifamily and BG Talent trade names.

We continue to operate under the Horn Solutions trade names.
On March 21, 2022, we completed the sale to Sentech Engineering Services, Inc. of substantially all of the assets pertaining to our Light Industrial segment. The Light Industrial segment provided field talent primarily to manufacturing, distribution, logistics, and call center client partners needing a flexible workforce and operated under the “InStaff” trade name. 

Instaff's financial results for periods prior to the sale have been reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as discontinued operations. Additionally, the related assets and liabilities associated with the discontinued operations in the prior periods are classified as discontinued operations in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
See “Note 4 - Discontinued Operations” in our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information.
We now operate across 46 states and D.C. We do not currently have any significant foreign operations.
Our Industry
The workforce solution industry supplies field talent to client partners helping them minimize the cost and effort of workforce planning. These workforce solutions also enable the client partner to rapidly respond to changes in business conditions, and in some cases to convert fixed labor costs to variable costs. Workforce solution companies act as intermediaries in matching available field talent to client partner assignments. The demand for a flexible workforce continues to grow with competitive and economic pressures to reduce costs and respond to changing market conditions.
The workforce solution market is subject to volatility based on overall economic conditions. Historically, in periods of economic growth, the number of companies providing workforce solutions has increased due to low barriers to entry. During recessionary periods, the number of companies has decreased through consolidation, bankruptcies, or other events. The workforce solution industry is experiencing increased demand in relation to total job growth as client partners have placed a greater priority on maintaining a more flexible workforce.
The workforce solution industry is large and highly fragmented with approximately 25,000 competing companies, while only 186 firms exceeded $100 million in annual revenues during 2021 according to Staffing Industry Analysts (“SIA”). As of September 2022, SIA estimated the 2023 U.S. temporary service market will be an estimated $216.8 billion, which is up from an estimated $212.2 billion in 2022. Workforce solution providers compete both to recruit and retain a supply of field talent and to attract and retain client partners to use these workers. Client partner demand for workforce solutions is dependent on the overall strength of the labor market and trends toward greater workforce flexibility. The workforce solution industry includes a number of markets focusing on business needs that vary widely in duration of assignment and level of technical specialization.
Our Operations
We have diversified our operations to provide field talent within distinct segments of the industry. We refer to our continuing operations as the Real Estate and Professional segments, and discontinuing operations as the Light Industrial segment. 
We operate separate profit centers within each segment and provide managers considerable operational autonomy and financial incentives. Managers focus on business opportunities within their markets and are provided centralized support to achieve success in those markets. We believe this structure allows us to recruit and retain highly motivated managers who have demonstrated the ability to succeed in a competitive environment. This structure also allows managers and team members to focus on market development while relying on centralized services for support in back-office operations, such as risk management programs and unemployment insurance, credit, collections, accounting, advice on legal and regulatory matters, and quality standards.
Our Segments
Our continuing operations are organized into the Real Estate and Professional segments, and our discontinued operations is the Light Industrial segment.
Real Estate Segment
Our Real Estate segment is a leading provider of office and maintenance field talent to various apartment communities and commercial buildings. We currently operate in 36 states and D.C. The Real Estate segment utilizes Virtual Talent Acquisition Center (“TAC”) with team members located in various locations throughout the United States. All open field talent positions nationally are recruited from this TAC. The field talent we assign to our Real Estate client partners are our employees, although our client partners provide on-the-job direction, control and supervision.
Professional Segment
Our Professional segment provides highly skilled IT professionals with expertise in SAP, Workday, Peoplesoft, Hyperion, Oracle, One Stream, cyber, project management and other IT workforce solutions to client partners on a national basis. Additionally, we provide finance, accounting, legal, human resource and related support personnel. Our client partners include large Fortune 500 companies, medium and small companies, as well as consulting firms engaged in systems integration projects. We operate our professional segment remotely and from our offices in Arizona, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, 
Massachusetts, New Jersey, North Carolina, Rhode Island, Tennessee, and Texas. 
Light Industrial Segment
The Light Industrial segment is reported in our financial statements as discontinued operations. See “Note 4 - Discontinued Operations” in our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Financial Information about Segments
Refer to Note 19 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is incorporated by reference.
Financial Information about Geographic Areas
Refer to Notes 1 and 2 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is incorporated by reference.
Our Client Partners
We currently provide workforce solutions to small and medium-sized companies as well as divisions of Fortune 500 companies. As is common in the industry, our engagements to provide workforce solutions to our client partners are generally of a non-exclusive, short-term nature and subject to termination by the client partner with little or no notice. No client partner accounted for more than 10% of our revenues in 2022, 2021, or 2020.
Marketing and Recruiting
We believe a key component of our success is the ability to recruit and maintain a pool of qualified field talent and regularly place them into desirable and appropriate positions. We use comprehensive methods to identify, assess, select and, when appropriate, measure the skills of our field talent and permanent placement candidates to meet the needs of our client partners.
We market our workforce solutions to client partners and field talent candidates via both national and local advertising activities. A significant portion of our total marketing efforts comes from direct marketing via telephone solicitation. Promotions consists of digital display, search engine marketing, social media, trade publications, job boards and events. As well, reputation management is a promotional utility that serves as the first impression; interactions on reviews, comments, posts, direct messages, etc. give our followers a cursory notion of our values and business practices. We market our hiring and career management advice through all digital platforms (websites, social media, and blogs) and have expanded our use of job boards and aggregators in all aspects of sales and recruitment. Joint marketing arrangements have been entered into with major software partners. We actively seek endorsements and affiliations with professional organizations in the accounting and finance, technology, apartment community, commercial building, creative and marketing fields. To enhance public recognition of us and our workforce solutions, we conduct public relations activities and team members and field talent are encouraged to be active in civic organizations and industry trade groups in their local communities.
Growth Strategy

We are committed to growing our operations. We have grown from $35 million of Light Industrial revenue in 2009 to $298 million of revenue from continuing operations in 2022, by using a growth strategy reliant upon both acquisitions and organic growth.
We will continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities utilizing our proven approach to the assessment, valuation, and integration of acquisitions. Additionally, we are committed to continue to grow our operations in our current markets, as well as expand into new markets within the segments and industries that we currently serve.
We are organized to handle many of the administrative functions at our home office location so that our segment operations can focus on business development and the effective recruiting and assignment of field talent.
We continue to invest in technology and process improvements, as necessary, to ensure that we are operating at optimal productivity and performance. In second quarter 2022, we completed the board of directors authorized three year plan to enhance our processes through the information technology improvement project. These workstreams included improvements to applications in front office, middle office, back office, modern workplace, IT infrastructure and project management. 
Competition
The workforce solutions market is highly competitive with limited barriers to entry. We compete in national, regional and local markets with full-service and specialized workforce solution companies. Some of our competitors have significantly more marketing and financial resources than we do. Price competition in the industry is intense. We expect that the level of competition will remain high, which could limit our ability to maintain or increase our market share or profitability.
The principal competitive factors in attracting qualified candidates for assignments are pay rates, availability of assignments, duration of assignments and responsiveness to requests for placement. We believe that many potential candidates seeking assignments through us may also be pursuing assignments through other means. Therefore, the speed at which we place prospective field talent and the availability of appropriate assignments are important factors in our ability to complete assignments of qualified field talent. In addition to having high quality field talent to assign in a timely manner, the principal competitive factors in obtaining and retaining client partners in the workforce solution industry are properly assessing the client partners’ specific job requirements, the appropriateness of the field talent assigned to the client partner, the price of services and the monitoring of client partner satisfaction. Although we believe we compete favorably with respect to these factors, we expect competition to continue to increase.
Seasonality and Other Fluctuations
Our business experiences seasonal fluctuations. Our quarterly operating results are affected by the number of billing days in a quarter, as well as the seasonality of our client partners’ business. Demand for our Real Estate workforce solutions typically increase in the second quarter and is highest during the third quarter of the year due to the increased turns in multifamily units during the summer months when schools are not in session. Overall first quarter demand can be affected by adverse weather conditions in the winter months. In addition, our cost of services typically increases in the first quarter primarily due to the reset of payroll taxes.
The industry has historically been cyclical, often acting as an indicator of both economic downturns and upswings. Client partners tend to use contingent workforce solutions to supplement their existing workforce and generally hire direct workers when long-term demand is expected to increase. As a consequence, our revenues tend to increase quickly when the economy begins to grow and, conversely, our revenues can also decrease quickly when the economy begins to weaken. Historically, demand for permanent placement workforce solutions is even more sensitive to economic and labor market conditions than demand for workforce and consultant solutions and this is expected to continue.
Human Capital
We are a workforce solutions company dedicated to connecting people to work in ways that enrich their lives. At BGSF, we define our purpose by championing the future of people, transforming lives, and positively impacting entire communities. We are more than a transactional business. Our focus is on the big picture. We believe we can be a powerful force for good by connecting people to opportunities that enrich their lives and support their personal and professional development. Embedded in our character is the positive energy we embrace that drives a happy work environment, that shapes a happy home, which cascades into happier communities. We believe small actions can turn into big impacts, creating a ripple that becomes a wave powerful enough to change the world around us. This is what we call The BG Ripple Effect. In order to compete and succeed in our highly competitive and rapidly evolving markets, it is crucial that we attract and retain experienced internal team members, as well as talent to work for our client partners. As part of these efforts, we strive to offer competitive total rewards programs, foster an inclusive and diverse environment, and give team members the opportunity to give back to their communities and make a social impact.
Team Members

As of February 13, 2023, we employed approximately 540 team members working remotely or in our various market locations in the United States. 
Field Talent
In addition to our team members, BGSF matches talent with our client partners. In 2022, we placed approximately 14,500 individuals in positions with our client partners. In significantly all of these instances, we remain the employer of record for substantially all of our talent working at our client partner locations. This means that we retain responsibility for all assignments, wages, benefits, workers’ compensation insurance, and the employers’ share of applicable payroll taxes as well as the administration of the team members' share of these taxes. We also offer our talent access to competitive health and benefit programs while they are working with us.
Compensation and Benefits
BGSF is committed to providing competitive, equitable and fiscally responsible total rewards programs to our team members. Our compensation programs are designed to attract, retain and reward talented individuals who possess the skills necessary to achieve our strategic goals and create long-term value for our shareholders. We provide team members with competitive compensation opportunities, with pay for performance opportunities that include a mix of base salary, commissions, short-term incentives and, in the case of our more senior team members, long-term equity awards. We believe that our programs provide fair and competitive opportunities that align team member and shareholder interests. In addition to cash and equity compensation, we also offer team members competitive benefits such as life and health (medical, dental and vision) insurance, paid time off including volunteer time off, wellness benefits, education/tuition reimbursement, a defined contribution retirement plan with BGSF matching contributions, and an Employee Stock Purchase Plan. 
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
We are committed to fostering an inclusive and diverse workforce. Our responsibility commitment is overseen by executive leadership, along with board-level oversight led by our Nominating and Governance Committee. In September 2020, we formed a diversity, equity and inclusion council called Voices Inspiring Inclusion, Belonging, and Equity (“VIIBE”), which represents broad perspectives across our organization. VIIBE is chaired by our Vice President of Diversity and Development. In August 2022, we launched our first two team member resource groups: African American/Black Employees & Allies and Working Parents and Allies. Later in 2023, we expect to launch our third team member resource group, with the name to be determined. Our team member resource groups are designed to create a strong sense of belonging within our work culture, to provide awareness and gain collaborative support from allies, and to help drive equitable opportunities throughout our organization for all. The essential work of VIIBE has continued to align it's work with the development of foundational pillars of excellence that promote this philosophy. We are focused on how we source, recruit, develop, appreciate, and leverage perspectives and experiences of underrepresented talent. This focus will extend to our collaboration with client partners, selection of vendor partners, engagement in our communities and prioritization of overall work-life harmony. Our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion does not sit with a singular individual, but with every team member at BGSF. BGSF leaders will continue to be provided additional inclusive-leadership growth opportunities, understanding the importance of mitigating biases, as an ongoing effort to shape our future talent pool selections, onboard new talent, and support future career trajectories.
As of October 14, 2022, we employed approximately 3,025 people, of which 14% were internal team members and 86% were field talent supporting our client partners across the country. 
•Women represented 36% of all team members, and underrepresented minorities (“URMs”, defined as those who identify as Black/African American, Hispanic/Latinx, Native American/Alaska Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander and/or two or more races) represented 72% of our all of our reporting team members (3% of team members in contingent roles chose not to disclose this information);
•Women represented 62% of our internal team members and 57% of internal team members in managerial and leadership roles; and
•URMs represent 40% of our internal team members and 21% of internal team members in managerial and leadership roles identified as URMs.
Our focus is to ensure BGSF is cultivating equality and equity, while recognizing and celebrating our differences at work, in our homes, and out in the communities.
Community Involvement
We consider sustainability to be a guiding principle in strengthening the relationship with our workforce, vendor partners and client partners. Through our programs and initiatives, we seek to contribute to improving the quality of life of our team 
members, their families, as well as the communities in which they operate. Designed on the concept of social investment, our approach ensures the creation of future development capacities instead of aiding on isolated occasions. Supporting our communities has always been an important part of how we uphold our company values. To this end, we support volunteerism through two paid days so team members can serve their charity, cause or not-for-profit organization of choice. Our 2021 launch of Philanthropy Cloud, powered by Salesforce.org, improves the giving experience by connecting employees with their charity of choice. The platform also greatly enhances our transparency in impact reporting, tracking, and engagement. In 2022, “BG'ers” donated more than $38,500 to charity and served over 1,375 volunteer hours to support to support causes that are close to their hearts, as well as BGSF-organized volunteer projects. In 2022, BGSF served as the Presenting Sponsor of the State Fair of Texas’s Youth Agricultural Job Interview Contest, bringing together BG volunteers to facilitate the contest for high school students from across Texas competing for scholarship awards BGSF. The team also continued to support the Junior Achievement charity, furthering the organization’s mission to prepare students for successful futures by providing work-readiness, entrepreneurship, and financial literacy learning programs. In early 2023, BGSF created the Darrell Freeman Fellowship program which will educate and support students at Nashville State Community College who want to successfully enter the Information Technology field after graduation.
Team Engagement
As part of BGSF’s continued initiative to provide its team members with feedback opportunities, in 2022, we conducted several pulse surveys to understand team member needs and provide support. Survey results were analyzed and reviewed by our senior leadership, as well as shared with individual managers, who were then tasked with taking action based on their team members’ confidential feedback (both quantitative and qualitative). By paying close attention to the results, both at an aggregate enterprise level as well as at a department/business/workgroup level, we have been able to continue the enhancement of our culture of rewards and recognition, drive efforts to promote inclusion and diversity, increase communication in support of team member well-being and modernize our approach to foster a culture of continuous learning and feedback. In 2022, team members recognized our BGSF values through our “BIG Deal” platform by sending over 2,500 awards to their fellow team members.
Learning and Development
We emphasize team member development and learning as a priority for the organization. We believe learning and development are key elements to overall retention, engagement, and team member experience strategy. This direction is led by our Vice President of Diversity and Development. Our strategy is designed to empower team members to reach their full potential, and we provide a wide range of development programs, opportunities, and resources needed to be successful. As we continue to develop the BGSF University, our goal is to provide a variety of learning channels including instructor-led, facilitated custom workshops, leader-led, cohort and mentorships, self-paced, e-learning and a catalog of vendor-provided courses, videos, resources, and books. We are committed to the organization's overall health and providing career progression by providing individual development, readiness, and transition plans as a part of our talent review and succession planning process.

Regulation
We are subject to regulation by numerous federal, state and local regulatory agencies, including but not limited to the U.S. Department of Labor, which sets employment practice standards for workers, and similar state and local agencies. We are subject to the laws and regulations of the jurisdictions within which we operate. While the specific laws and regulations vary among these jurisdictions, some require some form of licensing and often have statutory requirements for workplace safety and notice of change in obligation of workers’ compensation coverage in the event of contract termination. Although compliance with these requirements imposes some additional financial risk on us, particularly with respect to those client partners who breach their payment obligation to us, such compliance has not had a material adverse effect on our business to date. Increased government regulation of the workplace or of the employer-employee relationship, or judicial or administrative proceedings related to such regulation, could also materially harm our business.
