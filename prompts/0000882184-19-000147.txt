ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

D.R. Horton, Inc. is the largest homebuilding company in the United States as measured by number of homes closed. We construct and sell homes through our operating divisions in 90 markets across 29 states, primarily under the names of D.R. Horton, America’s Builder, Emerald Homes, Express Homes and Freedom Homes. Our common stock is included in the S&P 500 Index and listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “DHI.” Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms “D.R. Horton,” the “Company,” “we” and “our” used herein refer to D.R. Horton, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its predecessors and subsidiaries.
Our homebuilding business began in 1978 in Fort Worth, Texas, and our common stock has been publicly traded since 1992. We have expanded and diversified our homebuilding operations geographically over the years by investing available capital into our existing markets, start-up operations in new markets and acquisitions of other homebuilding companies. Our product offerings across our operating markets are broad and diverse. Our homes range in size from 1,000 to more than 4,000 square feet and in price from $100,000 to more than $1,000,000. For the year ended September 30, 2019, we closed 56,975 homes with an average closing price of $297,100.
Our business operations consist of homebuilding, a majority-owned residential lot development company, financial services and other activities. Our homebuilding operations are our core business, generating 97% of our consolidated revenues of $17.6 billion and $16.1 billion in fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively, and 98% of our consolidated revenues of $14.1 billion in fiscal 2017. Our homebuilding operations generate most of their revenues from the sale of completed homes and to a lesser extent from the sale of land and lots. Approximately 90% of our home sales revenue in fiscal 2019 was generated from the sale of single-family detached homes, with the remainder from the sale of attached homes, such as townhomes, duplexes and triplexes.
Our position as the most geographically diverse and largest volume homebuilder in the United States provides a strong platform for us to compete for new home sales. In recent years, we have expanded our product offerings to include a broad range of homes for entry-level, move-up, active adult and luxury buyers across our markets. Our entry-level homes at affordable price points have experienced very strong demand from homebuyers, as the entry-level segment of the new home market remains under-served, with low inventory levels relative to demand.
During fiscal 2018, we acquired 75% of the outstanding shares of Forestar Group Inc. (Forestar) for $558.3 million in cash. Forestar is a publicly traded residential lot development company listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “FOR.” Forestar is a component of our homebuilding strategy to enhance operational efficiency and returns by expanding relationships with land developers and increasing the portion of our land and lot position controlled under land purchase contracts to enhance operational efficiency and returns. We owned approximately 66% of Forestar’s outstanding common stock at September 30, 2019.
Our financial services operations provide mortgage financing and title agency services to homebuyers in many of our homebuilding markets. DHI Mortgage, our 100% owned subsidiary, provides mortgage financing services primarily to our homebuyers and generally sells the mortgages it originates and the related servicing rights to third-party purchasers. DHI Mortgage originates loans in accordance with purchaser guidelines and sells substantially all of its mortgage production shortly after origination. Our subsidiary title companies serve as title insurance agents by providing title insurance policies, examination and closing services, primarily to our homebuyers.
In addition to our homebuilding, Forestar and financial services operations, we have subsidiaries that engage in other business activities. These subsidiaries conduct insurance-related operations, construct and own income-producing rental properties, own non-residential real estate including ranch land and improvements and own and operate oil and gas related assets. The operating results of these subsidiaries are immaterial for separate reporting and therefore are grouped together and presented as other.

OPERATING STRUCTURE AND PROCESSES
Following is an overview of our company’s operating structure and the significant processes that support our business controls, strategies and performance.
Homebuilding Markets
Our homebuilding business operates in 90 markets across 29 states, which provides us with geographic diversification in our homebuilding inventory investments and our sources of revenues and earnings. We believe our geographic diversification lowers our operational risks by mitigating the effects of local and regional economic cycles, and it also enhances our earnings potential by providing more diverse opportunities to invest in our business.
We conduct our homebuilding operations in the geographic regions, states and markets listed below, and we conduct our financial services operations in many of these markets. Our homebuilding operating divisions are aggregated into six reporting segments, also referred to as reporting regions, which comprise the markets below. Our financial statements and the notes thereto contain additional information regarding segment performance.

When evaluating new or existing homebuilding markets for purposes of capital allocation, we consider local, market-specific factors, including among others:

• | Economic conditions;


• | Employment levels and job growth;


• | Income level of potential homebuyers;


• | Local housing affordability and typical mortgage products utilized;


• | Market for homes at our targeted price points;


• | Availability of land and lots in desirable locations on acceptable terms;


• | Land entitlement and development processes;


• | Availability of qualified subcontractors;


• | New and secondary home sales activity;


• | Competition;


• | Prevailing housing products, features, cost and pricing; and


• | Performance capabilities of our local management team.

Economies of Scale
We are the largest homebuilding company in the United States in fiscal 2019 as measured by number of homes closed, and we are also one of the largest builders in many of the markets in which we operate. We believe that our national, regional and local scale of operations provides us with benefits that may not be available to the same degree to some other smaller homebuilders, such as:

• | Greater access to and lower cost of capital, due to our balance sheet strength and our lending and capital markets relationships;


• | Volume discounts and rebates from national, regional and local materials suppliers and lower labor rates from certain subcontractors; and


• | Enhanced leverage of our general and administrative activities, which allows us flexibility to adjust to changes in market conditions and compete effectively across our markets.

Decentralized Homebuilding Operations
We view homebuilding as a local business; therefore, most of our direct homebuilding activities are decentralized to provide flexibility to our local managers in making operational decisions. We believe that our local management teams, who are familiar with local conditions, have the best information to make many decisions regarding their operations. At September 30, 2019, we had 52 separate homebuilding operating divisions, many of which operate in more than one market area. Generally, each operating division consists of a division president; a controller; land entitlement, acquisition and development personnel; a sales manager and sales and marketing personnel; a construction manager and construction superintendents; customer service personnel; a purchasing manager and office staff. Our division presidents receive performance-based compensation if they achieve targeted financial and operating metrics related to their operating divisions. Following is a summary of our homebuilding activities that are decentralized in our local operating divisions, and the control and oversight functions that are centralized in our regional and corporate offices.
Operating Division Responsibilities
Each operating division is responsible for:

• | Site selection, which involves

— A feasibility study;
— Soil and environmental reviews;
— Review of existing zoning and other governmental requirements;
— Review of the need for and extent of offsite work required to obtain project entitlements; and
— Financial analysis of the potential project;

• | Negotiating lot purchase, land acquisition and related contracts;


• | Obtaining all necessary land development and home construction approvals;


• | Selecting land development subcontractors and ensuring their work meets our contracted scopes;


• | Selecting building and architectural plans;


• | Selecting home construction subcontractors and ensuring their work meets our contracted scopes;


• | Planning and managing home construction schedules;


• | Determining the pricing for each house plan and options in a given community;


• | Developing and implementing local marketing and sales plans;


• | Coordinating all interactions with customers and real estate brokers during the sales, construction and home closing processes; and


• | Ensuring the quality and timeliness of post-closing service and warranty repairs provided to customers.

Centralized Controls
We centralize many important risk elements of our homebuilding business through our regional and corporate offices. We have five separate homebuilding regional offices. Generally, each regional office consists of a region president, a chief financial officer, legal counsel and other operational and office support staff. Each of our region presidents and their management teams are responsible for oversight of the operations of a number of homebuilding operating divisions, including:

• | Review and approval of division business plans and budgets;


• | Review and approval of all land and lot acquisition contracts;


• | Review of all business and financial analysis for potential land and lot inventory investments;


• | Oversight of land and home inventory levels;


• | Monitoring division financial and operating performance; and


• | Review of major personnel decisions and division incentive compensation plans.

Our corporate executives and corporate office departments are responsible for establishing our operational policies and internal control standards and for monitoring compliance with established policies and controls throughout our operations. The corporate office also has primary responsibility for direct management of certain key risk elements and initiatives through the following centralized functions:

• | Financing;


• | Cash management;


• | Allocation of capital;


• | Issuance and monitoring of inventory investment guidelines;


• | Approval and funding of land and lot acquisitions;


• | Monitoring and analysis of profitability, returns, costs and inventory levels;


• | Risk and litigation management;


• | Environmental assessments of land and lot acquisitions;


• | Technology systems to support management of operations, marketing and financial information;


• | Accounting and management reporting;


• | Income taxes;


• | Internal audit;


• | Public reporting and investor and media relations;


• | Administration of payroll and employee benefits;


• | Negotiation of national purchasing contracts;


• | Administration, reporting and monitoring of customer satisfaction surveys and resolutions of issues; and


• | Approval of major personnel decisions and management incentive compensation plans.

Land/Lot Acquisition and Inventory Management
We acquire land for use in our homebuilding and Forestar operations after we have completed due diligence and generally after we have obtained the rights (known as entitlements) to begin development or construction work resulting in an acceptable number of residential lots. Before we acquire lots or tracts of land, we complete a feasibility study, which includes soil tests, independent environmental studies, other engineering work and financial analysis. We also evaluate the status of necessary zoning and other governmental entitlements required to develop and use the property for home construction. Although we purchase and develop land primarily to support our homebuilding activities, we may sell land and lots to other developers and homebuilders where we have excess land and lot positions or for other strategic reasons.
We also enter into land/lot contracts, in which we obtain the right, but generally not the obligation, to buy land or lots at predetermined prices on a defined schedule commensurate with anticipated home closings or planned development. These contracts generally are non-recourse, which limits our financial exposure to our earnest money deposited into escrow under the terms of the contract and any pre-acquisition due diligence costs we incur. This enables us to control land and lot positions with limited capital investment, which substantially reduces the risks associated with land ownership and development.
We directly acquire almost all of our land and lot positions. We are a party to a small number of joint ventures. Joint ventures are consolidated if we have a controlling interest, or accounted for under the equity method of accounting if we have a significant influence, but not control.
We attempt to mitigate our exposure to real estate inventory risks by:

• | Controlling our level of inventory investment and managing our supply of land/lots owned and controlled under purchase contracts to match the expected housing demand in each of our operating markets;


• | Monitoring local market and demographic trends, housing preferences and related economic developments, including the identification of desirable housing submarkets based on the quality of local schools, new job opportunities, local growth initiatives and personal income trends;


• | Utilizing land/lot purchase contracts and seeking to acquire developed lots which are substantially ready for home construction, where possible; and


• | Monitoring and managing the number of speculative homes (homes under construction without an executed sales contract) built in each subdivision.

Land Development and Home Construction
Substantially all of our land development and home construction work is performed by subcontractors. Subcontractors typically are selected after a competitive bidding process and are retained for a specific subdivision or series of house plans pursuant to a contract that obligates the subcontractor to complete the scope of work at an agreed-upon price. We employ land development managers and construction superintendents to monitor land development and home construction activities, participate in major design and building decisions, coordinate the activities of subcontractors and suppliers, review the work of subcontractors for quality and cost controls and monitor compliance with zoning and building codes. In addition, our construction superintendents interact with our homebuyers during the construction process and instruct buyers on post-closing home maintenance.
Our home designs are selected or prepared in each of our markets to appeal to local homebuyers’ expectations for affordability, home size and features, and our local management teams adjust product offerings to meet buyer demand as necessary. In many communities, we offer optional interior and exterior features to homebuyers for an additional charge. Construction time for our homes depends on the availability of labor, materials and supplies, the weather, the size of the home and other factors. We complete the construction of most homes within two to six months.
We typically do not maintain significant inventories of land development or construction materials, except for work in progress materials for active development projects and homes under construction. Generally, the construction materials used in our operations are readily available from numerous sources. We have contracts exceeding one year with certain suppliers of building materials that are cancelable at our option.
We are subject to governmental regulations that affect our land development and construction operations. At times, we have experienced delays in receiving the proper approvals from municipalities or other government agencies that have delayed our anticipated development and construction activities in certain communities. 
Cost Controls
We control construction costs by designing our homes efficiently and by obtaining competitive bids for construction materials and labor. We also competitively bid and negotiate pricing from our subcontractors and suppliers based on the volume of services and products we purchase on a local, regional and national basis. We monitor our land development expenditures and construction costs versus budgets for each house and community, and we review our inventory levels, margins, expenses, profitability and returns for each operating market compared to both its business plan and our performance expectations.
We control overhead costs by centralizing certain accounting and administrative functions, monitoring staffing and compensation levels and by applying technology to business processes to improve productivity where practical. We review other general and administrative costs to identify efficiencies and savings opportunities in our operating divisions and our regional and corporate offices. We also direct many of our promotional activities toward local real estate brokers and digital marketing initiatives, which we believe are efficient uses of our marketing expenditures.
Marketing and Sales
We primarily use the D.R. Horton, Emerald Homes, Express Homes and Freedom Homes brand names to market and sell our homes. Our D.R. Horton branded communities are the core of our business and account for the majority of our home closings, focusing primarily on the first time and first time move-up homebuyer. Our Emerald branded communities appeal to buyers in search of higher-end move-up and luxury homes. Our Express branded communities primarily accommodate a segment of entry-level buyers who are focused on affordability. We introduced our Freedom Homes brand in 2016 to offer homes at affordable price points to active adult buyers seeking a low-maintenance lifestyle. The percentage of home closings and home sales revenue contributed by each brand during fiscal 2019 was as follows:

 | Percentage ofHome Closings | | Percentage ofHome Sales Revenue
D.R. Horton | 60 | % | | 63 | %
Emerald | 2 | % | | 5 | %
Express | 35 | % | | 29 | %
Freedom | 3 | % | | 3 | %
Total | 100 | % | | 100 | %

We also use names of acquired companies for a period of time after the acquisition. We currently utilize the Pacific Ridge Homes brand in our Seattle, Washington market; the Westport Homes brand in our Indianapolis and Fort Wayne, Indiana and Columbus, Ohio markets; and the Terramor Homes brand in our Raleigh, North Carolina market. The product offerings in all of these markets are similar to, and included with, our D.R. Horton branded communities shown above.
We market and sell our homes primarily through commissioned employees, and the majority of our home closings also involve an independent real estate broker. We typically conduct home sales from sales offices located in furnished model homes in each subdivision, and we generally do not offer our model homes for sale until the completion of a subdivision. Our sales personnel assist prospective homebuyers by providing floor plans and price information, demonstrating the features and layouts of our homes and assisting with the selection of options, when available. We train and inform our sales personnel regarding construction schedules and marketing and advertising plans. As market conditions warrant, we may provide potential homebuyers with incentives, such as discounts or free upgrades, to be competitive in a particular market or to attain our targeted sales pace.
We market our homes and communities to prospective homebuyers and real estate brokers digitally, through email, search engine marketing, social media and our company website and other real estate websites, in addition to print media and advertisement. We also use billboards, radio, television, magazine and newspaper advertising locally as necessary. We attempt to position our subdivisions in locations that are desirable to potential homebuyers and convenient to or visible from local traffic patterns, which helps to reduce advertising costs. Model homes play an important role in our marketing efforts, and we expend significant effort and resources to create an attractive atmosphere in our model homes.
We also build speculative homes in most of our communities, which allow us to compete effectively with existing homes available in the market and improve our profits and returns. These homes enhance our marketing and sales efforts to prospective homebuyers who are renters or who are relocating to these markets and require a home within a short time frame, as well as to independent brokers who represent these homebuyers. We determine our speculative homes strategy in each market based on local market factors, such as new job growth, the number of job relocations, housing demand and supply, seasonality, current sales contract cancellation trends and our past experience in the market. We maintain a level of speculative home inventory in each community based on our current and planned sales pace, and we monitor and adjust speculative home inventory on an ongoing basis as conditions warrant.

Sales Contracts and Backlog
Our sales contracts require an earnest money deposit which varies in amount across our markets and communities. Additionally, customers are generally required to pay additional deposits when they select options or upgrade features for their homes. Our sales contracts include a financing contingency which permits customers to cancel and receive a refund of their deposit if they cannot obtain mortgage financing at prevailing or specified interest rates within a specified period. Our contracts may include other contingencies, such as the sale of an existing home. We either retain or refund customer deposits on cancelled sales contracts, depending upon the applicable provisions of the contract or other circumstances.
Sales order backlog represents homes under contract but not yet closed at the end of the period. At September 30, 2019, the value of our backlog of sales orders was $4.1 billion (13,613 homes), an increase of 3% from $4.0 billion (13,371 homes) at September 30, 2018. The average sales price of homes in backlog was $304,100 at September 30, 2019, up slightly from the $301,300 average at September 30, 2018. Many of the contracts in our sales order backlog are subject to contingencies, such as those described above, which can result in cancellations. As a percentage of gross sales orders, cancellations of sales contracts were 21% in fiscal 2019 compared to 22% in fiscal 2018.
The length of time between the signing of a sales contract for a home and delivery of the home to the buyer (closing) is generally from two to six months; therefore, substantially all of the homes in our sales backlog at September 30, 2019 are scheduled to close in fiscal year 2020.
Customer Service and Quality Control
Our operating divisions are responsible for pre-closing quality control inspections and responding to customers’ post-closing needs. We believe that a prompt and courteous response to homebuyers’ needs during and after construction reduces post-closing repair costs, enhances our reputation for quality and service and ultimately leads to repeat and referral business from the real estate community and homebuyers. We typically provide our homebuyers with a ten-year limited warranty for major defects in structural elements such as framing components and foundation systems, a two-year limited warranty on major mechanical systems, and a one-year limited warranty on other construction components. The subcontractors who perform the actual construction also provide us with warranties on workmanship and are generally prepared to respond to us and the homeowner promptly upon request. In addition, some of our suppliers provide manufacturer’s warranties on specified products installed in the home.
Forestar Residential Lot Development Operations
During fiscal 2018, we acquired 75% of the outstanding shares of Forestar. Forestar is a residential lot development company with operations in 51 markets and 20 states as of September 30, 2019. We owned approximately 66% of Forestar’s outstanding common stock at September 30, 2019. Forestar is a component of our homebuilding strategy to enhance operational efficiency and returns by expanding relationships with land developers and increasing the portion of our land and lot position controlled under land purchase contracts to enhance operational efficiency and returns. Forestar is making significant investments in land acquisition and development to expand its residential lot development business across a geographically diversified national platform. Our homebuilding operations acquire finished lots from Forestar in accordance with the master supply agreement between the two companies. A shared services agreement is in place whereby we provide Forestar certain administrative, compliance, operational and procurement services. As the controlling shareholder of Forestar, we strongly influence the strategic direction and operations of Forestar.
Customer Mortgage Financing
We provide mortgage financing services principally to purchasers of our homes in the majority of our homebuilding markets through DHI Mortgage, our 100% owned subsidiary. DHI Mortgage assists in the sales transaction by coordinating the mortgage application, mortgage commitment and home closing processes to facilitate a timely and efficient home buying experience for our buyers. During the year ended September 30, 2019, DHI Mortgage provided mortgage financing services for approximately 58% of our total homes closed, and approximately 98% of DHI Mortgage’s loan volume related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations. Most of our homebuilding divisions also work with additional mortgage lenders that offer a range of mortgage financing programs to our homebuyers.
9

To limit the risks associated with our mortgage operations, DHI Mortgage originates loan products that we believe can be sold to third-party purchasers of mortgage loans, the majority of which are eligible for sale to the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) or the Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae). DHI Mortgage sells substantially all of the loans and their servicing rights to third-party purchasers shortly after origination with limited recourse provisions. DHI Mortgage centralizes most of its control and oversight functions, including those related to loan underwriting, quality control, regulatory compliance, secondary marketing of loans, hedging activities, accounting and financial reporting.
Title Services
Through our subsidiary title companies, we serve as a title insurance agent in selected markets by providing title insurance policies, examination and closing services primarily to our homebuilding customers. We currently assume little or no underwriting risk associated with these title policies.
Insurance Agency
Through our insurance agency subsidiary, we collect insurance commissions on homeowner policies placed with third party carriers.
Multi-Family Rental Properties
Through DHI Communities, a 100% owned subsidiary, we develop, construct and own multi-family residential properties that produce rental income. DHI Communities is primarily focused on constructing garden style multi-family products, which typically accommodate 200 to 400 dwelling units, in high growth suburban markets. After DHI Communities has completed construction and achieved a stabilized occupancy rate, the property is typically marketed for sale. We currently have four projects under active construction and two projects that are substantially complete, one of which was under contract to sell at September 30, 2019. During fiscal 2019, DHI Communities sold two multi-family rental properties for $133.4 million and recorded gains on sale totaling $51.9 million. At September 30, 2019, DHI Communities had total assets of $204.0 million, which included property and equipment of $153.9 million and other assets of $28.9 million for a property held for sale.
Employees
At September 30, 2019, we employed 8,916 persons, of whom 1,908 were sales and marketing personnel, 2,532 were involved in construction, 2,552 were office personnel and 1,924 worked in mortgage and title operations. We focus significant attention toward attracting and retaining talented and experienced individuals to manage and support our operations, and we believe that we have good relations with our employees.
Business Acquisitions
We routinely evaluate opportunities to profitably expand our operations, including potential acquisitions of other homebuilding or related businesses. Acquisitions of homebuilding and related businesses usually provide us with immediate land and home inventories and control of additional land and lot positions through purchase contracts. Also, employees of acquired businesses generally have specialized knowledge of local market conditions, including existing relationships with municipalities, land owners, developers, subcontractors and suppliers. These inventory positions and local market knowledge and relationships could take us several years to develop through our own efforts. We seek to limit the risks associated with acquiring other companies by conducting extensive operational, financial and legal due diligence on each acquisition and by performing financial analysis to determine that each acquisition will have a positive impact on our earnings within an acceptable period of time.
During fiscal 2019, we acquired the homebuilding operations of Westport Homes, Classic Builders and Terramor Homes for $325.9 million. The assets acquired included approximately 700 homes in inventory, 4,500 lots and control of approximately 4,300 additional lots through land purchase contracts. We also acquired a sales order backlog of approximately 700 homes. Westport Homes operates in Indianapolis and Fort Wayne, Indiana, and Columbus, Ohio; Classic Builders operates in Des Moines, Iowa; and Terramor Homes operates in Raleigh, North Carolina.
Competition
The homebuilding and lot development industries are highly competitive. We compete with numerous other national, regional and local homebuilders and developers for homebuyers, desirable land, raw materials, skilled labor, employees, management talent and financing. We also compete with resales of existing and foreclosed homes and with the rental housing market. Our homes compete on the basis of price, location, quality, design and mortgage financing terms.
The competitors to our financial services businesses include other mortgage lenders and title companies, including national, regional and local mortgage bankers and other financial institutions. Some of these competitors are subject to fewer governmental regulations and may have greater access to capital, and some of them may operate with different lending criteria and may offer a broader array of financing and other products and services to consumers than we do. We strive to provide flexible, fairly priced financing alternatives subject to applicable regulations.
Governmental Regulations and Environmental Matters
The homebuilding industry is subject to extensive and complex regulations. We and the subcontractors we use must comply with many federal, state and local laws and regulations. These include zoning, density and development requirements and building, environmental, advertising, labor and real estate sales rules and regulations. These regulations and requirements affect substantially all aspects of our land development and home design, construction and sales processes in varying degrees across our markets. Our homes are inspected by local authorities where required, and homes eligible for insurance or guarantees provided by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) are subject to inspection by them. These regulations often provide broad discretion to the administering governmental authorities. In addition, our new housing developments may be subject to various assessments for schools, parks, streets, utilities and other public improvements.
Our homebuilding and land development operations are also subject to an extensive array of local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning protection of health, safety and the environment. The particular compliance requirements for each site vary greatly according to location, environmental condition and the present and former uses of the site and adjoining properties.
Our mortgage company must comply with extensive state and federal laws and regulations, which are administered by numerous agencies, including but not limited to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), Federal Housing Finance Agency, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, FHA, VA, United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae. These laws and regulations include many compliance requirements, including but not limited to licensing, consumer disclosures, fair lending and real estate settlement procedures. As a result, our operations are subject to regular, extensive examinations by the applicable agencies.
Seasonality
Although significant changes in market conditions have impacted our seasonal patterns in the past and could do so again in the future, we generally close more homes and generate greater revenues and operating income in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. The seasonal nature of our business can also cause significant variations in our working capital requirements in our homebuilding, land development and financial services operations. As a result of seasonal activity, our quarterly results of operations and financial position at the end of a particular fiscal quarter are not necessarily representative of the balance of our fiscal year.
