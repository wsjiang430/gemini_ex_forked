Item 1. Business
Overview



Kayne Anderson BDC, Inc. was formed as a Delaware corporation to make investments in middle-market companies and commenced operations on February 5, 2021. We are an externally managed, closed-end, non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. In addition, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we intend to qualify, annually, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code.



We are managed by KA Credit Advisors, LLC (the “Advisor”) which is an indirect subsidiary of Kayne Anderson Capital Advisors, L.P. (“KACALP” or “Kayne Anderson”). The Advisor is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) as an investment advisor under the Investment Advisory Act of 1940, as amended. Subject to the overall supervision of the Company’s board of directors (the “Board”), the Advisor is responsible for originating prospective investments, conducting research and due diligence investigations on potential investments, analyzing investment opportunities, negotiating and structuring investments, determining the value of the investments and monitoring its investments and portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. The Board consists of seven directors, four of whom are independent.



Investment Objective and Strategy




Our investment objective is to generate current income and, to a lesser extent, capital appreciation primarily through debt investments in middle-market companies. We define “middle-market companies” as U.S.-based companies that, in general, generate between $10 million and $150 million of annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA. We refer to companies that generate between $10 million and $50 million of annual EBITDA as “core middle-market companies” and companies that generate between $50 million and $150 million of annual EBITDA as “upper middle-market companies.”


We intend to achieve our investment objective by investing primarily in first lien senior secured, unitranche and split-lien loans (collectively, “secured middle market loans”) to privately held middle-market companies. Similar to first lien senior secured loans, unitranche loans typically have a first lien on all assets of the borrower, but provide leverage at levels similar to a combination of first lien and second lien and/or subordinated loans. Split-lien loans are loans that otherwise satisfy the criteria of a first lien loan but which have been structured with a credit facility that is senior in right of payment with respect to working capital assets of the borrower and a term loan that is collateralized by all other assets of the borrower. Depending on market conditions, we expect that at least 90% of our portfolio (including investments purchased with proceeds from borrowings) will be invested in secured middle market loans. It is anticipated that most of these investments will be in core middle market companies, with the remainder in upper middle market companies. The remaining 10% of our portfolio may be invested in higher-returning investments, including, but not limited to, equity securities purchased in conjunction with secured middle market loans and other opportunistic investments (collectively “Opportunistic Investments”), including junior debt, real estate debt and infrastructure credit investments. We expect that the secured middle market loans we invest in will generally have stated maturities of no more than six years.


We intend to execute on our investment objective by (1) accessing the established loan sourcing channels developed by Kayne Anderson’s middle market private credit team, which includes an extensive network of private equity firms, other middle-market lenders, financial advisors and intermediaries, and management teams, (2) selecting investments within our middle-market company focus, (3) implementing Kayne Anderson’s middle market private credit team’s proven underwriting process, and (4) drawing upon the experience and resources of our Advisor’s investment team and the broader Kayne Anderson network.


We believe our Advisor’s disciplined approach to origination, credit analysis, portfolio construction and risk management should allow us to achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns while preserving investor capital. We anticipate the portfolio will be comprised of a broad mix of loans, with diversity among investment size, industry focus and geography. The Advisor’s team of professionals will conduct in-depth due diligence on prospective investments during the underwriting process and will be heavily involved in structuring the credit terms of each investment. Once an investment has been made, our Advisor will closely monitor portfolio investments and take a proactive approach identifying and addressing sector or company specific risks. The Advisor maintains a regular dialogue with portfolio company management teams (as well as their financial sponsors, where applicable), reviews detailed operating and financial results on a regular basis (typically monthly or quarterly) and monitors current and projected liquidity needs, in addition to other portfolio management activities.



Market Opportunity



The universe of middle market companies consists of nearly 200,000 potential borrowers that we believe will continue to require access to debt capital to refinance existing debt, support growth and finance acquisitions. Together, these businesses represent approximately one-third of the U.S. private sector GDP making them equivalent to the size of the third largest economy in the world on a standalone basis and employing approximately 48 million people.



The U.S. middle market includes businesses held under an array of ownership structures including publicly and privately held companies, those held in trusts, sole proprietorships, etc. These businesses are also, broadly speaking, geographically diverse and span almost all industries. Middle market companies outperformed through the financial crisis (i.e., the 2007–2010 period) by adding 2.2 million jobs across major industry sectors and U.S. geographies, demonstrating their importance to the overall health of the U.S. economy. More than three-quarters of middle market companies demonstrated revenue growth in 2021 as compared to the prior year, and while the COVID rebound was not as strong as the rebound exhibited by the S&P 500 Index, the downturn also was not as severe.





2







Further, there is a large amount of uninvested capital held by private equity funds focused on investing in middle market businesses. We expect these private equity firms will continue to pursue acquisitions and to seek to fund a portion of these transactions with debt.



We expect that a number of factors will continue to drive strong demand for middle market senior credit, both by private equity owned and non-private equity owned companies, for the foreseeable future, including: (i) primary market opportunities driven by a significant amount of unspent middle market private equity capital, (ii) opportunities driven by a large need for the refinancing or restructuring of existing debt of healthy companies and (iii) supplemental and growth capital opportunities. Meanwhile, the supply of capital to middle market borrowers is relatively constrained due to (i) a long-term regulatory trend that has nearly eliminated bank participation in leveraged finance due to stricter federal leveraged lending guidelines, (ii) consolidation of commercial banks over the last two decades, which has caused banks to abandon the middle market as they move up-market to service larger clients, (iii) the continued up-market movement of select competitors that historically participated in middle market financings and which now participate mostly in upper-middle market financings as target hold-sizes have increased and (iv) direct lending increasing share relative to broadly syndicated deals and mezzanine financings.



Further, current economic and geopolitical concerns have created a market dislocation in certain segments of lending markets globally with a lack of available capital to finance transaction activity. We believe this has created a substantial enhancement of the relative risk-reward profile for non-liquid private credit markets as an asset class, particularly for managers with a track record of investing through potentially uncertain economic times.



First, inflationary concerns in the United States have led the U.S. Federal Reserve to substantially increase rates, which have driven an increase in reference rates (e.g., LIBOR or SOFR) underpinning the pricing structure of floating rate securities from under 1.0% at year-end 2021 to over 4.50% (3-month SOFR) as of December 2022. This increase in reference rates inures to the benefit of lenders, increasing returns to investors.



Second, global economic considerations (e.g., the risk of a near-term recessionary environment) driven in part by (i) the aforementioned inflationary environment and the U.S. Federal Reserve’s response thereto, (ii) continued supply chain constraints globally and (iii) uncertainty associated with the Russian / Ukrainian conflict have created an environment in which lending institutions broadly have moderated activity. Most of this pull back has occurred in the upper-middle and large syndicated markets. Regardless, there has been a trickle-down effect of (a) increased opportunities for middle-market lenders to participate in larger transactions at attractive terms and (b) a general shift toward more lender-friendly terms inclusive of more conservative structures, increased economics and tightening of documentation.



While uncertainty associated with each of the above factors exists, we believe that, in the hands of a team with experience managing capital through multiple historical economic cycles, today’s climate represents an opportune time to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns relative to nearly any asset class. In addition to commanding higher pricing, principally due to illiquidity, directly negotiated middle market financings generally provide for more favorable terms to lenders than broadly syndicated loans, including more conservative leverage ratios, stronger covenants and reporting packages, better call protection, and more restrictive change-of-control provisions. 



The credit investments that we hold in our portfolio generate what we believe are attractive yields, make quarterly interest payments to holders and typically rank ahead of other debt instruments in the borrower’s capital structure. The vast majority of our credit investments are expected to be floating rate loans, providing a natural hedge against inflation in a higher interest rate environment. As a result of Kayne Anderson’s middle-market private credit team’s focus on lending at more conservative debt multiples than the broader market and to businesses that exhibit limited cyclicality, we believe that operating results for the Company’s portfolio investments will have minimal correlation to price changes in the broader equity markets. This lack of correlation to the broader equity markets, combined with attractive yields on senior debt investments and downside protection as a result of our secured middle-market loans’ seniority in such company’s capital structure, are some of the reasons we find private credit investments to be compelling for our portfolio.



Competition 



We compete with a number of BDCs and investment funds (both public and private), commercial and investments banks, commercial financing companies and, to the extent they provide an alternative form of financing, private equity and hedge funds. Many of our competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial and marketing resources than we do. We believe we are able to compete with these entities primarily on the basis of the experience and contacts of our management team, our responsive and efficient investment analysis and decision-making processes, the investment terms we offer, and our model of investing in companies participating in industries which we know well.



We believe that some of our competitors may make loans with interest rates that will be lower than the rates that we offer. We do not seek to compete solely on the interest rates that we offer to potential portfolio companies. For additional information concerning competitive risks, see “Item 1A – Risk Factors.”



Investment Advisor 



Our investment activities are managed by our Advisor, an investment advisor that is registered with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the “Advisers Act”), under an investment advisory agreement between us and the Advisor (the “Investment Advisory Agreement”). Our Advisor is responsible for originating prospective investments, conducting research and due diligence investigations on potential investments, analyzing investment opportunities, negotiating and structuring investments and monitoring our investments and portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. While we do not have any employees, the Advisor and its affiliates have a team of approximately 41 investment professionals who are primarily focused on private credit investments and liquid credit investments. The investment team is supported by a team of finance, legal, compliance, operations and administrative professionals.



The Advisor’s investment committee has overall responsibility for evaluating and approving the Company’s investments, and its portfolio allocations, subject to the oversight of our Board of Directors. The investment committee review process is intended to bring the diverse experience and perspectives of the investment committee members to the analysis and consideration of every investment. The investment committee currently consists of Terrence J. Quinn, Vice Chairman of Kayne Anderson; Paul S. Blank, President and Chief Operating Officer of Kayne Anderson; James C. Baker, Jr., Co-Head of Liquid Energy Infrastructure at Kayne Anderson; Douglas L. Goodwillie, Co-Head of Private Credit at Kayne Anderson; and Kenneth B. Leonard, Co-Head of Private Credit at Kayne Anderson. The investment committee also determines appropriate investment sizing and mandates ongoing monitoring requirements. Douglas L. Goodwillie and Kenneth B. Leonard, each a Co-Chief Investment Officer of the Company, are jointly and primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Company’s portfolio.

In addition to reviewing investments, the investment committee meetings serve as a forum to discuss credit views and outlooks. The investment committee also reviews potential transactions and deal flow on a regular basis. Members of the deal team are encouraged to share information and views on credit with the committee early in their analysis. We believe this process improves the quality of the analysis and enables deal team members to work more efficiently.



The Administrator



Our Advisor also serves as our administrator. Pursuant to an administration agreement (the “Administration Agreement”), our Administrator is responsible for providing or overseeing the performance of our required administrative services and professional services rendered by others, which will include (but not limited to), accounting, payment of our expenses, legal, compliance, operations, technology and investor relations, preparation and filing of our tax returns, and preparation of financial reports provided to our stockholders and filed with the SEC.

Private Offerings



We conduct private offerings of our Common Stock to investors in reliance on exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). At the closing of any private offering, each investor will make a capital commitment (a “Capital Commitment”) to purchase shares of our Common Stock (“Shares”) pursuant to a subscription agreement (the “Subscription Agreement”) entered into with us. Investors will be required to fund drawdowns to purchase Shares up to the amount of their respective Capital Commitments each time we deliver a notice to the investors. All purchases will generally be made pro rata in accordance with the investors’ Capital Commitments, at a per-Share price as determined by our Board of Directors as of a date that is immediately prior to the date of the applicable drawdown. The per-Share price will be at least equal to net asset value, or NAV, per share in accordance with the limitations under Section 23 of the 1940 Act.



Following our initial closing of the private offering on February 5, 2021 (the “Initial Closing”) and prior to any Liquidity Event (as defined below), our investment adviser may, in its sole discretion, permit additional closings of the private offering. A “Liquidity Event” is defined as (a) an initial public offering of our Shares (the “Initial Public Offering”) or the listing of our Shares on an exchange (together with the Initial Public Offering, an “Exchange Listing”), (b) the sale of the Company or (c) a disposition of the Company’s investments and distribution of the net proceeds (after repayment of borrowed funds or other forms of leverage) to the Company’s investors.



Our initial private offering of Shares was conducted in reliance on Regulation D under the Securities Act (“Regulation D”). Investors in our initial private offering were required to be “accredited investors” as defined in Regulation D of the Securities Act. The criteria required of Regulation D may not apply to investors in subsequent offerings.



We are targeting approximately $900 million in commitments, which may be more or less than this amount (the “Initial Capital Raise”), and we intend to complete this offering in 2023. Following our Initial Closing, each investor was required to make purchases of Shares (each, a “Catch-up Purchase”) on one or more dates to be determined by us. The aggregate purchase amount of any Catch-up Purchase will be equal to an amount necessary to ensure that, upon payment of the aggregate purchase amount, such investor will have contributed the same percentage of its Capital Commitment to us as all investors whose subscriptions were accepted at previous closings. Catch-up Purchases will be made at a per-Share price as determined by our Board of Directors prior to the date of the applicable drawdown, or such other date as may be required to comply with the provisions of the 1940 Act. In order to more fairly allocate organizational expenses among all of our stockholders, investors subscribing after the initial drawdown will be required to pay a price per Share above net asset value reflecting a variety of factors, including, without limitation, the total amount of our organizational and other expenses.



As of March 9, 2023, we had entered into subscription agreements with investors for an aggregate capital commitment of $832.3 million to purchase shares of common stock ($264.6 million is undrawn).

We conducted the following private offerings of our common stock associated with these subscription agreements during the year ended December 31, 2022.




Capital call notice date | Common stock issue date | Common stock shares issued | | Aggregate offering amount ($ in millions) | 
--------------------------+-------------------------+----------------------------+------------+-------------------------------------------+--
January 13, 2022 | January 24, 2022 | | 4,191,292 | | $ | 68.6

Total common stock issued | | | 16,305,034 | | $ | 268.2

Commitment Period



Upon the earlier of (a) December 31, 2024 or (b) an Exchange Listing (the “Commitment Period”), investors will be released from any further obligation to purchase additional Shares with respect to a Capital Commitment. If we have not otherwise completed an Exchange Listing by December 31, 2024, we may, subject to shareholder approval, extend the Commitment Period by an additional two years. During the Commitment Period, no investor will be permitted to sell, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of its Shares or Capital Commitment unless we provide our prior written consent and the transfer is otherwise made in accordance with applicable law.



Once we have completed the Exchange Listing, each investor will be released from any further obligation to purchase additional Shares with respect to a Capital Commitment. If we have not otherwise completed an Exchange Listing and the Commitment Period has ended (including extensions, if any), each investor will be released from any further obligation to purchase additional Shares with respect to a Capital Commitment, except to the extent necessary to (a) pay our expenses, including management fees, any amounts that may become due under any borrowings or other financings or similar obligations and any other liabilities, contingent or otherwise, in each case to the extent they relate to the Commitment Period, (b) complete investments in any transactions for which there are binding written agreements as of the end of the Commitment Period (including investments that are funded in phases), (c) fund follow-on investments made in existing portfolio companies that, in the aggregate, do not exceed 20% of total commitments, (d) fund obligations under any guarantee or indemnity made by us during the Commitment Period and/or (e) fund any defaulted commitments.



As part of certain credit facilities, the right to make capital calls of stockholders may be pledged as collateral to a lender, which will be able to call for capital contributions upon the occurrence of an event of default under such credit facility. To the extent such an event of default does occur, stockholders could therefore be required to fund any shortfall up to their remaining Capital Commitments, without regard to the underlying value of their investment.



Liquidity Event



Our term is perpetual. However, we intend to seek an Exchange Listing after we have substantially invested the proceeds from our Initial Capital Raise and as soon as market conditions warrant. If we have not consummated an Exchange Listing or some other type of Liquidity Event by December 31, 2026, our Board of Directors (to the extent consistent with its fiduciary duties and subject to any necessary stockholder approvals and applicable requirements of the 1940 Act) will direct the Company to cease making new investments and will direct the Advisor to commence the orderly disposition of investments (the “Wind Down Period”). The Company shall be allowed to make follow-on investments during the Wind Down Period if such investments are approved by our Board of Directors, subject to the 20% limit that applies after the Commitment Period. Existing investments will be disposed of in an orderly manner and the proceeds of such dispositions promptly distributed to the Company’s investors or used to satisfy any amounts owed under any borrowed funds or other forms of leverage (the “Company Liquidation”). If any investments made by the Company are also investments made by any other investment account managed by the Advisor or any affiliate of the Advisor, such investments shall be disposed of at the same time and on the same terms as such other investment account.
Shareholder Agreements 



We entered into several agreements (collectively, the “Shareholder Agreements”) with investors who participate in our private offering during our Initial Capital Raise (each an “Initial Investor”). The Initial Investors are granted the right to invest in our investment advisor. Upon completion of our Initial Capital Raise, we anticipate that the initial investors will own approximately 34.5% of our investment advisor.
Investment Advisory Agreement



On February 5, 2021, we entered into the Investment Advisory Agreement with our Advisor. Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement with our Advisor, we will pay our Advisor a fee for investment advisory and management services consisting of two components — a base management fee and an incentive fee. Our Advisor may, from time-to-time, grant waivers on our obligations, including waivers of the base management fee and/or incentive fee, under the Investment Advisory Agreement. The Investment Advisory Agreement may be terminated by either party with 60 days’ written notice. On November 8, 2022, the Board of Directors extended the term of the Investment Advisory Agreement until March 15, 2023.

Base Management Fee



Prior to an Exchange Listing, the base management fee is calculated at an annual rate of 0.90% of the fair market value of our investments including, in each case, assets purchased with borrowed funds or other forms of leverage, but excluding cash, U.S. government securities and commercial paper instruments maturing within one year of purchase. After an Exchange Listing, the base management fee will be calculated at an annual rate of 1.50% of the fair market value of our investments. However, following an Exchange Listing, if borrowed funds or other forms of leverage utilized to finance our investments is greater than a debt-to-equity ratio of 1.0x, the base management fee will be 1.00% of the fair market value of the portion of our investments financed with borrowed funds or other forms of leverage above a 1.0x debt-to-equity ratio.



For services rendered under the Investment Advisory Agreement, the base management fee is payable quarterly in arrears and calculated based on the average value, at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters, of our fair market value of investments, including, in each case, assets purchased with borrowed funds or other forms of leverage, but excluding cash, U.S. government securities and commercial paper instruments maturing within one year of purchase. Base management fees for any partial quarter are appropriately pro-rated.



Incentive Fee



We will also pay the Advisor an incentive fee. The incentive fee will consist of two parts—an incentive fee on income and an incentive fee on capital gains. Described in more detail below, these components of the incentive fee will be largely independent of each other with the result that one component may be payable even if the other is not.
Incentive Fee on Income



The incentive fee based on income (the “income incentive fee”) is determined and paid quarterly in arrears in cash. Our quarterly pre-incentive fee net investment income must exceed a preferred return of 1.50% of the our NAV at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter (6.0% annualized but not compounded) (the “Hurdle Amount”) in order for us to receive an income incentive fee. The income incentive fee is calculated as follows:

● | Prior to an Exchange Listing: 100% of our pre-incentive fee net investment income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter in excess of 1.50% of our NAV at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter until the Advisor has received 10% of the total pre-incentive fee net income for that calendar quarter and, for pre-incentive fee net investment income in excess of 1.6667%, 10% of all remaining pre-incentive fee net investment income for that quarter. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | After an Exchange Listing: 100% of our pre-incentive fee net investment income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter in excess of 1.50% of our NAV at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter until the Advisor has received 15% of the total pre-incentive fee net income for that calendar quarter and, for pre-incentive fee net investment income in excess of 1.7647%, 15% of all remaining pre-incentive fee net investment income for that quarter. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




The following are graphical representations of the calculations of the income incentive fee:



Quarterly Incentive Fee on

Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income

Prior to an Exchange Listing

(expressed as a percentage of the value of net assets)





Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income | 0% | 1.50% | 1.6667%

----------------------------------------+--------+----------+------------
Quarterly Incentive Fee | ← 0% → | ← 100% → | ← 15% → 




Pre-incentive fee net investment income is defined as interest income, dividend income and any other cash or non-cash income accrued during the calendar quarter, minus operating expenses for the quarter, including the base management fee, expenses payable under the Administration Agreement, any interest expense and distributions paid on any issued and outstanding debt or preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee. Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not include any expense support payments and/or any reimbursement by us of expense support payments, nor any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation.

Incentive Fee on Capital Gains




The incentive fee on capital gains (the “capital gains incentive fee”) will be calculated and payable in arrears in cash as follows:




● | Prior to an Exchange Listing: 10% of our realized capital gains, if any, on a cumulative basis from formation through the earlier of (a) the day before an Exchange Listing, (b) upon consummation of a Liquidity Event or (c) upon the termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis. For the purpose of computing the capital gain incentive fee, the calculation methodology will look through derivative financial instruments or swaps as if we owned the reference assets directly. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | After an Exchange Listing: 15% of our realized capital gains, if any, on a cumulative basis from formation through the end of a given calendar year or upon termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gain incentive fees. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Payment of Incentive Fees



Prior to an Exchange Listing, any incentive fees earned by the Advisor shall accrue as earned but only become payable in cash to the Advisor upon consummation of an Exchange Listing. To the extent we do not complete an Exchange Listing, the incentive fees will be payable to the Advisor (a) upon consummation of a sale of us or (b) once substantially all the proceeds from our Liquidation payable to our stockholders have been distributed to such stockholders.
Administration Agreement



On February 5, 2021, we entered into an Administration Agreement with our Advisor, which will serve as our Administrator and will provide or oversee the performance of our required administrative services and professional services rendered by others, which will include (but not limited to), accounting, payment of our expenses, legal, compliance, operations, technology and investor relations, preparation and filing of our tax returns, and preparation of financial reports provided to our stockholders and filed with the SEC. On November 8, 2022, the Board of Directors extended the term of the Administration Agreement until March 15, 2023.



We reimburse the Administrator for its costs and expenses incurred in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, which may include, after completion of our Exchange Listing, our allocable portion of office facilities, overhead, and compensation paid to or compensatory distributions received by our officers (while not currently doing so, including our Chief Compliance Officer and Chief Financial Officer) and their respective staff who provide services to us. As we reimburse the Administrator for its expenses, we will indirectly bear such cost. The Administration Agreement may be terminated by either party with 60 days’ written notice.



Our Administrator engaged U.S. Bank Global Fund Services under a sub-administration agreement to assist the Administrator in performing certain of its administrative duties. The Administrator may enter into additional sub-administration agreements with third-parties to perform other administrative and professional services on behalf of the Administrator.



Risk Management



Broad Diversification. We diversify our investments by company, asset type, investment size, industry and geography within the U.S. Furthermore, we must meet certain diversification tests in order to qualify as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes (the “Diversification Tests”). See “Item 1. Business — Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations.”



Hedging. We may hedge against interest rate fluctuations by using standard hedging instruments such as futures, options and forward contracts subject to the requirements of the 1940 Act and to applicable CFTC regulations. While hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates, they may also limit our ability to participate in benefits of such changes with respect to our portfolio of investments. The Advisor will claim relief from CFTC registration and regulation as a commodity pool operator with respect to our operations, with the result that we will be limited in our ability to use futures contracts or options on futures contracts or engage in swap transactions. Specifically, we will be subject to strict limitations on using such derivatives other than for hedging purposes, whereby the use of derivatives not used solely for hedging purposes is generally limited to situations where (i) the aggregate initial margin and premiums required to establish such positions do not exceed five percent of the liquidation value of our portfolio, after taking into account unrealized profits and unrealized losses on any such contracts we have entered into; or (ii) the aggregate net notional value of such derivatives does not exceed 100% of the liquidation value of our portfolio.

Regulation as a Business Development Company



General



A BDC is a specialized investment vehicle that elects to be regulated under the 1940 Act as an investment company but is generally subject to less onerous requirements than other registered investment companies under a regime designed to encourage lending to U.S.-based small and mid-sized businesses. Unlike many similar types of investment vehicles that are restricted to being private entities, the stock of a BDC is permitted to trade in the public equity markets. BDCs are also eligible to elect to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. A RIC typically does not incur significant entity-level income taxes, because it is generally entitled to deduct distributions made to its stockholders.
Qualifying Assets



Under the 1940 Act, a BDC may not acquire any asset other than assets of the type listed in Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, which are referred to as qualifying assets, unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the BDC’s total assets. The principal categories of qualifying assets relevant to our proposed business are the following:

(1) | Securities purchased in transactions not involving any public offering from the issuer of such securities, which issuer (subject to certain limited exceptions) is an eligible portfolio company, or from any person who is, or has been during the preceding 13 months, an affiliated person of an eligible portfolio company, or from any other person, subject to such rules as may be prescribed by the SEC. An eligible portfolio company is defined in the 1940 Act as any issuer which: 
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(a) | is organized under the laws of, and has its principal place of business in, the United States; 
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(b) | is not an investment company (other than a small business investment company wholly owned by the BDC) or a company that would be an investment company but for certain exclusions under the 1940 Act; and 
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(c) | satisfies either of the following: 
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(i) | does not have any class of securities listed on a national securities exchange or has any class of securities listed on a national securities exchange subject to a $250 million market capitalization maximum; or 
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(ii) | is controlled by a BDC or a group of companies including a BDC, the BDC actually exercises a controlling influence over the management or policies of the eligible portfolio company, and, as a result, the BDC has an affiliated person who is a director of the eligible portfolio company. 
-----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | Securities of any eligible portfolio company which we control. 
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------


(3) | Securities purchased in a private transaction from a U.S. issuer that is not an investment company or from an affiliated person of the issuer, or in transactions incident thereto, if the issuer is in bankruptcy and subject to reorganization or if the issuer, immediately prior to the purchase of its securities, was unable to meet its obligations as they came due without material assistance other than conventional lending or financing arrangements. 
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(4) | Securities of an eligible portfolio company purchased from any person in a private transaction if there is no ready market for such securities and we already own 60% of the outstanding equity of the eligible portfolio company. 
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(5) | Securities received in exchange for or distributed on or with respect to securities described in (1) through (4) above, or pursuant to the exercise of warrants or rights relating to such securities.

We may invest up to 30% of our portfolio opportunistically in “non-qualifying assets.”

Managerial Assistance to Portfolio Companies



In addition, a BDC must be organized and have its principal place of business in the United States and must be operated for the purpose of making investments in the types of securities described in (1), (2), or (3) above under “—Regulation as a Business Development Company—Qualifying Assets.” However, in order to count portfolio securities as qualifying assets for the purpose of the 70% test, the BDC must either control the issuer of the securities or must offer to make available to the issuer of the securities significant managerial assistance. However, when the BDC purchases securities in conjunction with one or more other persons acting together, one of the other persons in the group may make available such managerial assistance. Making available managerial assistance means, among other things, any arrangement whereby the BDC, through its directors, officers or employees, offers to provide, and, if accepted, does so provide, significant guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company.
Temporary Investments



Pending investment in other types of “qualifying assets,” as described above, our investments may consist of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment, which we refer to, collectively, as temporary investments, so that 70% of our assets are qualifying assets.
Senior Securities and Indebtedness



We will be permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of stock senior to our Shares if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least equal to 150% immediately after each such issuance. As defined in the 1940 Act, asset coverage of 150% means that for every $100 of net assets we hold, we may raise $200 from borrowing and issuing senior securities. We currently intend to target asset coverage of 200% to 180% (which equates to a debt-to-equity ratio of 1.0x to 1.25x) but may alter this target based on market conditions. In addition, while any senior securities remain outstanding, we must make provisions to prohibit any distribution to our stockholders or the repurchase of such securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the distribution or repurchase. We may also borrow amounts up to 5% of the value of our total assets for temporary or emergency purposes without regard to asset coverage. Regulations governing our operations as a BDC will affect our ability to raise, and the method of raising, additional capital, which may expose us to risks.
Codes of Ethics



We and our Advisor have adopted a code of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act that establishes procedures for personal investments and restricts certain personal securities transactions. Personnel subject to the joint code may invest in securities for their personal investment accounts, including securities that may be purchased or held by us, so long as such investments are made in accordance with the code’s requirements. In addition, we have adopted a code of ethics applicable to our Principal Executive Officer, Principal Accounting Officer and senior financial officers pursuant to Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2022. You may review or download the codes of ethics from the SEC’s Edgar database as part of our filings under www.sec.gov, or by written request to the following: Chief Compliance Officer, Kayne Anderson, 811 Main Street, 14th Floor, Houston, TX 77002.

Compliance Policies and Procedures



We make investments alongside certain entities and accounts advised by our Advisor and its affiliates. Under the 1940 Act, we are prohibited from knowingly participating in certain joint transactions with our affiliates without the prior approval of the independent directors and, in some cases, prior approval by the SEC. However, we generally make investments alongside affiliated entities and accounts pursuant to exemptive relief granted by the SEC to us, our Advisor, and certain of our affiliates on January 7, 2020. Pursuant to such exemptive relief, and subject to certain conditions, we are permitted to co-invest in the same security with our affiliates in a manner that is consistent with our investment objective, investment strategy, regulatory consideration and other relevant factors. If opportunities arise that would otherwise be appropriate for us and an affiliate to purchase different securities in the same issuer, our Advisor will need to decide which account will proceed with such investment. Our Advisor’s investment allocation policy incorporates the conditions of exemptive relief to seek to ensure that investment opportunities are allocated in a manner that is fair and equitable.



We will be periodically examined by the SEC for compliance with the 1940 Act.



We are required to provide and maintain a bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to protect us against larceny and embezzlement. Furthermore, as a BDC, we will be prohibited from protecting any director or officer against any liability to us or our stockholders arising from willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such person’s office.



We and our Advisor have adopted and implemented written policies and procedures reasonably designed to detect and prevent violation of the federal securities laws and will be required to review these compliance policies and procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation and designate a chief compliance officer to be responsible for administering the policies and procedures.



Sarbanes-Oxley Act



The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, imposes a variety of regulatory requirements on companies with a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act and their insiders. Many of these requirements affect us. For example:




● | pursuant to Rule 13a-14 under the Exchange Act our principal executive officer and principal financial officer must certify the accuracy of the financial statements contained in our periodic reports; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | pursuant to Item 307 under Regulation S-K under the Securities Act our periodic reports must disclose our conclusions about the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act, our management must prepare an annual report regarding its assessment of our internal control over financial reporting and (once we cease to be an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act, or if later, for the year following our first annual report required to be filed with the SEC as a public company) must obtain an audit of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting performed by its independent registered public accounting firm; and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | pursuant to Item 308 of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act and Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, our periodic reports must disclose whether there were significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect these controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation, including any corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires us to review our current policies and procedures to determine whether we comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the regulations promulgated under such act. We will continue to monitor our compliance with all regulations that are adopted under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and will take actions necessary to ensure that we comply with that act in the future.



JOBS Act



We currently are and expect to remain an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the “JOBS Act”), until the earliest of:




● | the last day of the fiscal year ending after the fifth anniversary of an Exchange Listing occurs; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the end of the fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues first exceed $1.07 billion; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the date on which we have, during the prior three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt; and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the last day of a fiscal year in which we (1) have an aggregate worldwide market value of our Shares held by non-affiliates of $700 million or more, computed at the end of each fiscal year as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter and (2) have been an Exchange Act reporting company for at least one year (and filed at least one annual report under the Exchange Act). 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------






10







Under the JOBS Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank”), we are exempt from the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which would require that our independent registered public accounting firm provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, until such time as we cease to be an emerging growth company and become an accelerated filer as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act. This may increase the risk that material weaknesses or other deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting go undetected.



Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have made an irrevocable election not to take advantage of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards. We therefore are subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.



Commodities Exchange Act



The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) and the SEC have issued final rules establishing that certain swap transactions are subject to CFTC regulation. Engaging in such swap transactions may cause us to fall within the definition of “commodity pool” under the Commodity Exchange Act and related CFTC regulations. The Advisor will rely on an exclusion from the definition of a CPO under CFTC Rule 4.5 because of our limited trading in commodity interests, and the Advisor will operate us as if we were not registered as a CPO, so that unlike a registered CPO, with respect to us, the Advisor is not required to deliver a Disclosure Document or an Annual Report (as those terms are used in the CFTC’s rules) to shareholders.
Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures



We have delegated our proxy voting responsibility to our Advisor. A summary of the Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures of our Advisor are set forth below. These policies and procedures will be reviewed periodically by our Advisor and, subsequent to our election to be regulated as a BDC, our non-interested directors, and, accordingly, are subject to change. For purposes of these Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures described below, “we” “our” and “us” refers to our Advisor.



An investment advisor registered under the Advisers Act has a fiduciary duty to act solely in the best interests of its clients. As part of this duty, we recognize that we must vote the Company’s securities in a timely manner free of conflicts of interest and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders.



These policies and procedures for voting proxies for our investment advisory clients are intended to comply with Section 206 of, and Rule 206(4)-6 under, the Advisers Act.



We will vote proxies relating to our portfolio securities in what we believe to be the best interest of our stockholders. To ensure that our vote is not the product of a conflict of interest, we will require that: (1) anyone involved in the decision making process disclose to our chief compliance officer any potential conflict that he or she is aware of and any contact that he or she has had with any interested party regarding a proxy vote; and (2) employees involved in the decision making process or vote administration are prohibited from revealing how we intend to vote on a proposal in order to reduce any attempted influence from interested parties.



You may obtain information about how we voted proxies by making a written request for proxy voting information to: KA Credit Advisors, LLC, 811 Main Street, 14th Floor, Houston, TX 77002, Attention: Chief Compliance Officer.



Employees



We do not have any employees. Our day-to-day investment operations are managed by our Advisor and the Administrator. Any compensation paid for services relating to our financial reporting and compliance functions will be paid by our Administrator, subject to reimbursement by us of an allocable portion of office facilities, overhead, and compensation paid to or compensatory distributions received by our officers (including our Chief Compliance Officer and Chief Financial Officer) and their respective staff who provide services to us. As we reimburse the Administrator for its expenses, we will indirectly bear such cost.



Our Administrator engaged U.S. Bank Global Fund Services under a sub-administration agreement to assist the Administrator in performing certain of its administrative duties. The Administrator may enter into additional sub-administration agreements with third-parties to perform other administrative and professional services on behalf of the Administrator. We will pay the fees associated with such functions on a direct basis without profit to our Administrator.



Privacy Principles



We are committed to maintaining the privacy of our investors and to safeguarding their non-public personal information. The following information is provided to help you understand what personal information we collect, how we protect that information and why, in certain cases, we may share information with select other parties.



We do not disclose any non-public personal information about our stockholders or a former stockholder to anyone, except as permitted by law or as is necessary in order to service stockholder accounts (for example, to a transfer agent or third-party administrator).



We restrict access to non-public personal information about our stockholders to employees of our Advisor and its affiliates with a legitimate business need for the information. We will maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards designed to protect the non-public personal information of our stockholders.





11







Reporting Obligations



As a BDC, we make available on our website (www.kaynebdc.com) our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and our current reports on Form 8-K. Shareholders and the public may also read and copy any materials we file with the SEC at the SEC’s Public Reference Room, 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549 and on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. Information on the operation of the SEC’s public reference room may be obtained by calling the SEC at (202) 551-8090 or (800) SEC-0330. The reference to our website and the SEC’s website is an inactive textual reference only, and the information should not be considered a part of this Form 10-K.
Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations



The following discussion is a general summary of the material U.S. federal income tax considerations applicable to us and to an investment in our Shares. This summary does not purport to be a complete description of the U.S. federal income tax considerations applicable to such an investment. For example, we have not described certain considerations that may be relevant to certain types of holders subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws, including persons who hold our common stock as part of a straddle or hedging, integrated or constructive sale transaction, stockholders subject to the alternative minimum tax, tax-exempt organizations, insurance companies, brokers or dealers in securities, traders in securities that elect to mark-to-market their securities holdings, pension plans and trusts, persons that have a functional currency (as defined in Section 985 of the Code) other than the U.S. dollar, U.S. expatriates, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, personal holding companies, persons who acquire an interest in the Company in connection with the performance of services and financial institutions. Such persons should consult with their own tax advisers as to the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in our Shares, which may differ substantially from those described herein. This summary assumes that investors hold our Shares as capital assets (within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code).



The discussion is based upon the Code, Treasury regulations, and administrative and judicial interpretations, each as of the date of the filing of this annual report on Form 10-K and all of which are subject to change, possibly retroactively, which could affect the continuing validity of this discussion. We have not sought and will not seek any ruling from the Internal Revenue Service, or the IRS, regarding any offering of our Shares. This summary does not discuss any aspects of U.S. estate or gift tax or foreign, state or local tax. It does not discuss the special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws that could result if we invested in tax-exempt securities or certain other investment assets. For purposes of this discussion, references to “dividends” are to dividends within the meaning of the U.S. federal income tax laws and associated regulations and may include amounts subject to treatment as a return of capital under section 19(a) of the 1940 Act. A return of capital distribution is a return to stockholders of a portion of their original investment in the Company and does not represent income or capital gains.



A “U.S. stockholder” is a beneficial owner of our Shares that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes:




● | a citizen or individual resident of the United States;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


● | a corporation, or other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a trust if either a U.S. court can exercise primary supervision over its administration and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all of its substantial decisions or the trust was in existence on August 20, 1996, was treated as a U.S. person prior to that date, and has made a valid election to be treated as a U.S. person. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




A “non-U.S. stockholder” is a beneficial owner of our Shares that is neither a U.S. stockholder nor a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.



If a partnership (including an entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) holds Shares, the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. A prospective investor that is a partner in a partnership that will hold Shares should consult its tax advisors with respect to the purchase, ownership and disposition of Shares.



Tax matters are very complicated and the tax consequences to an investor of an investment in our Shares will depend on the facts of his, her or its particular situation. We encourage investors to consult their own tax advisors regarding the specific consequences of such an investment, including tax reporting requirements, the applicability of U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax laws, eligibility for the benefits of any applicable tax treaty, and the effect of any possible changes in the tax laws.





12







Election to Be Taxed as a RIC



We intend to elect to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As a RIC, we generally will not have to pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any net ordinary income or capital gains that we timely distribute to our stockholders as dividends. To qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements (as described below). In addition, to qualify for RIC treatment, we must distribute to our stockholders, for each taxable year, dividends of an amount at least equal to the sum of 90% of our “investment company taxable income,” which is generally our net ordinary income plus the excess of realized net short-term capital gains over realized net long-term capital losses and determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid, and 90% of our net tax-exempt interest income, if any (the “Annual Distribution Requirement”). Although not required for us to maintain our RIC tax status, in order to preclude the imposition of a 4% nondeductible federal excise tax imposed on RICs, we must distribute to our stockholders in respect of each calendar year dividends of an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98% of our net ordinary income (taking into account certain deferrals and elections) for the calendar year, (2) 98.2% of the excess (if any) of our realized capital gains over our realized capital losses, or capital gain net income (adjusted for certain ordinary losses), generally for the one-year period ending on October 31 of the calendar year and (3) the sum of any net ordinary income plus capital gains net income for preceding years that were not distributed during such years and on which we paid no federal income tax (the “Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement”).



Taxation as a RIC



If we:




● | qualify as a RIC; and
--+----------------------


● | satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement;
--+---------------------------------------------






then we will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of our investment company taxable income and net capital gain, defined as net long-term capital gains in excess of net short-term capital losses, we distribute to stockholders. As a RIC, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate rates on any net income or net capital gain not distributed (or deemed distributed) as dividends to our stockholders.



In order to qualify as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must, among other things:




● | have in effect an election to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act at all times during each taxable year; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | derive in each taxable year at least 90% of our gross income from dividends, interest, payments with respect to certain securities loans, gains from the sale of stock or other securities, or other income derived with respect to our business of investing in such stock or securities, or currencies, other income derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock, securities or currencies and net income derived from interests in “qualified publicly traded partnerships” (partnerships that are traded on an established securities market or tradable on a secondary market, other than partnerships that derive 90% of their income from interest, dividends and other permitted RIC income) (the “90% Income Test”); and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------






13








● | diversify our holdings so that at the end of each quarter of the taxable year: 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | at least 50% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities, securities of other RICs, and other securities if such other securities of any one issuer do not represent more than 5% of the value of our assets or more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | no more than 25% of the value of our assets is invested in the securities, other than U.S. government securities or securities of other RICs, of one issuer or of two or more issuers that are controlled, as determined under applicable tax rules, by us and that are engaged in the same or similar or related trades or businesses or in the securities of one or more qualified publicly traded partnerships. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




We may be required to recognize taxable income in circumstances in which we do not receive cash. For example, if we hold debt obligations that are treated under applicable tax rules as having original issue discount (such as debt instruments with PIK interest or, in certain cases, increasing interest rates or issued with warrants), we must include in income each year a portion of the original issue discount that accrues over the life of the obligation, regardless of whether cash representing such income is received by us in the same taxable year. We may also have to include in income other amounts that we have not yet received in cash, such as PIK interest and deferred loan origination fees that are paid after origination of the loan. Because any original issue discount or other amounts accrued will be included in our investment company taxable income for the year of accrual, we may be required to make a distribution to our shareholders in order to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, even though we will not have received the corresponding cash amount.



We may invest in partnerships, including qualified publicly traded partnerships, which may result in our being subject to state, local or foreign income, franchise or other tax liabilities.



In addition, as a RIC, we are subject to ordinary income and capital gain distribution requirements under U.S. federal excise tax rules for each calendar year (as discussed above). If we do not meet the required distributions, we will be subject to a 4% nondeductible federal excise tax on the undistributed amount. The failure to meet U.S. federal excise tax distribution requirements will not cause us to lose our RIC status. Although we currently intend to make sufficient distributions each taxable year to satisfy the U.S. federal excise tax requirements, under certain circumstances, we may choose to retain taxable income or capital gains in excess of current year distributions into the next tax year in an amount less than what would trigger payments of federal income tax under Subchapter M of the Code. We may then be required to pay a 4% excise tax on such income or capital gains.



A RIC is limited in its ability to deduct expenses in excess of its investment company taxable income. If our deductible expenses in a given taxable year exceed our investment company taxable income, we may incur a net operating loss for that taxable year. However, a RIC is not permitted to carry forward net operating losses to subsequent taxable years and such net operating losses do not pass through to its stockholders. In addition, deductible expenses can be used only to offset investment company taxable income, not net capital gain. A RIC may not use any net capital losses (that is, the excess of realized capital losses over realized capital gains) to offset its investment company taxable income, but may carry forward such net capital losses, and use them to offset future capital gains, indefinitely. Due to these limits on deductibility of expenses and net capital losses, we may for tax purposes have aggregate taxable income for several taxable years that we are required to distribute and that is taxable to our stockholders even if such taxable income is greater than the net income we actually earn during those taxable years.





14







Any underwriting fees paid by us with respect to our own stock are not deductible. We may be required to recognize taxable income in circumstances in which we do not receive cash. For example, if we hold debt obligations that are treated under applicable tax rules as having OID (such as debt instruments with PIK interest or, in certain cases, with increasing interest rates or issued with warrants), we must include in income each year a portion of the OID that accrues over the life of the obligation, regardless of whether cash representing such income is received by us in the same taxable year. Because any OID accrued will be included in our investment company taxable income for the taxable year of accrual, we may be required to make a distribution to our stockholders in order to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, even though we will not have received any corresponding cash amount. Furthermore, a portfolio company in which we hold equity or debt instruments may face financial difficulty that requires us to work out, modify, or otherwise restructure such equity or debt instruments. Any such restructuring could, depending upon the terms of the restructuring, cause us to incur unusable or nondeductible losses or recognize future non-cash taxable income.



Certain of our investment practices may be subject to special and complex U.S. federal income tax provisions that may, among other things, (1) treat dividends that would otherwise constitute qualified dividend income as non-qualified dividend income, (2) treat dividends that would otherwise be eligible for the corporate dividends received deduction as ineligible for such treatment, (3) disallow, suspend or otherwise limit the allowance of certain losses or deductions, (4) convert lower-taxed long-term capital gain into higher-taxed short-term capital gain or ordinary income, (5) convert an ordinary loss or a deduction into a capital loss (the deductibility of which is more limited), (6) cause us to recognize income or gain without a corresponding receipt of cash, (7) adversely affect the time as to when a purchase or sale of stock or securities is deemed to occur, (8) adversely alter the characterization of certain complex financial transactions and (9) produce income that will not be qualifying income for purposes of the 90% Income Test. We intend to monitor our transactions and may make certain tax elections to mitigate the effect of these provisions and prevent our ability to be subject to tax as a RIC.



Gain or loss realized by us from warrants acquired by us as well as any loss attributable to the lapse of such warrants generally will be treated as capital gain or loss. Such gain or loss generally will be long term or short term, depending on how long we held a particular warrant.



Although we do not presently expect to do so, we are authorized to borrow funds and to sell assets in order to satisfy distribution requirements. However, under the 1940 Act, we are not permitted to make distributions to our stockholders while our debt obligations and other senior securities are outstanding unless certain “asset coverage” tests are met. See “Item 1. Business — Regulation as a Business Development Company — Senior Securities and Indebtedness.” Moreover, our ability to dispose of assets to meet our distribution requirements may be limited by (1) the illiquid nature of our portfolio and/or (2) other requirements relating to our qualification as a RIC, including the Diversification Tests. If we dispose of assets in order to meet the Annual Distribution Requirement or the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement, we may make such dispositions at times that, from an investment standpoint, are not advantageous.



Some of the income and fees that we may recognize, such as fees for providing managerial assistance, certain fees earned with respect to our investments, income recognized in a work-out or restructuring of a portfolio investment, or income recognized from an equity investment in an operating partnership, will not satisfy the 90% Income Test. In order to manage the risk that such income and fees might disqualify us as a RIC for a failure to satisfy the 90% Income Test, we may be required to recognize such income and fees indirectly through one or more entities treated as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes (therefore, received amounts treated as dividends of such corporations). Such corporations will be required to pay U.S. corporate income tax on their earnings, which ultimately will reduce our return on such income and fees.



Failure to Qualify as a RIC



If we were unable to qualify for treatment as a RIC and are unable to cure the failure, for example, by disposing of certain investments quickly or raising additional capital to prevent the loss of RIC status, we would be subject to tax on all of our taxable income at regular corporate rates. The Code provides some relief from RIC disqualification due to failures to comply with the 90% Income Test and the Diversification Tests, although there may be additional taxes due in such cases. We cannot assure you that we would qualify for any such relief should we fail the 90% Income Test or the Diversification Tests.



Should failure occur, not only would all our taxable income be subject to tax at regular corporate rates, we would not be able to deduct dividend distributions to stockholders, nor would they be required to be made. Distributions, including distributions of net long-term capital gain, would generally be taxable to our stockholders as ordinary dividend income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits. Subject to certain limitations under the Code, certain corporate stockholders would be eligible to claim a dividends received deduction with respect to such dividends and non-corporate stockholders would generally be able to treat such dividends as “qualified dividend income,” which is subject to reduced rates of U.S. federal income tax. Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits would be treated first as a return of capital to the extent of the stockholder’s tax basis, and any remaining distributions would be treated as a capital gain. If we fail to qualify as a RIC, we may be subject to regular corporate tax on any net built-in gains with respect to certain of our assets (i.e., the excess of the aggregate gains, including items of income, over aggregate losses that would have been realized with respect to such assets if we had been liquidated) that we elect to recognize on requalification or when recognized over the next five taxable years.



The remainder of this discussion assumes that we qualify as a RIC and have satisfied the Annual Distribution Requirement for each taxable year.





15







Taxation of U.S. Stockholders



Distributions by us generally are taxable to U.S. stockholders as ordinary income or capital gains. Distributions of our “investment company taxable income” (which is, generally, our net ordinary income plus net short-term capital gains in excess of net long-term capital losses) will be taxable as ordinary income to U.S. stockholders to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, whether paid in cash or reinvested in additional Shares. To the extent such distributions paid by us to non-corporate stockholders (including individuals) are attributable to dividends from U.S. corporations and certain qualified foreign corporations and if certain holding period requirements are met, such distributions generally will be treated as qualified dividend income and generally eligible for a maximum U.S. federal tax rate of either 15% or 20%, depending on whether the individual stockholder’s income exceeds certain threshold amounts, and if other applicable requirements are met, such distributions generally will be eligible for the corporate dividends received deduction to the extent such dividends have been paid by a U.S. corporation. In this regard, it is anticipated that distributions paid by us will generally not be attributable to dividends and, therefore, generally will not qualify for the preferential maximum U.S. federal tax rate applicable to non-corporate stockholders as well as will not be eligible for the corporate dividends received deduction.



Distributions of our net capital gains (which is generally our realized net long-term capital gains in excess of realized net short-term capital losses) properly reported by us as “capital gain dividends” will be taxable to a U.S. stockholder as long-term capital gains (currently generally at a maximum rate of either 15% or 20%, depending on whether the individual stockholder’s income exceeds certain threshold amounts) in the case of individuals, trusts or estates, regardless of the U.S. stockholder’s holding period for his, her or its Shares and regardless of whether paid in cash or reinvested in additional Shares. Distributions in excess of our earnings and profits first will reduce a U.S. stockholder’s adjusted tax basis in such stockholder’s Shares and, after the adjusted basis is reduced to zero, will constitute capital gains to such U.S. stockholder. Stockholders receiving dividends or distributions in the form of additional Shares purchased in the market should be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as receiving a distribution in an amount equal to the amount of money that the stockholders receiving cash dividends or distributions will receive, and should have a cost basis in the shares received equal to such amount. Stockholders receiving dividends in newly issued Shares will be treated as receiving a distribution equal to the value of the shares received and should have a cost basis of such amount.



Although we currently intend to distribute any net capital gains at least annually, we may in the future decide to retain some or all of our net capital gains but designate the retained amount as a “deemed distribution.” In that case, among other consequences, we will pay tax on the retained amount, each U.S. stockholder will be required to include their share of the deemed distribution in income as if it had been distributed to the U.S. stockholder, and the U.S. stockholder will be entitled to claim a credit or refund equal to their allocable share of the tax paid on the deemed distribution by us. The amount of the deemed distribution net of such tax will be added to the U.S. stockholder’s tax basis for their Shares. Since we expect to pay tax on any retained net capital gains at our regular corporate tax rate, and since that rate is in excess of the maximum rate currently payable by individuals on long-term capital gains, the amount of tax that individual stockholders will be treated as having paid and for which they will receive a credit or refund will exceed the tax they owe on the retained net capital gain. Such excess generally may be claimed as a credit against the U.S. stockholder’s other U.S. federal income tax obligations or may be refunded to the extent it exceeds a stockholder’s liability for U.S. federal income tax. A stockholder that is not subject to U.S. federal income tax or otherwise required to file a U.S. federal income tax return would be required to file a U.S. federal income tax return on the appropriate form in order to claim a refund for the taxes we paid. In order to utilize the deemed distribution approach, we must provide written notice to our stockholders prior to the expiration of 60 days after the close of the relevant taxable year. We cannot treat any of our investment company taxable income as a “deemed distribution.”

For purposes of determining (1) whether the Annual Distribution Requirement is satisfied for any tax year and (2) the amount of capital gain dividends paid for that tax year, we may, under certain circumstances, elect to treat a dividend that is paid during the following tax year as if it had been paid during the tax year in question. If we make such an election, the U.S. stockholder will still be treated as receiving the dividend in the tax year in which the distribution is made. However, any dividend declared by us in October, November or December of any calendar year, payable to stockholders of record on a specified date in such a month and actually paid during January of the following calendar year, will be treated as if it had been received by our U.S. stockholders on December 31 of the calendar year in which the dividend was declared.



With respect to the reinvestment of dividends, if a U.S. Shareholder owns Shares registered in its own name, the U.S. Shareholder will have all cash distributions automatically reinvested in additional Shares unless the U.S. Shareholder opts out of the reinvestment of dividends by delivering a written notice to our dividend paying agent prior to the record date of the next dividend or distribution. Any distributions reinvested will nevertheless remain taxable to the U.S. Shareholder. The U.S. Shareholder will have an adjusted basis in the additional Shares purchased through the reinvestment equal to the amount of the reinvested distribution. The additional Shares will have a new holding period commencing on the day following the day on which the shares are credited to the U.S. Shareholder’s account.



If an investor purchases Shares shortly before the record date of a distribution, the price of the Shares will include the value of the distribution and the investor will be subject to tax on the distribution even though it represents a return of their investment.



A stockholder generally will recognize taxable gain or loss if the stockholder sells or otherwise disposes of their Shares. Any gain arising from such sale or disposition generally will be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if the stockholder has held their Shares for more than one year. Otherwise, it would be classified as short-term capital gain or loss. However, any capital loss arising from the sale or disposition of Shares held for six months or less will be treated as long-term capital loss to the extent of the amount of capital gain dividends received, or undistributed capital gain deemed received, with respect to such Shares. In addition, all or a portion of any loss recognized upon a disposition of Shares may be disallowed if other Shares are purchased (whether through reinvestment of distributions or otherwise) within 30 days before or after the disposition. In such a case, the basis of Shares acquired will be increased to reflect the disallowed loss.



In general, individual U.S. stockholders are subject to a maximum U.S. federal income tax rate of either 15% or 20% (depending on whether the individual U.S. stockholder’s income exceeds certain threshold amounts) on their net capital gain, i.e., the excess of realized net long-term capital gain over realized net short-term capital loss for a taxable year, including a long-term capital gain derived from an investment in our Shares. Such rate is lower than the maximum federal income tax rate on ordinary taxable income currently payable by individuals. Corporate U.S. stockholders currently are subject to U.S. federal income tax on net capital gain at the maximum 21% rate also applied to ordinary income. Non-corporate stockholders incurring net capital losses for a tax year (i.e., net capital losses in excess of net capital gains) generally may deduct up to $3,000 of such losses against their ordinary income each tax year; any net capital losses of a non-corporate stockholder in excess of $3,000 generally may be carried forward and used in subsequent tax years as provided in the Code. Corporate stockholders generally may not deduct any net capital losses for a tax year, but may carry back such losses for three tax years or carry forward such losses for five tax years.



We will send to each of our U.S. stockholders, as promptly as possible after the end of each calendar year, a notice detailing, on a per share and per distribution basis, the amounts includible in such U.S. stockholder’s taxable income for such year as ordinary income and as long-term capital gain. In addition, the U.S. federal tax status of each calendar year’s distributions generally will be reported to the IRS. Distributions may also be subject to additional state, local and foreign taxes depending on a U.S. stockholder’s particular situation. Dividends distributed by us generally will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction or the lower tax rates applicable to certain qualified dividends.



Until and unless we are treated as a “publicly offered regulated investment company” (within the meaning of Section 67 of the Code) as a result of either (1) Shares and our preferred stock collectively being held by at least 500 persons at all times during a taxable year, (2) our Shares being continuously offered pursuant to a public offering (within the meaning of Section 4 of the Securities Act) or (3) Shares being treated as regularly traded on an established securities market for any taxable year, for purposes of computing the taxable income of U.S. stockholders that are individuals, trusts or estates, (1) our earnings will be computed without taking into account such U.S. stockholders’ allocable shares of the management and incentive fees paid to our investment advisor and certain of our other expenses, (2) each such U.S. stockholder will be treated as having received or accrued a dividend from us in the amount of such U.S. stockholder’s allocable share of these fees and expenses for such taxable year, (3) each such U.S. stockholder will be treated as having paid or incurred such U.S. stockholder’s allocable share of these fees and expenses for the calendar year and (4) each such U.S. stockholder’s allocable share of these fees and expenses may be treated as miscellaneous itemized deductions by such U.S. stockholder. Miscellaneous itemized deductions are generally not deductible by a U.S. stockholder that is an individual, trust or estate through 2025 and beginning in 2026 and deductible only to the extent that the aggregate of such U.S. stockholder’s miscellaneous itemized deductions exceeds 2% of such U.S. stockholder’s adjusted gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Miscellaneous itemized deductions are not deductible at any time for purposes of the alternative minimum tax for individuals and will be subject an annual cap for income tax purposes for individuals beginning in 2026.

Backup withholding, currently at a rate of 24%, may be applicable to all taxable distributions to any non-corporate U.S. stockholder (1) who fails to furnish us with a correct taxpayer identification number or a certificate that such stockholder is exempt from backup withholding or (2) with respect to whom the IRS notifies us that such stockholder has failed to properly report certain interest and dividend income to the IRS and to respond to notices to that effect. An individual’s taxpayer identification number is his or her social security number. Any amount withheld under backup withholding is allowed as a credit against the U.S. stockholder’s U.S. federal income tax liability and may entitle such stockholder to a refund, provided that proper information is timely provided to the IRS.



If a U.S. stockholder recognizes a loss with respect to Shares of $2 million or more for an individual stockholder or $10 million or more for a corporate stockholder, the stockholder must file with the IRS a disclosure statement on Form 8886. Direct stockholders of portfolio securities are in many cases exempted from this reporting requirement, but under current guidance, stockholders of a RIC are not exempted. The fact that a loss is reportable under these regulations does not affect the legal determination of whether the taxpayer’s treatment of the loss is proper. U.S. stockholders should consult their tax advisors to determine the applicability of these regulations in light of their specific circumstances.



A U.S. Shareholder that is a tax-exempt organization for U.S. federal income tax purposes and therefore generally exempt from U.S. federal income taxation may nevertheless be subject to taxation to the extent that it is considered to derive unrelated business taxable income (“UBTI”). The direct conduct by a tax-exempt U.S. Shareholder of the activities we propose to conduct could give rise to UBTI. However, a BDC (and RIC) is a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes and its business activities generally will not be attributed to its shareholders for purposes of determining their treatment under current law. Therefore, a tax-exempt U.S. Shareholder generally should not be subject to U.S. taxation solely as a result of the shareholder’s ownership of our Shares and receipt of dividends with respect to such common stock. Moreover, under current law, if we incur indebtedness, such indebtedness will not be attributed to a tax-exempt U.S. Shareholder. Therefore, a tax-exempt U.S. Shareholder should not be treated as earning income from “debt-financed property” and dividends we pay should not be treated as “unrelated debt-financed income” solely as a result of indebtedness that we incur. Legislation has been introduced in Congress in the past, and may be introduced again in the future, which would change the treatment of “blocker” investment vehicles interposed between tax-exempt investors and non-qualifying investments if enacted. In the event that any such proposals were to be adopted and applied to BDCs (and RICs), the treatment of dividends payable to tax-exempt investors could be adversely affected. In addition, special rules would apply if we were to invest in certain real estate mortgage investment conduits, which we do not currently plan to do, that could result in a tax-exempt U.S. Shareholder recognizing income that would be treated as UBTI.



An additional 3.8% federal tax is imposed on certain net investment income (including ordinary dividends and capital gain distributions received from us and net gains from redemptions or other taxable dispositions of our shares) of U.S. individuals, estates and trusts to the extent that such person’s “modified adjusted gross income” (in the case of an individual) or “adjusted gross income” (in the case of an estate or trust) exceed certain threshold amounts.



Taxation of Non-U.S. Stockholders



The following discussion only applies to certain non-U.S. stockholders. Whether an investment in the Shares is appropriate for a non-U.S. stockholder will depend upon that person’s particular circumstances. An investment in the Shares by a non-U.S. stockholder may have adverse tax consequences. Non-U.S. stockholders should consult their tax advisors before investing in our Shares.



Subject to the discussion below, distributions of our “investment company taxable income” to non-U.S. stockholders (including interest income, net short-term capital gain or foreign-source dividend and interest income, which generally would be free of withholding if paid to non-U.S. stockholders directly) will be subject to withholding of U.S. federal tax at a 30% rate (or lower rate provided by an applicable treaty) to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits unless the distributions are effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business of the non-U.S. stockholder (and, if treaty applies, are attributable to a U.S. permanent establishment of the non-U.S. stockholder), in which case the distributions will generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the rates applicable to U.S. persons. In that case, we will not be required to withhold U.S. federal tax if the non-U.S. stockholder complies with applicable certification and disclosure requirements such as providing IRS Form W-8ECI). Special certification requirements apply to a non-U.S. stockholder that is a foreign partnership or a foreign trust, and such entities are urged to consult their own tax advisors.

Certain properly reported dividends received by a non-U.S. stockholder generally are exempt from U.S. federal withholding tax when they (1) are paid in respect of our “qualified net interest income” (generally, our U.S. source interest income, other than certain contingent interest and interest from obligations of a corporation or partnership in which we are at least a 10% stockholder, reduced by expenses that are allocable to such income), or (2) are paid in connection with our “qualified short-term capital gains” (generally, the excess of our net short-term capital gain over our long-term capital loss for a tax year) as well as if certain other requirements are satisfied. Nevertheless, it should be noted that in the case of shares of our stock held through an intermediary, the intermediary may have withheld U.S. federal income tax even if we reported the payment as an interest-related dividend or short-term capital gain dividend. Moreover, depending on the circumstances, we may report all, some or none of our potentially eligible dividends as derived from such qualified net interest income or as qualified short-term capital gains, or treat such dividends, in whole or in part, as ineligible for this exemption from withholding.



Actual or deemed distributions of our net capital gains to a non-U.S. stockholder, and gains realized by a non-U.S. stockholder upon the sale of our Shares, will not be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax and generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless the distributions or gains, as the case may be, are effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business of the non-U.S. stockholder and, if an income tax treaty applies, are attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the non-U.S. stockholder in the United States or, in the case of an individual non-U.S. stockholder, the stockholder is present in the United States for 183 days or more during the year of the sale or capital gain dividend and certain other conditions are met.



If we distribute our net capital gains in the form of deemed rather than actual distributions (which we may do in the future), a non-U.S. stockholder will be entitled to a U.S. federal income tax credit or tax refund equal to the stockholder’s allocable share of the tax we pay on the capital gains deemed to have been distributed. In order to obtain the refund, the non-U.S. stockholder must obtain a U.S. taxpayer identification number and file a U.S. federal income tax return even if the non-U.S. stockholder would not otherwise be required to obtain a U.S. taxpayer identification number or file a U.S. federal income tax return. For a corporate non-U.S. stockholder, distributions (both actual and deemed), and gains realized upon the sale of our Shares that are effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business may, under certain circumstances, be subject to an additional “branch profits tax” at a 30% rate (or at a lower rate if provided for by an applicable treaty).



A non-U.S. stockholder who is a non-resident alien individual, and who is otherwise subject to withholding of U.S. federal income tax, may be subject to information reporting and backup withholding of U.S. federal income tax on dividends unless the non-U.S. stockholder provides us or the dividend paying agent with a U.S. nonresident withholding tax certification (e.g., an IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E, or an acceptable substitute form) or otherwise meets documentary evidence requirements for establishing that it is a non-U.S. stockholder or otherwise establishes an exemption from backup withholding.



Withholding of U.S. tax (at a 30% rate) is required by the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, or FATCA, provisions of the Code with respect to payments of dividends made to certain non-U.S. entities that fail to comply (or be deemed compliant) with extensive new reporting and withholding requirements designed to inform the U.S. Department of the Treasury of U.S.-owned foreign investment accounts. Under proposed U.S. Treasury regulations, which may be relied upon until final U.S. Treasury regulations are published, there is no FATCA withholding on gross proceeds from the sale of disposition of Shares or on certain capital gain distributions. Stockholders may be requested to provide additional information to enable the applicable withholding agent to determine whether withholding is required.



An investment in shares by a non-U.S. person may also be subject to U.S. federal estate tax. Non-U.S. persons should consult their own tax advisors with respect to the U.S. federal income tax, U.S. federal estate tax, withholding tax, and state, local and foreign tax consequences of acquiring, owning or disposing of our Shares.
