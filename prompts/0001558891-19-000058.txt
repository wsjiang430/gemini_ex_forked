Forward-Looking Statements
 
This Annual Report on Form 10-K includes a number of forward-looking statements that reflect management’s current views with respect to future events and financial performance. Forward-looking statements are projections in respect of future events or our future financial performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as “may,” “should,” “expects,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “predicts,” “potential” or “continue” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. Those statements include statements regarding the intent, belief or current expectations of us and members of our management team as well as the assumptions on which such statements are based. Prospective investors are cautioned that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risk and uncertainties, and that actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements. Based on the discontinuation of our former business plan, our current business model is to identify a viable business operation that can merge with our company. Any forward-looking statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K regarding this should be read with a view that such transaction may not occur in the near term or at all.
 
These statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors. Readers are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us in this Annual Report and in our other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We undertake no obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of unanticipated events or changes in the future operating results over time except as required by law. We believe that our assumptions are based upon reasonable data derived from and known about our business and operations. No assurances are made that actual results of operations or the results of our future activities will not differ materially from our assumptions.
 
As used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and unless otherwise indicated, the terms “Intellisense,” “we,” “us,” “our,” or the “Company” refer to Intellisense Solutions Inc. Unless otherwise specified, all dollar amounts are expressed in United States dollars.
 
Corporate History and Overview 
 
We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on March 22, 2013 with 75,000,000 shares authorized. We were initially engaged in the business of developing web portals to allow companies and individuals to engage in the purchase and sale of vegetarian food products over the Internet. However, were not able to execute our original business plan, develop significant operations or achieve commercial sales. We currently are pursuing acquiring or merging with an entity with significant operations in order to create a viable business model and value for our shareholders.
 
We received initial funding in March 2014 of $19,980 through the sale of common stock to our two former officers and directors, who purchased an aggregate of 1,998,000 shares at $0.01 per share.
 
From May 2018 through March 2019, the Company issued promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of $170,000 to six investors, Amir Uziel, Lavi Krasney, L.I.A. Pure Capital Ltd., Nir Reinhold, Attibute Ltd and Yaad Consulting & Management Services (1995) Ltd. (“Yaad”) The notes accrue interest at a rate of 8% per annum and are each due on September 30, 2019.
 On June 15, 2015, Neil Reithinger was appointed as President, Treasurer, Secretary and a director of the Company, and was the Company’s sole director and officer until his resignation on January 8, 2019. On that date Eyal Ben Ami was appointed President and served in such position until his resignation and the appointment of Idan Maimon as Chief Executive Officer of the Company on April 4, 2019. On November 2, 2018, Oded Gilboa was appointed Chief Financial Officer of the Company

On November 15, 2018, 1,998,000 shares or 79% of the Company's 2,529,680 then issued and outstanding shares were purchased by fourteen investors under a share Purchase Agreement from two previous controlling shareholders. One of the investors is currently a more than 10% shareholder.
 
Since inception, we have had limited operating activities, primarily consisting of the incorporation of our company, the initial equity funding by our officers and directors and designing our website.
 
Our financial statements from inception (March 22, 2013) through the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 report no revenues and an accumulated deficit of $244,993, working capital deficit is $171,845 and cash used from operating is $102,831. Our independent auditor issued an audit opinion for our Company for the year ended March 31, 2019, which includes a statement expressing substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.
 Proposed Merger and Subsequent Termination 
 
On December 11, 2015, the Company entered into a merger agreement with Dotz Nano Ltd. (“Dotz”), a private Israeli corporation and Intellisense (Israel) Ltd. (“Merger Sub”), an Israeli corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Pursuant to the merger agreement, the Merger Sub was to merge with and into Dotz and Dotz was to continue as the surviving corporation. On May 17, 2016, the Company terminated the contemplated merger transaction.
Canna Patch Ltd. Feasibility Study with Yissum
 
On January 10, 2019, we formed Canna Patch Ltd., an Israeli corporation (“Canna Patch”), which is 90% owned by the Company and 10% owned by Mr. Rafael Ezra, Canna Patch's chief technology officer. Canna Patch entered into a Research and Option Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Yissum Research Development Company of Hebrew University of Jerusalem Ltd. (“Yissum”), effective March 21, 2019. Pursuant to the Agreement, Canna Patch will fund a feasibility study (the “Study”) in the aggregate amount of $94,500 plus VAT relating to Yissum’s research concerning the development of a cannabis patch. The Study will be conducted in two stages, each of six months duration. Based upon the results of an interim study report (the “Interim Report”) at the end of the first stage, Canna Patch may determine whether to continue funding stage two whereupon Canna Patch will pay an additional $23,625 on the commencement of stage two and three months thereafter. In consideration for such financing, Canna Patch will have the option (the “Option”) for an exclusive, worldwide license to all work product and results of the Study, including all intellectual property in the field of systemic and trans-dermal and trans-mucosal delivery of cannabinoids using exudates-based formulations. If Canna Patch exercises the Option, it will be responsible for the costs of any patent filings, maintenance and prosecution.
 
In addition, under the Agreement Canna Patch has the right of first review of any newly developed use of the patch used in Yissum’s research to deliver chemical constitutes other than cannabis.
 
During the option exercise or negotiation period until the execution of a license agreement, Yissum will not enter into discussions or agreements with any third party or accept or negotiate any offer with respect to a transaction or any rights to or interests in the Study results.
 
The Agreement includes customary confidentiality provisions for the term of the Agreement and thereafter and provides that Canna Patch indemnifies Yissum and Hebrew University for any liability which is derived from Canna Patch’s use of the Study results. Either party may terminate the Agreement upon insolvency or bankruptcy or upon a breach that is not cured within 60 days of receipt of notice thereof. Yissum may terminate the Agreement upon 30 days prior written notice for (i) unauthorized early termination of the research or failure to fund the Study in accordance with the terms of the Agreement or (ii) upon attachment of Canna Patch’s assets or execution proceedings not set aside within 90 days. Canna Patch may terminate the Agreement after the first stage of the Study within 14 days of receipt of the Interim Report.
 
There can be no assurance that the results of the Study will be successful or that the Company will desire to enter into a license agreement. Even if successful, going forward, we may continue to seek, investigate and, if such investigation warrants, engage in a business combination with a private entity whose business presents an opportunity for our shareholders. Our objectives are extremely general and do not restrict the discretion of our board of directors to search for and enter into potential business opportunities or to reject any such opportunities.

We have no particular business combination in mind and have not entered into any negotiations regarding such a combination. Neither our officers nor any of our affiliates has engaged in any negotiations with any representative of any company regarding the possibility of an acquisition or combination between our company and such other company. We have not yet entered into any agreement, nor do we have any commitment or understanding to enter into or become engaged in a transaction.
 
We believe that there are numerous firms seeking the perceived benefits of a publicly registered corporation. These benefits are commonly thought to include:
 

· | the ability to use registered securities to acquire assets or businesses; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | increased visibility in the marketplace; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | greater ease of borrowing from financial institutions; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | improved stock trading efficiency; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | greater shareholder liquidity; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | greater ease in subsequently raising capital; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | ability to compensate key employees through stock options and other equity awards; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | enhanced corporate image; and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a presence in the United States capital markets. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We have not conducted market research and are not aware of statistical data to support the perceived benefits of a merger or acquisition transaction for the owners of a business opportunity.
 
A decision to participate or not in a specific business opportunity will be made based upon our analysis of the quality of the prospective business opportunity’s management and personnel, its assets, the anticipated acceptability of products or marketing concepts, the merit of a proposed business plan and numerous other factors that are difficult, if not impossible, to analyze using any objective criteria. We have unrestricted flexibility in seeking, analyzing and participating in potential business opportunities.
 
In our efforts to analyze potential acquisition targets, we may consider the following kinds of factors:
 

· | potential for growth, indicated by new technology, anticipated market expansion or new products; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | competitive position as compared to other firms of similar size and experience within the industry segment as well as within the industry as a whole; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | strength and diversity of management, either in place or scheduled for recruitment; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | capital requirements and anticipated availability of required funds, to be provided by us or from operations, through the sale of additional securities, through bank loans or other commercial borrowing arrangements, through joint ventures or similar arrangements or from other sources; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the cost of participation by us as compared to the perceived tangible and intangible values and potentials; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the extent to which the business opportunity can be advanced; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the accessibility of required management expertise, personnel, raw materials, services, professional assistance and other required items; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | other relevant factors. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------

In applying the foregoing criteria, no one of which will be controlling, management will attempt to analyze all factors and circumstances and make a determination based upon reasonable investigative measures and available data.
 
Potentially available business opportunities may occur in many different industries, and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex. Due to our limited capital available for investigation, we may not discover or adequately evaluate adverse facts about the opportunity to be acquired.
 
In implementing a structure for a particular business acquisition, we may become a party to a merger, consolidation, reorganization, joint venture, licensing agreement or other arrangement with another entity. We also may acquire stock or assets of an existing business. On the consummation of a transaction the present management and shareholders of the company may no longer be in control of the company. In addition, some or all of our officers and directors, as part of the terms of the acquisition transaction, may be required to resign and be replaced by one or more new officers and directors without a vote of our shareholders.
 
It is anticipated that any securities issued in any such reorganization would be issued in reliance upon exemption from registration under applicable federal and state securities laws. In some circumstances, however, as a negotiated element of a transaction, we may agree to register all or a part of such securities immediately after the transaction is consummated or at specified times thereafter. The issuance of substantial additional securities and their potential sale into any trading market which may develop in our securities may have a depressive effect on that market.
 
While the actual terms of a transaction to which we may be a party cannot be predicted, it may be expected that the parties to the business transaction will find it desirable to avoid the creation of a taxable event and thereby structure the acquisition as a “tax-free” reorganization under Sections 351 or 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
 
With respect to any merger or acquisition, negotiations with target company management are expected to focus on the percentage of our company that the target company shareholders would acquire in exchange for all of their shareholdings in the target company. Depending upon, among other things, the target company’s assets and liabilities, our existing shareholders may hold a substantially lesser percentage ownership interest in our company following any merger or acquisition. The percentage ownership of our existing shareholders may be subject to significant reduction in the event we acquire a target company with substantial assets. Any merger or acquisition effected by us can be expected to have a significant dilutive effect on the percentage of shares held by our shareholders at such time.
 
We will participate in a business opportunity only after the negotiation and execution of appropriate agreements. Although the terms of such agreements cannot be predicted, generally such agreements will require certain representations and warranties of the parties thereto, will specify certain events of default, will detail the terms of closing and the conditions which must be satisfied by the parties prior to and after such closing, will outline the manner of bearing costs, including costs associated with our attorneys and accountants, and will include miscellaneous other terms.
 
It is anticipated that the investigation of specific business opportunities and the negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents and other instruments will require substantial management time and attention and substantial cost for accountants, attorneys and others. If a decision is made not to participate in a specific business opportunity, the costs theretofore incurred in the related investigation would not be recoverable. Furthermore, even if an agreement is reached for the participation in a specific business opportunity, the failure to consummate that transaction may result in our loss of the related costs incurred.
 
We do not intend to undertake any efforts to cause a market to develop in our securities, either debt or equity, until we have successfully concluded a business combination.
 
Competition
 
We expect to encounter substantial competition in our efforts to identify and consummate a transaction with a business opportunity. The primary competition will be from other companies organized and funded for similar purposes, small venture capital partnerships and corporations, small business investment companies and wealthy individuals, all of which may have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do. In view of our limited financial resources and limited management availability, we may be at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors.
