 Our Strategy
     The Company’s overall strategy is to provide its customers with comprehensive design capabilities, a broad selection of products and a high level of service on a worldwide basis while maintaining continuing programs of productivity improvement and cost control.  Specifically, our business strategy is as follows:
· | Pursue broad diversification - The Company constantly drives to increase the diversity of its markets, customers, applications and products. Due to the tremendous variety of opportunities in the electronics industry, management believes that it is important to ensure participation wherever significant growth opportunities are available. This diversification positions us to proliferate our technologies across the broadest array of opportunities and reduces our exposure to any particular market, thereby reducing the variability of our financial performance. An overview of the Company’s market and product participation is described under “Markets”. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Develop performance-enhancing interconnect solutions - The Company seeks to expand the scope and number of its preferred supplier relationships. The Company works closely with its customers at the design stage to create and manufacture innovative solutions. These products generally have higher value-added content than other interconnect products and have been developed across the Company’s markets. The Company is focused on technology leadership in the interconnect areas of radio frequency, power, harsh environment, high-speed and fiber optics, as well as sensors, as it views these technology areas to be of particular importance to our global customer base.

--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Control costs - The Company recognizes the importance in today’s global marketplace of maintaining a competitive cost structure. Innovation, product quality and comprehensive customer service are not mutually exclusive with controlling costs. Controlling costs is part of a mindset. It is having the discipline to invest in programs that have a good return, maintaining a cost structure as flexible as possible to respond to changes in the marketplace, dealing with suppliers and vendors in a fair but prudent way to ensure a reasonable cost for materials and services and creating a mindset where managers manage the Company’s assets as if they were their own. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Pursue strategic acquisitions and investments - The Company believes that the industry in which it operates is highly fragmented and continues to provide significant opportunities for strategic acquisitions. Accordingly, we continue to pursue acquisitions of high-growth potential companies with strong management teams that complement our existing business while further expanding our product lines, technological capabilities and geographic presence. Furthermore, we seek to enhance the performance of acquired companies by leveraging Amphenol’s business strategy and access to low-cost manufacturing around the world. In 2018, the Company invested approximately $159 million to fund three acquisitions, while in 2017, the Company invested approximately $266 million to fund five acquisitions comprising seven businesses. Our acquisitions in 2018 and 2017 have strengthened our customer base and product offerings in many of our end markets. In addition, in January 2019, the Company acquired SSI Controls Technologies (“SSI”), the sensor manufacturing division of SSI Technologies, Inc., for approximately $400 million, net of cash acquired (subject to customary post-closing adjustments) plus a performance-related contingent payment. The acquisition of SSI is expected to strengthen our customer base and product offerings in our automotive and industrial end markets.

· | Foster collaborative, entrepreneurial management - Amphenol’s management system is designed to provide clear income statement and balance sheet responsibility in a flat organizational structure. Each general manager is incented to grow and develop his or her business and to think entrepreneurially in providing innovative, timely and cost-effective solutions to customer needs. In addition, Amphenol’s general managers have access to the resources of the larger organization and are encouraged to work collaboratively with other general managers to meet the needs of the expanding marketplace and to achieve common goals.
