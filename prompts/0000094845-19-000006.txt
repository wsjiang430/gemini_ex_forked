Item 1. | BUSINESS

Overview
From our California Gold Rush beginnings, we have grown into one of the world's largest brand-name apparel companies. A history of responsible business practices, rooted in our core values, has helped us build our brands and engender consumer trust around the world. Under our Levi's®, Dockers®, Signature by Levi Strauss & Co.™ and Denizen® brands, we design, market and sell – directly or through third parties and licensees – products that include jeans, casual and dress pants, tops, shorts, skirts, jackets, footwear, and related accessories for men, women and children around the world. 
Our Global Reach
Our products are sold in more than 110 countries, grouped into three geographic regions that comprise our three operating segments: the Americas, Europe and Asia (which includes the Middle East and Africa). We service our customers through our global infrastructure, developing, sourcing and marketing our products around the world. Although our brands are recognized as authentically "American," we derive approximately half of our net revenues from outside the United States. A summary of financial information for each regional operating segment is found in Note 19 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this report. As a global company with sales and operations in foreign countries, we are subject to risks of doing business in foreign countries. See "Item 1A – Risk Factors", specifically "Risks Relating to Our Industry – Our business is subject to risks associated with sourcing and manufacturing overseas, as well as risks associated with potential tariffs or a global trade war" and "Risks Relating to Our Business – We are a global company with significant revenues and earnings generated internationally, which exposes us to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, as well as political and economic risks."
Our products are sold in over 50,000 retail locations worldwide, including approximately 3,000 brand-dedicated stores and shop-in-shops. In the United States, chain retailers and department stores are the primary distribution channels for our Levi's® and Dockers® products. Outside the United States, department stores, specialty retailers, franchised or other brand-dedicated stores and shop-in-shops have traditionally been our primary distribution channels. Levi's® and Dockers® products are also sold through our brand-dedicated company-operated retail stores and through the e-commerce sites we operate, as well as the e-commerce sites operated by certain of our key wholesale customers and other third parties. We distribute Signature by Levi Strauss & Co.™ and Denizen® brand products primarily through mass channel retailers in the Americas.
We were founded in San Francisco, California in 1853 and were incorporated in Delaware in 1970. We conduct our operations outside the United States through foreign subsidiaries. We have headquarter offices in San Francisco, Brussels and Singapore. Our corporate offices are located at Levi's Plaza, 1155 Battery Street, San Francisco, California 94111, and our main telephone number is (415) 501-6000. 
We are a privately-held company and our common stock is primarily owned by descendants of the family of Levi Strauss and their relatives. 
Our website – www.levistrauss.com – contains additional and detailed information about our history, our products and our commitments. Financial news and reports and related information about our company can be found at http://levistrauss.com/investors/financial-news. Information contained on, or that can be accessed through, our website is not incorporated by reference into this report.
Our Business Strategies
Our growth and financial performance over the last several years has been the result of key growth strategies adopted by our management team, each of which is described in more detail below. We will continue to aggressively pursue our global market opportunity by executing these growth strategies and continuing to innovate throughout our business.
Drive the Profitable Core. Our core includes our most profitable and cash-generating businesses. Keeping these businesses healthy and growing is critical for funding expansion in other key growth areas.

• | Maintain and strengthen our longstanding leadership in men's bottoms. We are actively focused on maintaining and strengthening our men’s bottoms business, which has been and will continue to be a key driver of our operating results. Our iconic 501 jean continues to be a staple in closets around the world, and we continually find ways to update this fit to appeal to new consumers and remain relevant as tastes change. We are also introducing new products, such as updated straight leg and taper styles and fabrics with added stretch for greater comfort. Enhancing the fit, finish and fabric of our existing product offerings while continuing to introduce new styles enables us to appeal to younger

1

millennial customers and to capitalize on the ongoing consumer trend toward casualization in fashion. We will continue to be nimble and respond to evolving demographics and fashion trends while retaining our authentic heritage.

• | Expand and strengthen our established wholesale customer base. Our established wholesale customer base represents our largest distribution channel and will continue to represent a significant opportunity for growth. We are deepening key wholesale relationships through more targeted product assortments and a broader lifestyle offering. We are also expanding our wholesale relationships, with a focus in the United States on growing premium accounts such as Nordstrom and Bloomingdale's. We are also growing our core business through wholesale e-commerce sites, including Amazon, where we have expanded our core product offering and established a Levi’s-branded storefront that offers consumers a curated experience similar to the one they enjoy when they visit our company-operated e-commerce sites.


• | Increase penetration and sales within our top five developed markets. We manage our business by region, which enables us to respond more rapidly to opportunities presented by specific geographic markets. We continue to see growth among our top five developed markets: the United States, France, Germany, Mexico and the United Kingdom. Across these markets, we plan to expand via a combination of new stores, expanded wholesale relationships and an increased e-commerce presence.


• | Invest in marketing and advertising to increase engagement with our brands. We expect to continue our investment in marketing and advertising, including television, digital and influencer marketing, focusing primarily on growing sales of our core product offerings and increasing engagement with all of our brands, particularly among younger consumers.

Expand for More. We have significant opportunity to grow by expanding beyond our core business into other underpenetrated categories, markets and brands.

• | Develop leading positions in categories outside of men’s bottoms. We are focusing our product design and marketing efforts to reshape our global consumer perceptions from a U.S. men’s bottoms-oriented company to a global lifestyle leader for both men and women. To this end, in the near term, we are focusing on growing our tops and women’s businesses. While our logo T-shirt business has been a key driver of this growth, we are also seeing growth across other tops sub-categories such as fleece (sweatshirts) and trucker jackets. We believe we have a long runway for growth in both our tops and women’s categories. In the longer term, we intend to increase our focus on expanding our other product categories such as footwear and outerwear.


• | Expand presence in underpenetrated international markets. We believe we have a significant opportunity to deepen our presence in key emerging markets, such as China and India, to drive long-term growth. We believe our new management team in China can significantly expand our business in China as we leverage a localized go-to-market strategy to open new stores and build affinity among Chinese consumers. To support further growth, we opened our first company-operated store in India in December 2017 and launched a company-operated e-commerce platform for the country in January 2018.


• | Continue to grow and expand the presence of our value brands, Signature by Levi Strauss & Co. and Denizen. We are targeting value-conscious consumers through our Signature by Levi Strauss & Co. and Denizen brands, which are sold through wholesale accounts. We continue to grow our business with accounts such as Walmart and Target by expanding our offering within existing doors and leveraging our relationships with these retailers to launch our value brands in international markets.


• | Opportunistically pursue acquisitions. We expect to opportunistically pursue acquisitions to supplement our strong organic growth profile and drive further brand and category diversification. We will evaluate potential acquisition opportunities with a focus on strategic acquisitions that will enhance our portfolio of brands, bolster our product category expertise or add a new operating capability while fitting well with our corporate culture and providing an attractive financial return. We believe we are well-positioned and have the financial flexibility to pursue attractive acquisition opportunities as they arise.

Strengthen Position as a Leading Omni-Channel Retailer. We are focused on growing our direct-to-consumer ("DTC") channel in order to better control our brands and drive meaningful connections with our consumers globally.

• | Continue to expand our retail presence and improve our sales productivity in existing stores. We continue to add new, profitable retail locations in the United States and across the globe. We had 74 more company-operated stores on November 25, 2018 than we did on November 26, 2017. We are focused on creating a shopping experience that excites today’s consumers with enhanced customization and personalization through our Tailor Shops and Print Bars. We continue to focus on redesigning the shopping experience, including the opening of a new flagship store in New York City’s Times Square in November 2018. At approximately 17,000 square feet, this is our largest mainline store. Additionally, we are continuing to implement integrated omni-channel and digital capabilities across our store fleet. We have updated our systems to enable customers to return products in-store that they purchased through our websites

2

and allow our sales associates to place orders in store when desired fits or sizes are not available. Over the last year, we have also been rolling out a new RFID inventory management system to improve operations and help us test the effectiveness of different store layouts and assortments.

• | Drive e-commerce growth through global presence and superior consumer experience. We have been focused on building out our e-commerce sites across geographies while also upgrading the foundation of our sites in key geographies such as the United States and Europe in order to deliver a better user experience. In addition, we are incubating a portfolio of innovative e-commerce features that further enhance consumer experience and demonstrate our leadership in fit and style in an online forum. For example, in 2017 we rolled out "Ask Indigo," an AI-powered stylebot, to help guide consumers to the products that best fit their needs, just as an associate would in a brick-and-mortar store. We are continually testing and refining these features to help drive increased traffic, conversion and order size. We also recently rolled out an online program that enables consumers to customize trucker jackets, logo T-shirts and other products just as they would in-store.

Enhance Operational Excellence. We seek out operational improvements that leverage our scale to unlock efficiencies throughout our organization and enable us to respond quickly to changing market dynamics.

• | Improve operations by leveraging our scale and consolidating end-to-end accountability. We have ongoing initiatives to reduce inefficiency and increase profitability in our business. Our key efforts include leveraging our global scale to drive supply chain savings, end-to-end planning efforts to manage inventory more efficiently and a focus on driving continuous organizational efficiencies. We are in the process of implementing a new enterprise resource planning system that will strengthen our data and analysis capabilities. We are also planning to upgrade our distribution centers and improve our distribution networks in the United States and Europe to ensure we are prepared for future growth.


• | Improve flexibility and ability to respond to changing fashion and consumer trends. We are taking steps to shorten our time to market in order to better meet the rapidly evolving needs of our customers and consumers. For example, Project F.L.X. increases operational agility in our men’s and women’s bottoms businesses and improves inventory management by enabling us to make final decisions on the mix of styles for our denim products closer to the time of sale. We have also added shorter go-to-market processes in categories such as tops in order to forecast and buy inventory more effectively, leading to higher sell through rates and less marked down product.

Our Brands and Products
We offer a broad range of products, including jeans, casual and dress pants, tops, shorts, skirts, jackets, footwear and related accessories. Across all of our brands, pants – including jeans, casual pants and dress pants – represented 68%, 72% and 77% of our total units sold in fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Men's products generated 69%, 72% and 76% of our total net sales in fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Levi's® Brand
The Levi's® brand epitomizes classic, authentic American style and effortless cool. Levi's is an authentic and original lifestyle brand and the #1 brand globally in jeanswear (measured by total retail sales). Since their inception in 1873, Levi's® jeans have become one of the most recognizable garments in the world – reflecting the aspirations and earning the loyalty of people for generations. Consumers around the world instantly recognize the distinctive traits of Levi's® jeans, including the Arcuate Stitching Design and the Red Tab Device. The Levi's® brand continues to evolve to meet the tastes of today's consumers, driven by its distinctive pioneering and innovative spirit. Our range of leading jeanswear, other apparel items and accessories for men, women and children is available in more than 110 countries, allowing individuals around the world to express their personal style.
The Levi's® brand encompasses a range of products. Levi's® Red Tab™ products are the foundation of the brand, consisting of a wide spectrum of jeans and jeanswear offered in a variety of fits, fabrics, finishes, styles and price points intended to appeal to a broad spectrum of consumers. The line includes the iconic 501® jean, the original and best-selling five-pocket jean of all time. The line also incorporates a full range of jeanswear fits and styles designed specifically for women. Sales of Red Tab™ products represented the majority of our Levi's® brand net sales in all three of our regions in fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016. We also offer premium products around the world under the Levi's® brand, including a range of premium pants, tops, shorts, skirts, jackets, footwear, and related accessories. 
Our Levi's® brand products accounted for 86% of our total net sales in fiscal years 2018 and 2017, and 85% in fiscal year 2016, approximately half of which were generated in our Americas region.

Dockers® Brand 
Founded in 1986, the Dockers® brand sparked a revolution in the way millions of men dressed around the world, shifting from the standard issue suit to a more casual look. 30 years later, the Dockers® brand continues to embody the spirit of khakis and define business casual. Since its introduction, the brand has focused on men's khakis and the essential clothing accessories to go with them. 
Our Dockers® brand products accounted for 7%, 8% and 10% of our total net sales in fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Although the substantial majority of these net sales were in the Americas region, Dockers® brand products were sold in more than 50 countries.
Signature by Levi Strauss & Co.™ and Denizen® Brands 
In addition to our Levi's® and Dockers® brands, we offer the Signature by Levi Strauss & Co.™ and Denizen® brands, which are focused on value-conscious consumers who seek quality craftsmanship and great fit and style at affordable prices. We offer denim jeans, casual pants, tops and jackets in a variety of fits, fabrics and finishes for men, women and children under the Signature by Levi Strauss & Co.™ brand through the mass retail channel in the United States and Canada. The Denizen® brand was introduced in the United States starting in 2011, and includes a variety of jeans to complement active lifestyles and to empower consumers to express their aspirations, individuality and attitudes. The Denizen® brand is sold through wholesale accounts in the United States.
Our Signature by Levi Strauss & Co.™ and Denizen® brand products accounted for 7%, 6% and 5% of our total net sales in fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
Licensing 
The appeal of our brands across consumer groups and our global reach enable us to license our Levi's® and Dockers® trademarks for a variety of product categories in multiple markets in each of our regions, including footwear, belts, wallets and bags, outerwear, sweaters, dress shirts, kidswear, sleepwear and hosiery. Licensing accounted for 2% of our total net revenues in each of fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016.
We enter into licensing agreements with our licensees covering royalty payments, product design and manufacturing standards, marketing and sale of licensed products, and protection of our trademarks. We require our licensees to comply with our code of conduct for contract manufacturing and engage independent monitors to perform regular on-site inspections and assessments of production facilities.
Sales, Distribution and Customers
We recognize wholesale revenue from sales of our products through third-party retailers such as department stores, specialty retailers, leading third-party e-commerce sites and franchise locations dedicated to our brands. We also sell our products directly to consumers through a variety of formats, including our own company-operated mainline and outlet stores, company-operated e- commerce sites and select shop-in-shops located in department stores and other third-party retail locations.
Multi-brand Retailers
We seek to make our products available where consumers shop, including offering products that are appropriately tailored for our wholesale customers and their retail consumers. We take care to select wholesale customers and distributors that we believe will represent our brands in a manner consistent with our values and growth strategies. Sales to our top ten wholesale customers accounted for 27%, 28% and 30% of our net revenues in fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. No single customer represented 10% or more of our net revenues in any of these years. 
We also sell our products directly to consumers through shop-in-shops located in certain of our wholesale customers’ and other third-party retail locations. Typically, this format is conducted on a concession basis, whereby the inventory continues to be owned by us (not the retailer) until ultimate sale to the end consumer. The salespeople involved in these transactions are generally our employees and not those of the retailer. We recognize revenue in the amount of the sale to the end consumer, while paying our partners a commission. We operated approximately 500 of these shop-in-shops as of November 25, 2018.
Dedicated Stores and E-commerce Sites
We believe retail stores dedicated to our brands are important for the growth, visibility, availability and commercial success of our brands, and they are an increasingly important part of our strategy for expanding distribution of our products. Our brand-dedicated stores are either operated by us or by independent third parties such as franchisees. In addition to the dedicated stores, we maintain brand-dedicated e-commerce sites that sell products directly to consumers.

Company-operated brick-and-mortar retail stores.  Our company-operated retail stores, comprising both mainline and outlet stores, generated 26%, 25% and 24% of our net revenues in fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. As of November 25, 2018, we had 824 company-operated stores, predominantly Levi's® stores, located in 32 countries across our three regions. We had 268 of these stores in the Americas, 300 stores in Europe and 256 stores in Asia. During 2018, we added 115 company-operated stores and closed 41 stores. 
Franchised and other stores.  Franchised, licensed, or other forms of brand-dedicated stores operated by independent third parties sell Levi's® and Dockers® products in markets outside the United States. There were approximately 1,300 of these stores as of November 25, 2018, and they are a key element of our international distribution. In addition to these stores, we consider our network of brand-dedicated shop-in-shops, which are located within department stores and may be either operated directly by us or third parties, to be an important component of our retail distribution in international markets. Outside the United States, approximately 300 of these shop-in-shops were operated by third parties as of November 25, 2018.
E-commerce sites. We maintain brand-dedicated e-commerce sites, including www.levi.com and www.dockers.com, that sell products directly to consumers across multiple markets around the world. These sites represented 4% of overall net revenues in fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016; and 13% of DTC channel net revenues in fiscal years 2018 and 2017 and 12% in fiscal year 2016.
Seasonality of Sales
We typically achieve our largest quarterly revenues in the fourth quarter. In fiscal year 2018, our net revenues in the first, second, third and fourth quarters represented 24%, 22%, 25% and 29%, respectively, of our total net revenues for the year. In fiscal year 2017, our net revenues in the first, second, third and fourth quarters represented 22%, 22%, 26% and 30%, respectively, of our total net revenues for the year.
We typically achieve a significant amount of revenues from our DTC channel on the Friday following Thanksgiving Day, which is commonly referred to as Black Friday. Due to the timing of our fiscal year-end, a particular fiscal year might include one, two or no Black Fridays, which could impact our net revenues for the fiscal year. Each of fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016 included one Black Friday. Fiscal year 2019 will not have a Black Friday, while fiscal year 2020 will have two Black Fridays.
We use a 52- or 53- week fiscal year, with each fiscal year ending on the Sunday that is closest to November 30 of that year. Certain of our foreign subsidiaries have fiscal years ending November 30. Each fiscal year generally consists of four 13-week quarters, with each quarter ending on the Sunday that is closest to the last day of the month of that quarter. Fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016 were 52-week years, ending on November 25, 2018, November 26, 2017 and November 27, 2016, respectively. Each quarter of fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016 consisted of 13 weeks.
The level of our working capital reflects the seasonality of our business. We expect inventory, accounts payable and accrued expenses to be higher in the second and third quarters in preparation for the fourth quarter selling season. Order backlog is not material to our business.
Effects of Inflation
We believe inflation in the regions where most of our sales occur has not had a significant effect on our net revenues or profitability.
Marketing and Promotion
Our marketing is rooted in globally consistent brand messages that reflect the unique attributes of our brands, including the Levi's® brand as the authentic and original jeanswear brand and the Dockers® brand as the definitive khaki. We continually strengthen our portfolio of brands and our positioning at the center of popular culture with a diverse mix of marketing initiatives to drive consumer demand, such as through social media and digital and mobile outlets, sponsorships, product placement in leading fashion magazines and with celebrities, television and radio advertisements, personal sponsorships and endorsements, and selective collaborations with key influencers, integrating ourselves with significant cultural events, and on-the-ground efforts such as street-level events and similar targeted "viral" marketing activities. We also connect with sport and music fans across the world, including through the naming rights to the new stadium for the San Francisco 49ers, which we secured in 2013.
Our marketing organization includes both global and regional marketing teams. Our global marketing team is responsible for developing a toolkit of marketing assets and brand guidelines to be applied across all marketing activities, including media, engagement, brand environment and in-store activation. Our regional marketing teams adapt global tools for local relevance and execute marketing strategies within the markets where we operate.

We also use our websites, including www.levi.com and www.dockers.com in relevant markets to enhance consumer understanding of our brands and help consumers find and buy our products. 
Sourcing and Logistics
Organization.  Our global sourcing and logistics organizations are responsible for taking a product from the design concept stage through production to delivery to our customers. Our objective is to leverage our global scale to achieve product development and sourcing efficiencies and reduce total product and distribution costs while maintaining our focus on product quality, local service levels and working capital management. Our presence in more than 110 countries enables us to leverage our global scale for product development and sourcing while using our local expertise to tailor products and retail experiences to individual markets. Our integrated production development and distribution platform enables us to achieve operating efficiencies and deliver superior quality products.
Product procurement.  We source nearly all of our products through independent contract manufacturers. The remainder is sourced from our company-operated manufacturing and finishing plants. See "Item 2 – Properties" for more information about these manufacturing facilities.
Sources and availability of raw materials.  The principal fabrics used in our products include cotton, blends, synthetics and wools. The prices we pay our suppliers for our products are dependent in part on the market price for raw materials used to produce them, primarily cotton. The price and availability of cotton may fluctuate substantially, depending on a variety of factors. The price fluctuations impact the cost of our products in future seasons due to the lead time of our product development cycle. Fluctuations in product costs can cause a decrease in our profitability if product pricing actions taken in response are insufficient or if those actions cause our wholesale customers or retail consumers to reduce the volumes they purchase.
Sourcing locations.  We use numerous independent contract manufacturers located throughout the world for the production and finishing of our garments. We conduct assessments of political, social, economic, trade, labor and intellectual property protection conditions in the countries in which we source our products before placing production in those countries and on an ongoing basis. We also monitor ongoing global trade regulations to optimize our supply chain networks in response to changes in tariffs or other trade policies around the world.
In fiscal year 2018, we sourced products from contract manufacturers located in approximately 23 countries around the world. We sourced products in North and South Asia, South and Central America (including Mexico and the Caribbean), Europe and Africa. No single country accounted for more than 20% of our sourcing in fiscal year 2018.
Sourcing practices.  Our sourcing practices include these elements: 

• | We require all third-party contractors and subcontractors who manufacture or finish products for us to comply with our code of conduct relating to supplier working conditions as well as environmental, employment and sourcing practices. We also require our licensees to ensure that their manufacturers comply with our requirements.


• | Our supplier code of conduct covers employment practices such as wages and benefits, working hours, health and safety, working age and discriminatory practices, environmental matters such as wastewater treatment and solid waste disposal, and ethical and legal conduct.


• | We regularly assess manufacturing and finishing facilities through periodic on-site facility inspections and improvement activities, including use of independent monitors to supplement our internal staff. We integrate review and performance results into our sourcing decisions. 


• | We disclose the names and locations of our contract manufacturers to encourage collaboration among apparel companies in factory monitoring and improvement. We regularly evaluate and refine our code of conduct processes.

Logistics.  We use company-operated and third-party distribution facilities to warehouse and ship products to our wholesale customers, retail stores and e-commerce customers. For more information, see "Item 2 – Properties." Distribution center activities include receiving finished goods from our contract manufacturers and plants, inspecting those products, preparing them for retail presentation, and shipping them to our customers and to our own stores. Our distribution centers maintain a combination of replenishment and seasonal inventory. In certain locations around the globe, we have consolidated our distribution centers to service multiple countries.

Competition
The global apparel industry is highly competitive and fragmented. It is characterized by low barriers to entry, brands targeted at specific consumer segments, many regional and local competitors, and an increasing number of global competitors. Principal competitive factors include: 

• | anticipating and responding to changing consumer preferences and buying trends in a timely manner, and ensuring product availability at wholesale and DTC channels;


• | developing high-quality, innovative products with relevant designs, fits, finishes, fabrics, style and performance features that meet consumer desires and trends;


• | maintaining favorable and strong brand name recognition and appeal through strong and effective marketing support and intelligence in diverse market segments;


• | identifying and securing desirable new retail locations and presenting products effectively at company-operated retail and franchised and other brand-dedicated stores;


• | ensuring high-profile product placement at retailers;


• | anticipating and responding to consumer expectations regarding e-commerce shopping and shipping;


• | optimizing supply chain cost efficiencies and product development cycle lead times;


• | creating products at a range of price points that appeal to the consumers of both our wholesale customers and our dedicated retail stores and e-commerce sites situated in each of our geographic regions; and


• | generating competitive economics for wholesale customers, including retailers, franchisees, and licensees.

We believe we compete favorably with respect to these factors.
We face competition from a broad range of competitors at the global, regional and local levels in diverse channels across a wide range of retail price points, and some of our competitors are larger and have more resources in the markets in which we operate. Our primary competitors include vertically integrated specialty stores, jeanswear brands, khakiwear brands, athletic wear companies, retailers' private or exclusive labels, and certain e-commerce sites. 
Intellectual Property
We have more than 5,000 trademark registrations and pending applications in approximately 180 jurisdictions worldwide, and we acquire rights in new trademarks according to business needs. Substantially all of our global trademarks are owned by Levi Strauss & Co. We regard our trademarks as our most valuable assets and believe they have substantial value in the marketing of our products. The Levi's®, Dockers® and 501® trademarks, the Arcuate Stitching Design, the Tab Device, the Two Horse® Design, the Housemark and the Wings and Anchor Design are among our core trademarks.
We protect these trademarks by registering them with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and with governmental agencies in other countries, particularly where our products are manufactured or sold. We work vigorously to enforce and protect our trademark rights by engaging in regular market reviews, helping local law enforcement authorities detect and prosecute counterfeiters, issuing cease-and-desist letters against third parties infringing or denigrating our trademarks, opposing registration of infringing trademarks, and initiating litigation as necessary. We are currently pursuing over 200 infringement matters around the world. We also work with trade groups and industry participants seeking to strengthen laws relating to the protection of intellectual property rights in markets around the world. 
As of November 25, 2018, we had nine issued U.S. patents and 21 U.S. patent applications pending. Our patents expire between 2019 and 2037. We also had four issued patents and two international and foreign patent applications pending. In addition, as we develop technologies that we believe are innovative, such as Project F.L.X., we intend to continually assess the patentability of new intellectual property.
Employees
As of November 25, 2018, we employed approximately 15,100 people, approximately 7,400 of whom were located in the Americas, 4,200 in Europe, and 3,500 in Asia. Approximately 1,800 of our employees were associated with the manufacturing and procurement of our products, 7,800 worked in retail, including seasonal employees, 1,600 worked in distribution and 3,900 were other non-production employees. As of November 25, 2018, approximately 3,100 of our employees were represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.

History and Corporate Citizenship
Our story began in San Francisco, California in 1853 as a wholesale dry goods business. We invented the blue jean 20 years later. In 1873, we received a U.S. patent for “waist overalls” with metal rivets at points of strain. The first product line designated by the lot number "501" was created in 1890.
In the 19th and early 20th centuries, our work pants were worn primarily by cowboys, miners and other working men in the western United States. Then, in 1934, we introduced our first jeans for women, and after World War II, our jeans began to appeal to a wider market. By the 1960s, they had become a symbol of American culture, representing a unique blend of history and youth. We opened our export and international businesses in the 1950s and 1960s, respectively. The Dockers® brand helped drive "Casual Friday" in the 1990s and has been a cornerstone of casual menswear for more than 30 years.
Throughout this long history, we have upheld our strong belief that we can help shape society through civic engagement and community involvement, responsible labor and workplace practices, philanthropy, ethical conduct, environmental stewardship and transparency. We engage in a "profits through principles" business approach and constantly strive to set higher standards for ourselves and the industry. Our milestone initiatives over the years include integrating our factories prior to the enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; developing a comprehensive supplier code of conduct that requires safe and healthy working conditions before such codes of conduct became commonplace among multinational apparel companies; and offering benefits to same-sex partners in the 1990s, long before most other companies.
