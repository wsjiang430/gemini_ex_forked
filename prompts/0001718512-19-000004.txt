Item 1. Business 
We are a global manufacturer of innovative, highly engineered power transmission and fluid power solutions. We offer a broad portfolio of products to diverse replacement channel customers, and to original equipment (“first-fit”) manufacturers as specified components, with the majority of our revenue coming from replacement channels. Our products are used in applications across numerous end markets, which include construction, agriculture, energy, automotive, transportation, general industrial, consumer products and many others. Our revenue has historically been highly correlated with industrial activity and utilization, and not with any single end market given the diversification of our business and high exposure to replacement markets. Key indicators of our performance include industrial production, industrial sales and manufacturer shipments. We sell our products globally under the Gates brand, which is recognized by distributors, equipment manufacturers, installers and end users as a premium brand for quality and technological innovation; this reputation has been built for over a century since Gates’ founding in 1911. 
Within the diverse end markets we serve, our highly engineered products are critical components in applications for which the cost of downtime is high relative to the cost of our products, resulting in the willingness of end users to pay a premium for superior performance and availability. These applications subject our products to normal wear and tear, resulting in a natural replacement cycle that drives high-margin, recurring revenue. Our product portfolio represents one of the broadest ranges of power transmission and fluid power products in the markets we serve, and we maintain long-standing relationships with a diversified group of blue-chip customers throughout the world. As a leading designer, manufacturer and marketer of highly engineered, mission-critical products, we have become an industry leader across most of the regions and end markets in which we operate. 
Gates’ business is well-balanced and diversified across products, channels and geographies, as highlighted in the following charts showing breakdowns of our Fiscal 2018 net sales of $3,347.6 million.
Our History and Recent Developments 
On October 1, 1911, Charles Gates, Sr. purchased the Colorado Tire and Leather Company, a manufacturer of steel-studded bands of leather that attached to tires to extend their mileage. In 1917, the Company commercialized the V-belt, which used rubber and woven threading instead of rope belts, which were more commonly used at that time. In 1963, we built the first of many international facilities in Erembodegem, Belgium, followed by Jacarei, Brazil, in 1973. In 1986, we acquired the Uniroyal Power Transmission Company, which included an interest in the Unitta joint venture that lay the groundwork for Gates’ growth in the Asia-Pacific region. We have financial and operational control over the joint venture, and as such, consolidate it in our financial statements. 
In 1996, Gates was acquired by a publicly held engineering firm based in the United Kingdom (“U.K.”), Tomkins plc, which was itself acquired by Onex Partners and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, who proceeded to divest certain of Tomkins plc’s businesses under a new parent entity, Pinafore Holdings B.V. Gates was acquired by funds affiliated with The Blackstone Group L.P. in July 2014 and in 2015, established a new executive leadership team with the appointment of Ivo Jurek as Chief Executive Officer and David Naemura as Chief Financial Officer.

We have developed an active acquisition pipeline and the organizational capability to integrate acquired companies. In 2018, we acquired Rapro, based in Turkey, and in 2017 we closed two transactions, Techflow Flexibles in the U.K. and Atlas Hydraulics in North America. All three of our recent acquisitions have been focused on expanding our presence in industrial markets with new products, capabilities, capacity and geographic reach. In addition, we continue to invest organically in new production capacity. During Fiscal 2018, we opened two new facilities located in Poland and in Mexico, and we also expanded our Changzhou facility in China.
Our Solutions 
We operate our business on a product-line basis through our two reporting segments - Power Transmission and Fluid Power. See note 5 of our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information. 
We sell our products under the Gates brand in all geographies and end markets. Our power transmission segment includes elastomer drive belts and related components used to efficiently transfer motion in a broad range of applications. Power transmission products represented approximately 63% of our total net sales for Fiscal 2018. Our fluid power segment includes hoses, tubing and fittings designed to convey hydraulic fluid at high pressures in both mobile and stationary applications, and other high-pressure and fluid transfer hoses used to convey various fluids. Our fluid power products represented approximately 37% of our net sales for Fiscal 2018. 
Our power transmission and fluid power products are often critical to the functioning of the equipment, process or system in which they are components, such that the cost of downtime or potential equipment damage is high relative to the cost of our products. Our products are therefore replaced not only as a result of normal wear and tear, but also preemptively as part of ongoing maintenance to the broader system. 
We have a broad portfolio of both power transmission and fluid power products in the end markets we serve. We have a long history of focusing on customer engagement and training, driving product innovation and providing best-in-class order fulfilment services. This allows us to maintain a consistently high level of customer satisfaction, driving continued loyalty among our customer base. 
Power Transmission. Our Power Transmission solutions enable and control motion. They are used in applications in which belts, chains, cables, geared transmissions or direct drives transfer power from an engine or motor to another part or system. Belt-based power transmission drives typically consist of either a synchronous belt or an asynchronous belt (V-belt, CVT belt or Micro-V® belt) and related components (sprockets, pulleys, water pumps, tensioners or other accessories). Within our Power Transmission segment, we offer solutions across the following key application platforms: 

• | Stationary drives: fixed drive systems such as those used in a factory driving a machine or pump, or on a grain elevator driving the lift auger;


• | Mobile drives: drives on a piece of mobile machinery such as a combine harvester or a road compactor, or in applications such as the brush head of a vacuum cleaner;


• | Engine systems: synchronous drives and related components for cam shafts and auxiliary drives and asynchronous accessory drives for A/C compressors, power steering, alternators and starter/generator systems;


• | Personal mobility: drives on motorcycles, scooters, bicycles, snowmobiles and other power sports vehicles that are used to transfer power between the power source and the drive wheel(s) or track; and


• | Vertical lift: elevators, cargo lifts and other applications in which a belt, cable, chain or other lifting mechanism is used to carry load.

Customers choose power transmission solutions based on a number of factors, including application requirements such as load, speed, gear ratio, temperature, operating environment, ease of maintenance, noise, efficiency and reliability, as well as the support they receive from their suppliers, including application-specific engineering. Belt-based drive systems have many advantages over other alternatives, as they are typically clean, low-maintenance, lubrication-free, quiet with low-vibration, light-weight, compact, energy-efficient, durable and reliable. In applications where these advantages are valued, customers typically choose belts over other forms of power transmission solutions.

Our belts are classified by their general design into asynchronous and synchronous belts; in addition, we also manufacture metal drive products and assemble automotive replacement kits. 
Asynchronous Belts. Asynchronous belts are our highest-volume products and are used in a broad range of applications. Asynchronous belts are made of proprietary rubber formulations, textiles and embedded cords for reinforcement. We were a pioneer in the design and manufacturing of V-belts, which draw their name from the shape of their profile. We also manufacture “ribbed” V-belts, which are belts with lengthwise V-shaped grooves, which we market under the Micro-V® name. This design results in a thinner belt for the same drive surface, making it more flexible and offering improved efficiency through lower friction losses. Belt starter/generator (“BSG”) belts are used in start/stop accessory drive systems on automobiles and other engine applications used to improve fuel economy. The demanding BSG system functionality, including engine starting, torque boosting and energy recuperation, requires a high-performance belt construction. Continuously-variable transmission (“CVT”) systems found in scooters, power sports vehicles and other applications use a specialized V-belt knows as a CVT belt. 
In industrial end markets, asynchronous belts have a wide variety of applications, including use in pump drives, manufacturing lines, HVAC systems, industrial engines, truck, bus and marine engines, forestry and mining equipment and many other applications. In automotive applications, our asynchronous belts perform functions that include transferring power from the crankshaft to accessory drive components such as the alternator, A/C compressor, power steering system, water pump and, in some vehicles, a BSG system. 
During Fiscal 2018, Gates introduced a new Micro-V® platform for engine accessory drive systems. The combination of newly developed material compounds and product design reduces belt weight and results in lower bending stiffness. These improvements enable tighter pulley configurations and reduced drive bending losses as compared to existing belt technologies; lower losses result in reduced energy consumption, CO2 emissions and heat generation.
Synchronous Belts. Synchronous belts, also known as timing belts, are non-slipping mechanical drive belts. They have teeth molded onto the inner surface and they run over matching toothed pulleys or sprockets. Synchronous belts experience no slippage and are often used to transfer motion for indexing or timing purposes, as well as for linear positioning and positive drive conveying. They are typically used instead of chains or gears and we believe have a number of advantages over these alternatives, including less noise, no need for lubrication, improved durability and performance and a more compact design. Our synchronous belts are made of a flexible polymer over fabric reinforcement and are often built with Kevlar, aramid and carbon fibers. 
Examples of industrial applications include use in HVAC systems, food processing and bottling plants, mining and agricultural equipment, automatic doors and robotics. In automotive applications, our synchronous belts are used to synchronize the rotation of the engine crankshaft with the camshaft due to engine combustion in a valve train system, as well as in electric power steering and parking brake systems which are present in gasoline-powered, hybrid and electric vehicles. 
Metal Drive Components. We manufacture and sell the tensioners and idlers used in belt drive systems. These products are designed and engineered to work efficiently with our belts. Tensioners are devices that maintain a constant tension in the belt drive system, thereby ensuring proper function and preventing loss of power or system failure. Tensioners typically employ a spring that places pressure along the belt for an intricate hold, while still allowing enough movement for vibration and to prevent stretching. Idlers, which sometimes also perform as tensioners, are used to take up extra belt length. 
Kits. Our kits for the automotive replacement market include all of the parts needed by an automotive service shop to perform a replacement of one of our products. Kits are created for specific makes and models and typically include belts, tensioners and idlers, and will sometimes also include water pumps as they are often replaced when a timing belt is replaced. Our kits are convenient for service technicians as they eliminate the need for more complicated product sourcing. On a comparable quantity basis, kits typically sell at a premium to a loose belt and single tensioner.

Our power transmission products are used in a broad range of applications in end markets including construction, agriculture, transportation, automotive, energy, general industrial and consumer products. The majority of our Fiscal 2018 net sales came from the replacement markets, which provide high-margin, recurring revenue streams and are driven by attractive market trends. The bulk of our power transmission replacement business resides in developed regions, in which a large, aging installed base of equipment follows a natural maintenance cycle and is served by well-developed distribution channels. For example, a combine harvester in North America has over 25 high-performance belts that are typically replaced at regular intervals, depending on wear and tear, with end users having access to replacement parts through an established channel. Similarly, in the North American automotive replacement market, maintenance intervals are well defined and miles driven per vehicle are increasing, leading to more wear and tear on vehicles. A smaller portion of our power transmission replacement business is generated in emerging markets, which generally have a smaller base of installed equipment and relatively immature distribution channels. As they continue to develop, these replacement markets represent a significant long-term opportunity for growth. 
In addition to our power transmission replacement business, we also serve a wide variety of blue-chip first-fit customers across all of our end markets. The majority of our automotive first-fit revenues in power transmission tend to come from emerging markets. These markets generally are higher-growth and result in higher-margin business than our developed regions. Our first-fit presence in these markets serves to further strengthen our brand, strongly positioning us to serve the growing base of installed equipment as the nascent replacement channels continue to develop.
Fluid Power. Our Fluid Power solutions are used in applications in which hoses and rigid tubing assemblies either transfer power hydraulically or convey fluids, gases or granular materials from one location to another. Within our Fluid Power segment, we offer solutions across the following key application platforms: 

• | Stationary hydraulics: applications within stationary machinery, such as an injection molding machine or a manufacturing press;


• | Mobile hydraulics: applications used to power various implements in mobile equipment used in construction, agriculture, mining and other heavy industries;


• | Engine systems: applications for engine systems such as coolant, fuel, A/C, turbocharger, air intake and selective catalytic reduction for diesel emissions; and


• | Other industrial: applications in which hoses are used to convey fluids, gases or granular material across several industries such as oil and gas drilling and refining, food and beverage and other process industries.

Customers choose fluid power solutions based on a number of factors including application-specific product performance parameters such as pressure and temperature ratings, corrosion and leak resistance, weight, flexibility, abrasion resistance and cleanliness, as well as compliance with standards and product availability. Attributes associated with the supplier, including brand, global footprint and reputation for reliability and quality, are also considered. 
Hydraulics. Our hydraulics product line is comprised of hoses, tubing and fittings, as well as assemblies consisting of these products. Our hydraulic products are key components of hydraulic systems in both stationary and mobile equipment applications. We provide a full selection of hose sizes and construction types for use in a wide variety of working requirements and conditions. Hydraulic hoses are made of synthetic rubber and reinforced with steel wire or a textile-based yarn, and typically operate at very high pressures, often in extreme environmental conditions. Hoses are designed for use in specific mechanical applications and require high levels of quality and durability. 
Our hydraulic fittings and tubing are engineered to match the product performance of our hydraulic hoses. The high-pressure nature of hydraulic systems requires these products have high levels of performance similar to those found in our hydraulic hoses. The ultimate performance of a hydraulic assembly, in which our products function as part of a hydraulic circuit, depends not only on how well the components are made, but also on how well they complement each other. In order to ensure compatibility with numerous applications, our hydraulic fittings are manufactured in a wide assortment of sizes, crimping systems and materials, and are protected by a range of patents. Our hydraulic products and assemblies are used in construction, agricultural and forestry equipment, as well as in food and other processing lines and stationary machinery. 
During Fiscal 2018, Gates introduced a new hydraulic hose family that is lighter weight and more flexible. Made with high-performance reinforcement and a robust, abrasion-resistant cover, the MXT line of hydraulic hose is a universally applicable, high-performance product that meets the needs of diversified applications.

Engine Hose. Our engine hose products perform a variety of conveyance functions in engine applications in gasoline-powered, hybrid and electric vehicles. Engine system applications for which Gates provides solutions include coolant (radiator, heater), air system (turbocharger, intake, vacuum, crankcase ventilation), fuel, oil (transmission oil cooling, power steering) and emissions/Diesel Exhaust Filtration (“DEF”) systems. 
Industrial Hose. Our industrial hoses are capable of transferring a wide range of substances-chemicals, food and beverages, petroleum, fuels, bulk materials, water, steam and air-to meet the requirements of diverse applications, including manufacturing, mining, oil and gas drilling, marine, agriculture, industrial cleaning and construction. Our application engineering teams work with customers to assist them in selecting the appropriate hose solution to safely meet their operational needs. We leverage our materials science expertise to enable hose performance at varying pressures and levels of resistance to chemicals, oil, abrasion, ozone, flame and both hot and cold temperatures. For performance in extreme environments, many of our industrial hoses feature both crush-resistant and flexible designs. Gates industrial hoses are highly engineered to meet or exceed a multitude of industry standards and certifications, and are offered in a range of diameters, lengths and colors to allow customers to differentiate the hoses in applications. We also offer a wide range of couplings to provide complete assembly solutions to our customers. 
Our fluid power products are used in numerous applications, including construction, agriculture, transportation, automotive, energy and general industrial. The largest portion of our Fiscal 2018 fluid power revenue came from replacement markets. Within these replacement markets, the majority of our revenue came from industrial applications. Approximately 16% of our Fiscal 2018 fluid power revenue came from products sold into the automotive end market, almost all of which was served through the higher-margin replacement channel. 
Our Diverse Markets 
We participate in many sectors of the industrial and consumer markets. Our products play essential roles in a diverse range of applications across a wide variety of end markets ranging from harsh and hazardous industries such as agriculture, construction, manufacturing and energy, to everyday consumer applications such as printers, power washers, automatic doors and vacuum cleaners. Virtually every form of transportation, ranging from trucks, buses and automobiles to personal mobility vehicles such as motorcycles, bicycles and snowmobiles uses our products. 
Our revenue has historically been highly correlated with industrial activity and utilization, and not with any single end market given the diversification of our business and high exposure to replacement markets. Key indicators include industrial production, industrial sales and manufacturer shipments. 
Our products are sold in over 120 countries across our four commercial regions: (1) the Americas; (2) Europe, Middle East & Africa (“EMEA”); (3) Greater China; and (4) East Asia & India. We have a long-standing presence in each of these regions. 
Our commercial capabilities are complemented by our global manufacturing footprint, which frequently allows us to manufacture products in close proximity to our customers. We have power transmission and fluid power operations in each commercial region and typically manufacture products for both first-fit customers and replacement customers in the same factory, which provides improved factory loading and demand leveling, as well as optimization of capital expenditures. 
Our Channels 
We sell our power transmission and fluid power products both as replacement components and as specified components on original equipment to customers worldwide. As of December 29, 2018, approximately 62% of our net sales were generated from replacement markets and 38% from first-fit markets globally. Our mix of replacement sales to first-fit sales varies by region based on our market strategy and the maturity of the equipment fleet and replacement channel. For example, in emerging markets such as China, our business is characterized by a higher first-fit presence, given the relatively underdeveloped replacement channels and newer average age of cars. We believe that ultimately our first-fit presence in these emerging markets will allow us to better develop the replacement channels as they mature over time. By contrast, in North America and EMEA, where there are long-established replacement markets, approximately 72% and 69% of our Fiscal 2018 net sales, respectively, were derived from these higher-margin replacement channels. In the vast majority of the applications we service, we do not need to have been the first-fit provider to service these applications in the replacement markets.

Replacement. The majority of our sales are generated from customers in replacement channels, who primarily serve a large base of installed equipment that follows a natural maintenance cycle. Our ability to help replacement channel partners maximize revenue is an important part of our value proposition. These customers miss sales opportunities if a required product cannot be obtained quickly, either from a catalog or on-hand inventory. 
In addition to our products, we offer digital tools and other content to distributors, installers and end users of equipment containing our products. We also assist with customer training on product installation and early identification of wear-and-tear on components, which helps drive sales for our channel customers while mitigating the risk of equipment failure for end users. 
First-Fit. We work closely with our customers by providing application engineering expertise to assist them in selecting the right products for their applications. In engine systems, we are one of the only suppliers providing application engineering for cam drive and accessory drive applications, and completing all design and manufacturing of the system components in-house. Close interactions between our R&D organization and customer technical teams provide input into our innovation and product development processes. We selectively participate in first-fit projects, focusing on opportunities where we are able to differentiate with technology and innovative solutions. 
Customers 
We maintain long-standing relationships with many customers, who range from local distributors with one location to large, global manufacturers of equipment. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of our Fiscal 2018 net sales. 
Sales and Marketing and Distribution Organization 
Our sales and distribution operations are structured to serve our customers efficiently across the globe. We have field representatives who possess local knowledge of product and application requirements, allowing us to meet our customers’ product availability requirements with short lead times. Our global sales and service support team helps reinforce customer and distributor relationships by focusing on end markets and customers. 
Manufacturing 
We have a global, “in region, for region” manufacturing footprint and regional service model that enable us to operate efficiently and effectively in proximity to our customers. We operate 64 manufacturing facilities and service centers as well as several major technical centers giving us a presence in 29 countries throughout the world. Our in-country deployment of manufacturing and technical resources enables us to meet customer needs rapidly and satisfy regional variations in product preference, while our scale allows us to service global customers on a world-wide basis. 
Competition 
We operate in competitive markets and industries that are also very fragmented. We offer our products and solutions across numerous and varied end markets and geographies through over 120 locations in 29 countries. Consequently, we have many competitors across our various markets and product offerings. These competitors and the degree of competition vary by product line, geographic scope, end market and channel. Although each of our markets and product offerings has many competitors, no single competitor competes with us with respect to all of our products, solutions, channels and end markets. Our global presence makes it difficult for smaller regional and low-cost country manufacturers to penetrate our markets. We differentiate ourselves on the basis of product performance and quality, breadth of portfolio, customer support and training, service level, fill rates and product availability. 
Research, Development and Intellectual Property 
Applied R&D is important to our businesses and integral to our leading market positions. We have engineering teams in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Germany, Spain, Poland, Turkey, Japan, China, Brazil, India, Mexico, Korea and Thailand that focus on the introduction of new and improved products with a particular emphasis on energy efficiency and safety, the application of technology to reduce unit and operating costs and improving services to our customers. 
As of December 29, 2018, we held more than 2,500 patents and trademarks in various jurisdictions. While no individual patent or group of patents, taken alone, is considered critical to our business, collectively our patents and trademarks provide meaningful protection for our products and technical innovations. 
11

Materials and Suppliers 
We use a wide variety of materials, resulting in a highly diversified mix of inputs, which are sourced from a variety of suppliers around the world. Generally, we seek to obtain materials in the regions where our products are manufactured to minimize transportation and other costs. As of December 29, 2018, we had not experienced any significant shortages of raw materials and normally do not carry inventories of raw materials in excess of those required to meet our production schedules. 

We continually seek to manage commodity and raw material costs using various strategies, including working with our suppliers to mitigate costs, exploring material substitution opportunities, combining purchase requirements across regions and changing suppliers when appropriate. 
Environmental 
Our operations, products and properties are subject to extensive U.S. and foreign federal, state, local, and provincial laws and regulations relating to environmental, health and safety (“EHS”) protection, including laws and regulations governing air emissions, wastewater discharges, waste management and disposal, substances in products, and workplace health and safety, as well as the investigation and clean-up of contaminated sites. Under certain environmental laws, the obligation to investigate and remediate contamination at a facility may be imposed on current and former owners, lessees or operators or on persons who may have sent waste to that facility for disposal. We are currently performing environmental investigations and/or remediation at a number of former and current facilities in the U.S. and Canada and are incurring costs in relation to a number of offsite waste disposal sites. 
Employees 
As of December 29, 2018, we employed approximately 14,200 full time employees worldwide. Approximately 6,000 of our employees were located in North America, 3,700 in EMEA, 3,800 in China and East Asia and 700 in South America. Some of our employees are members of labor unions and over many years we have been able to maintain successful relationships with the unions and employment organizations. To date, employee relations have been flexible and constructive as we continue to pursue lean manufacturing improvements in our plants.
