Item 1. | Business
------------+---------

 
Rennova Health, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, “Rennova”, “we” or the “Company”) is a provider of health care services for healthcare providers, patients and individuals. Beginning in 2011 the Company owned and operated a number of clinical diagnostics laboratories which focused on the provision of urine toxicology diagnostics to the substance abuse sector. The majority of the Company’s business was conducted in Florida. The Company invested in and developed a suite of software products to complement its diagnostics business and create an additional revenue stream. The Company also expanded its diagnostics business to include certain genetic diagnostics and interpretation of diagnostic outcomes in the cancer and pharmacogenomics sector. Adverse market conditions in the Company’s core diagnostics business in 2015 and 2016 caused a significant downturn in revenue and cash generation and caused the Company to reconsider its activities and direction. In late 2016 the Company decided to pursue the opportunity acquire and operate clusters of rural hospitals and is currently focused on implementing this business model. In 2018, the Company focused on and operated two synergistic divisions: 1) Clinical diagnostics and 2) Hospital operations. Hospital operations have become the principle business of Rennova. The Company now owns and operates three hospitals, a physician’s office in Tennessee and a rural clinic in Kentucky. The facilities are, Big South Fork Medical Center, which we opened on August 8, 2017 in Oneida Tennessee, Jamestown Regional Medical Center located in Jamestown Tennessee, which includes a doctor’s practice, the assets of which were acquired in the second quarter of 2018, pursuant to the terms of a definitive asset purchase agreement that we entered into on January 31, 2018 and Jellico Community Hospital in Jellico, Tennessee and an outpatient clinic in Williamsburg, Kentucky, the assets of which we acquired on March 5, 2019, as more fully discussed below. We believe that our approach will produce a more sustainable business model and the capture of multiple revenue streams from medical providers, patients and hospital services.
 
On July 12, 2017, we announced plans to spin off our Advanced Molecular Services Group (“AMSG”) and in the third quarter 2017 our Board of Directors voted unanimously to spin off the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Health Technology Solutions, Inc. (“HTS”), as independent publicly traded companies by way of tax-free distributions to the Company’s stockholders. While these spin offs have taken longer than anticipated, completion of these spin offs is now expected to occur in the first quarter of 2020. The spin offs are subject to numerous conditions, including effectiveness of Registration Statements on Form 10 to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and consents, including under various funding agreements previously entered into by the Company. A record date to determine those stockholders entitled to receive shares in the spin offs should be approximately 30 to 60 days prior to the dates of the spin offs. The strategic goal of the spin offs is to create three public companies, each of which can focus on its own strengths and operational plans. In addition, after the spin offs, each company will provide a distinct and targeted investment opportunity.
 
We have reflected the amounts relating to AMSG and HTS as disposal groups classified as held for sale and included in discontinued operations in the Company’s accompanying consolidated financial statements. Prior to being classified as held for sale, AMSG had been included in the Decision Support and Informatics division, except for the Company’s subsidiary, Alethea Laboratories, Inc., which had been included in the Clinical Laboratories division and HTS had been included in the Company’s Supportive Software Solutions division. The Company believes it will be able to recognize the expenditures to date with regard to AMSG and HTS, which are in excess of $20 million, as an investment after the spin offs are complete.

We received approximately $9.0 million and $15.7 million in cash from issuances of debentures and warrants during 2018 and 2017, respectively (see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements), $3.3 million and $4.8 million from related parties in 2018 and 2017, respectively (see Notes 8, 9 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements), $4.0 million of proceeds on October 30, 2017 from the issuance of our convertible preferred stock (see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements) and $0.8 million in 2018 from the sale of stock we owned (see Note 18). Subsequent to December 31, 2018 and through September 27, 2019, we received $3.8 million from issuances of debentures as more fully discussed below and $1.6 million from the issuance of a promissory note, which is more fully discussed in Note 21 to the consolidated financial statements, and $9.9 million in advances from Mr. Diamantis, a member of our board of directors, which were used to repay obligations under a prepaid forward purchase contract related to an accounts receivable financing as more fully discussed below. In addition, subsequent to December 31, 2018 and through September 10, 2019, Mr. Diamantis loaned the Company $6.5 million, of which $1.9 million was used for fees and expenses incurred in connection with the settlement of the prepaid forward purchase contract, $0.7 million was used to purchase Jellico Community Hospital in March 2019 and the remainder was used for working capital purposes.
 
Our net loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $13.6 million, as compared to $50.9 million for the same period a year ago. The change is primarily due to a reduction in the loss from continuing operations before other income and expense and income taxes of $2.9 million, the change in fair value and the value of derivative liabilities, which provided a gain of $13.7 million in 2018 versus a loss of $12.4 million in 2017, a gain on bargain purchase associated with the acquisition of Jamestown Regional Medical Center in June 2018 of $7.6 million and an increase in other income of $0.6 million in 2018.
 
History and Development of the Company
 
Medytox Solutions, Inc. (“Medytox”) was organized on July 20, 2005 under the laws of the State of Nevada. In the first half of 2011, Medytox’s management elected to reorganize as a holding company, and Medytox established and acquired a number of companies in the medical service and software sector between 2011 and 2014.
 
On November 2, 2015, pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of April 15, 2015, by and among CollabRx, Inc. (“CollabRx”), CollabRx Merger Sub, Inc. (“Merger Sub”), a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of CollabRx formed for the purpose of the merger, and Medytox, Merger Sub merged with and into Medytox, with Medytox as the surviving company and a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of CollabRx (the “Merger”). Prior to closing, the Company amended its certificate of incorporation to change its name to Rennova Health, Inc. This transaction was accounted for as a reverse merger in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and, as such, the historical financial statements of Medytox became the historical financial statements of the Company.
 
Common Stock Listing
 
On November 3, 2015, the common stock of Rennova Health, Inc. commenced trading on The NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol “RNVA.” Prior to that date, our common stock was listed on The NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol “CLRX.”
 
On April 18, 2017, the Company was notified by NASDAQ that the stockholders’ equity balance reported on the Company’s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 fell below the $2.5 million minimum requirement for continued listing under The NASDAQ Capital Market’s Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) (the “Rule”). In accordance with the Rule, the Company submitted a plan to NASDAQ outlining how it intended to regain compliance. On August 17, 2017, NASDAQ notified the Company that its plan to correct the stockholders’ equity deficiency did not contain sufficient evidence to support a correction being achieved in the required time frame. The Company appealed this decision to a Hearing Panel which, on October 23, 2017, maintained this position and denied the Company a continued listing. Effective October 25, 2017, the Company’s common stock (RNVA) and warrants to purchase common stock (RNVAW) were no longer listed on The NASDAQ Capital Market but began trading on the OTCQB instead.
 
Reverse Stock Splits
 
On February 7, 2017, the Company’s Board of Directors approved an amendment to the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation to effect a 1-for-30 reverse stock split of the Company’s shares of common stock effective February 22, 2017, on September 21, 2017, the Company’s Board of Directors approved an amendment to the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation to effect a 1-for-15 reverse stock split effective October 5, 2017, and on November 5, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors approved an amendment to the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation to effect a 1-for-500 reverse stock split effective November 12, 2018 (the “Reverse Stock Splits”). The stockholders of the Company had approved these amendments to the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation on December 22, 2016 for the February 22, 2017 reverse stock split, on September 20, 2017 for the October 5, 2017 reverse stock split and on August 22, 2018 for the November 12, 2018 reverse stock split. In each of these cases, the Company’s stockholders had granted authorization to the Board of Directors to determine in its discretion the specific ratio, subject to limitations, and the timing of the reverse splits within certain specified effective dates.

As a result of the Reverse Stock Splits, every 30 shares of the Company’s then outstanding common stock was combined and automatically converted into one share of the Company’s common stock on February 22, 2017, every 15 shares of the Company’s then outstanding common stock was combined and automatically converted into one share of the Company’s common stock on October 5, 2017 and every 500 shares of the Company’s common stock was combined and automatically converted into one share of the Company’s common stock on November 12, 2018. In addition, the conversion and exercise prices of all of the Company’s outstanding preferred stock, common stock purchase warrants, stock options, restricted stock, equity incentive plans and convertible notes payable were proportionately adjusted at the applicable reverse split ratio in accordance with the terms of such instruments. In addition, proportionate voting rights and other rights of common stockholders were not affected by the Reverse Stock Splits, other than as a result of the rounding up of fractional shares in the February reverse split and the payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares in the October and November reverse splits, as no fractional shares were issued in connection with the Reverse Stock Splits.
 
All share, per share and capital stock amounts as of and for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 have been restated to give effect to the Reverse Stock Splits.
 
In addition, on September 18, 2018, the Company amended its Certificate of Incorporation to have the authority to issue 10,000,000,000 shares of common stock and the par value of the Company’s common stock was decreased from $0.01 per share to $.0001 per share. No additional change was made to the terms of the Company’s common stock as a result of the November 12, 2018 reverse stock split and no change was made to the authorized preferred stock, which remains at 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share.
 
Recent Developments
 
Asset Acquisitions of Jellico Community Hospital and CarePlus Center
 
On March 5, 2019, the Company closed an asset purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) whereby it acquired certain assets related to an acute care hospital located in Jellico, Tennessee and an outpatient clinic located in Williamsburg, Kentucky. The hospital is known as Jellico Community Hospital and the clinic is known as the CarePlus Center. The hospital and the clinic and their associated assets were acquired from Jellico Community Hospital, Inc. and CarePlus Rural Health Clinic, LLC, respectively.
 
Jellico Community Hospital is a fully operational 54-bed acute care facility that offers comprehensive services, including diagnostic imaging, radiology, surgery (general, gynecological and vascular), nuclear medicine, wound care and hyperbaric medicine, intensive care, emergency care and physical therapy. The CarePlus Center offers sophisticated testing capabilities and compassionate care, all in a modern, patient-friendly environment. Services include diagnostic imaging services, x-ray, mammography, bone densitometry, computed tomography (CT), ultrasound, physical therapy and laboratory services on a walk-in basis.
 
The purchase price was approximately $658,537. This purchase price was made available by Christopher Diamantis, a director of the Company. Diligence, legal and other costs associated with the acquisition are estimated to be approximately $250,000, meaning the total cost of acquisition to the Company is approximately $908,000.
 
Annual net revenues of these businesses in recent years have been approximately $12,000,000, with government payors, including Medicare and Medicaid, accounting for in excess of 70% of the payor mix. The Company does not expect that payor mix to change in the new future.

The June 13, 2019, June 21, 2019 and June 24, 2019 debentures (collectively, “the June 2019 Debentures”) are secured and guaranteed by the Company’s subsidiaries on the same terms as provided in the Securities Purchase Agreement, dated as of August 31, 2017. At the Company’s option, the June 2019 Debentures may also be exchanged for shares of the Company’s Series I-2 Convertible Preferred Stock under the terms of the previously-announced Exchange Agreement, dated as of October 30, 2017. Commencing on August 17, 2019, the June 2019 Debentures shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount at a rate of 2.5% per month (increasing to 5% per month on October 12, 2019), payable quarterly beginning on October 1, 2019. All overdue accrued and unpaid interest shall entail a late fee equal to the lesser of 24% per annum or the maximum rate permitted by applicable law. Christopher Diamantis is a guarantor of the June 2019 Debentures.
 
Promissory Note
 
On September 27, 2019, the Company issued a promissory note to a lender in the principal amount of $1.9 million and received proceeds of $1.6 million. The first principal payment of $1.0 million is due on or before November 8, 2019 and the remaining $0.9 million is due on or before December 26, 2019. The note does not bear interest except upon the occurrence of an event of default (as defined in the note). The note is unsecured and is guaranteed by Mr. Diamantis.
Accounts Receivable Factoring Arrangements
 
Subsequent to December 31, 2018 and through September 10, 2019, the Company entered into five accounts receivable factoring arrangements as more fully discussed in Note 21 to the consolidated financial statements.
Accounts Receivable Financing (Prepaid Forward Purchase Contract)
 
As previously announced, on March 31, 2016 the Company entered into an agreement to sell certain of its accounts receivable. The agreement was originally scheduled to mature on March 31, 2017, which date was extended to March 31, 2018 by an amendment on March 24, 2017. Also, what the counterparty was to receive was amended to equal (a) the $5,000,000 purchase price plus a 20% per annum investment return thereon, plus (b) $500,000, plus (c) the product of (i) the proceeds received from the accounts receivable, minus the amount set forth in clauses (a) and (b), multiplied by 40%. In connection with this extension, the counterparty received a fee of $1,000,000. On April 2, 2018, the Company, the purchaser and Christopher Diamantis, a director of the Company, as guarantor, entered into a second amendment to extend further the Company’s obligation to May 30, 2018. In connection with this further extension, the purchaser received a fee of $100,000. The counterparty instituted an arbitration proceeding under the agreement with regard to the outstanding balance. In December 2018, the Company, Mr. Diamantis and the counterparty entered into a preliminary settlement agreement in connection with the arbitration, with the terms of the settlement agreement revised on March 31, 2019. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, the Company and Mr. Diamantis agreed to pay the counterparty $2,000,000 on or before April 5, 2019 and an additional $7,694,685 plus interest at 10% per annum on or before May 20, 2019. These terms were subsequently amended and on April 5, 2019 and May 31, 2019, Mr. Diamantis, a director of the Company made payments totaling $5,000,000 on behalf of the Company. A final payment of $4,937,105 was agreed to be made on or before July 28, 2019. Mr. Diamantis made that payment on behalf of the Company on July 26, 2019. The Company and Mr. Diamantis have now complied with all of their obligations under the settlement agreement. As a result, the Company is now obligated to repay Mr. Diamantis a total of $9,937,105. To date, the Company has not recovered any proceeds from the disputed accounts receivable.

Our Services
 
We are a healthcare enterprise that delivers products and services to healthcare providers, their patients and individuals. We operate in two synergistic divisions: 1) Hospital operations; and 2) Clinical diagnostics services through our clinical laboratory. We aspire to create a more sustainable relationship with our customers by offering needed and interoperable solutions to capture multiple revenue streams from medical providers, patients and hospital services.
Hospital Operations
 
We believe that the acquisition or development of rural hospitals will create a stable revenue base from a needed service and believe that we can expand the sales of our products and services to surrounding medical providers and doctors’ groups, as well as realize the potential for significant synergistic opportunities with our Clinical Laboratory Operations business segment.
Scott County Community Hospital (DBA Big South Fork Medical Center)
 
On January 13, 2017, we closed on an asset purchase agreement to acquire certain assets related to Scott County Community Hospital, based in Oneida, Tennessee (the “Oneida Assets”). The Oneida Assets include a 52,000 square foot hospital building and 6,300 square foot professional building on approximately 4.3 acres. Scott County Community Hospital is classified as a Critical Access Hospital (rural) with 25 beds, a 24/7 emergency department, operating rooms and a laboratory that provides a range of diagnostic services. Scott County Community Hospital closed in July 2016 in connection with the bankruptcy filing of its parent company, Pioneer Health Services, Inc. We acquired the Oneida Assets out of bankruptcy for a purchase price of $1.0 million. The hospital, which has been renamed Big South Fork Medical Center, became operational on August 8, 2017.
Jamestown Regional Medical Center
 
On January 31, 2018, the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement to acquire certain assets related to an acute care hospital located in Jamestown, Tennessee, referred to as Jamestown Regional Medical Center. The purchase was completed on June 1, 2018. The hospital was acquired by a newly formed subsidiary, Jamestown TN Medical Center, Inc., and is an 85-bed facility of approximately 90,000 square feet on over eight acres of land, which offers a 24-hour Emergency Department with two spacious trauma bays and seven private exam rooms, inpatient and outpatient medical services and a Progressive Care Unit which provides telemetry services. The acquisition also included a separate physician practice which now operates under Rennova as Mountain View Physician Practice, Inc. Jamestown is located 38 miles west of our from Big South Fork Medical Center.
 
Jellico Medical Center
 
On March 5, 2019, the Company closed an asset purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) whereby it acquired certain assets related to an acute care hospital located in Jellico, Tennessee and an outpatient clinic located in Williamsburg, Kentucky. The hospital is known as Jellico Community Hospital and the clinic is known as the CarePlus Center. The hospital and the clinic and their associated assets were acquired from Jellico Community Hospital, Inc. and CarePlus Rural Health Clinic, LLC, respectively.
 
Jellico Community Hospital is a fully operational 54-bed acute care facility that offers comprehensive services, including diagnostic imaging, radiology, surgery (general, gynecological and vascular), nuclear medicine, wound care and hyperbaric medicine, intensive care, emergency care and physical therapy. Jellico is located 33 miles east of our Big South Fork Medical Center. The CarePlus Center offers sophisticated testing capabilities and compassionate care, all in a modern, patient-friendly environment. Services include diagnostic imaging services, x-ray, mammography, bone densitometry, computed tomography (CT), ultrasound, physical therapy and laboratory services on a walk-in basis.
 
The purchase price was approximately $658,537. This purchase price was made available by Christopher Diamantis, a director of the Company. Diligence, legal and other costs associated with the acquisition are estimated to be approximately $250,000, meaning the total cost of acquisition to the Company is approximately $908,000.
 
Annual net revenues of these businesses in recent years have been approximately $12,000,000, with government payors, including Medicare and Medicaid, accounting for in excess of 70% of the payor mix. The Company does not expect that payor mix to change in the new future.
 
Our hospital operations began on August 8, 2017, following the receipt of the required licenses and regulatory approvals and generated revenues of approximately $14.4 million during 2018 and approximately $0.9 million during the period from August 8, 2017 to December 31, 2017. Management determined that because Big South Fork Medical Center was reopened after being closed and contracts with payers had to be negotiated and implemented during the first months of operation, they would recognize a 20% collection rate for the period to December 31, 2017, until there was adequate collection history to analyze and confirm anticipated collections. During 2018, based on collection history achieved, management recognized a 17% collection rate for all of our hospitals.
 
Clinical Diagnostics
 
Prior to our focus on hospital operations, our principal focus had been clinical laboratory blood and urine testing services, with a particular emphasis on the provision of urine drug toxicology testing to physicians, clinics and rehabilitation facilities in the United States. Testing services to physicians, clinics and rehabilitation facilities represented approximately 0.9%% and 71.6% of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We believe that we are responding to the challenges faced by today’s healthcare providers to adopt paper free and interoperable systems, and to market demand for solutions by strategically expanding our offering of diagnostics services to include a full suite of clinical laboratory services. The drug and alcohol rehabilitation and pain management sectors provide an existing and sizable target market, where the need for our services already exists and opportunity is being created by a continued secular growth and need for compliance. This sector has been fraught with difficulties over the past number of years as payers reduce reimbursement and cover for diagnostics in this sector. The lack of consistency between payer’s policies and their requirement for proof of medical necessity has created uncertainty for ordering physicians and testing laboratories and their ability to receive payment. In the first quarter of 2018, we reduced the number of laboratories we operate to one facility in Palm Beach County, Florida.

The Company owns and operates the following products and services to support its business objectives and to enable it to offer these services to its customers:
 
Medytox Diagnostics, Inc. (“MDI”)
 
Through our Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (“CLIA”) certified laboratory, Rennova offers toxicology, clinical pharmacogenetics and esoteric testing. Rennova seeks to provide these testing services with superior logistics and specimen integrity, competitive turn-around times and excellent customer service.
Clinical Laboratory Operations
 
The Company, through its wholly-owned MDI subsidiary, owns and operates the following clinical laboratory:
 

Laboratory | Location 
------------------------------+----------------------
EPIC Reference Labs, Inc. | Riviera Beach, FL 

 
During 2017 and 2018, the Company experienced a substantial decline in the volume of samples processed at its laboratories and continued difficulty in receiving reimbursement for certain diagnostics. As a result, in an effort to reduce costs, the Company is currently operating its Clinical Laboratory Operations business segment out of its EPIC Reference Labs, Inc. (“EPIC”) laboratory, and cost reduction efforts are continuing in response to the operating losses incurred. MDI formed EPIC as a wholly-owned subsidiary on January 29, 2013 to provide reference, confirmation and clinical testing services. The Company acquired necessary equipment and licenses in order to allow EPIC to test urine for drugs and medication monitoring. Operations at EPIC began in January 2014 using approximately 2,500 square feet and the premises has since been expanded to occupy approximately 12,500 square feet.
 
The Company’s Medytox Medical Marketing & Sales, Inc. subsidiary was formed on March 9, 2013 as a wholly-owned subsidiary to provide marketing, sales, and customer service exclusively for our clinical laboratories.
 
Marketing Strategy
 
Rennova provides a suite of products and services to the medical services sector. We endeavor to be a single source for multiple business solutions that serve the medical services industry. The Company intends to expand, through its acquisition and subsequent integration of businesses, into a robust business model providing an extensive range of services to medical providers that demonstrate improved patient care and outcomes.
Competition
 
The healthcare industry is highly competitive among hospitals and other healthcare providers for patients, affiliations with physicians and acquisitions. The most significant competition our hospitals, and any other hospitals we may acquire, face comes from hospitals that provide more complex services, and other healthcare providers, including outpatient surgery, orthopedic, oncology and diagnostic centers that also compete for patients. Our hospitals, our competitors, and other healthcare industry participants are increasingly implementing physician alignment strategies, such as acquiring physician practice groups, employing physicians and participating in ACOs or other clinical integration models, which may impact our competitive position. In addition, increasing consolidation within the payor industry, vertical integration efforts involving payors and healthcare providers, and cost-reduction strategies by large employer groups and their affiliates may impact our ability to contract with payors on favorable terms and otherwise affect our competitive position.
 
The Company competes in a fragmented diagnostics industry split between independently-owned and physician-owned laboratories. There are three predominant players in the industry that operate as full-service clinical laboratories (processing blood, urine and other tissue). In addition, the competition ranges from smaller privately-owned laboratories (3-6 employees) to large publicly-traded laboratories with significant market capitalizations.

Governmental Regulation
 
Overview
 
The healthcare industry is governed by an extremely complex framework of federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations, and there continue to be federal and state proposals that would, and actions that do, impose limitations on government and private payments to providers. In addition, there regularly are proposals to increase co-payments and deductibles from program and private patients. Facilities also are affected by controls imposed by government and private payors designed to reduce admissions and lengths of stay. Such controls include what is commonly referred to as “utilization review”. Utilization review entails the review of a patient’s admission and course of treatment by a third party. Historically, utilization review has resulted in a decrease in certain treatments and procedures being performed. Utilization review is required in connection with the provision of care which is to be funded by Medicare and Medicaid and is also required under many managed care arrangements.
 
Many states have enacted, or are considering enacting, additional measures that are designed to reduce their Medicaid expenditures and to make changes to private healthcare insurance. Various states have applied, or are considering applying, for a waiver from current Medicaid regulations in order to allow them to serve some of their Medicaid participants through managed care providers. These proposals also may attempt to include coverage for some people who presently are uninsured, and generally could have the effect of reducing payments to hospitals, physicians and other providers for the same level of service provided under Medicaid.
 
Healthcare Facility Regulation
 
Certificate of Need Requirements
 
A number of states require approval for the purchase, construction or expansion of various healthcare facilities, including findings of need for additional or expanded healthcare services. Certificates of Need (“CONs”), which are issued by governmental agencies with jurisdiction over applicable healthcare facilities, are at times required for capital expenditures exceeding a prescribed amount, changes in bed capacity or the addition of services and certain other matters. Tennessee, the state in which we currently operate our hospitals, has a CON law that applies to such facilities. States periodically review, modify and revise their CON laws and related regulations. Any violation of state CON laws can result in the imposition of civil sanctions or the revocation of licenses for such facilities. We are unable to predict whether our hospitals will be able to obtain any CONs that may be necessary to accomplish their business objectives in any jurisdiction where such certificates of need are required. Violation of these state laws may result in the imposition of civil sanctions or the revocation of licenses for such facilities. In addition, future healthcare facility acquisitions also may occur in states that require CONs.
 
Future healthcare facility acquisitions also may occur in states that do not require CONs or which have less stringent CON requirements than the state in which Rennova currently operates its hospitals. Any healthcare facility operated by the Company in such states may face increased competition from new or expanding facilities operated by competitors, including physicians.
 
Utilization Review Compliance and Hospital Governance
 
Healthcare facilities are subject to, and comply with, various forms of utilization review. In addition, under the Medicare prospective payment system, each state must have a peer review organization to carry out a federally mandated system of review of Medicare patient admissions, treatments and discharges in hospitals. Medical and surgical services and physician practices are supervised by committees of staff doctors at each healthcare facility, are overseen by each healthcare facility’s local governing board, the primary voting members of which are physicians and community members, and are reviewed by quality assurance personnel. The local governing boards also help maintain standards for quality care, develop long-range plans, establish, review and enforce practices and procedures and approve the credentials and disciplining of medical staff members.
Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act
 
The Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (“EMTALA”) is a federal law that requires any hospital that participates in the Medicare program to conduct an appropriate medical screening examination of every person who presents to the hospital’s emergency department for treatment and, if the patient is suffering from an emergency medical condition or is in active labor, to either stabilize that condition or make an appropriate transfer of the patient to a facility that can handle the condition. The obligation to screen and stabilize emergency medical conditions exists regardless of a patient’s ability to pay for treatment. There are severe penalties under EMTALA if a hospital fails to screen or appropriately stabilize or transfer a patient or if the hospital delays appropriate treatment in order to first inquire about the patient’s ability to pay. Penalties for violations of EMTALA include civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in the Medicare program, the Medicaid program or both. In addition, an injured patient, the patient’s family or a medical facility that suffers a financial loss as a direct result of another hospital’s violation of the law can bring a civil suit against that other hospital. Although we believe that our hospitals comply with EMTALA, we cannot predict whether the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) will implement new requirements in the future and whether our hospitals will be able to comply with any new requirements.

General Healthcare Regulations
 
Drugs and Controlled Substances
 
Various licenses and permits are required by our hospitals to dispense narcotics. They are required to register our dispensing operations for permits and/or licenses with, and comply with certain operating and security standards of, the United States DEA, the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), state health departments and other state agencies.
 
Fraud and Abuse, Anti-Kickback and Self-Referral Regulations
 
Participation in the Medicare and/or Medicaid programs is heavily regulated by federal statutes and regulations. If we fail to comply substantially with the numerous federal laws governing such activities, our participation in the Medicare and/or Medicaid programs may be terminated and/or civil or criminal penalties may be imposed. For example, a hospital may lose its ability to participate in the Medicare and/or Medicaid programs if it:
 

● | makes claims to Medicare and/or Medicaid for services not provided or misrepresents actual services provided in order to obtain higher payments; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | pays money to induce the referral of patients or the purchase of items or services where such items or services are reimbursable under a federal or state health program; 
● | fails to report or repay improper or excess payments; or 
● | fails to provide appropriate emergency medical screening services to any individual who comes to a hospital’s campus or otherwise fails to properly treat and transfer emergency patients. 

 
Hospitals continue to be one of the primary focus areas of the Office of the Inspector General (“OIG”) of the United States and other governmental fraud and abuse programs and the OIG has issued and periodically updated compliance program guidance for hospitals. Each federal fiscal year, the OIG also publishes a General Work Plan that provides a brief description of the activities that the OIG plans to initiate or continue with respect to the programs and operations of the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) and details the areas that the OIG believes are prone to fraud and abuse.
 
Sections of the Anti-Fraud and Abuse Amendments to the Social Security Act, commonly known as the “anti-kickback” statute, prohibit certain business practices and relationships that might influence the provision and cost of healthcare services reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, TriCare or other healthcare programs, including the payment or receipt of remuneration for the referral of patients whose care will be funded by Medicare or other government programs. Sanctions for violating the anti-kickback statute include criminal penalties and civil sanctions, including fines and possible exclusion from future participation in government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. HHS has issued regulations that create safe harbors under the anti-kickback statute. A given business arrangement that does not fall within an enumerated safe harbor is not per se illegal; however, business arrangements that fail to satisfy the applicable safe harbor criteria are subject to increased scrutiny by enforcement authorities.
 
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) broadened the scope of the fraud and abuse laws by adding several criminal statutes that are not related to receipt of payments from a federal healthcare program. HIPAA created civil penalties for proscribed conduct, including upcoding and billing for medically unnecessary goods or services. These laws cover all health insurance programs, private as well as governmental. In addition, HIPAA broadened the scope of certain fraud and abuse laws, such as the anti-kickback statute, to include not just Medicare and Medicaid services, but all healthcare services reimbursed under a federal or state healthcare program. Finally, HIPAA established enforcement mechanisms to combat fraud and abuse. These mechanisms include a bounty system where a portion of the payment recovered is returned to the government agencies, as well as a whistleblower program, where a portion of the payment received is paid to the whistleblower. HIPAA also expanded the categories of persons that may be excluded from participation in federal and state healthcare programs.
 
There is increasing scrutiny by law enforcement authorities, the OIG, the courts and the U.S. Congress of arrangements between healthcare providers and potential referral sources to ensure that the arrangements are not designed as mechanisms to exchange remuneration for patient-care referrals and opportunities. Investigators also have demonstrated a willingness to look behind the formalities of a business transaction and to reinterpret the underlying purpose of payments between healthcare providers and potential referral sources. Enforcement actions have increased, as is evidenced by highly publicized enforcement investigations of certain hospital activities.

In addition, provisions of the Social Security Act, known as the Stark Act, also prohibit physicians from referring Medicare and Medicaid patients to providers of a broad range of designated health services with which the physicians or their immediate family members have ownership or certain other financial arrangements. Certain exceptions are available for employment agreements, leases, physician recruitment and certain other physician arrangements. A person making a referral, or seeking payment for services referred, in violation of the Stark Act is subject to civil monetary penalties; restitution of any amounts received for illegally billed claims; and/or exclusion from future participation in the Medicare program, which can subject the person or entity to exclusion from future participation in state healthcare programs.
 
Further, if any physician or entity enters into an arrangement or scheme that the physician or entity knows or should have known has the principal purpose of assuring referrals by the physician to a particular entity, and the physician directly makes referrals to such entity, then such physician or entity could be subject to a civil monetary penalty. Compliance with and the enforcing of penalties for violations of these laws and regulations is changing and increasing. For example, CMS has issued a “self-referral disclosure protocol” for hospitals and other providers that wish to self-disclose potential violations of the Stark Act and attempt to resolve those potential violations and any related overpayment liabilities at levels below the maximum penalties and amounts set forth in the statute. In light of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act that created potential liabilities under the federal False Claims Act (discussed below) for failing to report and repay known overpayments and return an overpayment within 60 days of the identification of the overpayment or the date by which a corresponding cost report is due, whichever is later, hospitals and other healthcare providers are encouraged to disclose potential violations of the Stark Act to CMS. It is likely that self-disclosure of Stark Act violations will increase in the future. Finally, many states have adopted or are considering similar legislative proposals, some of which extend beyond the Medicaid program, to prohibit the payment or receipt of remuneration for the referral of patients and physician self-referrals regardless of the source of the payment for the care.
 
The Federal False Claims Act and Similar State Laws
 
The Federal False Claims Act prohibits providers from, among other things, knowingly submitting false or fraudulent claims for payment to the federal government. The False Claims Act defines the term “knowingly” broadly, and while simple negligence generally will not give rise to liability, submitting a claim with reckless disregard to its truth or falsity can constitute the “knowing” submission of a false or fraudulent claim for the purposes of the False Claims Act. The “qui tam” or “whistleblower” provisions of the False Claims Act allow private individuals to bring actions under the False Claims Act on behalf of the government. These private parties are entitled to share in any amounts recovered by the government, and, as a result, the number of “whistleblower” lawsuits that have been filed against providers has increased significantly in recent years. When a private party brings a qui tam action under the False Claims Act, the defendant will generally not be aware of the lawsuit until the government makes a determination whether it will intervene and take a lead in the litigation. If a provider is found to be liable under the False Claims Act, the provider may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government plus mandatory civil monetary penalties for each separate false claim. The government has used the False Claims Act to prosecute Medicare and other government healthcare program fraud such as coding errors, billing for services not provided, submitting false cost reports, and providing care that is not medically necessary or that is substandard in quality.
HIPAA Transaction, Privacy and Security Requirements
 
HIPAA and federal regulations issued pursuant to HIPAA contain, among other measures, provisions that have required the Company to implement modified or new computer systems, employee training programs and business procedures. The federal regulations are intended to encourage electronic commerce in the healthcare industry, provide for the confidentiality and privacy of patient healthcare information and ensure the security of healthcare information.
 
A violation of the HIPAA regulations could result in civil money penalties per standard violated. HIPAA also provides for criminal penalties and one year in prison for knowingly and improperly obtaining or disclosing protected health information, up to five years in prison for obtaining protected health information under false pretenses and up to ten years in prison for obtaining or disclosing protected health information with the intent to sell, transfer or use such information for commercial advantage, personal gain or malicious harm. Since there is limited history of enforcement efforts by the federal government at this time, it is difficult to ascertain the likelihood of enforcement efforts in connection with the HIPAA regulations or the potential for fines and penalties, which may result from any violation of the regulations.

HIPAA Privacy Regulations
 
HIPAA privacy regulations protect the privacy of individually identifiable health information. The regulations provide increased patient control over medical records, mandate substantial financial penalties for violation of a patient’s right to privacy and, with a few exceptions, require that an individual’s individually identifiable health information only be used for healthcare-related purposes. These privacy standards apply to all health plans, all healthcare clearinghouses and healthcare providers, such as our hospitals, that transmit health information in an electronic form in connection with standard transactions, and apply to individually identifiable information held or disclosed by a covered entity in any form. These standards impose extensive administrative requirements on our hospitals and require compliance with rules governing the use and disclosure of such health information, and they require our facilities to impose these rules, by contract, on any business associate to whom we disclose such information in order to perform functions on our behalf. In addition, our hospitals are subject to any state laws that are more restrictive than the privacy regulations issued under HIPAA. These laws vary by state and could impose stricter standards and additional penalties.
 
The HIPAA privacy regulations also require healthcare providers to implement and enforce privacy policies to ensure compliance with the regulations and standards. We believe all of our facilities are in compliance with current HIPAA privacy regulations.
 
HIPAA Electronic Data Standards
 
The Administrative Simplification Provisions of HIPAA require the use of uniform electronic data transmission standards for all healthcare related electronic data interchange. These provisions are intended to streamline and encourage electronic commerce in the healthcare industry. Among other things, these provisions require us to use standard data formats and code sets established by HHS when electronically transmitting information in connection with certain transactions, including health claims and equivalent encounter information, healthcare payment and remittance advice and health claim status.
 
The HHS regulations establish electronic data transmission standards that all healthcare providers and payors must use when submitting and receiving certain electronic healthcare transactions. The uniform data transmission standards are designed to enable healthcare providers to exchange billing and payment information directly with the many payors thereby eliminating data clearinghouses and simplifying the interface programs necessary to perform this function. We believe that our management information systems comply with HIPAA’s electronic data regulations and standards.
 
HIPAA Security Standards
 
The Administrative Simplification Provisions of HIPAA require the use of a series of security standards for the protection of electronic health information. The HIPAA security standards rule specifies a series of administrative, technical and physical security procedures for covered entities to use to assure the confidentiality of electronic protected health information. The standards are delineated into either required or addressable implementation specifications.
HIPAA National Provider Identifier
 
HIPAA also required HHS to issue regulations establishing standard unique health identifiers for individuals, employers, health plans and healthcare providers to be used in connection with standard electronic transactions. All healthcare providers, including our hospitals, were required to obtain a new National Provider Identifier (“NPI”) to be used in standard transactions instead of other numerical identifiers by May 23, 2007. Our hospitals implemented use of a standard unique healthcare identifier by utilizing their employer identification number. HHS has not yet issued proposed rules that establish the standard for unique health identifiers for health plans or individuals. Once these regulations are issued in final form, we expect to have approximately one to two years to become fully compliant, but cannot predict the impact of such changes at this time. We cannot predict whether our facilities may experience payment delays during the transition to the new identifiers. HHS is currently working on the standards for identifiers for health plans; however, there are currently no proposed timelines for issuance of proposed or final rules. The issuance of proposed rules for individuals is on hold indefinitely.
Medical Waste Regulations
 
Our operations, especially our hospitals, generate medical waste that must be disposed of in compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws, rules and regulations. Our operations are also generally subject to various other environmental laws, rules and regulations. Based on our current level of operations, we do not anticipate that such compliance costs will have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, financial position or results of operations.

Compliance Program
 
The Company continuously evaluates and monitors its compliance with all Medicare, Medicaid and other rules and regulations. The objective of the Company’s compliance program is to develop, implement and update compliance safeguards as necessary. Emphasis is placed on developing and implementing compliance policies and guidelines, personnel training programs and various monitoring and audit procedures to attempt to achieve implementation of all applicable rules and regulations.
 
The Company seeks to conduct its business in compliance with all statutes, regulations, and other requirements applicable to its operations. The health care industry is, however, subject to extensive regulation, and many of these statutes and regulations have not been interpreted by the courts. There can be no assurance that applicable statutes and regulations will not be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that would adversely affect the Company. Potential sanctions for violation of these statutes and regulations include significant civil and criminal penalties, fines, exclusions from participation in government health care programs and the loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations, necessary to operate as well as potential liabilities from third-party claims, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.
 
Professional Liability
 
As part of our business, our hospitals are subject to claims of liability for events occurring in the ordinary course of operations. To cover a portion of these claims, professional malpractice liability insurance and general liability insurance are maintained in amounts which are commercially available and believed to be sufficient for operations as currently conducted, although some claims may exceed the scope or amount of the coverage in effect.
Environmental Regulation
 
We believe we are in substantial compliance with applicable federal, state and local environmental regulations. To date, compliance with federal, state and local laws regulating the discharge of material into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment have not had a material effect upon our results of operations, financial condition or competitive position. Similarly, we have not had to make material capital expenditures to comply with such regulations.
Clinical Laboratory Regulations
 
The CLIA are regulations that include federal standards applicable to all U.S. facilities or sites that test human specimens for health assessment or to diagnose, prevent, or treat disease. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”), in partnership with CMS and the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), supports the CLIA program and clinical laboratory quality. CLIA requires that all clinical laboratories meet quality assurance, quality control and personnel standards. Laboratories also must undergo proficiency testing and are subject to inspections.
 
Standards for testing under CLIA are based on the complexity of the tests performed by the laboratory, with tests classified as “high complexity,” “moderate complexity,” or “waived.” Laboratories performing high complexity testing are required to meet more stringent requirements than moderate complexity laboratories. Laboratories performing only waived tests, which are tests determined by the FDA to have a low potential for error and requiring little oversight, may apply for a certificate of waiver exempting them from most of the requirements of CLIA. All Company laboratory facilities hold CLIA certificates to perform high complexity testing. The sanctions for failure to comply with CLIA requirements include suspension, revocation or limitation of a laboratory’s CLIA certificate, which is necessary to conduct business, cancellation or suspension of the laboratory’s approval to receive Medicare and/or Medicaid reimbursement, as well as significant fines and/or criminal penalties. The loss or suspension of a CLIA certification, imposition of a fine or other penalties, or future changes in the CLIA law or regulations (or interpretation of the law or regulations) could have a material adverse effect on the Company.
 
In addition to compliance with the federal regulations, the Company is also subject to state and local laboratory regulation. CLIA provides that a state may adopt laboratory regulations different from or more stringent than those contained in Federal law and a number of states have implemented their own laboratory requirements. State laws may require that laboratory personnel meet certain qualifications, specify certain quality controls, or require maintenance of certain records. There are a number of states that have even more stringent requirements with which lab personnel must comply to obtain state licensure or a certificate of qualification.

The FDA has regulatory responsibility over instruments, test kits, reagents and other devices used by clinical laboratories. The FDA has issued draft guidance regarding FDA regulation of laboratory-developed tests (“LDTs”), but if or how the draft guidance will be implemented is uncertain. On November 18, 2016, the FDA announced it would not release final guidance at this time and instead would continue to work with stakeholders, the new administration and Congress to determine the right approach, and on January 3, 2017, the FDA released a discussion paper outlining a possible risk-based approach for FDA and CMS oversight of LTDs. Later in 2017, the FDA indicated that Congress should enact legislation to address improved oversight of diagnostics, including LTDs, rather than the FDA addressing the issue through administrative proposals. There are many other regulatory and legislative proposals that would increase general FDA oversight of clinical laboratories and LDTs. The outcome and ultimate impact of such proposals on the business is difficult to predict at this time. Our point of collection testing devices are regulated by the FDA. The FDA has authority to take various administrative and legal actions for non-compliance, such as fines, product suspension, warning letters, injunctions and other civil and criminal sanctions. We make every good faith effort to exercise proactive monitoring and review of pending legislation and regulatory action.
 
Reimbursement under the Medicare program for clinical diagnostic laboratory services is subject to a clinical laboratory fee schedule that sets the maximum amount payable in each Medicare carrier’s jurisdiction. This clinical laboratory fee schedule is updated annually. Laboratories bill the program directly for covered tests performed on behalf of Medicare beneficiaries. State Medicaid programs are prohibited from paying more than the Medicare fee schedule limit for clinical laboratory services furnished to Medicaid recipients.
 
In addition to reimbursement rates, the Company is also impacted by changes in coverage policies. Congressional action in 1997 required the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) to adopt uniform coverage, administration and payment policies for many of the most commonly performed lab tests using a negotiated rulemaking process. The negotiated rulemaking committee established uniform policies limiting Medicare coverage for certain tests to patients with specified medical conditions or diagnoses, replacing local Medicare coverage policies which varied around the country. The final rules generally became effective in 2002, and the use of uniform policies improves the Company’s ability to obtain necessary billing information in some cases, but Medicare, Medicaid and private payer diagnosis code requirements and payment policies continue to negatively impact the Company’s ability to be paid for some of the tests it performs. Further, some payers require additional information to process claims or have implemented prior authorization policies, which delay or prohibit payment. Due to the range of payers and policies, the extent of this impact continues to be difficult to quantify.
 
The Company believes that it is in compliance with all applicable laboratory requirements. The Company’s laboratory has continuing programs to ensure that its operations meet all such regulatory requirements, but no assurances can be given that the Company’s laboratory will pass all future licensure or certification inspections. We embrace compliance as an integral part of our culture and we consistently promote that culture of ethics and integrity.
 
Payment for Services
 
In each of 2018 and 2017, the Company’s Hospital Operations derived over 60% of their net sales directly from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The Company’s Hospital Operations depend significantly on continued participation in these programs and in other government healthcare programs. In recent years, both governmental and private sector payers have made efforts to contain or reduce health care costs, including reducing reimbursement for services.
 
Following an inspection at Jamestown Regional Medical Center on February 5, 2019, the hospital was informed on February 15 that several conditions of participation in its Medicare agreement were deficient. The hospital was informed that if the deficiencies where not corrected by May 16 the Medicare agreement would terminate. A follow-up inspection on May 15 resulted in the determination that the hospital had failed to adequately correct the deficiencies highlighted and a notice of involuntary termination was issued that was effective on June 12, 2019. A significant percentage of patients at Jamestown Regional Medical Center are covered by Medicare and without any ability to get paid for these services the Company suspended operations at the hospital. On June 10, 2019 the Company hired a new CEO to oversee the reopening of the hospital and took steps to re-enter the Medicare program. The hospital received initial approval of its application to reactivate the Medicare agreement in August and is currently planning the reopening of the hospital.
 
In 2018 and 2017, the Company’s Clinical Laboratory Operations derived less than 10% and 16%, respectively, of their net sales directly from the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
 
Employees
 
As of August 31, 2019, we have 309 employees for our continuing operations, of which 178 are full time. Of our total employees from continuing operations, two are assigned to Clinical Laboratory Operations, four are assigned to corporate administration and 303 are assigned to our Hospital Operations. In addition, we have eight employees associated with our discontinued operations. We continue to adjust our number of employees to achieve efficiencies and cost savings where applicable.
