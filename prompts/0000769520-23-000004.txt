The Customers and Market

Commercial Foodservice Equipment Industry

The company's end-user customers include: (i) fast food, fast casual and quick-service restaurants, including ghost kitchens, (ii) full-service restaurants, including casual-theme restaurants, (iii) retail outlets, such as convenience stores, supermarkets and department stores and (iv) public and private institutions, such as hotels, resorts, schools, hospitals, long-term care facilities, correctional facilities, stadiums, airports, corporate cafeterias, college and universities, military facilities and government agencies. The company's domestic sales are primarily through independent dealers and distributors and are marketed by the company's sales personnel and network of independent manufacturers' representatives. Many of the dealers in the U.S. belong to buying groups that negotiate sales terms with the company. Certain large multi-national restaurant and hotel chain customers have purchasing organizations that manage product procurement for their systems. Included in these customers are several large multi-national restaurant chains, which account for a meaningful portion of the company's business, although no single customer accounts for more than 10% of net sales.

Over the past several decades, the commercial foodservice equipment industry has enjoyed steady growth in the United States due to the development of new quick-service and casual-theme restaurant chain concepts, the expansion of foodservice into nontraditional locations such as convenience stores and retail outlets, as well as store equipment modernization driven by efforts to improve efficiencies within foodservice operations. In the international markets, foodservice equipment manufacturers have been experiencing growth due to expanding international economies and increased opportunity for expansion by U.S. chains into developing regions.

The company believes that the worldwide commercial foodservice equipment market has sales in excess of $35.0 billion. The company believes that continuing growth in demand for foodservice equipment will result from the development of new restaurant concepts in the U.S. and the expansion of U.S. and foreign chains into international markets, the replacement and upgrade of existing equipment and new equipment requirements resulting from menu changes, menu diversity and consumer food trends.
The company is developing innovations to solve the challenges within our customers' operations. We believe automated equipment that addresses labor issues will provide our customers a meaningful return on their investment. Innovative equipment solutions, including integrated IoT platforms and universal controllers, will allow restaurateurs to scale their operations quickly and leverage data to make operational decisions. 

Food Processing Equipment Industry

The company's customers include a diversified base of leading food processors. Customers include several large international food processing companies, which account for a significant portion of the revenues of this business segment, although none of which is greater than 10% of net sales. A large portion of the company's revenues have been generated from producers of protein products such as bacon, salami, hot dogs, dinner sausages, poultry, lunchmeats and plant based/alternative protein and producers of bakery products, such as muffins, cookies, crackers, pies, bread and buns; however, the company believes that it can leverage its expertise and product development capabilities in thermal processing to organically grow into new end markets and offers unique full processing line solutions.

Food processing has quickly become a highly competitive landscape dominated by a few large conglomerates that possess a variety of food brands. The consolidation of food processing plants associated with industry consolidation drives a need for more flexible and efficient equipment that is capable of processing large volumes in quicker cycle times. In recent years, food processors have had to conform to the demands of “big box” retailers and the restaurant industry, including, most importantly, greater product consistency and exact package weights. Food processors are beginning to realize that their old equipment is no longer capable of efficiently producing adequate uniformity in the large product volumes required, and they are turning to equipment manufacturers that offer better process control for proven product consistency, innovative packaging designs and other solutions. To protect their own brands and reputations, retailers and large restaurant chains are also dictating food safety standards that are often stricter than government regulations.
A number of factors, including raw material prices, cost of ownership of their equipment, labor and health care costs, are driving food processors to focus on ways to improve their generally thin profitability margins. In order to increase the profitability and efficiency in processing plants, food processors pay increasingly more attention to the performance of their machinery and the flexibility in the functionality of the equipment. Food processors are continuously looking for ways to make their plants safer and reduce labor-intensive activities. Food processors have begun to recognize the value of new technology as an important vehicle to drive productivity and profitability in their plants. Due to customer requirements, food processors are expected to continue to demand new and innovative equipment that addresses food safety, food quality, automation, flexibility and sustainability.
Improving living standards in developing countries is spurring increased worldwide demand for pre-cooked and convenience food products. As industrializing countries create more jobs, consumers in these countries will have the means to buy pre-cooked food products. In industrialized regions, such as Western Europe and the U.S., consumers are demanding more pre-cooked and convenience food products, such as deli tray variety packs, frozen food products and ready-to-eat varieties of ethnic foods.

The global food processing equipment industry is highly fragmented, large and growing. The company estimates demand for food processing equipment is in excess of $55.0 billion worldwide. 
Residential Kitchen Equipment Industry
The company’s end-users include customers with high-end residential kitchens as well as retail dealers of residential cooking equipment. The market potential for such equipment has continued to broaden due to an increase in interest from the consumer to have professionally styled appliances with commercial inspired, higher performing features in their home as well as their outdoor entertaining space. The kitchen, both indoors and out, has been the main area in which consumers have invested the most money over the past several decades to increase the personal satisfaction and the value of their home. Other important factors which affect the market size and growth include the level of new home starts, increase in home renovations and general macro-economic factors. Macro-economic factors such as GDP growth, employment rates, inflation, interest rates and consumer confidence, which impact the overall economy, impact the residential kitchen equipment industry and cause variability in the revenues at this segment. The residential kitchen appliance industry is estimated to be in excess of $260.0 billion worldwide.

Competition

The commercial foodservice, food processing and residential kitchen equipment industries are highly competitive and fragmented. Within a given product line the company may compete with a variety of companies, including companies that manufacture a broad line of products and those that specialize in a particular product category. Competition is based upon many factors, including brand recognition, product features, reliability, quality, price, delivery lead times, serviceability and after-sale service. The company believes that its ability to compete depends on strong brand equity, exceptional product performance, short lead-times and timely delivery, competitive pricing and superior customer service support. In the international markets, the company competes with U.S. manufacturers and numerous global and local competitors.

The company believes that it is one of the largest multiple-line manufacturers of commercial kitchen, food processing and residential kitchen equipment in the U.S. and worldwide although some of its competitors are units of operations that are larger than the company and possess greater financial and personnel resources. Among the company's major competitors to the Commercial Foodservice Equipment Group are the Ali Group S.r.l.; Duke Manufacturing; AB Electrolux; Haier Group; Hoshizaki America, Inc.; Hobart Corporation and Vulcan-Hart, subsidiaries of Illinois Tool Works Inc.; Marmon Foodservice Technologies, a Berkshire Hathaway Company; Midea Group; Panasonic Corporation; Rational AG; SMEG S.p.A.; and Welbilt, Inc.

The company's efforts have also been focused on IoT solutions which allow customers to connect, analyze and control equipment, while delivering operational efficiencies. The company has identified these issues as key concerns for most of its customers. The company often identifies product improvement opportunities by working closely with customers on specific applications. Most research and development activities are performed by the company's technical service and engineering staff located at each manufacturing location. On occasion, the company will contract outside engineering firms to assist with the development of certain technical concepts and applications. See Note 3(n) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the company's research and development activities.
Seasonality

The company’s revenues at the Commercial Foodservice Equipment Group historically have been slightly stronger in the second and third quarters due to increased purchases from customers involved with the catering business and institutional customers, particularly schools, during the summer months. Revenues at the Residential Kitchen Equipment Group are historically stronger in the second and third quarters, due to increased purchases of outdoor cooking equipment and greater new home construction and remodels during the summer months, and the fourth quarter, due to increased holiday purchases in the European markets. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, typical patterns of seasonality as previously mentioned were disrupted.
Trademarks, Patents and Licenses

The company has developed, acquired and assembled a leading portfolio of trademarks and trade names. The company believes that these trademarks and trade names help the company compete in the marketplace due to their recognition with customers, restaurant operators, distribution partners, sales and service agents, and foodservice consultants that specify foodservice equipment.
