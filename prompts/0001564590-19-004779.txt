General Development of Business
 SITE Centers Corp. (formerly known as DDR Corp.), an Ohio corporation (the “Company” or “SITE Centers”), a self-administered and self-managed Real Estate Investment Trust (“REIT”), is in the business of acquiring, owning, developing, redeveloping, expanding, leasing, financing and managing shopping centers.  Unless otherwise provided, references herein to the Company or SITE Centers include SITE Centers Corp. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries and consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures.  
 The Company is self-administered and self-managed and, therefore, has not engaged, nor does it expect to retain, any REIT advisor.  The Company manages all of the Portfolio Properties as defined herein.  At December 31, 2018, the Company owned approximately 60.6 million total square feet of gross leasable area (“GLA”) through all its properties (wholly-owned and joint venture) and managed approximately 16.9 million total square feet of GLA for Retail Value Inc. (“RVI”).  
 The primary source of the Company’s income is generated from the rental of the Company’s Portfolio Properties to tenants.  The shopping centers and land are collectively referred to as the “Portfolio Properties.”  In addition, the Company generates revenue from its management contracts with its unconsolidated joint venture assets and RVI, as well as interest income from notes receivable.  
 On July 1, 2018, SITE Centers completed the spin-off of RVI.  At the time of the spin-off, RVI owned 48 shopping centers, comprised of 36 continental U.S. assets and all 12 of SITE Centers’ shopping centers in Puerto Rico, representing $2.7 billion of gross book asset value and $1.27 billion of mortgage debt.   
 Strategy
 The overall investment, operating and financing policies of the Company, which govern a variety of activities, such as capital allocations, dividends and status as a REIT, are determined by management and the Board of Directors.  Although management and the Board of Directors have no present intention to materially amend or revise the Company’s policies, the Board of Directors may do so from time to time without a vote of the Company’s shareholders.  
 The Company's mission is to deliver superior total shareholder returns through the ownership and operation of shopping centers.  Management believes that returns should be underpinned by strong earnings growth, sustainable dividends, and a balance sheet that is well positioned through various economic cycles.
In 2018, the Company completed its portfolio transformation through the sale of $1.0 billion of assets and the strategic initiative to spin-off 48 assets into a separate, publicly-traded REIT, RVI.  The Company also initiated its capital recycling program through the formation of a 20% owned unconsolidated joint venture consisting of 10 existing assets, Dividend Trust Portfolio JV LP (“Dividend Trust Portfolio joint venture”).  In 2019, growth opportunities within the core property operations include rental increases and continued lease-up of the portfolio.  Additional growth opportunities include a renewed focus on redevelopment of the SITE Centers portfolio as well as opportunistic investments.  Having largely completed its deleveraging plans, management intends to use proceeds from future sales of lower growth assets, including sales to newly formed joint ventures, largely to fund opportunistic investments in assets that offer growth potential through specialized leasing and redevelopments efforts.
 The Company believes the following serve as cornerstones for the execution of its strategy:
  
• | Maximization of recurring cash flows through strong leasing and core property operations;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Enhancement of property cash flows through creative, proactive redevelopment efforts that result in the profitable adaptation of assets to better suit dynamic retail tenant and community demands;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Growth in Company cash flows through capital recycling, especially the redeployment of capital from mature, slower growing assets into opportunistic acquisitions at attractive rates that offer leasing and redevelopment potential;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Risk mitigation through continuous focus on maintaining prudent leverage levels and lengthy average debt maturities, as well as access to a diverse selection of capital sources, including the secured and unsecured debt markets, a large unsecured line of credit and equity from a wide range of joint venture partners and

• | Sustainability of growth through a constant focus on relationships with investor, tenant, employee, community and environmental constituencies.

Narrative Description of Business
 The Company’s portfolio as of February 15, 2019, consisted of 174 shopping centers (including 104 centers owned through joint ventures) and more than 400 acres of undeveloped land (of which approximately 100 acres are owned through unconsolidated joint ventures).  The shopping centers are located in 26 states.  Over the prior three years, the Company has been a net seller of assets and used the proceeds to deleverage.  From January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2018, the Company sold 155 shopping centers (including 69 properties owned through unconsolidated joint ventures) aggregating 28.0 million square feet of Company-owned GLA for an aggregate sales price of $3.9 billion.  From January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2018, the Company acquired six shopping centers (including three that were acquired from unconsolidated joint ventures) aggregating 1.4 million square feet of Company-owned GLA for an aggregate purchase price of $0.3 billion.  In July 2018, the Company completed the RVI spin-off of 48 shopping centers.
 The following tables present the operating statistics affecting base and percentage rental revenues summarized by the following portfolios: pro rata combined shopping center portfolio, wholly-owned shopping center portfolio and joint venture shopping center portfolio.
