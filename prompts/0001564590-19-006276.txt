Overview 
 We are a commercial stage medical technology company focused on designing, developing and marketing products that improve the quality of life for patients who suffer from psychiatric disorders. Our first commercial product, the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System, is a non-invasive and non-systemic office-based treatment that uses transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS, to create a pulsed, MRI-strength magnetic field that induces electrical currents designed to stimulate specific areas of the brain associated with mood. The system is cleared by the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, to treat adult patients with major depressive disorder, or MDD, that have failed to achieve satisfactory improvement from prior antidepressant medication in the current MDD episode. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy is safe, clinically effective, reproducible and precise and we believe is supported by the largest clinical data set of any competing TMS system. We believe we are the market leader in TMS therapy based on our U.S. installed base of 907 active NeuroStar Advanced Therapy Systems in approximately 707 psychiatrist offices as of December 31, 2018 and the estimated 62,900 patients treated with approximately 2.3 million treatment sessions through such date. We generated revenues of $52.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. 
 MDD is a mood disorder characterized by the presence of one or both of two major diagnostic criteria: a depressed mood or loss of interest in pleasure that continues for at least two weeks. The presence of at least one of these diagnostic symptoms must be accompanied by several of the following additional symptoms: sleep disturbance, changes in appetite, sexual dysfunction, anxiety, fatigue, difficulty concentrating and suicidal thinking. MDD is a recurrent disease and follows a fluctuating course over an individual’s lifetime, with periods of remission and relapse. 
 The World Health Organization, or WHO, ranks MDD as the single largest contributor to global disability and a major contributor to suicide worldwide. According to a study published in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry, the economic burden of the disease was estimated to be $210 billion in 2010 in the United States, including outpatient and inpatient medical costs, pharmacy costs, suicide related costs and workplace costs. A study published in Psychological Medicine reported a global incidence rate of MDD is 3.0% and the WHO estimates that there are over 300 million people in the world living with depression. Based on U.S. Census Bureau data and a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, we estimate that approximately 21 million people in the United States suffer from MDD annually. Of these people, we estimate approximately 13.3 million are adults aged 22 to 70 years, of whom an estimated 7.6 million, based on data from the Journal of the American Medical Association, are being treated by a psychiatrist. We estimate, based on data from the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression, or the STAR*D study, that approximately 5.5 million of these patients have failed to achieve remission of their MDD from their prior antidepressant medication therapy and that approximately 3.8 million of those patients have commercial insurance or Medicare coverage for NeuroStar Advanced Therapy. As a result, based on our expected revenues for a standard course of treatment, we believe our total annual addressable market opportunity for treatment sessions in the United States is approximately $9.6 billion. 
 Initial treatment options for MDD often consist of antidepressant medication prescribed by a primary care physician. Although a variety of antidepressant medications are available, drug therapy has two primary limitations: limited effectiveness and treatment-emergent side effects. These limitations were demonstrated in the STAR*D study, a large clinical trial funded by the U.S. National Institute of Mental Health, or NIMH, that enrolled more than 4,000 adult MDD patients at 41 clinical sites to examine the outcomes to a sequenced series of antidepressant medication attempts that mimicked best practices. In the study, approximately 28% and 21% of patients achieved remission in their first and second medication attempts, respectively. Many patients taking antidepressant medications experience intolerable or troubling side effects that contribute to a delay or failure in attaining an effective or optimal antidepressant dose, poor patient treatment adherence or discontinuation of treatment therapy. The likelihood of achieving remission is limited and declines with each successive medication attempt.

TMS is considered to be an appropriate therapy for the treatment of MDD patients who have failed to achieve satisfactory improvement from prior antidepressant medication. TMS is typically performed as an office-based procedure using a capital equipment system designed to deliver the magnetic pulses necessary to stimulate the specific areas of the brain associated with mood. A course of treatment typically requires treatment sessions five times a week for up to six weeks that can last from as low as three to as long as 45 minutes per session. The effectiveness of TMS depends on the psychiatrist’s ability to deliver a precise amount of magnetic pulses to a specific area of the brain in a manner that can be consistently repeated during each treatment session. While TMS has been demonstrated to be a safe and effective treatment alternative for patients suffering from MDD, we believe that competing TMS systems have experienced limited adoption because of their lack of the following: the ability to reproduce consistent treatments, significant clinical data from randomized outcome trials, practice development resources and a cloud-based practice management system. 
 We designed the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy as a non-invasive therapeutic alternative to treat patients who suffer from MDD and to address many of the key limitations of existing treatment options. We believe our NeuroStar Advanced Therapy provides our psychiatrist customers and their patients with several benefits, including clinically demonstrated response and remission with durable results, a demonstrated safety profile with limited treatment-emergent side effects and high patient adherence. Additionally, NeuroStar Advanced Therapy was designed to provide a precise and reproducible office-based therapy that is also efficient and convenient. Our therapy is delivered without general anesthesia or sedation, enabling the patient to drive and resume normal activities immediately following each treatment session. We couple our product’s clinical benefits with significant practice development resources, on-site clinical training and reimbursement and service support to help our psychiatrist customers develop a successful NeuroStar Advanced Therapy practice. We also provide cloud-based practice management solutions that enhance convenience for both psychiatrists and patients. Based on our commercial data, we believe psychiatrists can recoup their initial capital investment in our system by providing a standard course of treatment to approximately 12 patients, assuming these patients receive reimbursement from Medicare or commercial insurance at rates that are similar to what our customers have observed for existing and prior patients. We believe psychiatrists can generate approximately $7,500 to $10,000 of revenue per patient for a standard course of treatment, which may provide meaningful incremental income to their practices. 
 The safety, effectiveness and durability of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy is supported by a large clinical data set published in 23 articles in peer-reviewed medical journals, including from 11 clinical studies that have collectively enrolled more than 900 adult patients suffering from MDD. In a 307 patient, naturalistic, prospective, observational trial conducted at 42 U.S. clinical sites in patients who had tried and failed to receive relief from one or more medication trials in their current MDD episode, following an acute course of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy, 58% of patients responded, which means they achieved a clinically meaningful reduction in symptoms, and 37% achieved remission. Response and remission were maintained over a 12-month period for a majority of these patients. In the STAR*D study approximately 28% and 21% of patients achieved remission in their first and second medication trials, respectively. 
 Our growth strategy includes expanding our commercialization efforts in the United States, expanding international opportunities and pursuing pipeline development of our therapy for additional indications. Outside the United States, our products have received marketing authorizations in the European Union and Japan. Our initial international commercial focus is Japan, which has the third largest healthcare spend globally. We have entered into an exclusive distribution agreement with Teijin Pharma Limited, or Teijin, a leading Japanese healthcare company, to further expand our commercialization efforts in this market. We are also evaluating the use of enhancements to our NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System to treat additional indications, which may include bipolar depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had an installed base of 907 active NeuroStar Advanced Therapy Systems in the United States. We currently sell our NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System and recurring treatment sessions in the United States through our sales and customer support team, which was comprised of 133 people as of December 31, 2018. Our sales force primarily targets 15,100 psychiatrists at 3,600 high-decile psychiatric practices that we estimate, based on data from Symphony Health and our own internal estimates, treat approximately 33% of the total MDD patients in the United States who meet our labeled indication and are insured. Patients are reimbursed by Medicare and the vast majority of commercial payors in the United States for treatment sessions utilizing our NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System.

We generate revenues from initial capital sales of our systems, sales of our recurring treatment sessions and from service and repair and extended warranty contracts. We derive the majority of our revenues from recurring treatment sessions. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we generated revenues of $52.8 million and had a net loss of $24.1 million. Our revenues increased 31% during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our U.S. revenues were $51.5 million, compared to $39.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which represented an increase of 29% compared to the prior period. Revenues from treatment sessions represented 69% of our U.S. revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 71% of our U.S. revenues for the prior year. 
 Market Opportunity and Major Depressive Disorder 
 Market Opportunity 
 The WHO estimates that there are over 300 million people in the world living with depression and ranks MDD as the single largest contributor to global disability and a major contributor to suicide worldwide. In the United States, the economic burden of the disease was estimated by the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry to be $210 billion in 2010, including outpatient and inpatient medical costs, pharmacy costs, suicide related costs and workplace costs. There were approximately 333 million antidepressant medication prescriptions written in the United States in 2017, representing pharmaceutical sales totaling $5.0 billion, according to IMS Health. Based on U.S. Census Bureau data and a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, we estimate that approximately 21 million people in the United States suffer from MDD annually. Of these people, we estimate approximately 13.3 million are adults aged 22 to 70 years, of whom an estimated 7.6 million, based on data from the Journal of the American Medical Association, are being treated by a psychiatrist. We estimate, based on data from the STAR*D study, that approximately 5.5 million of these patients have failed to achieve remission of their MDD from their prior antidepressant medication therapy and that approximately 3.8 million of those patients have commercial insurance or Medicare coverage for the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy. As a result, based on our expected revenues for a standard course of treatment, we believe our total annual addressable market opportunity for treatment sessions in the United States is approximately $9.6 billion. 
 In Japan, the country with the third highest aggregate healthcare expenditures worldwide according to Deloitte, we estimate, based on data from the National Center for Biotechnology and Information, that approximately 2.4 million adults suffer from MDD and approximately 655,000 of these adults are being treated for their MDD by a psychiatrist. We estimate, based on data from the STAR*D study, that approximately 475,000 of these patients, all of whom are covered by Japan’s single payor healthcare system, have failed to achieve remission of their MDD from prior antidepressant medication therapy and are candidates for treatment with NeuroStar Advanced Therapy. As a result, we believe our total addressable market opportunity for treatment sessions in Japan is over $1.0 billion, assuming psychiatrist reimbursement levels per treatment course per patient are similar to those in the United States. 
 Major Depressive Disorder 
 Disease Overview 
 MDD is a mood disorder characterized by the presence of one or both of two major diagnostic criteria that continues for at least two weeks: a depressed mood or loss of interest in pleasure. The presence of at least one of these diagnostic symptoms must be accompanied by several of the following additional symptoms, for a total of five or more symptoms: sleep disturbance, changes in appetite, sexual dysfunction, anxiety, fatigue, difficulty concentrating and suicidal thinking. In order to be diagnosed with MDD, a patient must display symptoms that are present most of the day, nearly every day, for at least two weeks. A diagnosis of MDD is established by clinical interview and an assessment of whether a patient reports a collection of symptoms defined in the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition, or DSM-5. The severity of a patient’s symptoms is typically measured by a standardized rating scale from a self-reported questionnaire, such as the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, or PHQ-9, or from an observer-dependent interview, such as the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, or HAMD. Based in part on these rating scale measures, MDD can be graded on a continuum from mild to severe. The symptoms of the disease may result in role impairment, which refers to a loss of functioning or enjoyment in work, or impairment of household relationships and/or social roles. MDD is often accompanied by, or comorbid with, other mental disorders, with an estimated three-fourths of patients with recurrent MDD suffering from another psychiatric illness or substance abuse disorder. MDD patients also have an increased risk of death from suicide and other more typical causes, such as heart disease.

MDD is a recurrent disease and follows a fluctuating course over an individual’s lifetime, with periods of remission and relapse. If an initial episode of MDD is resolved, the return of depressive symptoms during the first nine months thereafter is referred to as a relapse of the illness and is generally considered to be part of the same depressive episode. When depressive symptoms return more than 12 months after the initial episode of MDD is resolved, it is considered to be a recurrence of the illness and is deemed a new and distinct episode. A response to treatment is commonly measured as a clinically significant decrease in symptoms on a standardized rating scale from baseline scores. When a patient shows no or nearly no symptoms, the patient is referred to as being in remission. An average episode of MDD lasts approximately four to eight months and approximately three-fourths of all patients who experience an episode of MDD will experience recovery within a year. However, experiencing one episode of MDD places an individual at an estimated 50% risk of experiencing an additional episode of MDD. Approximately 80% of those individuals who have experienced two episodes of MDD will experience an additional episode. 
 Neuroscience of MDD 
 The exact causes of MDD are not known but, as with many psychiatric disorders, a variety of factors may be involved, including the physical and chemical characteristics of the brain, hormonal changes, genetics, acute life events, chronic stress, childhood exposure to adversity and other environmental factors. Researchers have identified a network in the brain that affects a person’s mood, which can play a significant role in MDD and includes the prefrontal cortex, the anterior cingulate cortex and the limbic brain structures. The basic unit of organization in this network of the brain is the neuron, a specialized cell that responds to both chemical and electrical signals. The release of chemical messengers, or neurotransmitters, in the brain occurs across synapses, or the space between neurons. This release of neurotransmitters results in changes in the electrical properties of the receiving neuron, which in turn triggers a cascade of neuron-to-neuron electro-chemical reactions along a pathway of the brain referred to as a neuronal circuit. 
 The following diagram depicts the chemical reactions across the neuronal network: 
 Neurotransmission Mechanism 
 
This communication process across different regions of the brain is ordinarily self-regulated by feedback mechanisms that instruct the originating neuron to stop releasing the neurotransmitter and start reabsorbing it into the cell, a process called reabsorption or reuptake. 
 In people with MDD, however, this complex system of neuronal communication does not function properly. Receptors may be either oversensitive or insensitive to a specific neurotransmitter, causing their response to its release to be excessive or inadequate. The signal might also be weakened if the originating cell produces too little of a neurotransmitter or if an overly efficient reuptake process reabsorbs too much of the neurotransmitter before the molecules have the chance to bind to the receptors on other neurons.

One of the most important discoveries in neuroscience has been the recognition that improper regulation of one or more of the three major neurotransmitters, serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine, plays a key role in a patient’s depression. This understanding has guided psychiatric drug development and the treatment of depression for more than three decades by placing a major focus on targeting chemically-based mechanisms. The relatively recent introduction of TMS as a targeted, circuit-based treatment option has reintroduced the importance of electrical mechanisms in restoring proper function to neuronal pathways to treat depression. 
 Current Treatment Landscape 
 First Line Therapy 
 In the United States, an initial diagnosis of adult MDD is typically made by the patient’s primary care physician. Upon diagnosis, the most common form of treatment is antidepressant medication, which may or may not be accompanied by psychotherapy. The physician typically discusses a number of different treatment options and then designs a treatment plan tailored to the patient’s specific symptoms, personal preferences and the psychiatric services that are available near the patient’s home. 
 The most commonly prescribed antidepressant medications are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs. SSRIs primarily affect the levels and activity of serotonin in the brain and attempt to address depression by blocking the reuptake of this neurotransmitter, thereby making more serotonin available. During the initial treatment course, a patient may experience uncomfortable side effects and it is common for a patient and the primary care physician to spend time testing different medications within the same and different chemical classes before arriving at a medication regimen that provides symptom relief and is tolerable. Different classes of antidepressant medications may also work on different combinations of underlying neurotransmitters. For example, serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, or SNRIs, work by blocking the reuptake of both serotonin and norepinephrine. Other medications may have more diverse effects on all three major neurotransmitters. 
 Depression-focused psychotherapies are a commonly recommended treatment option for MDD and are generally used in conjunction with an antidepressant medication. The two most well studied and commonly available psychotherapy techniques include cognitive behavioral therapy and interpersonal psychotherapy. These are interactive therapies between a trained professional and a patient. 
 Second Line Therapy 
 If initial treatment approaches do not adequately relieve a patient’s symptoms, a primary care physician will often make a referral for consultation with a psychiatrist trained in psychopharmacology. There are a wide array of options that a psychiatrist may consider as second line therapies after an initial treatment has failed. For example, a psychiatrist may recommend either combining two or more antidepressant medications, which is referred to as combination therapy, or using a second medication such as an atypical antipsychotic that is not an antidepressant along with the initial antidepressant medication to augment the efficacy of such antidepressant, which is referred to as augmentation. 
 Another second line therapy is TMS, which is considered to be an appropriate alternative for the treatment of a patient with MDD who has failed to achieve satisfactory improvement from prior antidepressant medication in the current MDD episode. TMS differs from drug therapy approaches by using a pulsed, MRI-strength magnetic field to induce electrical currents designed to stimulate specific areas of the brain associated with mood. The target for brain stimulation is the prefrontal cortex, which serves as a starting point to regulate the neuronal circuitry connected to this region of the brain. This stimulation triggers a cascading electro-chemical effect that can pass along the neuronal circuit and reach into the deeper structures of the brain that also regulate mood. This action changes the connections among these structures in a manner that improves the activity of the neuronal circuit and results in an improvement in mood. TMS is typically performed as an office-based procedure using a piece of capital equipment designed to deliver the magnetic pulses necessary to stimulate the neurons. A course of treatment typically requires treatment sessions five times a week for up to six weeks that can last from 19 to as long as 45 minutes per session. The effectiveness of TMS therapy depends on the psychiatrist’s ability to deliver a precise amount of magnetic pulses to a specific area of the brain in a manner that can be consistently repeated during each treatment session.

Later Stage Treatment Options 
 More aggressive options, which are associated with greater medical risk, are sometimes considered for patients that require later stages of treatment and include electroconvulsive therapy, or ECT, and vagus nerve stimulation, or VNS. ECT is a hospital-based treatment approach that is usually reserved for the most critical MDD patients and is considered most frequently in instances where the patient is experiencing catatonia, acute suicidal behaviors requiring inpatient hospitalization or psychotic symptoms. ECT involves the direct application of high voltage electrical current to the surface of the head and must be administered under anesthesia in a controlled hospital setting. VNS is considered the most invasive treatment option currently approved by the FDA for MDD patients who have proven to be severely treatment resistant. VNS involves the surgical implantation of an electrode wrapped around the vagus nerve, which travels through the neck near the carotid artery, and utilizes a pulse generator that is separately implanted under the skin near the patient’s collarbone. The pulse generator sends electrical impulses to the electrode throughout the day with the goal of modifying the regions of the brain known to be involved in the regulation of mood. 
 A general overview of the treatment sequence for a patient with MDD is shown in the diagram below. 
 
Limitations of Current Therapies 
 Antidepressant medication therapy 
 Although a variety of antidepressant medications are available for the treatment of MDD, antidepressant therapy has two primary limitations: limited efficacy and treatment-emergent side effects that interfere with patient adherence to the prescribed treatment regimen. These limitations were demonstrated in the STAR*D study. This study was sponsored by the NIMH and enrolled more than 4,000 adult patients at 41 clinical sites, including outpatients with nonpsychotic MDD. The trial examined the outcomes to a sequenced series of antidepressant medication treatment options that mimicked best practices. Patients whose depression did not remit after the initial treatment trial of using a single-medication SSRI treatment were able to participate in a sequence of up to three treatment trials. The progression that followed included switching to a different class and more complex combination and augmentation treatments for patients who were unable to achieve remission with each of the trials. Brain stimulation techniques, including ECT and VNS, were not examined in this study.

• | Limited Efficacy. In the STAR*D study, approximately 28% and 21% of patients achieved remission in their first and second medication attempts, respectively. The likelihood of achieving remission from a medication regimen was limited and declined with each successive augmentation attempt. For patients that had three prior treatment attempts, only approximately 7% achieved remission in response to the fourth monotherapy treatment option used in that study. The following figure depicts the percentage of patients who achieved remission at each stage of monotherapy treatment in the STAR*D study based on analysis of HAMD scores: 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Treatment-Emergent Side Effects. The STAR*D study showed that the likelihood of discontinuing treatment due to treatment-emergent side effects increased with each incremental course of medication. According to the study and as shown in the figure below, approximately 41% of patients who progressed to the fourth monotherapy treatment attempt subsequently discontinued drug treatment. Many patients taking antidepressant medications experience intolerable or troubling side effects that contribute to a delay or failure in attaining an effective or optimal antidepressant dose and often result in poor patient treatment adherence or discontinuation of therapy. These side effects include sexual dysfunction, drowsiness, fatigue, weight gain and nausea. The severity of side effects generally increase as a patient proceeds from initial drug treatment to combination or augmented drug treatments. Later stage treatment options, such as first-generation antidepressants and antipsychotics, have potentially more serious side effects and intolerability, with the risk of potential fatal overdose. The discontinuation of treatment can also result in severe side effects, including dizziness, nausea, lethargy, headache, anxiety and agitation that can last for extended periods. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Since the publication of the STAR*D study results, additional drug therapies have been introduced, including most prominently atypical antipsychotics, which are used as augmentation agents for patients with partial or non-response to initial antidepressant medications given alone. Unfortunately, these augmentation treatments have not significantly improved overall MDD patient response rates and have also introduced additional side effects.

Depression-Focused Psychotherapies 
 Antidepressant medication therapy for MDD is often administered along with a recommendation for a depression-focused psychotherapy. While these treatment options have demonstrated efficacy in some clinical studies, they also are associated with limitations in practice. For instance, the experience level of the therapist may significantly affect the treatment outcome. Additionally, in order to access these treatments, patients usually require a referral to a psychotherapist who may be located at a different clinical site than their treating psychiatrist. Psychotherapy requires a commitment by a patient to numerous treatment sessions in order to potentially achieve significant improvement, with a typical treatment regimen consisting of 16 sessions. 
 Later Stage Treatment Options 
 Both ECT and VNS have significant drawbacks. ECT requires general anesthesia and is administered in a controlled hospital setting with access to emergency resuscitation equipment. ECT is typically administered three times per week for up to 12 treatments, with some patients requiring as many as 20 treatments. ECT patients may experience confusion and memory loss, the two most common side effects of ECT treatments, immediately following a treatment session. Other side effects may include nausea, headache, jaw pain, muscle ache, hypertension and hypotension and life threatening complications including adverse reactions to anesthesia, arrhythmias, ischemia or prolonged seizures. Because of the potentially disabling side effects of ECT, the patient is typically unable to work for the duration of the course of treatment. VNS is considered the most invasive treatment option currently approved by the FDA for MDD patients who have proven to be severely treatment resistant. VNS includes surgical related risks, such as infection or local damage to the recurrent laryngeal nerve, which may lead to permanent voice alteration. Other drawbacks of VNS include the development of cardiac arrhythmias and the periodic repeat surgeries required to replace the pulse generator battery. Finally, reimbursement for the implantation and ongoing monitoring of the VNS device remains problematic, limiting access to the procedure for most patients. 
Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation 
 While TMS has been demonstrated to be a safe and effective treatment alternative for patients suffering from MDD, we believe that most TMS systems have experienced limited adoption for several reasons, including: 

• | Challenges in delivering precise and reproducible treatments. We believe the design and technology of most TMS systems makes it difficult for psychiatrists to reliably administer precise and reproducible treatments during each treatment session. Notably, most TMS systems do not provide the psychiatrist with the ability to stabilize the patient’s head during treatment. If a slight separation of the TMS treatment coil from the patient’s head occurs, it may reduce the magnetic field in the patient’s brain, resulting in the delivery of a lower dose than what was prescribed. Most TMS systems are unable to track the number of pulses not delivered as a result of this separation and therefore may not administer the prescribed dose. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Lack of clinical data from randomized outcome and other trials. Most TMS providers have not conducted, and their systems have not been the subject of, significant clinical trials or naturalistic studies to demonstrate their effectiveness. As a result, when selling their products most TMS providers must rely on smaller or more general studies or clinical trials that were conducted using other TMS systems or the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System, which may present a barrier to adoption by psychiatrists and patients. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Lack of cloud-based practice management system. Many psychiatrists and psychiatrist practice groups operate in multiple locations and may use multiple TMS devices. Most TMS systems, however, only allow for the storage of patient data and treatment information on a local computer. Unless connected through an inter or intra-office network, psychiatrists may not be able to access patient treatment data and information regarding the use of the TMS system. Moreover, this can create logistical challenges when psychiatrists seek to treat the patient at multiple locations or on multiple systems at the same location. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Lack of comfort and convenience. Most TMS systems are adaptations of research devices that have been repurposed. As a result, they frequently lack the ergonomic and other human factors that provide comfort and convenience and that are important for improving the patient experience and acceptance of the treatment. Other TMS systems may also require treatment to be administered for up to 45 minutes per treatment session. Some TMS systems require patients to wear a cap that fits firmly around the head and/or utilizes a chin strap that is attached from one ear to the other, which patients may consider uncomfortable. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Lack of customer support and practice development resources. Many psychiatrists are not accustomed to implementing a piece of capital equipment into their practice. As a result, we believe they need multi-day, on-site training for themselves and their staff, marketing and reimbursement support, and help determining the allocation of office space and proper roles of staff for the use of TMS systems. We believe that most TMS providers do not provide comprehensive clinical support and practice development resources that are necessary to operationalize a TMS service line into their practice.

Our Solution 
 We designed the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy as a non-invasive and non-systemic therapeutic alternative for patients who suffer from MDD. We believe our solution addresses the key limitations of existing MDD treatment options and that NeuroStar Advanced Therapy provides the following principal benefits to our psychiatrist customers and their patients: 

• | Clinically demonstrated safety, efficacy, response and remission with durable results. The safety and efficacy of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy has been demonstrated in two large prospective, multisite, randomized, sham-controlled trials. In addition, the efficacy of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy has been demonstrated in a multisite, real world, open-label, clinical trial in which patients who failed to achieve satisfactory improvement from antidepressant medication treatment in their current episode of MDD received an acute treatment course of TMS therapy. Overall, the results of this trial demonstrated that 58% of patients responded to treatment, and 37% achieved remission. In this trial, similar response and remission rates were observed across patients with a wide range of prior drug treatment attempts. The majority of patients in this trial also participated in a 12-month follow-up phase at the conclusion of which the clinician-assessed response rate in these patients was 68% and remission rate was 45%. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Demonstrated safety profile with limited treatment-emergent side effects and high patient adherence. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy has a demonstrated safety profile without the systemic side effects typically experienced with antidepressant medications. The adverse events discontinuation rate in our sham-controlled clinical studies has been approximately 5%. For single medication treatment in the STAR*D Study, the adverse events discontinuation rate was 9% to 41%. The most common side effect associated with NeuroStar Advanced Therapy is transient, localized pain or discomfort at or near the treatment location. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Precise and reproducible office-based therapy. Patients receive NeuroStar Advanced Therapy for five days a week for up to six weeks in a psychiatrist’s office without the need for general anesthesia or sedation. The NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System’s proprietary components and software are designed to deliver the recommended TMS treatment dose to the indicated location on the patient’s prefrontal cortex consistently. The treatment location is determined with a three-dimensional, laser-guided, six-point coordinate system. The SenStar Connect is a proprietary component of the device designed to ensure our NeuroStar Treatment Coil is functioning properly and positioned against a patient’s head. SenStar Connect provides continuous real-time feedback to the clinician throughout the course of treatment and it tracks lost pulses during each treatment session and provides the clinician with the opportunity to readminister any lost pulses at the end of the treatment, all of which helps to ensure that a patient receives the prescribed dose of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Efficient and convenient treatment for the patient and the psychiatrist. We have developed and deployed a treatment for MDD using TMS approved by the FDA, with each treatment cleared to be performed in as little as 19 minutes (but may take up to 39 minutes due to patient sensitivity or at the discretion of the treating psychiatrist). Our therapy is delivered while a patient is awake and alert, enabling the patient to drive a vehicle and resume normal activities immediately following each treatment session. The NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System was designed for patient and psychiatrist convenience by establishing a proprietary software system, which we refer to as MT Assist, that allows the psychiatrist to determine the proper dose and motor threshold unique to each patient. After the initial treatment session, the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System records the treatment coordinates so they do not need to be re-identified in future treatments. Once a psychiatrist has established the patient’s coordinates during the initial treatment session, a trained member of the office staff under the supervision of the psychiatrist may administer subsequent treatment sessions.

• | Unique cloud-based practice management system. Our TrakStar practice management system captures all treatment relevant information, and the encrypted information can be downloaded to any NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System in a psychiatrist’s network in order to make it convenient for a patient to receive care and increase scheduling flexibility. Patients do not need to be treated by the same NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System for each treatment session, and therefore psychiatrists who own multiple systems do not need to schedule patients to specific devices. A treating psychiatrist can download a patient’s encrypted information from TrakStar and analyze it real-time from their laptop, mobile phone or tablet. TrakStar also manages the inventory of purchased treatment sessions, which can be replenished by an office administrator online at any time. The most recent version of TrakStar software that we released enables remote software updates, diagnostics and troubleshooting and performance monitoring to maintain industry-leading up time. TrakStar also captures and records daily system utilization, office productivity and patient outcomes.

Our Strengths 
 We are focused on improving the quality of life for patients who suffer from psychiatric disorders, including MDD. Our executive team on average has 20 years of experience in healthcare, developing and commercializing innovative medical technology products. We believe that our focus and experience in treating patients with MDD, combined with the following strengths, will allow us to build our business and potentially expand our market opportunity: 

• | A market leader in TMS therapy. We believe we are the market leader in TMS therapy based on our U.S. installed base of 907 active NeuroStar Advanced Therapy Systems in approximately 707 psychiatrist offices as of December 31, 2018 and the estimated 62,900 patients treated with over 2.3 million treatment sessions through such date. We generated revenues of $52.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. We believe this commercial scale, combined with our investments in comprehensive practice support services and an experienced direct sales and customer support team provides us meaningful competitive advantages by creating significant barriers to entry to other TMS providers.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Significant body of clinical data and key opinion leader support. The safety, efficacy and durability of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy is supported by what we believe is the largest clinical data set of any TMS system. Our therapy has been the subject of 11 clinical studies that have collectively enrolled more than 900 patients suffering from MDD. The results of these studies have been published in 23 articles in peer reviewed medical journals. We have also established strong relationships with key opinion leaders within the psychiatric community, who help us to educate psychiatrists from around the world on innovative treatment modalities such as TMS therapy. These key opinion leaders also help inform our clinical development programs.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Proprietary technology with a broad IP portfolio. Our NeuroStar Advanced Therapy incorporates several key proprietary technologies that are designed to ensure the precise delivery and repeatability of our therapy in the clinical setting. As of December 31, 2018, we owned or licensed 34 issued or allowed U.S. patents, 49 issued or allowed foreign patents, eight pending U.S. patent applications, 11 pending foreign patent applications and one pending Patent Cooperation Treaty application. We believe this patent portfolio is substantially larger than that of any competing TMS companies. This portfolio covers key aspects of our technology, including contact sensing, MT Assist and our iron core magnet that allows high patient throughput.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Extensive reimbursement coverage and experience. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy is a well-established treatment option for patients with MDD and is reimbursed by many commercial payors and Medicare contractors in the United States. We estimate that, over 65 major private insurers in the United States, including the top 25 largest private insurers, have adopted coverage policies for reimbursement of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy, representing approximately 205 million covered lives or about 95% of the total private payor covered lives in the United States. TMS treatment sessions using NeuroStar Advanced Therapy are also eligible for reimbursement for all Medicare regions, representing an additional 59 million covered lives in the United States in as of December 2018. In addition, our reimbursement team has significant experience working with our psychiatrist customers to help them navigate the reimbursement process. Our reimbursement team has assisted our customers to conduct more than 31,000 benefits investigations. We are also in the process of obtaining reimbursement coverage for NeuroStar Advanced Therapy in Japan, which we expect to receive in the second half of 2019. In April 2018 we received approval to submit reimbursement dossiers with the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, or JMHLW.

• | Potential to enhance psychiatrist practice economics. Based on our commercial data, we believe our psychiatrist customers can generate between approximately $7,500 to $10,000 of revenues per patient for a standard course of treatment using the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System, and can recoup their capital investment in our system by treating approximately 12 patients, assuming these patients receive reimbursement from Medicare or commercial insurance at levels that are similar to what our customers have observed for existing and prior patients. We believe that subsequent treatments using our system may significantly increase practice economics for our psychiatrist customers.

Our Strategy 
 Our goal is to maintain and extend our leadership position in TMS therapy for patients with psychiatric disorders. The key elements of our strategy include: 
  
• | Improve customer targeting and expand our direct sales and customer support team to accelerate growth. To capture new psychiatrist customers, we plan to expand our specialized, direct sales organization that targets MDD treating psychiatric practices that accept reimbursement from private insurance and Medicare. Symphony Health estimates that there are approximately 26,300 group and solo practice sites in the United States with psychiatrists that prescribe antidepressant medications. Our direct sales force primarily targets 15,100 psychiatrists at 3,600 high-decile psychiatric practices that we estimate, based on data from Symphony Health and our own internal estimates, treat approximately 2.5 million patients, representing 33% of the total MDD patients in the United States who meet our labeled indication and are insured. We estimate that approximately 1.2 million of these patients have failed prior antidepressant medication attempts in the current MDD episode and are covered by insurance that will provide reimbursement based on this medical status, resulting in a targeted total addressable market of approximately $3.0 billion. After nearly doubling the number of our business development managers in the last twelve months, we intend to continue to expand our team of 46 business development managers and 7 inside sales representatives that are responsible for driving new customer acquisitions. To reach our target practices, we also plan to expand our advertising efforts, both online and through more traditional approaches, such as targeting leading psychiatric journals, practice outreach and education through monthly webcasts, attendance at key psychiatric trade shows and sponsoring clinical symposiums and product theaters. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Increase utilization of our new and existing installed base of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy Systems. We plan to expand our sales and customer support team to increase the number of patients treated by our existing installed base of 907 active NeuroStar Advanced Therapy Systems in the United States and any additional systems that we sell in the future. We intend to hire additional clinical training consultants to our existing team of eight who will focus on the ongoing training of our psychiatrist customers and their staff in order to allow our existing team of 30 clinical practice consultants to focus exclusively on helping increase patient utilization of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy in a practice. Our clinical practice consultants focus their efforts on helping psychiatrist customers implement our six step Practice Success Program. We intend to make further investments in marketing tools, such as our marketing portal, which consists of customizable practice development and advertisement materials all of which are designed to drive patient awareness within an existing practice and in the local community. We recently concluded a three-week national television advertising campaign designed to increase patient awareness of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy. We also plan to invest further in our direct to consumer marketing programs, primarily through digital marketing, which is comprised of paid search, display advertising, social media and public relations to our psychiatrist customers. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand our international market opportunities. We primarily sell our products within the United States and also sell our products through distributors in countries where we have received regulatory approval, including Japan, Saudi Arabia, The United Arab Emirates, Singapore, and the Republic of Korea. We plan to primarily focus our commercial efforts outside of the United States on Japan. We plan to work with Teijin to obtain reimbursement approval for the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System in the second half of 2019 and to provide sales, marketing and clinical support to ensure our commercial success. We will continue to opportunistically evaluate additional markets outside the United States and Japan for commercial expansion. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pursue enhancements of our NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System and pipeline development for additional indications. We plan to continue our research and development efforts to enhance the hardware and software components of our NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System for the treatment of MDD and other psychiatric disorders. We also plan to evaluate the use of enhancements to our NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System to treat other psychiatric disorders, which may include bipolar depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD.

The NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System 
 Product 
 Our NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System is comprised of the NeuroStar Mobile Console, Patient Positioning System, NeuroStar Treatment Coil and TrakStar practice management system. NeuroStar Treatment Sessions and SenStar Treatment Links, which we refer to as treatment sessions, represent the consumable portion of the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy Treatment System. 
NeuroStar Mobile Console and Patient Positioning System 
 Our NeuroStar Mobile Console and Patient Positioning System are comprised of the following components: 
 
 
1. LCD touch screen and graphical user interface. Our LCD touch screen and graphical user interface provide the operator clear visual directions for sequencing the TMS treatment. User confirmation is required on critical steps to ensure accuracy. 2. Patient Positioning System. The patented patient positioning system includes an electromechanically controlled chair to recline the patient during treatment and a three-dimensional positioning device that uses laser alignment and six calibrated coordinates to accurately position the patient’s head during treatment. 3. Gantry Arm. The gantry arm mechanically counterbalances the NeuroStar Treatment Coil and allows the operator to consistently move and place it into position. Once in position, electromechanical brakes stabilize the NeuroStar Treatment Coil and gantry arm. 4. Mobile Console. The mobile console houses the embedded computer and power electronics responsible for generating the prescribed pulse sequence. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NeuroStar Treatment Coil 
 
 
Our proprietary NeuroStar Treatment Coil produces the magnetic field that induces the electric current at the prescribed treatment site. The iron core in our NeuroStar Treatment Coil provides efficient energy conversion and management of the magnetic field. This allows our NeuroStar Treatment Coil to function at higher operating power and lower temperatures. Our NeuroStar Treatment Coil assembly includes a small fan and sensor to assist in cooling, and temperature tracking, and ensure patient comfort and safety. This temperature management feature allows for short intervals between treatment sessions. The coil face is set at a 140-degree angle to conform with the patient’s head to ensure contact across the magnet face.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 SenStar 
 SenStar is a thin, flexible electronic circuit, as shown in the figure below, that functions in both the treatment delivery and procedure fee management for our NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System. Embedded in each SenStar is a magnetic field detector. At the start of each treatment, the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System performs a self-test that includes verifying the magnetic field is operating within the specified limits. Each SenStar also includes a sensory guard to reduce topical irritation and improve patient comfort at the skin-coil interface. 
 14


SenStars also contain a patented contact sensor that allows the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System to monitor and provide real-time visual feedback to the operator that the NeuroStar Treatment Coil is in proper contact with the patient’s head. The system tracks any pulses lost during treatment and will highlight lost pulses on the graphical user interface. At the end of treatment, the system allows the operator to administer any missed pulses to complete the full prescribed dose. 
 
We sell two versions of the SenStar: the SenStar Treatment Link and the SenStar Connect. SenStar Connect is a multi-use device for the U.S. market. To activate a treatment session, a provider needs to purchase an encrypted activation code to enable the SenStar Connect to deliver one treatment session. NeuroStar Treatment Sessions are purchasable online 24 hours a day, any day of the year. The treatment inventory is electronically managed between the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System and TrakStar systems using digital encryption technology. SenStar Treatment Link is a single use consumable. SenStar treatment links are used outside the United States and enable one treatment session. Each is programmed for the country of use. 
 TrakStar Practice Management System 
 The TrakStar patient data management system component is a cloud or local application that interfaces with the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy Systems. TrakStar maintains patient information, prescription, treatment and medication history, positioning coordinates, depression scores and psychiatrist notes. 
 TrakStar automatically synchronizes patient data on all NeuroStar Advanced Therapy Systems on the network. Thus the information to treat a patient is available on every system in every office within a practice. After each treatment is completed, the data is automatically uploaded to TrakStar. This seamless data integration simplifies record management and office workflow. TrakStar supports multiple reports including patient treatment history, patient depression score trending, practice outcomes and system utilization. 
 TrakStar cloud allows the psychiatrist to see status of other NeuroStar Advanced Therapy Systems in real-time, and access patient data anywhere and anytime using an internet browser. TrakStar cloud is hosted in Microsoft Azure and employs multiple levels of security. Patient data is encrypted both in transit and at rest. Third-party experts successfully completed penetration testing and an overall business security assessment and certified us as compliant with National Institute of Standards and Technology, or NIST, and Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health, or HITECH, standards. We also monitor traffic for cybersecurity threats on an ongoing basis.

The NeuroStar Advanced Therapy Process 
 The Treatment Procedure 
 NeuroStar Advanced Therapy is an in-office treatment that has been cleared to be performed in as little as 19 minutes per session (but may take up to 39 minutes due to patient sensitivity or at the discretion of the treating psychiatrist) and is performed while the patient is awake, alert and seated and reclined comfortably in the treatment chair. A course of treatment consists of sessions administered five days a week for up to six weeks. During the first treatment session, two essential steps are performed. First, the patient’s cortex is mapped with the NeuroStar Treatment Coil to identify the area of the brain controlling the thumb. Once the specific location on the motor cortex is found, the second step involves the use of a proprietary software algorithm, which assists the psychiatrist in estimating the physiologically appropriate magnetic field intensity for each treatment session based on the intensity needed to stimulate movement in the thumb. After these two steps are performed, the location of the motor cortex then also serves as a reference point to enable the psychiatrist to properly position the NeuroStar Treatment Coil over the left prefrontal cortical surface, resting the coil lightly in contact with the patient’s scalp. Accuracy of positioning of the treatment coil for pulse delivery is assured by use of the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System’s three-dimensional positioning device. Once the coil is properly positioned, the device delivers NeuroStar Advanced Therapy using a highly targeted pulsed magnetic field to stimulate cortical neurons. Our therapy provides targeted stimulation of the prefrontal cortex and engages the neuronal circuitry connected to this region and known to be involved in the regulation of mood. 
 During treatment, accurate positioning of our NeuroStar Treatment Coil is maintained by use of a proprietary contact sensing and navigation system, which helps to ensure precise targeting of the treatment and assurance of accurate therapeutic dosing for each session. The patient typically hears a clicking sound during coil operation and feels a tapping sensation on the head for the duration of the session. Over the course of each treatment, the patient receives 3,000 pulses. Real-time feedback ensures the patient receives a full dose with safe and effective care. When the session is completed, the psychiatrist removes the coil and the patient is able to immediately resume normal activities. 
 16


The Patient Experience 
 Our clinical studies indicate that most patients find the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy easy to tolerate when contrasted with alternative MDD treatments. After completion of a treatment session, a patient may immediately resume his or her normal activities, including work and exercise. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy patients generally do not experience the systemic side effects associated with drug therapy. The most typical side effect after treatment with NeuroStar Advanced Therapy, as shown in the figure below, is pain or discomfort near the treatment area, which is generally temporary and typically self-resolves within one week. In our sham-controlled clinical trials, approximately 5% of patients discontinued treatment due to adverse events. 
Potential Indications for Use and Research and Development 
 We selectively invest in research and development for the use of the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System in psychiatric disorders. Throughout our history, we have provided material support to 50 investigator-initiated trials of such prospective additional indications. We are currently considering a number of potential future indications for the use of the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System, including, but not limited to, those described below. 
 17


Bipolar Depression 
 Bipolar depression is a psychiatric disorder characterized by a recurrent episodes of mania and depression. The depressed phase of bipolar disorder is considered to be a form of treatment resistant depression and is the most difficult to treat phase of bipolar disorder. The depressive episode diagnostic criteria in bipolar depression are identical to our current MDD indication. Although bipolar depression represents a smaller market than MDD, this disease state has few treatment options available and many patients experience suboptimal outcomes. Current treatment options for patients with bipolar depression include the use of mood stabilizers, including lithium carbonate, anticonvulsant, and second-generation antipsychotics. While these treatments are effective in managing the recurrent mania, there are few effective treatments for the depressed phase of the illness. For example, antidepressant medications may lead to instability in resolution of the manic episodes if administered alone, and the use of second-generation antipsychotic medications can be associated with undesirable long-term medical side effects, including weight gain or the development of metabolic syndrome. Based on early research, we are evaluating whether treatment with our NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System could be beneficial to these patients. If we were to pursue an additional indication in bipolar depression, we would need to conduct additional clinical trials, file an investigational device exemption and clinical trial protocols with the FDA, submit a 510(k) pre-market notification and receive clearance prior to commercialization. 
Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder 
 Post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, is a psychiatric disorder that develops in some people who have experienced an overwhelming traumatic event, such as witnessing death in a military or civilian setting, or as a result of severe physical abuse such as assault or rape. This exposure to a traumatic stressor can lead to a later unwanted re-experiencing of symptoms, avoidance behavior, alteration in cognition and mood and states of increased physiological arousal. Treatment options for PTSD include psychotherapy and SSRI antidepressant medications. We believe NeuroStar Advanced Therapy may represent a potential new treatment option for PTSD patients. If we were to pursue an additional indication in PTSD, we would need to conduct additional clinical trials, file an investigational device exemption and clinical trial protocols with the FDA, submit a 510(k) pre-market notification and receive clearance prior to commercialization. 
 Adolescent MDD 
 We completed patient enrollment with 112 adolescent MDD patients in a prospective, 13-center, randomized, sham-controlled, double-blind pivotal clinical trial with three phases that mirrors the design of our original adult, randomized, controlled trial. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the acute and long-term safety and efficacy of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy in treating adolescents with MDD. The trial utilizes a double-blind control design to minimize variability and allow for blinded assessment of the safety and efficacy of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy, using an active NeuroStar Treatment Coil compared to a system utilizing a sham NeuroStar Treatment Coil. Patients were randomly allocated in a one-to-one ratio to either active NeuroStar Treatment Coil or sham NeuroStar Treatment Coil. At the time of enrollment, patients were antidepressant-free for at least one week and up to four weeks, depending on medication washout period. 
 The first phase is designed to evaluate the antidepressant effects of active NeuroStar Advanced Therapy compared with sham treatment when administered five times per week for a six week acute course of therapy. The primary endpoint of this phase is the difference between active and sham arms using the 24-Item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, or HAMD24, total score change from baseline score over the six week acute phase. Safety will be assessed at every treatment visit by recording adverse events. We are currently completing the analysis of all phases of the study, including the randomized controlled trial, open label extension and six-month follow-up study. Based on a preliminary analysis conducted in the second quarter of 2018, the primary endpoint in the first phase of the trial was not met. Although we cannot directly attribute clinical trial outcomes from other studies to our own clinical trials, we believe several clinical trials for antidepressant medications failed to meet the primary efficacy endpoint in their studies for MDD in adolescents and children. These include duloxetine, venlafaxine and, most recently, desvenlafaxine. To date, the data safety monitoring board has not identified any serious safety issues in the study population, including suicidality and seizure. 
 18


Consistent with our clinical trial protocols, patients who have completed the first phase were eligible to participate in the second phase of our clinical trial, which is a separate, open-label extension study. The second phase trial is designed to evaluate the benefit of active treatment administered five times per week for a six-week acute course of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy in patients who received active or sham treatment and did not receive protocol-defined clinical benefit in the first phase. Patients remain antidepressant medication free during the second phase. This trial will provide descriptive data on patients who are switched from sham to active treatments or receive a longer course of active treatment up to 12 weeks. 
 Patients who met the criteria for at least partial response in either the first or second phases of the trial were eligible to be followed in a third phase that will be a separate six-month follow up phase. Patients entering the third phase first undergo a three-week transition during which they will be gradually tapered off NeuroStar Advanced Therapy. Patients who experience symptom worsening during this phase of the study may receive reintroduction of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy. Patients remain antidepressant medication free during the third phase of the trial. The purpose of this phase is to provide descriptive data on the six-month follow-up period and any retreatments received by patients. 
 Although we believe we are unlikely to seek a label expansion for the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System for the treatment of adolescent MDD, we plan to evaluate next steps with respect to our clinical development efforts for this indication following the completion of the data analysis. We do not expect that the results from the clinical trial will be sufficient to obtain approval of our system for this indication. Nevertheless, we do not believe these clinical trial results or the failure to obtain approval of our NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System for the treatment of adolescents with MDD will have a material impact on our current or future business. 
 Research and Development and Clinical Operations 
 Continued innovation through research and development is critical to our future success as a leader in improving the quality of life for patients who suffer from psychiatric disorders. Our research and development activity is performed with a mix of internal and third party contract resources. As of December 31, 2018, our research and development and clinical operations team consisted of 33 employees with expertise in electronic, mechanical or electrical design, software, biomedical engineering, neuroscience and clinical trial design and management. Our research and development expenses, including spending on our clinical trials and development efforts, totaled $8.2 million and $7.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our current research and development efforts are focused primarily on platform extensions for our NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System and a series of enhancements to our TrakStar cloud-based software application. Our clinical development efforts are focused on further expanding the use of our products in additional indications. We coordinate our development efforts with our intellectual property strategies in order to enhance our ability to obtain patent and other intellectual property protection. 
Clinical Results and Studies 
 Overview of Clinical Trial Evidence for the Safety and Efficacy of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy 
 Clinical evidence supporting the safety and efficacy of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy has been published in 23 peer reviewed medical journals, involving an aggregate of over 900 adult patients and more than 60 investigators. We have sponsored the largest prospective, multisite, randomized, sham-controlled trial ever conducted of a TMS device, enrolling 325 patients with treatment resistant MDD at 23 U.S. and international study sites. Results from this trial served as the basis of our initial FDA 510(k) clearance of the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System in 2008. The clinical data from this trial were reported in Biological Psychiatry in 2007. A second, industry-independent prospective, multisite, randomized, sham-controlled trial, funded by the NIMH using the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System, enrolled 199 patients with treatment resistant MDD across four major academic medical centers in the United States. The clinical data from this trial were submitted to the FDA in 2014, leading to an expanded labeling for our NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System for an indication of use in adult patients who have failed to benefit from one or more prior antidepressant medications in the current episode of MDD. This data was published in 2010 in Archives of General Psychiatry, now published as JAMA Psychiatry. We sponsored the largest, post-market naturalistic outcomes study of the use of the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System in routine clinical practice. This study enrolled 307 patients with treatment resistant MDD seeking care at 42 U.S. study sites. Patients 
 19


in this study were assessed at the beginning and end of their prescribed acute treatment course, and 257 of these patients agreed to be followed for a period of 12 months to characterize the durability of the long-term outcome in clinical practice. Results of this study were published in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry in 2012 and in CNS Spectrums in 2014. 
 Efficacy endpoints reported in these clinical trials used validated and well-accepted measures of symptomatic benefit to characterize antidepressant medication treatment in clinical trials and included those measures listed in Figure 1. An accepted goal of treatment with an antidepressant is the definitive resolution of the symptoms, which is defined as remission. Remission is defined using a validated, clinician-administered rating scale such as the 17 or 24-item versions of HAMD or the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, or MADRS. Patients who achieve an endpoint score below 8 points on the 17-item HAMD, below 11 points on the 24-item HAMD or below 10 points on the MADRS, are considered to have reached remission of illness. A clinically global, psychiatrist rated scale, such as the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness, or CGI-S, scale can also grade remission if a patient reaches an end of treatment score of one or two on that scale. 
 
 
Depression Assessment Scale | Response Criteria | Remission Criteria
----------------------------+--------------------------+-------------------
MADRS | 50% change from baseline | <10 
HAMD17 | 50% change from baseline | <8 
HAMD24 | 50% change from baseline | <11 
CGI-S | ≤3 score | ≤2 score 
PHQ-9 | <10 | <5 

 Figure 1. Validated measures of symptomatic benefit to characterize antidepressant treatment effect. 
 Patient-rated outcomes are also used to verify symptom improvement. In the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy clinical trial data, the PHQ-9 scale was used, with a score below five indicating remission of illness. Significant clinical improvement that does not constitute remission is termed response, and is graded by a 50% or greater reduction of score from baseline on the HAMD and MADRS scales, and a score of one, two or three on the CGI-S or a score below 10 on the PHQ-9. Outcomes are also reported for each of these rating scales as a mean change in total score from baseline, called continuous outcome measures. Standardized effect size measures are used to assess the statistical magnitude of treatment benefit (active versus control) in a clinical trial, and because they are normalized measures, allow the comparison of treatment benefit across different clinical studies. Standardized effect sizes of greater than 0.50 are considered large, between 0.30 and 0.50 are considered medium and below 0.30 are considered small. 
Randomized Controlled Trial 
 Our U.S. registration trial was a prospective, multisite, randomized, sham-controlled trial at 23 U.S. and international study sites that enrolled 325 patients from January 2004 through August 2005 to evaluate the safety and efficacy of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy in patients who met DSM-IV criteria for MDD, with a moderate level of treatment resistance based on rigorous evidence of failure of benefit from prior treatment with a research-grade exposure to at least one and up to four complete antidepressant medication trials. Patients were randomized to either active NeuroStar Advanced Therapy or sham-controlled TMS. The primary efficacy endpoint of this trial was a statistically significant, or P<0.05, average baseline to endpoint change in MADRS score for patients in the active NeuroStar Advanced Therapy treatment group when compared to the change in MADRS score for the sham-controlled TMS patient treatment group using the last visit MADRS score through week four of the acute phase. The trial design consisted of three phases: a one week, no-treatment lead-in phase; a six week acute treatment phase of daily TMS sessions scheduled in a 5-day sequence, for a maximum of 30 sessions during which NeuroStar Advanced Therapy was given in the active treatment arm as a monotherapy in medication-free patients, and a three week taper phase during which time all patients were begun on an open-label, single antidepressant medication and followed for six months to examine the durability of the acute effect of TMS. 
 20


Results for the overall trial population demonstrated clinically meaningful improvement on the primary efficacy outcome measure, baseline to endpoint change on the MADRS at four weeks, as shown in Figure 2 (MADRS, P=0.057, standardized effect size = 0.38), although the primary efficacy endpoint of the trial was not achieved. Additionally, several secondary outcome measures demonstrated statistically and clinically significant benefit for active NeuroStar Advanced Therapy compared with sham-controlled TMS. Among these secondary outcome measures were a superior outcome on the HAMD, with both the 17 and 24-item versions showing baseline to endpoint change for active NeuroStar Advanced Therapy at four weeks, as shown in Figure 3 (17-Item change: P=0.006, standardized effect size = 0.55) and as shown in Figure 4 (24-Item change: P=0.012, standardized effect size = 0.48). These outcomes were sustained at the secondary efficacy time point at week six, with a significant advantage in favor of active NeuroStar Advanced Therapy.

 We also observed a statistically significant benefit in categorical outcomes of response and remission rates on the MADRS, as shown in Figure 5, the HAMD17, as shown in Figure 6, and the HAMD24, as shown in Figure 7. In this trial, NeuroStar Advanced Therapy was well tolerated and safe. The dropout rate for any reason was low and similar in the active therapy (7.7%) and sham-controlled TMS (8.2%) treatment groups at four weeks, and discontinuation specifically because of side effects was similar in the active therapy (4.5%) and sham-controlled TMS (3.4%) treatment groups. The trial demonstrated that NeuroStar Advanced Therapy administered over a period of six weeks was effective in treating MDD and with a favorable tolerability profile.

 Our NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System received marketing authorization from the FDA in 2008 based on the results of this initial registration trial. The FDA review determined that statistical significance for the primary outcome measure was obtained for the patients in that portion of the study population (N=164) who had failed to benefit from one prior research grade antidepressant medication treatment trial (MADRS, P=0.0006). The original FDA-authorized indication for use in MDD based on this trial was for adult patients who failed to benefit from one prior antidepressant medication in the current episode. 
 NIMH-Sponsored Randomized Controlled Trial—the Optimization of TMS, or OPT-TMS Study 
 The U.S. NIMH sponsored a prospective, multisite, randomized, sham-controlled trial at four U.S. study sites that enrolled 199 patients from October 2004 through March 2009 to evaluate the safety and efficacy of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy in patients who met DSM-IV criteria for MDD, with at least a moderate level of treatment resistance to at least one and up to four complete antidepressant medication trials. Patients were randomly allocated 1:1 to either active NeuroStar Advanced Therapy or sham-controlled TMS. The primary efficacy endpoint of this trial was remission, measured using the 24-item HAMD scale. The trial design consisted of three phases: a two week no treatment lead-in phase, a three-week fixed-treatment phase of daily TMS sessions scheduled in a 5-day sequence, for a maximum of 15 sessions during which NeuroStar Advanced Therapy was given in the active treatment arm as a monotherapy in antidepressant medication-free patients and a variable, three-week treatment continuation for clinical improvers. 
 Results from the trial demonstrated that for the entire treatment resistant patient population, for the primary analysis of remission, there was a statistically significant effect of daily NeuroStar Advanced Therapy as monotherapy (odds ratio, 4.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.32–13.24; P=0.02). There were 18 remitters (N=13 or 14.1% in the active therapy and N=5 or 5.1% in the sham-controlled TMS treatment groups). NeuroStar Advanced Therapy was well tolerated, with no difference in adverse events between the active therapy and sham-controlled TMS treatment groups. Discontinuation specifically because of side effects was 5.4% in the active therapy treatment group. These results indicate that the likelihood of achieving remission using the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System increased by more than four times when compared to sham-control TMS, which is clinically meaningful. 
 The results of this clinical trial became available after we received our original marketing authorization in 2008. We submitted the clinical data from this trial to the FDA and received a new FDA 510(k) clearance in 2014 that expanded our original indication to adult patients who have failed to benefit from one or more prior antidepressant medications in the current episode of MDD.

Acute Efficacy and Long-Term Durability in Real-World Clinical Settings Study 
 The acute efficacy of treatment with the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System was evaluated in a prospective, multisite, naturalistic, observational trial at 42 U.S. study sites that enrolled 307 patients from 2010 through 2012 to evaluate the effectiveness of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy in real-world clinical practice settings in patients who met DSM-IV criteria for MDD. The mean patient age was 48.6 years and the mean number of medication trials in the current episode that were of adequate dose and duration was 2.5, indicating a treatment resistant population of patients with MDD. Outcome assessments were obtained at baseline, week two, at the point of maximal acute treatment benefit and at week six in cases where the acute course of TMS therapy extended beyond six weeks. This naturalistic study design permitted patients to continue concurrent antidepressant medications during treatment with NeuroStar Advanced Therapy if they were directed to do so by the prescribing psychiatrist. The primary efficacy endpoint of this trial was the change from baseline to endpoint on the CGI-S. Secondary outcome measures included baseline to endpoint change on the PHQ-9. 
 The average number of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy treatment sessions across the acute phase was 28.3 (standard deviation: 10.1). Results from the trial demonstrated that there was a statistically significant mean change in depression severity from baseline to end of treatment on the CGI-S (-1.9 ± 1.4, P<0.0001) and for the PHQ-9 (-8.7 ± 7.2, P<0.0001). Clinician-assessed response rate for CGI-S was 58.0% and the remission rate was 37.1%, as shown in Figure 8. Patient-reported outcomes measured using the PHQ-9 was 56.4% for response, and 28.7% for remission, as shown in Figure 9. Notably, the outcomes were consistent across patients with both low and high grades of treatment resistance. Patients with low treatment resistance had been treated without success with one antidepressant medication in their current illness episode and patients with high grades of treatment resistance had been treated with two or more antidepressants without benefit. These results further support NeuroStar Advanced Therapy as an effective therapy for those who have failed to benefit from antidepressant medication.

 The long-term durability of the clinical effect resulting from treatment with NeuroStar Advanced Therapy was also studied as part of this report over 12 months of follow-up. In the long-term phase, 257 patients who had participated in the acute treatment outcomes entered into long-term follow-up where their treatment outcomes were monitored over the next twelve months. This trial was conducted between March 2010 and August 2012. Clinical assessments using the CGI-S and the PHQ-9 were obtained at three, six, nine, and 12 months. A total of 205 patients provided data across the entire12-month trial period. Concurrent medication use and NeuroStar Advanced Therapy reintroduction were allowed for recurrent symptoms and were recorded during the long-term follow-up period. 
 23


Compared with baseline scores obtained prior to acute TMS treatment, the statistically significant reduction in mean standard deviation CGI-S and PHQ-9 total scores at the end of acute TMS treatment were sustained throughout the 12-month follow-up period (end of 12 months follow-up: CGI-S 2.8 and PHQ-9 8.6, both P<0.0001). The proportion of patients who achieved remission at the conclusion of acute TMS treatment remained similar to that observed following the conclusion of the long-term follow-up phase: CGI-S (total score 1 or 2), 41.2% (end of acute) and 45.1% (end of long-term), as shown in Figure 10; PHQ-9 (total score < 5), 31.1% (end of acute) and 37.0% (end of long-term). These results demonstrate that NeuroStar Advanced Therapy provides a sustained durability of effect over 12 months of follow-up in a patient population receiving minimal to no benefit with antidepressant medications. 
 CGI-S Outcomes

 Our Outcome Registry 
 In 2016, we launched our voluntary outcome registry to measure and record the outcomes of MDD patients treated with our NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System. Since inception, we have recorded results for over 1,500 patients at approximately 50 treatment facilities. For the patients treated with our products who completed self-evaluations, such as PHQ-9, and have had their results submitted to the registry, our data indicates remission and response rates of 32% and 62%, respectively. For the more than 600 patients treated with our products who have been evaluated using an observer-dependent interview, such as CGI-S, and have had their results submitted to the registry, our data indicates remission and response rates of 53% and 75%, respectively. Although we believe that these results demonstrate the potential of our products to treat patients with MDD, our registry is voluntary and only a portion of psychiatrists using our products have reported their outcomes. Therefore, these results may not be representative of response and remission rates for all MDD patients treated with our products. 
Sales and Customer Support Team and Psychiatrist Training 
 As of December 31, 2018, our sales and customer support team consisted of 133 employees working collaboratively across the following departments: 96 sales, 6 marketing, 22 field service and customer support, and 9 reimbursement. Additionally, our clinical team consisted of 7 employees.
 Sales and Marketing—United States 
 Our commercialization team selectively markets and sells the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System and recurring treatment sessions in the United States. Our primary focus is on selling to psychiatrists, with primary care physicians and pain management specialists representing a small percentage of our customer base. We target approximately 3,600 high-decile psychiatric practices, who we estimate, based on data from Symphony Health and our own internal estimates, treat approximately 33% of MDD patients who meet our labeled indication and are insured. We target these practices by the number of psychiatrists within their practices, the number of patients they treat and their acceptance of commercial insurance and Medicare. We believe that our psychiatrist targeting strategy makes for a well-defined customer base that is accessible by our direct sales organization. 
 We have structured our sales and customer support team with specialized roles to sell our NeuroStar Advanced Therapy Systems and recurring treatment sessions, while delivering customer service at each stage of the implementation process. Our business development managers are responsible for identifying key customer prospects, educating them on the value of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System, gaining their commitment for capital placement and introducing our clinical practice consultants. Our clinical practice consultants enhance the operational experience for providers and drive implementation of the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System into our customers’ practices. We created the role of clinical training consultant to partner with our psychiatrist providers to conduct initial and ongoing on-site clinical training to ensure clinical and practice success. 
 24


Practice Management Support and Psychiatrist Training—United States 
 Our clinical practice consultants play a pivotal role in ensuring the success of our customers as they implement a new service line into their practice. In the early stages of implementation, they help the practice set goals, educate on the types of patients that can benefit from our therapy and assist in preparing the office work flow and staffing needs. As the office prepares to begin scheduling consults, the clinical practice consultants will train the office staff on how to talk with patients about TMS and how to use patient educational tools such as presentations, videos and starter kits. Once the practice begins treating patients, they will educate the psychiatrist on how to track clinical outcomes, interpret data and how to effectively convey results to existing and potential patients and referring physicians. Our clinical practice consultants also work with our customers to increase awareness with referring physicians and develop external marketing tactics. Our dedicated reimbursement managers help each practice navigate all issues regarding the reimbursement process including investigation of benefits, prior authorizations and claims documentation. This group has assisted our customers to conduct over 31,000 benefit investigations. 
 Psychiatrists and staff training on the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System is a key to success within each practice. Our clinical training consultants take the burden of clinical training off our clinical practice consultants and provide a dedicated training resource to each customer. Clinical training consultants conduct at least a three-day, hands on training course that is scheduled after system installation at each practice and also provide ongoing advanced on-site clinical training. 
 Field Support—United States 
 Our field service engineers are responsible for maintenance, repairs and installation of upgrades. We provide a 24/7 support hotline to respond to medical information inquiries and technical questions that arise in all time zones. We pledge to have a field service engineer on-site within 24 hours of a service call. Because of the size and geographical coverage of our field service engineers and our standard 24-hour response time, NeuroStar Advanced Therapy Systems experience over 99% uptime, helping to ensure uninterrupted patient treatments. 
International 
 We market our products in a few select markets outside the United States through independent distributors. In Japan, we have an exclusive distribution agreement with Teijin, for the commercialization of our products. 
Distribution Agreement with Teijin Pharma Limited 
 In October 2017, we entered into a seven and a half year distribution agreement with Teijin Pharma Limited, or Teijin, for the exclusive distribution of our NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System to customers who will treat patients with MDD in Japan. Under the distribution agreement, Teijin is generally restricted from selling competing products in Japan. Our distribution agreement provides that we will have primary responsibility for obtaining reimbursement approval for use of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System for the treatment of MDD in Japan, and Teijin will promote the sales of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System for treatment of MDD in Japan. We have agreed to provide sales and technical support training to Teijin for our NeuroStar Advanced Therapy Systems. 
 Teijin is required to purchase minimum dollar values of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy Systems and treatment sessions from us following reimbursement approval by the JMHLW, TMS treatment for MDD (or, if such approval requires certified training on the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System by a third party, then upon the first psychiatrist being issued his or her training certification). In April 2018, we were approved to submit reimbursement dossiers to the JMHLW. 
 In 2017, under our distribution agreement with Teijin, we received an upfront payment of $0.75 million and a milestone payment of $2.0 million following JMHLW’s approval of marketing the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System for the treatment of MDD in Japan. These upfront and milestone payments have been deferred and are being recognized as revenue over the seven and one half year term of the agreement. Teijin is required to pay us a milestone payment tied to JMHLW issuing reimbursement for use of our products for the treatment of MDD in Japan. 
 25


The distribution agreement is scheduled to expire on March 31, 2025, subject to earlier termination if we or Teijin breach the agreement, Teijin fails to maintain distributor-level permits and approvals, Teijin fails to purchase from us specified dollar values of its sales forecasts, reimbursement for treatment of MDD using the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System is not obtained from JMHLW by specified dates or such reimbursement is below specified minimums, Teijin reasonably believes that it is not commercially reasonable to continue distributing the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System in Japan or bankruptcy related events occur. The term of the distribution agreement will be automatically extended for two years unless either party gives the other party at least two years’ prior written of notice of non-renewal, except that we cannot decline to renew the agreement if Teijin has purchased 100% of its sales forecasts over the term of the agreement. 
 Competition 
 Our currently marketed products are, and any future products we develop and commercialize will be, subject to intense competition. The industry in which we operate is subject to rapid change and is highly sensitive to the introduction of new products or other market activities of current or new industry participants. If we are not successful in convincing others of the merits of our products or educating them on the use of our products, they may not use our products or use them effectively and we may be unable to increase our sales. Key competitive factors affecting the commercial success of the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System and any other product candidates we may develop are likely to be efficacy, safety and tolerability profile, reliability, convenience of administration, price, treatment times, other indications outside of MDD and reimbursement. 
 We have competitors that sell other forms of TMS therapy, including Brainsway, Magstim, MagVenture, CloudTMS and Nexstim, that compete directly with the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System and have TMS therapy treatment times as short as 20, 37, three, 19 and 37 minutes, respectively. Competing TMS therapy companies have developed and may develop additional treatments that can be administered for shorter time periods or for indications outside of MDD, or may develop treatments that have improved efficacy when compared to our products or that require a less significant investment of resources from psychiatrists. We also face competition from pharmaceutical and other companies that develop products, such as antidepressant medications, for the treatment of psychiatric disorders. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if these competitors develop and commercialize antidepressant medications or other treatments that are safer, more convenient or more effective than the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System. At any time, these and other potential market entrants may develop treatment alternatives that may render our products uncompetitive. 
 In addition, our competitors may have greater financial resources or more established distribution networks than we do, or may be acquired by enterprises that have more established distribution networks than we do. Our competitors may also develop and patent processes or products earlier than we can or obtain domestic or international regulatory clearances or approvals for competing products more rapidly than we can, which could impair our ability to develop and commercialize similar products. We also compete with our competitors in acquiring technologies and technology licenses complementary to our products or advantageous to our business. In addition, we compete with our competitors to engage the services of independent distributors outside the United States, both those presently working with us and those with whom we hope to work as we expand. 
 Intellectual Property 
 Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our products and services, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others, and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. We rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets, copyrights and trademarks, as well as contractual protections, to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. We seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other things, filing patent applications in the United States and internationally. Our patent estate includes patents and applications with claims directed to our NeuroStar Advanced Therapy Systems and broader claims for potential future products and developments. On a worldwide basis, as of December 31, 2018, our patent estate included over 100 issued or allowed patents and pending patent applications for our products and novel design methods, manufacturing process, novel TMS devices and systems and future combination products that are mainly designed to treat psychiatric conditions or perform diagnostic procedures. In the United States, as of December 31, 2018, we owned or licensed 34 issued or allowed patents and eight patent applications filed that are directed to our TMS technology. Outside the United States, as of December 31, 2018, we owned or licensed 49 issued or allowed patents, 11 pending patent applications and one pending Patent Cooperation Treaty application. 
 26


These U.S. issued patents are expected to remain in effect until between 2019 and 2035. Our core patents in the United States will not expire before 2024. Our non-U.S. patents are expected to remain in effect until between 2024 and 2035. Our worldwide intellectual property portfolio includes multiple pending patent applications relating to methods and apparatuses for the treatment of psychiatric health conditions in Australia, Canada, the European Union, Japan and the United States. Our patents and patent applications mainly relate to iron core technology, including materials, manufacturing methods, geometries, applications, and open core technologies, TMS design patents, including coil position, motor threshold level determination, contact sensing, and articulation arm designs, patient comfort, TMS support technologies and pulse monitoring, and potential next generation technologies. 
 In some instances, we submit patent applications directly with the USPTO as provisional patent applications. Provisional applications for patents were designed to provide a lower-cost first patent filing in the United States. Corresponding non-provisional patent applications must be filed not later than 12 months after the provisional application filing date. The corresponding non-provisional application benefits in that the priority date(s) of the patent application is/are the earlier provisional application filing date(s), and the patent term of the finally issued patent is calculated from the later non-provisional application filing date. This system allows us to obtain an early priority date, add material to the patent application(s) during the priority year, obtain a later start to the patent term and to delay prosecution costs, which may be useful in the event that we decide not to pursue examination in an application. We file U.S. non-provisional applications and Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, applications that claim the benefit of the priority date of earlier filed provisional applications, when applicable. The PCT system allows a single application to be filed within 12 months of the original priority date of the patent application, and to designate all of the 152 PCT member states in which national patent applications can later be pursued based on the international patent application filed under the PCT. The PCT searching authority performs a patentability search and issues a non-binding patentability opinion which can be used to evaluate the chances of success for the national applications in foreign countries prior to having to incur the filing fees. Although a PCT application does not issue as a patent, it allows the applicant to seek protection in any of the member states through national-phase applications. 
 At the end of the period of two and a half years from the first priority date of the patent application, separate patent applications can be pursued in any of the PCT member states either by direct national filing or, in some cases by filing through a regional patent organization, such as the European Patent Organization. The PCT system delays expenses, allows a limited evaluation of the chances of success for national/regional patent applications and enables substantial savings where applications are abandoned within the first two and a half years of filing. 
 For all patent applications, we determine claiming strategy on a case-by-case basis. Advice of counsel and our business model and needs are always considered. We file patents containing claims for protection of all useful applications of our proprietary technologies and any products, as well as all new applications and/or uses we discover for existing technologies and products, assuming these are strategically valuable. We continuously reassess the number and type of patent applications, as well as the pending and issued patent claims to ensure that maximum coverage and value are obtained for our processes, and compositions, given existing patent office rules and regulations. Further, claims may be modified during patent prosecution to meet our intellectual property and business needs. 
 We recognize that the ability to obtain patent protection and the degree of such protection depends on a number of factors, including the extent of the prior art, the novelty and non-obviousness of the invention, and the ability to satisfy the enablement requirement of the patent laws. The patent positions of medical device companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and its scope can be reinterpreted or further altered even after patent issuance. Consequently, we may not obtain or maintain adequate patent protection for any of our product candidates or for our technology platform. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient proprietary protection from competitors. Any patents that we hold may be challenged, circumvented or invalidated by third parties. 
 Our commercial success will also depend in part on not infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. In addition, we have licensed rights under proprietary technologies of third parties to develop, manufacture and commercialize specific aspects of our products and services. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third party patent would 
 27


require us to alter our development or commercial strategies, alter our processes, obtain licenses or cease certain activities. The expiration of patents or patent applications licensed from third parties or our breach of any license agreements or failure to obtain a license to proprietary rights that we may require to develop or commercialize our future technology may have a material adverse impact on us. If third parties prepare and file patent applications in the United States that also claim technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference proceedings in the USPTO to determine priority of invention. 
 We further own trade secrets relating to our technology, and we maintain the confidentiality of proprietary information to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. We seek to protect our trade secrets and know-how by entering into confidentiality agreements with third-parties, consultants and employees who have access to such trade secrets and know-how. These agreements provide that all confidential information concerning our business or financial affairs developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us are to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In addition, we enter into employment agreements that require employees to assign to us any inventions, trade secrets or know-how that they develop while employed by us. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, including through agreements with our employees and consultants, these agreements may be breached, or third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. Thus, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. To the extent that our employees, consultants, scientific advisors or other contractors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know how and inventions. 
 For a more comprehensive discussion of the risks related to our intellectual property, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property.” 
 Manufacturing and Supply 
 We manage all aspects of product supply through our operations team based in Malvern, Pennsylvania. We outsource the manufacture of components and high level assemblies, which are produced and tested to our specifications. We rely on third party providers to provide components used in existing products and we expect to continue to do so for future products. 
 We manage our arrangements with our third-party manufacturers and suppliers to adjust delivery schedules and quantities of components to match our changing manufacturing requirements. We forecast our component needs based on historical trends, current utilization patterns and sales forecasts of future demand. We establish our relationships with our third-party manufacturers and suppliers through supplier contracts and purchase orders. In most cases, these supplier relationships may be terminated by either party upon short notice. Currently, we are engaged with Sparton Medical Systems to supply our console; Molex Incorporated to supply our SenStar Treatment Link; Paragon Micro to supply our computer systems as well as other companies to supply components of our chairs and treatment packs. 
 In order to mitigate against the risks related to a single-source of supply, we qualify alternative suppliers when possible, maximize the use of commercial, off the shelf components and materials, minimize specialized or proprietary manufacturing processes, and develop contingency plans for responding to disruptions, including maintaining adequate inventory of any critical components. To date, we have not experienced material delays in obtaining any of our components, nor has the ready supply of finished products to our customers or clinicians been adversely affected by component supply issues. 
 Reimbursement, Payor Relations and Customer Support 
 Coverage and Reimbursement in the United States 
 Sales of a medical device, which is utilized for in-office medical treatments, depends, in part, on the extent to which such treatments using that medical device will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid private insurance and managed healthcare organizations. Even if a third-party payor covers a particular treatment, the resulting reimbursement payment rates may not be adequate to 
 28


cover a provider’s cost to purchase such medical device or ensure that purchase will be profitable for the provider. Additionally, patients who are treated in-office for a medical condition generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with the treatment and may be unwilling to undergo such treatment in the absence of coverage and adequate reimbursement. 
 Reimbursement by a third-party payor may depend upon a number of factors, including the third-party payor’s determination that a treatment is neither experimental nor investigational; safe, effective, and medically necessary; appropriate for the specific patient; cost-effective; supported by peer reviewed medical journals; and included in clinical practice guidelines. 
 In the United States, there is no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement among third-party payors. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement policies, but also have their own methods and approval process apart from Medicare coverage and reimbursement determinations. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for treatments can differ significantly from payor to payor. Decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for an in-office treatment are made on a plan-by-plan basis. One payor’s determination to provide coverage for a specific treatment does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage, and adequate reimbursement. 
 In addition, the federal government and state legislatures have continued to implement cost containment programs, including price controls and restrictions on coverage and reimbursement. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost effectiveness of medical services. Adoption of price controls and cost containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net sales and results of operations. 
 Based on our estimates, over 65 major private insurers in the United States, including the top 25 largest private insurers, have coverage policies for reimbursement of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy, representing approximately 205 million covered lives or about 95% of the total payor covered lives in the United States. Treatments using NeuroStar Advanced Therapy are also eligible for reimbursement from Medicare, representing an additional 59 million covered lives in the United States as of January 2018. 
 Government Regulation 
 Our products and our operations are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other federal and state authorities in the United States, as well as comparable authorities in foreign jurisdictions. Our products are subject to regulation as medical devices under the FDCA, as implemented and enforced by the FDA. The FDA regulates the development, design, non-clinical and clinical research, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, installation, servicing, recordkeeping, premarket clearance or approval, import, export, adverse event reporting, advertising, promotion, marketing and distribution, and import and export of medical devices to ensure that medical devices distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses and otherwise meet the requirements of the FDCA. 
 In addition to U.S. regulations, we are subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA clearance or approval for a product, we must obtain authorization before commencing clinical trials or obtain marketing authorization or approval of our products under the comparable regulatory authorities of countries outside of the United States. The marketing authorization process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA clearance or approval. 
 FDA Premarket Clearance and Approval Requirements 
 Unless an exemption applies, each medical device commercially distributed in the United States requires either FDA clearance of a 510(k) premarket notification or PMA approval. Under the FDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes—Class I, Class II or Class III—depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of manufacturer and regulatory control needed to ensure its safety and efficacy. Class I includes devices with the lowest risk to the patient and are those for which safety and efficacy can be assured by adherence to the FDA’s General Controls for medical devices, which include compliance with the applicable 
 29


portions of the quality systems regulation, or QSR, facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events, and truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising, and promotional materials. Class II devices are subject to the FDA’s General Controls, and special controls as deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and efficacy of the device. These special controls can include performance standards, post-market surveillance, patient registries and FDA guidance documents. While most Class I devices are exempt from the 510(k) premarket notification requirement, manufacturers of most Class II devices are required to submit to the FDA a premarket notification under Section 510(k) of the FDCA requesting permission to commercially distribute the device. The FDA’s permission to commercially distribute a device subject to a 510(k) premarket notification is generally known as 510(k) clearance. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risks, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or some implantable devices, or devices that have a new intended use, or use advanced technology that is not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed device, are placed in Class III, requiring approval of a PMA. 
 Our NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System is classified as a Class II medical device. We initially received marketing authorization of this device through the de novo classification process. Subsequently, we have cleared any changes made to our system through the 510(k) clearance process. 
 510(k) Marketing Clearance Pathway 
 To obtain 510(k) clearance, we must submit to the FDA a premarket notification submission demonstrating that the proposed device is “substantially equivalent” to a predicate device already on the market. A predicate device is a legally marketed device that is not subject to premarket approval, i.e., a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976 (pre-amendments device) and for which a PMA is not required, a device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or I, or a device that was found substantially equivalent through the 510(k) process. The FDA’s 510(k) clearance process usually takes from nine to twelve months, but may take significantly longer. The FDA may require additional information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence. If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device currently on the market, it will grant 510(k) clearance to commercially market the device. If the FDA determines that the device is “not substantially equivalent” to a previously cleared device, the device is automatically designated as a Class III device. The device sponsor must then fulfill more rigorous PMA requirements, or can request a risk-based classification determination for the device in accordance with the “de novo” process, which is a route to market for novel medical devices that are low to moderate risk and are not substantially equivalent to a predicate device. 
Pre-Market Approval Process 
 A PMA application must be submitted if the medical device is in Class III (although the FDA has the discretion to continue to allow certain pre-amendment Class III devices to use the 510(k) process) or cannot be cleared through the 510(k) process. A PMA application must be supported by, among other things, extensive technical, preclinical, clinical trials, manufacturing and labeling data to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device. 
 After a PMA application is submitted and filed, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the submitted information, which typically takes between one and three years, but may take significantly longer. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided. Also during the review period, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA will usually be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. In addition, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with the QSR, which imposes elaborate design development, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures in the design and manufacturing process. The FDA may approve a PMA application with post-approval conditions intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution and collection of long-term follow-up data from patients in the clinical study that supported approval. Failure to comply with the conditions of approval can result in materially adverse enforcement action, including the loss or withdrawal of the approval. New PMA applications or supplements are required for significant modifications to the manufacturing process, labeling of the product and design of a device that is approved through the PMA process. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as an original PMA application, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original PMA application, and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel. 
 30


De novo Classification Process 
 Medical device types that the FDA has not previously classified as Class I, II, or III are automatically classified as Class III regardless of the level of risk they pose. The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 established a new route to market for low to moderate risk medical devices that are automatically placed into Class III due to the absence of a predicate device, called the “Request for Evaluation of Automatic Class III Designation,” or the de novo classification procedure. This procedure allows a manufacturer whose novel device is automatically classified as Class III to request down-classification of its medical device into Class I or Class II on the basis that the device presents low or moderate risk, rather than requiring the submission and approval of a PMA application. Prior to the enactment of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, in July 2012, a medical device could only be eligible for de novo classification if the manufacturer first submitted a 510(k) premarket notification and received a determination from the FDA that the device was not substantially equivalent. FDASIA streamlined the de novo classification pathway by permitting manufacturers to request de novo classification directly without first submitting a 510(k) premarket notification to the FDA and receiving a not substantially equivalent determination. We originally obtained marketing authorization for our system using the de novo classification process after receiving a not substantially equivalent determination following the submission of a 510(k) premarket notification. We have subsequently used the 510(k) clearance process to obtain authorization from the FDA for changes to our marketed system. 
Clinical Trials 
 A clinical trial is typically required to support a PMA application or de novo classification, and is sometimes required for a 510(k) pre-market notification. Clinical trials generally require submission of an application for an Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, to the FDA. The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the investigational protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE application must be approved in advance by the FDA for a specified number of patients, unless the product is deemed a non-significant risk device and eligible for more abbreviated IDE requirements. Clinical trials for a significant risk device may begin once the IDE application is approved by the FDA as well as the appropriate institutional review boards, or IRBs, at the clinical trial sites, and the informed consent of the patients participating in the clinical trial is obtained. After a trial begins, the FDA may place it on hold or terminate it if, among other reasons, it concludes that the clinical subjects are exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Any trials we conduct must be conducted in accordance with FDA regulations as well as other federal regulations and state laws concerning human subject protection and privacy. Moreover, the results of a clinical trial may not be sufficient to obtain clearance or approval of the product. 
Changes to Marketed Devices 
 After a device receives 510(k) marketing clearance, or de novo classification, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or efficacy, or that would constitute a major change or modification in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) marketing clearance or, depending on the modification, a de novo classification or PMA approval. The FDA requires each manufacturer to determine whether the proposed change requires submission of a 510(k) or a PMA in the first instance, but the FDA can review any such decision and disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. Many minor modifications today are accomplished by a manufacturer documenting the change in an internal letter-to-file. The letter-to-file is in lieu of submitting a new 510(k) to obtain clearance for every change. The FDA can always review these letters to file in an inspection. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or request the recall of the modified device until 510(k) marketing clearance or PMA approval is obtained. Also, in these circumstances, we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties. 
 31


Post-Market Regulation 
 After a device is cleared or approved for marketing, numerous and pervasive regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include: 
  
• | establishment registration and device listing with the FDA;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | QSR requirements, which require manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the design and manufacturing process;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | labeling and marketing regulations, which require that promotion is truthful, not misleading, fairly balanced and provide adequate directions for use and that all claims are substantiated, and also prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or “off-label” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling; FDA guidance on off-label dissemination of information and responding to unsolicited requests for information;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | clearance or approval of product modifications to 510(k)-cleared devices that could significantly affect safety or efficacy or that would constitute a major change in intended use of one of our cleared devices;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | medical device reporting regulations, which require that a manufacturer report to the FDA if a device it markets may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned and the device or a similar device that it markets would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury or serious adverse events, if the malfunction were to recur;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | correction, removal and recall reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | complying with regulations requiring Unique Device Identifiers (UDI) on devices and also requiring the submission of certain information about each device to the FDA’s Global Unique Device Identification Database (GUDID);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the FDA’s recall authority, whereby the agency can order device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulations; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | post-market surveillance activities and regulations, which apply when deemed by the FDA to be necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and efficacy data for the device.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We may be subject to similar foreign laws that may include applicable post-marketing requirements such as safety surveillance and risk-benefit analysis. Our manufacturing processes are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and the facilities and controls for the design, manufacture, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, distribution, installation and servicing of finished devices intended for human use. The QSR also requires, among other things, maintenance of a device master file, device history file, and complaint files. As a manufacturer, we are subject to periodic scheduled or unscheduled inspections by the FDA. Our failure to maintain compliance with the QSR requirements could result in the shut-down of, or restrictions on, our manufacturing operations and the recall or seizure of our products. The discovery of previously unknown problems with any of our products, including unanticipated adverse events or adverse events of increasing severity or frequency, whether resulting from the use of the device within the scope of its clearance or off-label by a physician in the practice of medicine, could result in restrictions on the device, including the removal of the product from the market or voluntary or mandatory device recalls. 
 The FDA has broad regulatory compliance and enforcement powers. If the FDA determines that we failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it can take a variety of compliance or enforcement actions, which may result in any of the following sanctions: 
  
• | warning letters, untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | recalls, withdrawals, or administrative detention or seizure of our products;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 32


 
• | refusing or delaying requests for 510(k) marketing clearance or PMA approvals of new products or modified products;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | withdrawing 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals that have already been granted;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal to grant export or import approvals for our products; or
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


• | criminal prosecution.

U.S. and Foreign Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements 
 Healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation, prescription and payment for medical treatments. A medical device manufacturer’s arrangements with third-party payors, providers and patients may expose it to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may affect its business or the financial arrangements and relationships through which it markets, sells and distributes its products. Even if a medical device manufacturer does not control referrals of healthcare services or bill directly to Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors, federal and state healthcare laws and regulations are applicable to its business. In addition, a portion of our business is subject to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as a business associate of our covered entity customers. To provide our covered entity customers with services that involve the use or disclosure of PHI, we are required to enter into business associate agreements. As a business associate, we are also directly liable for compliance with HIPAA. The laws that may affect a medical device manufacturer’s ability to operate include, but are not limited to: 

• | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The intent standard under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or the PPACA, to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, such as the False Claims Act, or FCA, which can be enforced by private citizens through civil qui tam actions, prohibits individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false, fictitious or fraudulent claims for payment of federal funds, and knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. For example, companies have been prosecuted under the FCA in connection with alleged off-label promotion of devices and allegedly providing free products to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal health care programs for the product. In addition, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the FCA. As a result of a modification made by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. In addition, manufacturers can be held liable under the FCA even when they do not submit claims directly to government payors if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | HIPAA, among other things, imposes criminal liability for executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and creates federal criminal laws that prohibit knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation, or making or using any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 33


 
• | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, which imposes privacy, security, transmission and breach reporting obligations with respect to individually identifiable health information upon “covered entities” subject to the law, including health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and certain healthcare providers and their respective business associates that perform services on their behalf that involve individually identifiable health information. HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal physician payment transparency requirements, sometimes referred to as the “Physician Payments Sunshine Act,” created under the PPACA, which requires, among other things, certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies reimbursed under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to the United States Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Medicare and Medicare Services, or CMS, information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | foreign and state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws, that may impose similar or more prohibitive restrictions, and may apply to items or services reimbursed by any non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers; state laws that require device manufacturers to comply with the industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require device manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures and pricing information; and other federal and state laws that govern the privacy and security of health information or personally identifiable information in certain circumstances, including state health information privacy and data breach notification laws which govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not pre-empted by HIPAA, thus requiring additional compliance efforts and data privacy and security laws and regulations in foreign jurisdictions that may be more stringent than those in the United States (such as the European Union, which adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, which became effective in May 2018).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of their statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors, it is possible that some of a medical device manufacturer’s business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of these laws. The scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations. Federal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. 
 Ensuring that business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations is costly and time consuming. If a medical device manufacturer’s operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to it, it may be subject to penalties, including civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, exclusion from governmental funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, additional reporting obligations and oversight if it becomes subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of operations, any of which could adversely affect the ability of a medical device manufacturer to operate its business and the results of its operations.

United States Healthcare Reform 
 In the United States, a number of legislative and regulatory proposals have been considered or enacted to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect a medical device manufacturer’s business. Among policy makers and payors in the United States, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality or expanding access. For example, in 2010, the PPACA was enacted, which includes measures to significantly change the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the medical device industry. Among other ways in which it may impact a medical device manufacturer’s business, the PPACA: 

• | imposes an annual excise tax of 2.3% on any entity that manufactures or imports medical devices offered for sale in the United States, with limited exceptions, although the effective rate paid may be lower. Under the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016, the excise tax was suspended through December 31, 2017, and under the continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018, or 2018 Appropriations Resolution, signed by President Trump on January 22, 2018, was further suspended through December 31, 2019;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | establishes a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee and identify priorities in comparative clinical efficacy research in an effort to coordinate and develop such research;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | implements payment system reforms including a national pilot program on payment bundling to encourage hospitals, physicians and other providers to improve the coordination, quality and efficiency of certain healthcare services through bundled payment models; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expands the eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs.
--+--------------------------------------------------------

 Some of the provisions of the PPACA have yet to be implemented, and there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the PPACA, as well as recent efforts by the Trump administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the PPACA. President Trump has signed two Executive Orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the PPACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the PPACA. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the PPACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the PPACA have been signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the Tax Act, includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the PPACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate”. The 2018 Appropriations Resolution delayed the implementation of certain PPACA-mandated fees, including, without limitation, the medical device excise tax. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, amends the PPACA, effective January 1, 2019, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole”. In July 2018, CMS published a final rule permitting further collections and payments to and from certain PPACA qualified health plans and health insurance issuers under the PPACA risk adjustment program in response to the outcome of federal district court litigation regarding the method CMS uses to determine this risk adjustment. On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas, or Texas District Court Judge, ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the PPACA, and therefore, because it was repealed as part of the Tax Act, the remaining provisions of the PPACA are invalid as well. While the Texas District Court Judge, as well as the Trump administration and CMS, have stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect, it is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals, if any, and other efforts to repeal and replace the PPACA will impact the PPACA.
 35


In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the PPACA was enacted. On August 2, 2011, President Obama signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013, and due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, including the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, will stay in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. On January 2, 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, or the ATRA, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. In addition, the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, enacted on April 16, 2015, or MACRA, repealed the formula by which Medicare made annual payment adjustments to physicians and replaced the former formula with fixed annual updates and a new system of incentive payments scheduled to begin in 2019 that are based on various performance measures and physicians’ participation in alternative payment models such as accountable care organizations. 
 Recently there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, reduce the cost of certain products under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies. At the state level, individual states in the United States are also increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures. 
 It is likely that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for a medical device manufacturer’s products or additional pricing pressure. 
 Japanese Regulation 
 In Japan, medical devices must be approved prior to importation and commercial sale by the MHLW. The approval process identifies a Marketing Authorization Holder, or MAH, who is designated as the only authorized seller of products. Manufacturers of medical devices outside of Japan who do not operate through a Japanese entity are able to designate a MAH who will apply for product approval and take responsibility for the medical device as designated. The MHLW evaluates each device for safety and efficacy. As part of its approval process, the MHLW may require that the product be tested in Japanese laboratories. The approval process ranges in length and certain medical devices may require a longer review period for approval. Once a device is approved, the MHLW issues a Shonin to the MAH or designated MAH, thereby permitting such entity to import the device into Japan for sale. 
 After a device is approved for importation and commercial sale in Japan, the MHLW continues to monitor sales of approved products for compliance with labeling regulations, which prohibit promotion of devices for unapproved uses, and reporting regulations, which require reporting of product malfunctions, including serious injury or death caused by any approved device. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the MHLW, which may include fines, injunctions, and civil penalties; recall or seizure of our products; operating restrictions; partial suspension or total shutdown of sales in Japan; or criminal prosecution. 
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 191 employees, with 133 employees on our sales and customer support team, 33 in research and development, including clinical, regulatory and certain quality functions, 3 employees in operations and 22 employees in general and administrative. We have never had a work stoppage and none of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or represented by a labor union. We believe our employee relations are good.
