Item 1. Business 
Overview
Okta is the leading independent identity provider. Our vision is to free everyone to safely use any technology, and we believe identity is the key to making that happen. Our mission is to bring simple and secure digital access to people and organizations everywhere. Our Workforce Identity and Customer Identity Clouds are powered by our category-defining Okta Identity Platform that enables our customers to securely connect the right people to the right technologies and services at the right time.
Our Workforce Identity and Customer Identity Clouds help organizations effectively harness the power of cloud, mobile and web technologies by securing users and connecting them with the applications and technology they use. Every day, thousands of organizations and millions of people use Okta to securely access a wide range of cloud, mobile, web and Software-as-a-Service ("SaaS") applications, on-premises servers, application programming interfaces ("APIs"), IT infrastructure providers and services from a multitude of devices. Employees and contractors sign into the Workforce Identity Cloud to seamlessly and securely access the applications they need to do their most important work. Developers leverage our Customer Identity and Workforce Identity Clouds to securely and efficiently embed identity into the software they build, allowing them to innovate and focus on their core mission. Organizations use our platform to collaborate with their partners, and to provide their customers with more modern and secure experiences in the cloud and via mobile devices. As we add new customers, users, developers and integrations to our platform, our business, customers, partners and users benefit from powerful network effects that increase the value and security of our Workforce Identity and Customer Identity Clouds.
The acceleration of digital transformations, cloud adoption and evolving security threat landscape and changing consumer expectations to simple, secure digital experiences are driving a shift in how organizations manage consumer identities on the internet. Organizations are building secure consumer-facing applications and are turning to identity to optimize seamless and private user experiences. Our approach provides organizations with the scale, interoperability, efficiency and security they need to build customer-facing applications. 
Given the growth trends in the number of applications and cloud adoption, and the movement to remote workforces, identity is becoming the most critical layer of an organization’s security. As organizations shift from network-based security models to a Zero Trust security model focusing on adaptive and context-aware controls, identity has become the most reliable way to manage user access and protect digital assets. Our approach to identity allows our customers to simplify and efficiently scale their security infrastructures across internal IT systems and external customer-facing applications. 
As of January 31, 2023, more than 17,600 customers across nearly every industry used Okta to secure and manage identities around the world. Our customers consist of leading global organizations ranging from the largest enterprises, to small- and medium-sized businesses, universities, non-profits and government agencies. We partner with leading application, infrastructure and security vendors, such as Amazon Web Services ("AWS"), CrowdStrike, Google, LexisNexis Risk Solutions, Microsoft, Netskope, Palo Alto Networks, Plaid, Proofpoint, Salesforce, ServiceNow, VMware, Workday, Yubico and Zscaler. We had over 7,000 integrations with cloud, mobile and web applications and IT infrastructure providers as of January 31, 2023, which while not directly correlated to revenue, shows the breadth and acceptance of our platform.
We employ a SaaS business model and generate revenue primarily by selling multi-year subscriptions to our cloud-based offerings. We focus on acquiring and retaining our customers and increasing their spending with us through expanding the number of users who access our Workforce Identity and Customer Identity Clouds and up-selling additional products. We sell our products directly through our field and inside sales teams, as well as indirectly through our network of channel partners, including resellers, system integrators and other distribution partners.
The Okta Identity Platform
Okta is an independent and neutral cloud-based identity solution that allows our customers to integrate with nearly any application, service or cloud that they choose through our secure, reliable and scalable platform and cloud infrastructure. Our technological neutrality allows our customers to easily adopt the best technologies, and our Okta Identity Platform is designed to securely connect users to the technology that they choose. Our Workforce Identity and Customer Identity Clouds are underpinned by Okta Platform Services which are the foundational platform components that power our product features. We prioritize the compatibility of our platform with public clouds, on-premises infrastructures and hybrid clouds. 
The Okta Identity Platform is used by organizations in two distinct and powerful ways. Our customers use it to manage and secure their employees, contractors and partners, which we refer to as workforce identity as supported by our Workforce Identity Cloud. Our customers also use it to enable, manage and secure the identities of their own customers via the powerful APIs we have developed, which we refer to as customer identity as supported by our Customer Identity Cloud. 
Workforce Identity Cloud
The Workforce Identity Cloud simplifies the way an organization’s employees, contractors and partners connect to its applications and data from any device, while increasing efficiency and keeping IT environments secure. The Workforce Identity Cloud can be used as the central system for an organization’s connectivity, access, authentication and identity lifecycle management needs spanning all of its users, technology and applications. Our customers use the Workforce Identity Cloud to secure their workforces, to create solutions that make their partner networks more collaborative, and to provide more seamless and secure experiences for their end users, which combined with our open approach, enables our customers to future-proof their environments. We enable our customers to easily deploy, manage and secure applications and devices, and to provision and support users across their IT environments, with a simple, intuitive, consumer-like user experience. Once deployed, we enable administrators to enforce contextual access management decisions based on conditions such as user identity, device, location, application identity, IP reputation and time of day. 
We enable organizations to provide their workforces with immediate and secure access to every application they need from any device they use, without requiring multiple credentials, which significantly enhances user connectivity and productivity. We offer our customers an additional security layer through our Adaptive Multi-Factor Authentication product. Our Universal Directory product also serves as a system of record to help our customers organize, customize and manage their users. Our Lifecycle Management product enables customers to manage users’ access privileges through their entire lifecycle with a no-code approach that improves administrative efficiency and productivity. Okta Identity Governance, our unified identity access management and identity governance solution, helps our customers improve their security and compliance posture while mitigating modern security risks and increasing efficiency. Our Advanced Server Access product is designed to significantly improve our customers’ ability to secure access to cloud-based and on-premises servers, while Access Gateway enables our customers to extend the Workforce Identity Cloud to their existing on-premises applications. The Workforce Identity Cloud enables our customers to automate access across their growing ecosystem of employees, contractors and partners, increasing collaboration across their workforces.
Customer Identity Cloud
The Customer Identity Cloud enables organizations to transform their own customers’ experiences by empowering development teams to rapidly and securely build customer-facing cloud, mobile or web applications. Our Customer Identity Cloud primarily supports consumer and SaaS applications. It empowers application builders to innovate faster by removing the complexity from identity and making it simple, extensible and customizable. We enable organizations to integrate our powerful identity platform into their cloud, web and mobile applications. This makes it easier for them to authenticate, manage, scale and secure their applications through comprehensive APIs, software development kits and extensive developer community tools, enabling rapid time to market for the business. Organizations are able to streamline user experience and improve security across all their applications, leading to increased customer acquisition, retention and loyalty.
Platform Services
In order to enable customers and partners to address a wide range of identity use cases, we have built a set of modular components, called Okta Platform Services, which can be combined to build new features and tailored experiences faster. Okta Platform Services are available in Okta packaged products through APIs and software 
development kits. Okta Platform Services can be used across both workforce and customer identity use cases. We expect to use Okta Platform Services to continue to enable new and expanded use cases and enable customers or third-party developers to build their own solutions based on an industry use case or unique customer need. Okta Platform Services include Okta’s Identity Engine, Workflows, Devices, Directories, Integrations and Insights. 
Growth Strategy
Key elements of our growth strategy are to:
Execute with Our Platform 
•Drive New Customer Growth.  To increase our market share, we intend to continue to grow our customer base using a land-and-expand sales model, with a focus on key markets by size of customers, as well as key verticals, including highly-regulated sectors.
•Deepen Relationships Within Our Existing Customer Base.  We strive to further increase revenue from our existing customers by cross-selling and up-selling additional and new products. We also believe we can expand our footprint by focusing on current customers that have deployed our Workforce Identity Cloud for workforce identity, and expanding those customers’ use of our Customer Identity Cloud for customer identity, or vice versa.
•Leverage Partner Ecosystem. We also plan to further leverage the sales efforts of resellers, system integrators and other distribution partners, and to increase the contribution we receive from these channel partners.
•Expand Our International Footprint.  With 22% of our revenue generated outside of the United States in fiscal 2023, and our international revenue growing 53% from fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2023, we believe there is significant opportunity to continue to grow our international business. We believe global demand for our products will continue to be a long-term opportunity as organizations outside the United States fully embrace the transition to cloud computing, and larger international organizations take advantage of technology consolidation within their global locations.
Increase Our Opportunities
•Innovate and Extend Our Platform with New Products.  We intend to continue making significant investments in research and development, hiring top technical talent and maintaining an agile organization. In addition, we intend to selectively pursue acquisitions and strategic investments in businesses and technologies to extend our platform. By continuing to innovate, introduce new products and extend our platform, we believe that we can offer increasing value to our existing and potential customers.
•Extend Our Accessible Market with New Use Cases. As technology and our customers’ needs evolve, we plan to use our platform to help our customers address new challenges, regulatory requirements and use cases.
•Leverage Our Integrations.  The Okta Integration Network is an extensive ecosystem, which includes over 7,000 integrations with cloud, mobile and web applications and IT infrastructure providers. We plan to maintain these integrations as well as add new ones to enrich our user experience and expand our customer base. We view our investment in these partnerships as a force multiplier that enables us to build and promote complementary capabilities that benefit our customers. 
•Expand our Developer Ecosystem. We want to empower every application developer to use our platform to securely integrate identity into any application. We believe that our Okta Identity Platform enables developers to focus their time and attention on innovating within their core application capabilities while relying on our platform for their identity related requirements, leading to more secure and convenient experiences for their own customers. 
•Leverage Our Unique Data Assets with Powerful Analytics. Our position at the intersection of people, devices, applications and infrastructure gives us unique access to powerful data, and the opportunity to provide differentiated insights based on that data, as well as predictive capabilities based on that data to help keep customers more secure. We expect the value of our analytics to our customer base will increase as customers continue to connect more devices, applications and users to their networks and as we add 
more customers. We also expect that our analytics ability will enable our customers to use our data and third-party data from our partners, to help customers make more informed and secure access decisions. We do not currently derive direct revenue from our unique data assets, but we may explore opportunities for monetization in the future.
•Mergers and Acquisitions and Investments. From time to time, we evaluate opportunities to acquire or invest in emerging and adjacent technologies to complement our organic investments and improve our products, services and customers’ experiences. We will continue to use these types of strategic levers as opportunities arise.
Our Products
Okta's suite of products and services is used to manage and secure identities. Most of our products can be used for both customer identity and for workforce identity use cases and we are continuously enhancing our products and services. Our workforce identity products are consumed through web and mobile interfaces, and provide simple ways for IT organizations to manage identities for their employees, contractors and partners. For customer identity, our APIs are also used by developers to embed Okta identity functionality into their own customer-facing mobile or web applications. We continuously improve our Workforce Identity and Customer Identity Clouds through the release and development of additional products, features and services.
Workforce Identity Products
•Universal Directory.  Universal Directory provides a centralized, cloud-based system of record to store and secure user, application and device profiles for an organization.

It offers adaptive, risk-based authentication that leverages data intelligence from across the Okta network of thousands of organizations.
•Lifecycle Management.  Lifecycle Management enables IT organizations or developers to manage a user's identity throughout its entire lifecycle. It automates IT processes and ensures user accounts are created and deactivated at the appropriate times, including the workflow and policies needed to power those processes. With Lifecycle Management, organizations can securely manage the entire identity lifecycle, from on-boarding to off-boarding, and ensure compliance requirements are met as user roles evolve and access levels change.
•API Access Management.  API Access Management enables organizations to secure APIs as systems connect to each other. Access to these APIs is managed based on the user, which enables organizations to centrally maintain one set of permissions for any employee, partner or customer across every point of access. API Access Management reduces development time, boosts security, helps in achieving compliance and enables seamless end user experiences by providing a unified portable service for authorizing secure and always available access to any API.
•Access Gateway.  Access Gateway enables organizations to extend the Workforce Identity Cloud, which is a cloud native platform, from the cloud to their existing on-premises applications, so that they can harness the benefits of Okta to manage all of their critical systems, whether in the cloud, on-premises or hybrid. Extending the benefits of the Workforce Identity Cloud to hybrid IT environments delivers a single point of management for our customers’ administrators and a single location from which end users can access their critical applications.

Our Technology
We focus on engineering an intuitive, but comprehensive, platform to solve complex problems. Our cloud architecture is multi-tenant, encrypted and third-party validated. Our service also allows us to integrate into our customers’ on-premises components and hybrid configurations.
Okta Identity Platform with Differentiated Administration, User and Developer Experience
Okta provides one common platform and user interface framework supporting our Workforce Identity and Customer Identity Clouds, offering administrators and users a consistent, easy-to-use, consumer-like experience across our products. Our technology integrates with industry-leading browsers and mobile applications to provide seamless access to nearly any web or native mobile application. We also heavily leverage operating system management and security technologies across desktops, laptops and mobile devices to provide a transparent, but secure experience for users across a range of devices. These integrations allow us to seamlessly deliver connectivity use cases that previously required significant custom development to achieve.
Robust Security
Security is a mission-critical issue for Okta and for our customers. Our approach to security spans day-to-day operational practices from the design and development of our software to how customer data is segmented and secured within our multi-tenant platform. We ensure that access to our platform is securely delegated across an organization. Okta's source code is updated weekly, and there are audited and verifiable security checkpoints to ensure source code fidelity and continuous security review. We have attained multiple SOC 2 Type II Attestations, CSA Star Level 2 Attestation, ISO/IEC 27001:2013, ISO/IEC 27018:2019 and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ("HIPAA") certifications and multiple agency Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program ("FedRAMP") Moderate Authorities to Operate. We also support FIPS 140-2 encryption requirements.
Scalability and Uptime
Our technical operations and engineering teams are designed around the concept of an always-on, highly redundant and available platform that we can upgrade without customer disruption. Our products and architecture were built entirely in and for the cloud with availability and scalability at the center of the design and were built to be agnostic with respect to the underlying infrastructure. Our maintenance windows do not require any downtime.
Okta's proprietary cell architecture includes redundant, active-active availability zones with cross-continental disaster recovery centers, real-time database replication and geo-distributed storage. If one of our systems goes down, another is quickly promoted. Our architecture is designed to scale both vertically by increasing the size of the application tiers and horizontally by adding new geo-distributed cells.
Our Workforce Identity and Customer Identity Clouds are monitored not only at the infrastructure level but also at the application and third-party integration level. Synthetic transaction monitoring allows our technical operations team to detect and resolve issues proactively. 
Okta Integration Network and Auth0 Marketplace
The Okta Integration Network contains over 7,000 integrations with cloud, mobile and web applications, IoT devices and IT infrastructure providers, including Amazon Web Services, Atlassian, DocuSign, Google, Microsoft Office 365, NetSuite, Oracle, Palo Alto Networks, Proofpoint, Salesforce, SAP, ServiceNow, Slack, Splunk, VMware, Workday, Zendesk and Zoom.

Our customers span nearly all industry verticals and range from small organizations with fewer than 100 employees to companies in the Fortune 50, with up to hundreds of thousands of employees, some of which use our platform to manage millions of their customers' identities.
Sales and Marketing
Sales
We sell directly to customers through our direct inside and field sales force and also indirectly through our extensive ecosystem of channel partners. Once a sale is made, we leverage our land-and-expand sales model to generate incremental revenue, often within the term of the initial agreement, through the addition of new users and the sale of additional products. In many instances, we find that initial customer success with our platform results in key internal decision makers expanding their deployments, for example, from initial use for workforce identity to expanded use for their customer identity needs. Furthermore, as our customers are successful in their businesses and increase headcount or the number of their customers, we share in their growth as the number of identities that we manage increases.
Our sales organization is structured to address the specific needs of each segment of our target market. Our sales team is divided by geography, customer size and industry vertical. Our direct sales force is supported by our sales engineers, security team, cloud architects, professional services team and other technical resources.
We benefit from an expansive partner ecosystem that helps drive additional sales. Nearly all of the leading cloud application providers are our partners, and many of them drive further customer acquisition for us through co-selling arrangements, building our offerings directly into their products, and product demonstrations running on Okta. We also partner with several of the large technology companies that are driving the movement to the cloud. In addition to these technology partners, we leverage our channel partners, including system integrators, traditional value-added resellers ("VARs") and Government VARs, to broaden the range of customers we reach.
Marketing
Our most valuable marketing features our customers and their successes, and is informed by a deeply data-driven approach, giving us insights into the efficacy of our efforts. Our marketing efforts focus on promoting our industry-leading identity platform, establishing our brand, generating awareness, creating sales leads and cultivating the Okta Community.
A centerpiece of our marketing strategy is our annual customer conference, Oktane, that features customers sharing their success stories, new product and feature announcements and hands-on product labs. We also host a number of other events where we engage with both existing customers and new prospects, as well as deliver product training.
Research and Development
Our research and development organization is responsible for the design, architecture, creation and the quality of our platform. The research and development organization also works closely with our technical operations team to ensure the successful deployment and monitoring of our platform. We use test automation and application monitoring to ensure our services are always-on. 
Customer Support and Professional Services
Our products are designed for ease of use and fast deployments. As part of our customer first strategy, we are focused on customer success and offer several programs to help our customers maximize their success with our products. These programs leverage the expertise and best practices that we have built while helping thousands of customers to adopt and deploy our products.
Customer Support and Training Services
We offer three tiers of support, each of which builds upon the previous tier. We provide 24/7 support for the highest support tiers as well as access to Customer Success and Technical Account Managers. We also provide on-demand access to a robust online digital community and customer success hub where customers can find answers to common use cases, information about product features, and interact with Okta experts and industry peers.
Professional Services
Our professional services team provides assistance to customers in the deployment of our Workforce Identity and Customer Identity Clouds and includes identity and security experts, customized deployment plans and SmartStart, which provides a quick path to implementation.
Okta Community
We have created the Okta Community, an online community available to all of our customers that enables them to connect with other customers and partners to ask questions and find answers.
Intellectual Property
We protect our intellectual property through a combination of trademarks, domain names, copyrights, trade secrets and patents, as well as contractual provisions and restrictions on access to our proprietary technology.
As of January 31, 2023, we had thirty-four issued patents in the United States, which expire between 2030 and 2039 and cover various aspects of our products. In addition, as of such date, we also had a number of patents granted around the world including twelve issued patents in Australia which expire between 2033 and 2037, seven issued patents in New Zealand which expire between 2034 and 2037, and nine issued European patents which have each been validated in Germany, France and Great Britain, with some also validated in Switzerland, Denmark, Spain, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden, and expire between 2033 and 2037.
We have registered “Okta” and "Auth0" as trademarks in many jurisdictions throughout the world to protect our brands. We also have filed other trademark applications pending in various jurisdictions throughout the world. We also have registered other trademarks in the United States including “Okta Workforce Identity Cloud,” “Okta Customer Identity Cloud,” “Okta WIC,” “Okta CIC,” “The World’s Identity Company,” "Okta Your Cloud, Covered," "Enterprise Identity, Delivered," "Work Outside the Perimeter," "Oktane" and "Never Build Auth Again." 
We are the registered holder of a variety of domestic and international domain names that include “Okta,” "Auth0" and similar variations. 
In addition to the protection provided by our intellectual property rights, we enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights or similar agreements with our employees, consultants and contractors. Our employees, consultants and contractors are also subject to invention assignment agreements. We further control the use of our proprietary technology and intellectual property through provisions in both general and product-specific terms of use.
Additional information regarding certain risks related to our intellectual property is included in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Our Competitors
The markets for our products are rapidly evolving, highly competitive and subject to shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new competing technologies. As the markets in which we operate continue to mature and new technologies and competitors enter those markets, we expect competition to intensify. Our competitor categories include: 
•Authentication providers; 
•Lifecycle Management providers;
•Multi-factor Authentication providers; 
•Infrastructure-as-a-service providers;
•Other customer identity and access management providers; and
•Solutions developed in-house by our potential customers.
We compete with both cloud-based and on-premise enterprise application software providers. Our competitors vary in size and in the breadth and scope of the products and services offered. However, certain of our competitors have substantial competitive advantages such as significantly greater financial, technical, sales and marketing, distribution, customer support or other resources, longer operating histories, greater resources to make strategic acquisitions and greater name recognition than we do. Our principal competitor is Microsoft.
Due to the flexibility and breadth of our platform, we can and often do co-exist alongside our competitors’ products within our customer base.
Principal competitive factors in our markets include flexibility, independence, product capabilities, total cost of ownership, time to value, scalability, user experience, number of pre-built integrations, customer satisfaction, global reach and ease of integration, management and use. We believe our product strategy, platform architecture, technology and independence as well as our company culture allow us to compete favorably on each of these factors.
We expect competition to increase as other established and emerging companies enter our markets, as customer requirements evolve, and as new products and technologies are introduced. We expect this to be particularly true as we are a cloud-based offering, and our competitors may also seek to acquire new offerings or repurpose their existing offerings to provide identity management solutions with subscription models. With the continuing merger and acquisition activity in the technology industry, particularly transactions involving security or identity and access management technologies, there is a greater likelihood that we will compete with other large technology companies in the future in both the workforce identity and customer identity markets. 
Additional information regarding our competition is included in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Human Capital Resources
Our core values – love our customers, never stop innovating, act with integrity, be transparent and empower our people – inform and guide our human capital initiatives and objectives. In order to continue to innovate and drive customer success, it is crucial that we continue to attract, develop and retain exceptional talent and balanced teams. To that end, we strive to make Okta a diverse and inclusive workplace, with opportunities for our employees to grow and develop in their careers, supported by fair and competitive compensation, benefits and wellness programs, and by initiatives that foster connections between and among our employees and their communities.
As of January 31, 2023, we had 6,013 employees, of which approximately 72% were in the United States and 28% were in our international locations. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good. Our employee engagement program helps us understand employee sentiment on a wide range of topics throughout the employee lifecycle, providing insights that inform our decisions about company initiatives, employee programs, talent risks, management opportunities and more. In fiscal 2023, 84% of our eligible employees participated in our annual employee engagement survey.
We encourage you to review the “Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging,” “Responsibility,” “Careers” and “Okta for Good” pages of our website at www.okta.com for more detailed information regarding our human capital programs and initiatives. Additional information on our diversity, inclusion and belonging strategy, diversity metrics and programs can be found in our most recent State of Inclusion at Okta annual report located on our website at www.okta.com/state-of-inclusion-at-okta, and additional information on our compensation, benefits and wellness programs is available on our Total Rewards website at rewards.okta.com. The information contained on, or that can be accessed through, our website is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
People First Philosophy
“Empower our people” is one of our core values. Our “People First” philosophy, in which culture, career growth, competitive rewards, flexible work and purpose come together, creates a shared sense of ownership in achieving our company vision. We want every employee to feel ownership of Okta.
Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging
We are committed to fostering a culture of inclusion and belonging, and to building a diverse workforce to drive innovation and collective growth, which we believe is critical to our success. In recent years, we have made deeper investments in our diversity, inclusion and belonging ("DIB") program at Okta. Our DIB initiatives – spearheaded by our DIB department and employee resource groups ("ERGs"), in partnership with various other teams – focus on DIB in our workforce, in our workplace and in the marketplace.
We employ inclusive recruitment and hiring practices to source diverse talent and mitigate potential bias throughout the hiring process. Our engagement with diversity sourcing programs and partnerships allows us to both source top talent from underrepresented groups for current open roles, and further strengthen our ability to build and nurture diverse talent communities for future roles. We also continue to recruit from a range of colleges and engage with organizations that support diverse students and jobseekers through our social impact arm, Okta for Good. 
Nurturing a culture of inclusion and belonging in our workplace is a key priority. We empower our employees to be authentic and grow through open conversations and engagement resources, including regular safe space DIB discussion forums and facilitated workshops, precise language and inclusive calibrations, personalized DIB learning tools, mentoring and workplace development programs focused on supporting talent from underrepresented communities, and sponsorship of ERGs that strengthen our DIB culture. We currently have an affinity group supporting neurodiversity and ERGs supporting women, people of color, veterans, the LGBTQIA+ community and parents and caregivers.
Growth and Development
We invest significant resources to develop talent and actively foster a learning culture where employees are empowered to drive their personal and professional growth. We provide our employees with a wide range of learning and development opportunities, including in-person, virtual, social and self-directed learning, mentoring, coaching and external development. We offer extensive onboarding and training programs through our internal learning initiative to prepare our employees at all levels for career progression and individual development. Our employee onboarding program helps our employees get off to the right start, our manager development program helps to build a solid foundation for our people managers, and our technical training program quickly brings our new technical employees up to speed on our product offerings.
Compensation, Benefits and Wellness
We provide robust compensation, benefits and wellness programs that help support the varying needs of our employees. In addition to market-competitive base pay, short-term bonus incentives and long-term equity incentives, our total rewards program offers comprehensive employee benefits that may vary by country/region, including an employee stock purchase plan, a 401(k) plan with company matching contributions, comprehensive medical, dental and vision insurance, life and disability insurance, health savings accounts, charitable donation matching, flexible time off, volunteer time off, gender-neutral paid parental leave, fertility and adoption support, family care resources, mobile and internet reimbursement, mental health and lifestyle support programs and a variety of other health and wellness resources. 
We are committed to fair compensation and opportunity in our workplace. We conduct regular equal pay assessments and adjust as needed to ensure our employees are paid equitably without regard to gender or ethnicity. 
Dynamic Work
We help our employees succeed by providing flexibility in where and how they work. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, we had introduced and began transitioning our workforce to a “Dynamic Work” framework, based on the premise that enabling our employees to work from anywhere can increase employee empowerment, satisfaction and productivity, drive efficiency and enable us to hire from a broader, more diverse pool of talent. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we accelerated our move to Dynamic Work to protect the health, safety and wellness of our employees.
Looking forward, we continue to focus on technologies and programs that create equity and build community across our dynamic workforce, including:
•Flexible benefit offerings that allow employee customization;
•Workplace solutions, such as coworking spaces, outside of our primary office locations that support our distributed teams; 
•A Dynamic Work Sustainability Guide to empower our employees to bring sustainability into their work environments, wherever they are based; and
•Curated experience programs that foster a sense of community both in-person and virtually.
Community and Social Impact
The mission of our social impact arm, Okta for Good, is to strengthen the connections between people, technology and community, which we believe fosters a more meaningful, fulfilling and enjoyable workplace. Our employees are passionate about many causes and Okta for Good connects them with numerous giving and volunteering opportunities in service of our communities. Okta for Good's core focus areas are:
•Developing technology for good ecosystems;
•Expanding economic opportunity and pathways into the technology sector;
•Supporting non-profits addressing critical needs in our global communities; and
•Empowering our employees to become changemakers. 
Through Okta for Good, which is a part of our company and not a separate legal entity, we donate and discount access to our service for non-profit organizations, who use Okta to make their teams more efficient, allowing them to focus on their important missions. Our employee volunteer program enables global team members to donate time to support charitable organizations worldwide. 
In addition, prior to our initial public offering ("IPO") in April 2017, we reserved 300,000 shares of our common stock to fund and support the operations of Okta for Good, of which 131,250 shares of Class A common stock remained reserved for future issuances as of January 31, 2023.

Sustainability
In fiscal 2021, we launched our Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) program. We established an oversight structure to provide strategic direction for our ESG program. Our ESG efforts are overseen by our executive leadership team and are reviewed by the nominating and corporate governance committee of our board of directors. Our ESG program covers issues relevant to our business under three categories: Protecting Our Customers, Investing in Our People and Supporting Our Communities.
We have set public commitments to climate targets. Our climate strategy to address emissions is currently aimed at energy consumption reduction, electrification, purchasing renewable energy and engaging with vendors to address their emissions. We have a renewable energy program, which matches our electricity consumption from our offices, our remote workforce and cloud services with renewable electricity. Additional information on our ESG programs and initiatives can be found in our “ESG Fact Sheet” on the “Responsibility” page of our website at www.okta.com.
