We have two wholly owned subsidiaries, AppYea Holdings, Inc., a South Dakota corporation and The Diagnostic Centers, Inc., a South Dakota corporation.

Our Current Business

We are a development stage company that was initially only engaged in the acquisition, purchase, and maintenance of mobile software applications (“apps”). Although we are still active in the mobile applications industry, we began investigating healthcare markets to augment the apps business in early 2017 and subsequently formed a wholly owned subsidiary The Diagnostic Centers, Inc. to focus on marketing certain products and services to healthcare providers.

On November 15, 2017, we entered into a distribution agreement with Cedar Creek Labs Series Two LLC (“LLC”) for the term of 1 year.

The Apps Business

We are a mobile application provider for iOS, Google Play, and Amazon platforms. We operate our own titles as well as provide strategic partnerships with promising mobile app developers. We recently acquired two kid friendly applications, “Duck Quest” and “Ball Bearing Racer” that are available in the in-app purchasing system for download, and a new app, Cheap RX, that you can immediately save money on prescriptions for the entire family.
Our Apps

Our company’s products include mobile applications. Our company acquires third party mobile applications (“apps”), in order to build a diverse portfolio of apps that will service a wide range of industries and consumers. Our company plans to acquire apps that are currently in development, as well as apps that are ready to be presented to the public. By purchasing existing apps, we aim to considerably cut the time to the market for introducing these apps. Our company intends to market and sell our acquired apps under our own name. Our company’s target customers vary widely, due to the numerous types of apps that are currently available. Below, our current business strategy and plan are detailed in an effort to explain the methods by which our company generates revenue in the apps industry.
Source Code Assets

On April 2, 2013 we acquired a mobile application that will help the millions of amusement and theme park visitors by providing them with accurate attraction wait times, ride information, theme park maps, hours of park operation, parade and show times, firework times, and much more in the palms of cell phone users’ hands.

On October 15, 2014, we acquired an automobile and the MySocial mobile application for $60,000. The purchase was satisfied through the issuance of a Promissory Note in an amount of $60,000. The MySocial mobile application is a social media application that will allow a user to share news, videos, and other information to various social media outlets.

Current Products and Revenue

Our company currently generates nominal revenues from paid downloads and advertisement integration. We currently use advertising integration in the free versions of our mobile applications that are downloaded by consumers. Advertisement integration has accounted for roughly five percent of our total revenues as of the date of this annual report. Our company plans to continue using advertisement integration in the free versions of our mobile apps. However, at the time of the initial download, or at any time after the initial download of our application, the consumer can choose to pay for the full application, at which time the advertisements are removed. Our company plans on generating future revenues from the purchase of underdeveloped mobile applications, application development and mobile application development consulting. There is currently no single customer or product that has accounted for a material portion of our revenues.
Management and Development Role

We intend to become a management company that focuses on the promotion, marketing, and sales of its acquired apps. We intend to obtain the services of specialized app marketing companies in order to become well positioned in online mobile app stores. In addition, our company believes that by properly marketing our apps, we will be able to increase downloads, lower the acquisition costs associated with the acquired apps, and expand our portfolio of apps for all current and future platforms.

Competition

The app development market is very competitive, with many companies developing apps worldwide. Also, it is possible that our business model may be duplicated in the future. However, at the current time we believe our system and business method of not only generating internal apps, but also continuously acquiring third party apps and app development companies will give us access to a large number of mobile apps, and while that will not decrease the amount of competitors in the industry, it will place us in a very competitive position, as we will have apps that function in a wide range of categories. Our ability to sell apps that operate in a wide range of categories will allow us to reach a large customer base, consisting of consumers who will purchase our mobile applications on app stores, which we believe will allow us to be successful and competitive, regardless of the number of other application development companies that compete in our industry.
Strategy

Structured as a mobile app acquisition and management company, our app business model is designed to provide an almost unlimited amount of apps that can be of use to a large amount of different consumer purchasers. We will sell our products to consumers in mobile application stores, and we will also hire third party marketing companies in order to reach a large number of potential consumer purchasers of our apps.
Compliance Approval

Our company does not require any government approval for our services. As a mobile application product provider, our business will not be subject to any environmental laws.
Compliance with Government Regulation

Our company will be subject to local and international laws and regulations that relate directly or indirectly to our operations. We will also be subject to common business and tax rules and regulations pertaining to the operation of our business. Our company believes that the effects of existing or probable governmental regulations will be additional responsibilities of our management to ensure that our company is in compliance with securities regulations as they apply to our company’s products as well as ensuring that our company does not infringe on any proprietary rights of others with respect to our products. Our company will also need to maintain accurate financial records in order to remain complaint with securities regulations as well as any corporate tax liability we incur.
Research and Development

We have incurred $Nil in research and development expenditures over the last two fiscal years.

Intellectual Property

Our company currently has no patents or trademarks on our brand name and we have not and do not intend to seek protection for our brand name or our mobile applications at this time; however, as business develops and operations continue, it may seek such protection. Despite efforts to protect our proprietary rights, such as our brand and service names, since we have no patent or trademark rights unauthorized persons may attempt to copy aspects of our company business, including our web site design, services, product information and sales mechanics or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Any encroachment upon our company’s proprietary information, including the unauthorized use of our brand name, the use of a similar name by a competing company or a lawsuit initiated against us for infringement upon another company’s proprietary information or improper use of their trademark, may affect our ability to create brand name recognition, cause customer confusion and/or have a detrimental effect on our business. Litigation or proceedings before the U.S. or International Patent and Trademark Offices may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets and domain name and/or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Any such litigation or adverse proceeding could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could seriously harm our business operations and/or results of operations.

Our company does not currently have any licenses to use any third-party intellectual property.

Healthcare Products and Services

After investigating the healthcare markets in early 2017, it was determined that the market conditions were right for our entry into blood lab, toxicology and genetic testing service industry, with a focus on marketing services using third party providers. In our investigation we found that most patients are frustrated as to the time it takes to get lab results back, especially when the diagnosis is dependent on these results.

Our vision is to become the leading marketing and service company in the industry. Now that is a bold statement and how do we get there. People want results. People also want answers quicker especially when it comes to their wellbeing. Our strategy is to work as a liaison between the Doctor and the lab itself. By developing strong personal relationships with these groups.

The diagnostic information service provider market is estimated by Forbes to be a $55Billion worldwide market.

The primary customers for these diagnostic information services are: 

Hospitals | Hospitals generally maintain an on-site laboratory to perform the significant majority of clinical testing for their patients and refer esoteric testing to outside service providers. They are continuing to come under pricing pressure to outsource more of their basic testing based on the growing efficiency of outside labs.
---------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Physicians | Independent physician offices that provide a more fully stocked portfolio of care 
Clinicians | Clinicians, including both primary care physicians and specialists, requiring diagnostic information services for patients are the primary referral source of our services. Clinicians determine which laboratory to recommend or use based on a variety of factors 
Employers | Employers use tests for drugs of abuse to determine an individual’s employability and his or her “fitness for duty.” Companies with high employee turnover, safety conscious environments or regulatory testing requirements provide the highest volumes of testing. 
State & Federal Government | Entities such as prisons, hospitals, hospices and/or psychiatric wards that are funded by state or federal agencies. 
ACOs and IDNs | An ACO is a network of providers and facilities that share financial risk in providing or arranging for the provision of healthcare. An IDN is a network of providers and facilities working together in providing or arranging for the provision of healthcare. 

Competitive Environment

The diagnostic information service industry is a very fractured market with 2 primary Companies with leading market share. These two Companies (Quest and Lab Corp) have grown through a roll-up strategy that has propelled them to the size they are today. Since these larger providers are so focused on improving operational efficiencies from the myriad of acquired smaller providers, we believe that we can capitalize on this lack of focus on the end-user customer by these larger players, which gives us a powerful opportunity to make its mark quickly. Additionally, a quarter of the market is served by 5000 other small players. This is also an opportunity for us to capitalize on an opportunity to gather new customers who likely have very little loyalty to their current provider.

The Company’s initial primary diagnostic information service provider is the Diagnostic Group, LLC which owns and manages labs in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. Their lab is an advanced state of the art blood, toxicology and genetic testing laboratory located just outside of the DFW Metroplex in Southlake, TX – and serving customers on a national basis. Their team is comprised of innovative leaders with a combined 35 years of experience in the medical and healthcare industries that have identified a need for superior laboratory services.
