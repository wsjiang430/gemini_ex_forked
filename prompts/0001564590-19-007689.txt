We believe our wealth management business differentiates us from our competition and adds significant value. We intend to grow this business further both in and around our market areas through our Delaware Trust subsidiary; through our existing wealth, loan and depository client base; through our innovative private banking service model, which utilizes private bankers working together to provide fully integrated client solutions; and through potential acquisitions of complimentary and/or additive wealth management businesses. Throughout the wealth management division and all other business lines, we will continue to provide the unparalleled personalized, high-touch service our valued clients have come to expect.
 Our Markets
 Our current market is defined as the NY-NJ-PA metropolitan statistical area. Our primary market areas are located in New Jersey and areas of New York. New Jersey had a total population exceeding 8.9 million and a median household income of $76,475 as of 2013-2017, compared to the U.S. median household income of $57,652 as of 2013-2017, according to estimates from the United States Census Bureau. Somerset County, where we are headquartered, is among one of the wealthiest in New Jersey, with a 2013-2017 median household income of $106,046 according to estimates from the United States Census Bureau. We believe that these markets have economic and competitive dynamics that are consistent with our objectives and favorable to executing our growth strategy.
Competition
 We operate in a market area with a high concentration of banking and financial institutions and we face substantial competition in attracting deposits and in originating loans and leases. A number of our competitors are significantly larger institutions with greater financial and managerial resources and lending limits.  Our ability to compete successfully is a significant factor affecting our growth potential and profitability.
 Our competition for deposits, loans and leases historically has come from other insured financial institutions such as local and regional commercial banks, savings institutions, leasing companies and credit unions located in our primary market area.  We also compete with mortgage banking and finance companies for real estate loans and with commercial banks and savings institutions for consumer loans.
 The Company also faces direct competition for wealth and advisory services from registered investment advisory firms and investment management companies.
 Our Business Strategy
 We implemented our Strategic Plan – Expanding Our Reach – in early 2013.  At that time, we recognized three industry headwinds, the Plan would help address.
  
• | that the low interest rate and tight spread environment would likely continue;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | that costs associated with compliance and risk management would increase significantly; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | that our clients would continue to shift from traditional branches in favor of electronic delivery channels.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The key elements of our business strategy include:
  
• | a robust wealth management business that provides a diversified and relatively predictable and stable source of revenue over time, with growth organically and through strategic acquisitions;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a focus on commercial banking with private bankers focused on providing high touch client service through an advice based approach encompassing corporate and industrial (C&I) lending (including equipment finance lending and leasing), wealth management, depository services, electronic banking, SBA and other commercial real estate lending, and corporate advisory services;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a highly efficient branch network and deposit gathering processes;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | robust risk management processes, including, but not limited to, active loan portfolio, capital, liquidity, and interest rate risk stress testing;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a focus on the community and community service and involvement.

Governmental Policies and Legislation
 The banking industry is highly regulated.  Statutory and regulatory controls increase a bank holding company’s cost of doing business and limit the options of its management to deploy assets and maximize income.  Proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the operations and taxation of banks, bank holding companies and other financial institutions are frequently made in Congress, in state legislatures and before various bank regulatory agencies.  The likelihood of any major changes and the impact such changes might have on the Company or the Bank is impossible to predict.  The following description is not intended to be complete and is qualified in its entirety to applicable laws and regulations.
Bank Regulation
 As a New Jersey-chartered commercial bank, the Bank is subject to the regulation, supervision, and examination of the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance (“NJDOBI”).  As a Federal Reserve-member bank, the Bank is also subject to the regulation, supervision and examination of the Federal Reserve Board (“FRB”) as its primary federal regulator. The regulations of the FRB and the NJDOBI impact virtually all of our activities, including the minimum level of capital we must maintain, our ability to pay dividends, our ability to expand through new branches or acquisitions and various other matters. 
Investment Advisory Regulations
 In addition to the Bank’s Private Wealth Management Division, we offer wealth management services through two subsidiaries of the Bank. These subsidiaries are registered investment advisers under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, and as such are supervised by the SEC. They are also subject to various other federal laws and state licensing and/or registration requirements. These laws and regulations generally grant supervisory agencies broad administrative powers, including the power to limit or restrict the carrying on of business for failure to comply with such laws.
Holding Company Supervision
 The Company is a bank holding company within the meaning of the Holding Company Act. As a bank holding company, the Company is supervised by the FRB and is required to file reports with the FRB and provide such additional information as the FRB may require.
 The Holding Company Act prohibits the Company, with certain exceptions, from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than five percent of the voting shares of any company which is not a bank and from engaging in any business other than that of banking, managing and controlling banks or furnishing services to subsidiary banks, except that it may, upon application, engage in, and may own shares of companies engaged in, certain businesses found by the FRB to be so closely related to banking “as to be a proper incident thereto.” The Holding Company Act requires prior approval by the FRB of the acquisition by the Company of more than five percent of the voting stock of any additional bank. Satisfactory capital ratios, Community Reinvestment Act ratings and anti-money laundering policies are generally prerequisites to obtaining federal regulatory approval to make acquisitions. The policy of the FRB provides that a bank holding company is expected to act as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support the subsidiary bank in circumstances in which it might not do so absent that policy. Acquisitions through the Bank require the approval of the FRB and the NJDOBI.

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Report and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) significantly changed bank regulation and has affected the lending, investment, trading and operating activities of depository institutions and their holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act also created a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”) with extensive powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws.  The CFPB has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions, including the authority to prohibit “unfair, deceptive or abusive” acts and practices.  The CFPB also has examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than $10 billion in assets.  Banks and savings institutions with $10 billion or less in assets, such as the Bank, continue to be examined by their applicable federal bank regulators.  The Dodd-Frank Act required the CFPB to issue regulations requiring lenders to make a reasonable good faith determination as to a prospective borrower’s ability to repay a residential mortgage loan.  The final “Ability to Repay” rules, which were effective beginning January 2014, established a “qualified mortgage” safe harbor for loans whose terms and features are deemed to make the loan less risky.
The CFPB may issue additional final rules regarding mortgages in the future, including amendments to certain mortgage servicing rules regarding forced-placed insurance notices, policies and procedures and other matters.  We cannot ensure you that existing or future regulations will not have a material adverse impact on our residential mortgage loan business.  
 To the extent the Dodd-Frank Act remains in place or is not materially amended it is likely to continue to affect our cost of doing business, limit our permissible activities, and affect the competitive balance within our industry and market areas. 
 The Economic Growth Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act of 2018 (the “Relief Act”) modified certain aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act to relieve regulatory burden.  In particular, the legislation exempted banks with less than $10 billion of assets from the ability to repay requirements for certain qualified residential mortgage loans held in portfolio.
 Capital Requirements
 Pursuant to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (“FDICIA”), each federal banking agency has promulgated regulations, specifying the levels at which a financial institution would be considered “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized,” or “critically undercapitalized,” and to take certain mandatory and discretionary supervisory actions based on the capital level of the institution.
 FRB regulations require member banks to meet several minimum capital standards:  a common equity Tier 1 (“CET1”) capital to risk-based assets ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 6.0%, a total capital to risk-based assets of 8%, and a 4% Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio.  The present capital requirements were effective January 1, 2015 and represent increased standards over the previous requirements.  The current requirements implement recommendations of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain requirements of federal law.
 The capital standards require the maintenance of CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, 6% and 8%, respectively, and a leverage ratio of at least 4% Tier 1 capital.  CET1 capital is generally defined as common stockholders’ equity and retained earnings.  Tier 1 capital is generally defined as CET1 and additional Tier 1 capital.  Additional Tier 1 capital includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries.  Total capital includes Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital.  Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus, meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt.

As fully phased in on January 1, 2019, the capital requirements also require the Company and the Bank to maintain a 2.5% “capital conservation buffer,” composed entirely of CET1, on top of the minimum risk-weighted asset ratios, effectively resulting in minimum ratios of (i) CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7.0%, (ii) Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.5%, and (iii) total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 10.5%. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a ratio of (i) CET1 to risk-weighted assets, (ii) Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets or (iii) total capital to risk-weighted assets above the respective minimum but below the capital conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers based on the amount of the shortfall. 
 Under current capital standards, the effects of accumulated other comprehensive income items included in capital are excluded for the purposes of determining regulatory capital ratios. Under the Basel Rules, the effects of certain accumulated other comprehensive items are not excluded; however, non-advanced approaches banking organizations, including the Company and the Bank, may make a one-time permanent election to continue to exclude these items effective as of January 1, 2015. This election was made by the Company.  
 Federal law requires that federal bank regulatory authorities take “prompt corrective action” with respect to institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. The FRB has adopted regulations to implement the prompt corrective action legislation. The regulations were amended to incorporate the previously mentioned increased regulatory capital standards that were effective January 1, 2015.  An institution is deemed to be “well capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater and a CET1 ratio of 6.5% or greater. An institution is “adequately capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of 4.0% or greater and a CET1 ratio of 4.5% or greater. An institution is “undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a leverage ratio of less than 4.0% or a CET1 ratio of less than 4.5%. An institution is deemed to be “significantly undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0%, a leverage ratio of less than 3.0% or a CET1 ratio of less than 3.0%. An institution is considered to be “critically undercapitalized” if it has a ratio of tangible equity (as defined in the regulations) to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0%.
 The Bank’s capital ratios were all above the minimum levels required for it to be considered a “well capitalized” financial institution at December 31, 2018 under the “prompt corrective action” regulations in effect as of such date.  
 The Regulatory Relief Act required that the federal banking agencies, including the FRB, to establish a “community bank leverage ratio” of between 8-10% of average total consolidated assets for qualifying institutions with less than $10 billion of assets.  Institutions with tangible equity (subject to certain adjustments) meeting the specified level and electing to follow the alternative framework would be deemed to comply with the applicable regulatory capital requirements, including the risk-based requirements, and be considered to be “well-capitalized.”  The agencies have issued a proposed rule that would set the “community bank leverage ratio” at 9%.
 Insurance Funds Legislation
 The Bank’s deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC. Under the FDIC’s risk-based system, insured institutions are assigned to one of four risk categories based on supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels and certain other factors with less risky institutions paying lower assessments on their deposits.
 Effective July 1, 2016, the FDIC adopted changes that eliminated the risk categories. Assessments for institutions are now based on financial measures and supervisory ratings derived from statistical modeling estimating the probability of failure within three years. In conjunction with the Deposit Insurance Fund's reserve ratio achieving 1.15%, the assessment range (inclusive of possible adjustments) was reduced for insured institutions of less than $10 billion in total assets to a range of 1.5 basis points to 30 basis points.  In conjunction with the reserve ratio achieving 1.35%, the FDIC announced that institutions with less than $10 billion of assets would be receiving certain assessment credits for the portion of assessments paid to help the ratio raise from 1.15% to 1.35%.  Such credits will commence when the ratio reaches 1.38%.
 Restrictions on the Payment of Dividends
 The holders of the Company’s common stock are entitled to receive dividends, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors of the Company out of funds legally available. The only statutory limitation is that such dividends may not be paid when the Company is insolvent. Since the principal source of income for the Company will be dividends on Bank 
 8


common stock paid to the Company by the Bank, the Company’s ability to pay dividends to its shareholders will depend on whether the Bank pays dividends to it. As a practical matter, restrictions on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends act as restrictions on the amount of funds available for the payment of dividends by the Company. As a New Jersey chartered commercial bank, the Bank is subject to the restrictions on the payment of dividends contained in the New Jersey Banking Act of 1948, as amended (the “Banking Act”). Under the Banking Act, the Bank may pay dividends only out of retained earnings, and out of surplus to the extent that surplus exceeds 50% of stated capital. Under the Financial Institutions Supervisory Act, the FDIC has the authority to prohibit a state-chartered bank from engaging in conduct that, in the FDIC’s opinion, constitutes an unsafe or unsound banking practice. Under certain circumstances, the FDIC could claim that the payment of a dividend or other distribution by the Bank to the Company constitutes an unsafe or unsound practice. The Company is also subject to FRB policies, which may, in certain circumstances, limit its ability to pay dividends. The FRB policies require, among other things, that a bank holding company maintain a minimum capital base and serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary bank. The FRB by supervisory letters has advised holding corporations that it is has supervisory concerns when the level of dividends is too high and would seek to prevent dividends if the dividends paid by the holding company exceeded its earnings. The FRB would most likely seek to prohibit any dividend payment that would reduce a holding company’s capital below these minimum amounts.  In addition, the FRB staff has recently begun interpreting its regulatory capital regulations to require holding companies to receive FRB approval prior to any repurchases or redemptions of its common shares.
 Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 was enacted to address, among other issues, corporate governance, auditing and accounting, executive compensation, and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information. We have existing policies, procedures and systems designed to comply with these regulations.
