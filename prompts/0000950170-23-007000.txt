 Overview
We are a leading digital medicine company, pioneering the development of cognitive treatments through game-changing technologies. Our approach of developing and commercializing technologies designed to directly target the physiology of the brain has established a new category of medicine—medicine that is validated through clinical trials like a drug or medical device, but experienced like entertainment.
 Impairments in cognition are associated with many different chronic diseases and acute illnesses, impacting approximately 85 million people in the U.S. These impairments include, but are not limited to attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder (“ADHD”), autism spectrum disorder (“ASD”), multiple sclerosis (“MS”), major depressive disorder (“MDD”), post-traumatic stress disorder (“PTSD”), cognitive impairments in COVID-19 survivors (“COVID fog”), traumatic brain injury (“TBI”), cancer-related cognitive impairment (“CRCI”) and Alzheimer’s Disease, among others. Global recognition of cognitive function by physicians and patients is at an all-time high, yet many current treatment approaches are inadequate, as they are either unable to effectively target the brain to address underlying impairments or lack clinical validation. Existing clinically-validated treatments for these indications are largely comprised of drugs, many of which have side effects that are intolerable or worrisome to patients and families. For example, the safety profile of ADHD drugs and lack of options to specifically address inattention creates a very high unmet need. Current ADHD treatment approaches are limited to traditional medications, lack precision, largely only treat symptoms, and are often accompanied by side effects that may include growth suppression, appetite suppression, weight issues, sleep issues and abdominal pain.
 Our vision is to change this treatment paradigm with our development of the first digital prescription treatment to improve cognition across diseases, developed through a unique collaboration of cognitive neuroscientists and entertainment and technology designers.
Until now, digital therapeutics have consisted of tools and technology used to deliver existing medical processes, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, through accessible and easy-to-use mobile applications. Our platform represents a fundamental paradigm shift where technology is the medicine itself, designed to target neural networks critical to cognitive function. We aim to evolve the field of digital health applications into clinically-validated treatments for cognitive functions that are designed to be indistinguishable from high-end entertainment experiences.
 With this approach, we introduced EndeavorRx, the first prescription video game treatment (and first digital treatment for a cognitive impairment) reviewed and granted marketing authorization by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) in June 2020, as a Class II medical device through the FDA’s de novo process that reviews both safety and efficacy. EndeavorRx is indicated for use to improve attention function for children ages 8-12 years old with primarily inattentive or combined-type ADHD, who have a demonstrated attention issue. In June 2020, EndeavorRx also received Conformité Européenne (“CE”) Mark certification as a prescription-only digital therapeutic software intended for the treatment of attention and inhibitory control deficits in pediatric patients with ADHD, enabling EndeavorRx to be marketed in European Economic Area (“EEA”) member countries. EndeavorRx should be considered for use as part of a therapeutic program that may include clinician-directed therapy, medication and/or educational programs, which further address symptoms of the disorder. It is not intended to be used as a stand-alone therapeutic and is not a substitution for a child’s medication.
We built EndeavorRx using our most advanced therapeutic engine, our selective stimulus management engine (“SSME”) mechanism of action. SSME has been evaluated in clinical trials in adolescent and adult ADHD populations. In January 2023, we announced top-line results from STARS-ADHD-Adolescents, our pivotal trial of AKL-T01 (marketed and branded as EndeavorRx in the U.S.) in adolescents ages 13-17 with ADHD. The STARS-ADHD-Adolescents trial enrolled 162 patients, and we plan to present full data from this study at a future medical meeting. We also plan to use the STARS-ADHD-Adolescents study data in our regulatory submission to FDA in 2023 to seek an expanded label for EndeavorRx. Based on the strong clinical data from the STARS-ADHD-Adolescents study and our desire to preserve capital, in January 2023 we also disclosed that we had discontinued recruitment of STARS-ADHD-Adults, the pivotal trial of AKL-T01 in adults with ADHD in order to analyze the trial data. The STARS-ADHD-Adults trial enrolled 223 patients, and data analysis for that adult study is ongoing.
Within ADHD, there is a large and growing opportunity for innovative non-drug treatments. Current ADHD treatment options represent a $10 billion market with over 70 million prescriptions written every year for drugs in the U.S. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly half the pediatric ADHD population uses behavioral therapy as well. However,

the current standard of care for ADHD has been unchanged for several decades, despite continued negative outcomes across a range of functional domains (e.g., home, school, work, health) and poor long-term prognosis for patients with ADHD. For example, patients with ADHD continue to be at increased risk for lower educational achievement, poorer vocational advancement, and a range of adverse health outcomes including early mortality compared to non-diagnosed individuals. The total ADHD population in the U.S. is 10.8 million and our initial target population includes those with inattentive or combined type ADHD, or 8.1 million of the total U.S. ADHD population. EndeavorRx is currently cleared in the U.S. to treat patients in the 8-12 age group, which represent approximately 22% (1.8 million) of our target 8.1 million ADHD population.
In the third quarter of 2022, we executed the first phase of our commercial launch of EndeavorRx using a commercial model we purpose-built for digital therapeutics, deploying the first wave of our go-to-market field sales force in 13 priority territories (and one inside sales representative covering inbound inquiries from unoccupied territories) across the United States, with a focus on integrated behavioral health centers and pediatric providers. As of the end of 2022, growth in sales-occupied territories has outperformed unoccupied geographies in overall prescription growth, overall number of active prescribers and the number of prescriptions per prescriber. Based on these early results, we are expanding our sales force and expect to be in approximately 15 additional U.S. territories by the end of the first quarter of 2023.
 Within this market we face competition from a range of companies. Our competitors include both enterprise companies who are focused on or may enter the healthcare industry, including initiatives and partnerships launched by these large companies, and from private companies that offer solutions for specific chronic conditions. We compete with companies that are developing treatments for cognitive impairment associated with ADHD and other diseases and disorders resulting in cognitive impairment. In the digital health space, we compete with companies that have created non-regulated products to treat cognitive impairment.
 In January 2023, we restructured our business to preserve capital and focus primarily on commercializing EndeavorRx in ADHD and seeking a label expansion for EndeavorRx in ADHD patients. This resulted in the reprioritization of our pipeline of preclinical and clinical development programs and a reduction of our workforce by approximately 30% across different areas and functions. In addition to our ADHD label expansion programs, our current pipeline of preclinical and clinical development programs includes previously launched investigator initiated and collaborative studies, including our two studies of EndeavorRx to treat cognitive impairments in patients following COVID infection, a collaborative study for cognitive monitoring in a healthy aging population and investigator initiated studies of post-operative cognitive dysfunction and of chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment. Other development programs have been deprioritized and will be evaluated in connection with Akili’s capital raising and business development activities.
 Our Proprietary Approach
Our platform is powered by proprietary therapeutic engines, which are software and associated algorithms that form the core of our products and product candidates, designed to target cognitive impairment at its source in the brain, informed by decades of research (including research conducted prior to the founding of Akili) and validated through rigorous clinical programs. Our most advanced therapeutic engine, SSME, presents specific sensory stimuli and simultaneous motor challenges designed to target the fronto-parietal cortex which plays a key role in attention function, while our earlier stage therapeutic engines also focus on cognitive functions, including spatial navigation, memory, and planning and organization. Each product and product candidate embodies a specific proprietary therapeutic engine with a variation of the video game-like user interface in an effort to optimize user engagement applicable to a particular disease or medical condition indication. Product candidates are clinically tested in development programs for particular disease or medical condition indications.
These products and product candidates are characterized by these key attributes:
•Targeted treatments that are personalized to patients’ needs. Delivered through closed-loop adaptive algorithms, the technology continuously learns and adapts based on a patient’s use of and progress in the treatment, which enables the delivery of tailored and personalized experiences that automatically adjust to each individual’s therapeutic needs. Our technologies provide direct access to a de-identified, aggregate level view of each patient’s activity, informing our product development. The therapeutics’ mechanics, algorithms and designs are protected by patents, trade secrets and copyrights, combining protections typically seen in both the medicine and technology industries to create a robust intellectual property portfolio. 
 •Clinically validated like drugs and medical devices. Our therapeutics have been studied in more than 20 clinical trials involving more than 2,600 patients across nine disease populations, including large prospective, randomized controlled trials. In SSME, for instance, we have conducted five different clinical studies in children with ADHD, which collectively demonstrated the technology’s ability to improve objective measures and caregiver observations of attention function. These results were further validated by visible changes in the brain’s activity seen in clinical studies using electroencephalogram (“EEG”) imaging. Results of our clinical studies have been published in 16 leading peer-reviewed scientific journals, including The American Journal of Psychiatry, The Lancet Digital Health and Nature: Digital Medicine. 


•Therapeutics that are experienced as entertainment. We are blending medicine with entertainment and creating patient experiences like never before. Our treatments look and feel like high-quality video games. They change over time, incorporate rewards and increase challenges in ways that feel natural to patients. Enabled by the adaptive ability of digital therapeutics and the dynamic nature of video games, and informed by extensive data infrastructure, we believe we can rapidly iterate our products to enhance patient enjoyment and engagement, encouraging compliance with the treatment plan. Our ability to rapidly create unique user experiences also allows us to adapt the experience to appeal to different patient populations by developing and testing product candidates in clinical trials. We believe we have the potential to offer the first treatments that both rival the experience of consumer entertainment products and can be utilized as part of a treatment plan.
 •Patient focused and adaptive. We are relentlessly focused on our patients and caregivers and have developed a platform and infrastructure that allows us to quickly and continuously refine and optimize based on their feedback. Our products are widely accessible, are personalized and adaptable, and generate rich data caregivers can use to foster meaningful conversations with patients and their health care providers, such as EndeavorRx gameplay data provided to caregivers via our EndeavorRx Insight app. With data from our platform and feedback from caregivers and patients, we have released multiple enhancements to our product’s gameplay, established patient connectivity via telemedicine and changed our fulfillment system to better meet their needs. 
 This same technology platform also has potential applications beyond the treatment of cognitive impairments, with the potential to measure and monitor cognitive functioning. As we work towards improving cognitive impairments in patients at scale, the ability to measure cognitive function is critical. Today, cognition is typically only assessed in response to a specific patient complaint, and there is no consistent approach for this measurement. Clinical studies have shown our platform’s potential to act as a sensitive cognitive measure that correlates with well-known in-person or paper-based cognitive measurements.
EndeavorRx®: The first prescription video game treatment
In June 2020, EndeavorRx, the first product built on the Akili platform, was granted marketing authorization and classified as a Class II medical device by the FDA through FDA’s de novo process, which reviews both safety and efficacy of new treatments. EndeavorRx is indicated for use to improve attention function for children ages 8-12 with primarily inattentive or combined-type ADHD, who have a demonstrated attention issue. EndeavorRx represents a fundamental paradigm shift in the treatment of cognitive disorders, where technology is not just delivering a therapy but is itself the medicine: EndeavorRx was the first game-based therapeutic granted marketing authorization by the FDA.
 EndeavorRx is the only FDA-authorized prescription video game-based treatment designed to directly target cognitive functioning. For the first time, licensed health care providers have a treatment option that is purpose-built to target cognitive function and that is not taken as a pill, but delivered through a video game. EndeavorRx also obtained Conformité Européenne (CE) Mark certification in pediatric patients with ADHD, enabling EndeavorRx to be marketed in European Economic Area (EEA) member countries.
 EndeavorRx Commercial Launch
In the third quarter of 2022, we executed the first phase of our commercial launch of EndeavorRx using a commercial model we purpose-built for digital therapeutics, deploying the first wave of our go-to-market field sales force in 13 priority territories (and one inside sales representative covering inbound inquiries from unoccupied territories) across the United States, with a focus on integrated behavioral health centers and pediatric providers. As of the end of 2022, growth in sales-occupied territories has outperformed unoccupied geographies in overall prescription growth, overall number of active prescribers and the number of prescriptions per prescriber. Based on these early results, we are expanding our sales force and expect to be in approximately 15 additional U.S. territories by the end of the first quarter of 2023.
 Our commercial model has important levers that go beyond the traditional therapeutic model. Because we are building the model from the ground up, we have the ability to use the extensive data collected through our platform, not just to rapidly iterate our products, but to tailor the entire delivery system for our products. We are leveraging a fully digital process, from prescription to fulfillment to treatment, creating unparalleled optimization of the end-to-end patient experience and potentially enabling higher conversion, better compliance and optimal treatment. Our digital process includes features like a personalized customer support program, Akili Assist, which is designed to help our Health Care Providers (“HCPs”) and caregivers learn more about Akili and our products. Akili Assist representatives can be reached via email, phone and chat. With a commitment to experimenting, testing and learning, we have piloted several initiatives to understand promotional levers for our products and to prioritize the successful commercialization of EndeavorRx. Our commercial model is supported by the learnings and experience we gained from our pre-launch of EndeavorRx, which demonstrated strong business fundamentals such as conversion rates, refill rates and breadth and depth of prescribing.

We are utilizing our field sales force and medical science liaisons to train and educate HCPs on how to incorporate EndeavorRx in their treatment regimens while simultaneously supporting a consumer-driven model through our engagement with parents of children with ADHD, including through social media campaigns. Our approach prioritizes expanding access to EndeavorRx for families through our efforts with payers, while ensuring a path is available for self-pay.
 Our Clinical Pipeline
Our therapeutic engines are designed to target cognitive functions with the potential to address multiple medical conditions presenting the same functional cognitive impairments.
As announced in January 2023 and as shown in the updated pipeline chart included below, there are several updates to our pipeline as part of our approved 2023 operating plan and clinical pipeline reprioritization.
 
Based on unmet need and potential market opportunities our clinical pipeline is currently focused on pediatric, adolescent, and adult ADHD. We are currently analyzing data from the following two Akili-sponsored studies:
 •STARS-ADHD-Adolescents, a pivotal study of AKL-T01 (marketed and branded as EndeavorRx in the U.S.) in adolescents ages 13-17 with ADHD. This study completed enrollment in the fourth quarter of 2022 with 162 patients and top-line results were reported in January 2023. Full results are expected to be presented/published in scientific outlets later in 2023.
 •STARS-ADHD-Adults, a pivotal study of AKL-T01 in adults with ADHD. Enrollment for this study was discontinued early with 223 patients to analyze data, and data analysis for this adult study is ongoing. This decision was made on the basis of the positive STARS-ADHD-Adolescents data previously announced and our desire to preserve capital. Full results are expected to be presented/published in scientific outlets later in 2023.
 The following study is being conducted by one of our partners and is in progress:
•A pivotal study in pediatric ADHD in Japan by Shionogi & Co., Ltd (“Shionogi”). 
 The following study is being conducted by one of our partners and is in the planning stages:
•A proof of concept study in early childhood (3-8 year olds) ADHD by TALi Digital Limited (“TALi”). 
 In addition to our priority focus on advancing our products across the lifespan in ADHD, clinical studies are ongoing or completed in a number of other indications in which cognitive dysfunction plays an important role.
Two collaborative research studies are being conducted to evaluate the effects of our product in patients with cognitive dysfunction following recent COVID-19 infection at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and Cornell Weill School of Medicine/New York Presbyterian Hospital. Results are expected to be announced in the first half of 2023.
 We are also continuing to explore the application of our products and technology to other clinical areas.


•An additional collaborative study is being conducted for cognitive monitoring in a healthy aging population.
 Investigator-initiated studies that are currently being conducted include:
•A study of post-operative cognitive dysfunction by Vanderbilt University Medical Center. 
 •A study of chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment by the University of California San Francisco (“UCSF”). 
 We have also published clinical studies involving other populations with demonstrated cognitive challenges, including major depressive disorder, autism spectrum disorder, multiple sclerosis, lupus, and traumatic brain injury. We are currently evaluating our strategy for advancing our product candidates for these and other indications.
 We expect our model to be scalable and repeatable.
With our platform and business model, we believe we have created a set of capabilities and infrastructure that can be applied, again and again, with increased efficiency over time, creating a competitive advantage for Akili.
From technology sourcing through regulatory authorization and commercial growth, Akili is the first to take these types of innovative technologies that target brain function and bring them through every step of the product development, regulatory clearance/approval and commercialization process. We have built the first platform uniquely designed to leverage these physiologically-targeting digital therapeutics, which we believe could be used to support future products and enable us to be a preferred acquirer of these types of technologies as the field of physiologically-targeting digital therapeutics grows.
We meet patients on their own terms.
We believe that we are the first to create a prescribed treatment product that is delivered in a way that feels like high-quality entertainment and designed in a way that fits seamlessly into people’s lives.
With the aims of developing relationships with caregivers and patients that rival that of successful consumer companies, we have created a patient-adaptive model. Our products meet patients on their own terms and engage them in their care. Our products are widely accessible, are personalized and automatically adaptable and generate rich data that caregivers and patients can use to foster meaningful conversations with their health care providers. Caregivers and patients are also our collaborators in product design. We collect ongoing data and feedback through gameplay data, playtesting, workshops and research and refine, adapt and optimize both our products and our communications based on our learnings. Their valuable feedback has led us to add more choices during gameplay, including new quests, new creatures and costumes, and the ability for children to build their own universes.
Our hope is that, in the moment, patients forget that they are being treated with a therapeutic. In our work to fully realize the promise of digital therapeutics, we are just beginning to scratch the surface of what is possible as we develop experiences that capture the imagination and are akin to the best entertainment products.
About Akili
We were founded in 2011 with a vision of creating safe and effective cognitive medicine that is enjoyable for patients to use, and we have since been pioneering the development of game-changing technologies with the potential to change the world’s perception of medicine.
We provide robust compensation and benefits programs to help meet the needs of our employees, and to recruit, retain, and reward our existing and new employees. The principal purposes of our equity and cash incentive plans are to attract, retain and reward personnel, whether existing employees or new hires, through the granting of stock-based and cash-based compensation, salary and bonus awards. We believe that this increases value to our stockholders and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives. Our benefits programs also include a 401(k) plan, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, donation matching and flexible work schedules and work locations, among others.
Because the success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being of our employees, we are committed to their health, safety and wellness. We provide our employees and their families with access to a variety of innovative, flexible and convenient health and wellness programs, including benefits that: provide peace of mind concerning events that may require time away from work or that impact their financial well-being; support their physical and mental health by providing tools and resources to help them improve or maintain their health status and encourage engagement in healthy behaviors; and offer choice where possible so they can customize their benefits to meet their and their families’ needs. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best interests of our employees and our operational communities, and to comply with government regulations. These include permitting employees to work from home and

implementing additional safety measures for any employees on-site, and we plan to continue these programs for the foreseeable future.
Our facilities
We lease our corporate headquarters in Boston, Massachusetts where we occupy approximately 4,000 square feet pursuant to a lease that expires in December 2023. We also lease approximately 43,600 square feet of office space in Larkspur, California pursuant to a lease that expires in November 2026. We believe that our facilities are sufficient to meet our current needs and that suitable additional space will be available as and when needed.
 Our Strategy
Direct targeting of the brain’s physiology to improve neural functions is nascent but an area poised for growth in medicine as tens of millions of people worldwide live with cognitive and other brain health issues and many are actively searching for solutions. The growing global recognition of this unmet need comes at a time when patients are increasingly taking control of their own health and looking for medical products to fit into their lives and look and feel like consumer products. We believe we are uniquely positioned to capitalize on this opportunity, with our technologies designed to directly target the brain and delivered through high-end video game interfaces.
Establishing a commercial foothold in pediatric ADHD
Pediatric ADHD is our initial target market, which has a high-unmet need population, as well as families who are unsatisfied with current treatment and are looking for new options. Traditional ADHD drugs have shown side effects including growth suppression, appetite suppression, weight issues, sleep issues and abdominal pain. Many children with ADHD are not currently on or well-controlled by medication, and more than half of them have tried, are trying or plan to try non-pharmacological treatments. EndeavorRx’s safety profile provides a significant advantage over traditional therapeutics as no serious side effects have been associated with its use. However, EndeavorRx should be used as part of an overall treatment regimen and is not intended to substitute for a child’s medication. Our initial targeted market of pediatric ADHD with our flagship product will also allow us to introduce this new type of treatment to a large patient population, building awareness and relationships on which we can build for future products.
Additionally within ADHD, there is a large and growing opportunity for innovative non-drug treatments. This is a $10 billion market with over 70 million prescriptions written every year for drugs. And, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly half the ADHD population uses behavioral therapy as well. The total ADHD population in the U.S. is 10.8 million and our initial target population includes those with inattentive or combined type ADHD, or 8.1 million of the total U.S. ADHD population. EndeavorRx is currently cleared in the U.S. to treat patients in the 8-12 age group, which represent approximately 22% of our target 8.1 million ADHD population.
Leveraging our initial success to expand into other ADHD populations
Our first commercial product is indicated in the U.S. for children ages 8-12 old with primary inattentive or combined-type ADHD, who have a demonstrated attention issue, and we are actively seeking to expand across both age and geography with further clinical studies. We are completing clinical trials in the U.S. in adolescents and adults with ADHD, which we plan to fully report on by the end of 2023. In January 2023, we announced topline results of the STARS-ADHD-Adolescents label expansion trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of AKL-T01 (marketed and branded as EndeavorRx in the U.S.) in adolescents ages 13-17 with ADHD, with the trial meeting its primary endpoint and showing statistically-significant improvement in a number of other symptom outcomes. In addition, we announced plans to use this study data in our planned regulatory submission to the FDA in 2023 to seek an expanded label for EndeavorRx. In January 2023, we also announced that based on the clinical data from the pivotal trial in adolescents and our desire to maximize capital efficiency, we discontinued recruitment of the STARS-ADHD-Adults study in order to analyze the trial data.
 In addition, there are studies that our partners are conducting or plan to conduct in pediatric ADHD, including an ongoing study in children ages 6-17 in Japan (Shionogi), and an anticipated pilot study in a younger pediatric population ages 3-8 in the U.S. (TALi) that has not yet commenced.
 Applying our clinically-validated technology to other mental health and neurology conditions
Building on the clinical validation of the technology underlying EndeavorRx, we have studied the therapeutic engine for its potential to improve the same cognitive impairment, attention function, in patients with impairments associated with MDD, ASD, MS, lupus, traumatic brain injury, post-operative cognitive dysfunction, chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment, and

cognitive dysfunction related to COVID-19. Details and updates around plans to advance, and in some instances pause, the development of these programs and report additional outcomes are detailed above.
 Further evolving the treatment paradigm by creating new methods of cognitive assessment
There is currently no consistent clinical protocol for how to use cognitive assessment tools, and most cognitive assessments have not changed in decades, with many still performed on pen and paper. Our technology has the potential to go beyond treatments and deliver a new way to measure and monitor cognitive function at scale. Early clinical data suggest that our technology may serve a cognitive measure that correlates with well-known in-person or paper-based cognitive measurements and detect unique neurological events before symptoms even appear. There is a collaborative study ongoing in cognitive monitoring in a healthy aging population, and the next step in advancement would be clinical validation, which we may consider pursuing through potential partnerships.
Our Platform
Our approach is designed to strengthen cognitive function while simultaneously delivering experiences that capture the imagination. We have built a proprietary platform engineered to induce clinically meaningful cognitive changes at the functional level. Informed by decades of research (including research conducted prior to the founding of Akili) and validated through rigorous clinical testing, our platform is powered by therapeutic engines that deploy sensory stimuli and simultaneous motor challenges designed to target and activate the neural networks that are key to certain cognitive functioning.
Our therapeutic engines employ adaptive closed-loop algorithms to personalize the treatment experience for each individual patient. This enables live adaptation to patient progress within gameplay, causing the treatment to continuously adapt and challenge the patient at an optimized level to drive engagement and improve the targeted cognitive function.
We designed our products and product candidates to deploy our technology to patients in a way that feels exciting, unlike educational software or brain stimulation. We learned over time how to build these engines into products that look and feel like today’s entertainment and high-quality games. And so, our products operate in patients’ hands like any other video game. Our technology changes over time, adds rewards and increases challenges in a way that feels natural to patients.
Components of our prescription digital therapeutics
Each of our product and product candidates has three basic components: (1) core mechanics (our therapeutic engines), (2) a self-adaptive closed-loop system and (3) a population specific UX/UI (the video game component interface).
Core Mechanics (Our Therapeutic Engines)
We currently have three therapeutic engines, each with proprietary mechanics designed to activate specific systems in the brain responsible for different cognitive functions: Selective Stimulus Management Engine (“SSME”), Body Brain Trainer (“BBT”) and Spatial Navigation Engine (“SNAV”). To date, we have only progressed the SSME therapeutic engine through clinical development and to market with EndeavorRx.
 Selective Stimulus Management Engine (“SSME”)
SSME technology is our most advanced therapeutic engine. SSME is specifically engineered to target and activate the systems in the brain that play a key role in attention function, a critical function that is often impaired in disorders including ADHD, ASD, MDD, MS, brain fog and others.

SSME is designed to activate the fronto-parietal cortex area in the brain.


Attentional Control is a set of cognitive processes that allow us to interact with our complex environment in a goal-directed manner. Specifically, it is the capacity to apply the necessary attention at an appropriate time and place, while monitoring the environment for new sources of information, in order to enable the optimal processing of task-relevant information to achieve a particular goal. SSME is designed to target attentional control and to activate the fronto-parietal cortex area in the brain.
To date, each of our development programs has been oriented toward a single indication and specific patient population. We refer to variations of our treatment software as our products or product candidates, each of which incorporates the core algorithms of one of our proprietary therapeutic engines (for example, our SSME therapeutic engine, which is incorporated into the majority of our existing product candidates). Within a single development program, we may explore multiple product candidates in early research and studies to optimize user engagement applicable to a particular patient population and indication and to determine which product candidate(s) will be evaluated in later clinical studies within that development program. Based on results of our studies and regulatory feedback from our clinical studies, we may also introduce other product candidates into our ongoing development programs. Furthermore, a specific product candidate may be used for one specific development program or across different development programs. Multiple product candidates may embody a single proprietary therapeutic engine but are differentiated based on one or more characteristics, including the videogame-like user interface and gameplay difficulty and progression, and each product candidate includes unique characteristics optimized for a particular indication and population.
AKL-T01 (marketed and branded as EndeavorRx in the U.S. and FDA-cleared for children ages 8-12 old with primary inattentive or combined-type ADHD, who have a demonstrated attention issue), as well as our AKL-T02 and AKL-T03 product candidates, are each variations of Akili’s treatment software targeting attention aspects of cognition, and each incorporates Akili’s SSME therapeutic engine technology. For example, AKL-T02, while retaining the same user interface and SSME therapeutic engine as AKL-T01, has adapted gameplay difficulty intended to increase user engagement in an autism spectrum disorder population. The SDT-001 product candidate is substantially the same SSME-based software as AKL-T01, but localized for Japanese language and culture for distribution in Japan. As a commercial product, EndeavorRx maintains the same gameplay functionality and therapeutic engine as the AKL-T01 product candidate used in the clinical studies that were the basis for FDA clearance, while being updated with incremental user interface changes and commercial compatibility modifications, such as compatibility modifications to enable access within applicable app stores. To the extent AKL-T01 is utilized, and cleared for marketing, under another development program (for example, a patient population and/or indication different from that cleared by the FDA for EndeavorRx), the resulting commercial product may be marketed and branded under a different label and reflect different incremental user interface and/ or gameplay changes than AKL-T01 or EndeavorRx.
SSME prototype study
An early prototype utilizing UCSF’s patented technology was studied by UCSF for its potential to improve certain cognitive functioning in older adults. This study served as proof of concept for the patented technology exclusively licensed to us and embedded in the SSME therapeutic engine.
The prototype presented the user with two tasks: a motor function task focused on navigating along a racecourse and a set of go/no-go tasks. Presenting users with both tasks simultaneously was used to determine the individual user’s ability to perform

under the challenge of a specific interference. An interference (multitasking) cost was calculated based on the reduction in single-task performance when performing multiple tasks simultaneously.


The prototype was used to quantify changes in the ability to process information as people age in a study of 174 subjects between the ages of 20 and 79 distributed with 26 to 30 subjects per age decade (experiment 1 above). With each decade of age, the ability to process interference was decreased (reducing multitasking cost in graph a, below). The impact of the prototype on cognitive function was assessed in experiment 2 which involved randomly assigning 46 naive older adults 60-85 years old to one of three groups: Multitasking Training (n=16), Single-task Training (n=15), or No-Contact Control (n=15). Training involved playing the prototype on a laptop at home for one hour a day, three times a week for four weeks (12 total hours of training), with all groups returning for a one-month post-training and a six-month follow-up assessment. The multitasking group’s performance significantly improved after four weeks, thus supporting the role of interference during game play as a key mechanistic feature of the prototype. These improvements remained stable six months after training without booster sessions. This group also showed cognitive ‘near transfer’ effects in improvements in measures of sustained attention and working memory after 4 weeks.
The neural basis of training effects were assessed by assessing midline frontal theta (MFT), a well-described EEG measure of attentional control, localized to the medial prefrontal cortex. The multitasking group demonstrated a significant increase in MFT between pre-and post-training after 4 weeks (p<0.05). Notably, these changes in neural processing reached a level comparable to neural activity patterns observed in younger adults (reference new EEG graphic with pre- post-and healthy control).

This groundbreaking research demonstrated that neural networks can be specifically and predictably activated and was published on the cover of the peer-reviewed scientific journal Nature.



Building on this initial research, we built our SSME therapeutic engine from which we developed EndeavorRx. SSME has been clinically validated across more than 20 research, proof-of-concept and pivotal clinical studies.
Body Brain Trainer (“BBT”)
BBT is designed to target neural systems involved in attention, impulsivity, working memory and goal management (fronto-parieto-cerebellar areas of the brain). BBT integrates cognitive and physical training within a single interactive environment through a motion capture video game and utilizes adaptive closed-loop algorithms that drive individuals to work at their ideal target heart rate and cognitive challenge.
Spatial Navigation Engine (“SNAV”)
SNAV is designed to leverage temporal, object and scene integration to target neural systems involved in spatial navigation, memory and planning and organization (extended hippocampal system in the brain).

 A Self-Adaptive Closed-Loop System
Each user’s experience is algorithmically customized and adapts in real-time based on a closed-loop feedback system. This allows the therapy to optimize and provide the most engaging and effective benefit to each individual. With this ability to adapt real-time based on a patient’s individual performance, the therapeutic is assessed and updated automatically, without the need for ongoing “titration” from prescribers.


A Population Specific UX/UI (Video Game Component Interface)
Our video game mechanics are the means of delivering our digital therapeutics, and we optimize these games to keep patients fully engaged for the duration of the therapy as well as appropriately challenged. Virtually every aspect of gameplay, from audio feedback to on-screen rewards, is designed to maximize the user’s engagement.
We customize gameplay for each specific patient population that it is intended to address. For example, when adapting a game originally designed for children for adult applications, we built four prototype games using the same clinically-validated

technology but reimagined with new themes, art and music, solely for the purpose of testing each treatment product with our target population. Each of our game concepts are focus tested with the target population.
Game mechanics overview of EndeavorRx, our first FDA-cleared digital therapeutic
The gameplay experience of EndeavorRx is designed to look and feel like a familiar 3D mobile action video game. Players attempt to successfully navigate their character through courses while collecting targets and avoiding obstacles. Players chase mystic creatures and race through different worlds, using boosts to problem- solve while building their very own universe. Successfully navigating each level requires focus and flexibility to manage multiple tasks at the same time, while filtering out distractions.
The game adapts in real-time as well as between treatment sessions, continuously challenging and encouraging the patient to improve their performance—individualizing each patient’s experience. As is the case with all of our product candidates, EndeavorRx is engineered with adaptive algorithms and designed to automatically adjust the cognitive challenge for each person’s individual treatment needs. Second by second tracking of individual progress allows caregivers to continuously monitor and assess treatment and share progress with their child’s health care provider.
EndeavorRx involves three key skills: Navigation, Targeting and Multitasking:
•Navigation: Steering over gates and/or avoiding obstacles 
 •Targeting: Tap for targets and ignore non-targets 
 •Multitasking: Simultaneous navigation and targeting 
 The multitasking complexity increases through the four worlds of the game, as illustrated below:


Through the development of EndeavorRx and our SSME technology, we developed specialized technologies and practices that allow us to create additional therapeutics with increased efficiency, highlighted in the section below. With the development of EndeavorRx, we have built a platform that enables us to continue developing innovative technologies designed to target brain function and efficiently advance them to commercialization upon marketing authorization.
Our unique development capabilities
Through our collaboration with world-renowned cognitive neuroscientists and acclaimed entertainment and technology designers, we have development capabilities that allow us to build unique video game interfaces tailored for each target audience. For instance, we have advanced a number of different gameplay experiences through clinical trials, each delivering our SSME technology through completely unique experiences designed for specific audiences. This enables us to efficiently create audience-specific products that, once cleared or approved by the applicable regulatory body, can be prescribed and used at scale.

Market Opportunity
While we believe we have the opportunity to develop a new pillar of medicine across dozens of medical conditions, our primary focus is currently on pediatric ADHD and expanding into broader age groups in ADHD.
 The U.S. market opportunity in ADHD, our primary area of focus, is as follows:


Disease Area | Total U.S. Populationwith Disease Diagnosis* | Initial Target Population Subset withapplicable cognitive impairment, asnoted*
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (“ADHD”), all ages | 10.8M (ADHD + inattention) | 8.1M 

 
* Figures in table above are based on our management’s good faith estimates based on various publications, public health data and national health statistics including from the NIH and CDC.
In our initial focus area, ADHD, there is a large and growing opportunity for innovative non-drug treatments. ADHD currently represents a $10 billion annual market with over 70 million prescriptions written every year for traditional drugs. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly half the ADHD population uses behavioral therapy in addition to prescription medicines. Our estimated market for inattentive or combined type ADHD in the U.S. is 8.1 million patients for all age groups, including 1.8 million patients in the 8-12 year old age group, which is the population EndeavorRx is currently cleared to treat.
Inadequacies of the Current Treatment Paradigm
Widely recognized in aging, cognitive impairments are also associated with dozens of chronic diseases and acute illnesses, including MDD, ASD, ADHD, MS, dementia, anxiety, schizophrenia, PTSD, “chemo-fog” and more. This manifests in ways like the inability to concentrate, memory issues, difficulty learning new things or issues making decisions that affect everyday life.
The safety profile of ADHD drugs and lack of options to specifically address inattention creates a very high unmet need. Current treatment approaches are limited to traditional medication, which lack precision, largely only treat symptoms, and are often accompanied by side effects. Traditional ADHD drugs have shown side effects that may include growth suppression, appetite suppression, weight issues, sleep issues and abdominal pain. Many children with ADHD are not currently on or well-controlled by medication, and more than half of them have tried, are trying or plan to try non-pharmacological treatments. Patients are looking for new options to improve upon the inadequate existing treatment paradigm. Additionally, behavioral therapies teach coping mechanisms rather than addressing the underlying impairment. Furthermore, patients are turning to supplements and brain trainers, which lack clinical evidence of effectiveness.
The stress of the global pandemic and the impact of technology in our lives is aggravating these challenges, and recognition of the impact on society is increasing. The World Health Organization estimates that 139 million people will be living with dementia by 2050. In 2021, a coalition of the U.S.’s leading experts in pediatric health declared a national emergency in child and adolescent mental health, and the U.S. Surgeon General issued an advisory to highlight the urgent need to address the mental health crisis among U.S. youth.
Now is the right time to apply technology to treating human diseases, in particular, cognitive conditions for which existing approaches have fallen short of providing clinically meaningful therapeutic options and for which there remains a significant unmet need.
Our Advantages
Disease agnostic
Our therapeutic engines are designed to target specific neural networks independent of the cause of the disease, and therefore a single therapeutic engine can potentially power dozens of products that target the same cognitive impairments, serving many different disease populations and creating a highly efficient technology-centric medicine model.
Personalized and adaptable
Our technology continuously learns and adapts based on a patient’s use of and progress in the treatment, resulting in tailored and personalized experiences that automatically adjust to each individual’s therapeutic needs.

Rich data Infrastructure
Our platform gives us real-time direct access to a de-identified aggregate level view of each patient’s activity in real-world conditions, enabling continuous innovation and rapid product iteration and allowing us to be truly patient adaptive.
Repeatable and Efficient Model
Building on clinically-validated technologies, with the regulated therapeutic engine intact, we can rapidly build different front-end experiences for different patient populations, creating completely unique games tailored for each audience.
Strong intellectual property protection
We seek to protect our platform, including unique algorithm mechanics, through the use of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, providing Akili with a rich intellectual property estate to develop, strengthen and maintain our proprietary position in the digital therapeutics field.
Ability to leverage our platform and infrastructure to achieve scale
We have developed specialized technologies and practices to support our first product, EndeavorRx, that are designed to enable us to repeat that success with increased efficiency over time. Highlighted in the figure below, from technology sourcing all the way up through regulatory clearance, commercial and growth on the market, our platform takes innovative technologies that target brain function and brings them through every step of the process. We are the first company to have built a platform to leverage these types of physiologically-targeting digital therapeutics, and we intend to further develop our SSME therapeutic engine as well as to be an acquirer of choice as this field of digital therapeutics (“DTx”) grows.


Our work to obtain regulatory clearance/marketing authorization, including with regulators to define the product category, clinical endpoints and labeling approach, paves the way not only for our future products on our current platform, but for other novel clinically validated and FDA cleared digital therapeutics from other technology sources to increasingly come to market.
We have established commercial capabilities to support an expanded clinical pipeline.
EndeavorRx represents our first commercial offering, demonstrating to the world what is possible using game-changing technology as medicine. But we believe this is just the beginning. Leveraging the clinical success of Endeavor Rx, we have built commercial and operational capabilities that we believe can support other product candidates in our clinical pipeline. These capabilities include a flexible fulfillment infrastructure, market access resources, marketing resources, field sales and medical representation, customer relationship management systems and service and support systems. These capabilities along with our technology platform enables us to potentially improve cognitive impairments across dozens of other diseases and disorders.
 EndeavorRx Commercialization Strategy
 EndeavorRx is Akili’s first commercial offering and demonstrates our ability to create software with the potential to scale like a drug and be readily available for patients and health care providers.


Akili is commercializing EndeavorRx using a prescription therapeutic business model, where a prescription or order from a licensed health care provider is filled by a patient and the cost of the treatment may be shared between the patient and the insurer, if reimbursed by an insurer. We have carefully developed our commercialization strategy based on our understanding of the key components to successfully target the therapeutics market and the benefits of Akili’s unique technology solution. Our strategy has the potential to address unmet needs among the pediatric ADHD population by:
 1) increasing awareness and activation of caregivers, and
 2) directly educating and activating health care providers, using a therapeutic sales model. Since obtaining FDA authorization for EndeavorRx, we have built an infrastructure that includes patient connectivity via telemedicine, digital fulfillment and additional scalable commercial capabilities. Our strategy focuses on three main stakeholders: consumers, health care providers and payers.
 Consumers
 Our initial patient population focus is children with ADHD with inattention who are not well controlled on medication or who are naive to stimulants. This represents about 44% of the pediatric ADHD population in the U.S. We are planning a direct-to-consumer approach to increase awareness and activation of the caregivers of this population. These caregivers are constantly looking for non-drug and effective options to help their families and already spend on solutions beyond traditional ADHD drugs. On average, caregivers pay five times the amount to raise their child with ADHD as compared to a neurotypical child. We intend to drive consumer demand via digital marketing and continually evolving and improving the treatment experience to drive word-of-mouth awareness.
 Health Care Providers
We intend to use a therapeutic sales model with a strong salesforce and integrate telemedicine. The physician targets consist of pediatricians, psychiatrists and health care practices that are considered to be Centers of Excellence that focus on children with ADHD. We have seen that our data, published in leading peer review journals like Lancet and Nature, generates significant credibility with this key stakeholder group, which we will continue to leverage. This approach, combining a proven therapeutic sales model with telemedicine, is designed to enable seamless access to care by providers.
Payers
 Our first market has a unique characteristic where the consumer, caregivers of children with ADHD, have a high willingness to pay cash out-of-pocket to help their children. They already spend on approaches beyond drugs, including psychotherapy, dietary supplements, after-school programs, online programs, etc. We expect that our clinically-validated treatments will increasingly be covered by commercial and government payers and, in the interim, we have a cash pay model that allows for expanded access to EndeavorRx. We have a dedicated market access team that is focused on top commercial national and targeted regional plans as well as government payers. Our early conversations with payers indicate that they consider ADHD treatments to be an essential need and we believe that our price point, currently $450 for a 30-day prescription (before any reductions based on potential promotional and/or discount programs), is competitive considering drugs and behavioral therapy costs in this space. In combination, Akili’s approach with payers prioritizes expanded access to EndeavorRx across more families seeking new therapies while ensuring a path is available for the unique self-pay characteristic of the market as we build expanded coverage over time.
 In the U.S., we plan to continue to evolve our commercial model through the EndeavorRx commercial launch and beyond, reaching more patients while mitigating risk associated with market conditions or promotional investment. Outside of the U.S., we will consider regional partnerships in relevant markets, leveraging existing and established brands and will franchise on an indication per indication basis. For example, Akili has formed a strategic partnership with Shionogi in Japan and Taiwan, leveraging each party’s distinct expertise to build a novel commercial model and launch a new class of treatment to patients.
 Key components of our EndeavorRx commercialization model
 •Consumer-integrated model: Parents of children with attention issues are looking for alternative solutions—solutions that are actually designed for their children.
 •Active participation by a licensed health care provider: A clinically-validated treatment that requires a prescription or order from a health care provider.
 •Delivered as a comprehensive care program: Families receive support through a gateway to high-touch personalized support and assistance with curated resources and online care management, along with a companion app to follow their child’s progress.
 •Coverage by payer decision-makers: Hybrid self-pay/reimbursement model to enable growth in the short term with potential to track toward expanded access via insurance coverage over time.


•Power of data to inform and adapt: Gain direct insight into patient use and outcomes by having access to an aggregate level view of each patient’s activity and completion of therapy.
 Potential Revenue Opportunity in ADHD
 Across ADHD—including our first EndeavorRx label and described label expansions—we anticipate the revenue opportunity to be at least $500 million per year, expected in the next four to six years (2027-2029) assuming clinical and regulatory success of our ADHD label expansion trials to the entire ADHD population and investment in its sales and marketing infrastructure. One example set of assumptions that results in this revenue potential is approximately 8% estimated market share, an even split of patients paying in cash as opposed to paying through insurance, an average net price between $300-350 per prescription and an average of 1.5x refills per patient after their first prescription. This revenue forecast would be negatively impacted to the extent these assumptions, particularly label expansion to the entire ADHD population, prove to be incorrect.
 Given EndeavorRx’s safety profile, we believe we can offer significant advantages over existing products in market, appealing to a broad spectrum of families, including:
 •families with children not well-managed on ADHD drugs due to side effects or lack of efficacy,
 •families choosing to not put their children on ADHD drugs, and
 •families with children actively taking ADHD drugs but looking for additional options to supplement their treatment.
 The revenue across ADHD described above reflects expectations based on a traditional pharmaceutical revenue model. Yet, we have a unique platform that allows us to grow and evolve our offering through a patient’s lifetime. We have several distinct levers enabling this:
 1) We are building meaningful relationships with caregivers and patients, offering products they enjoy that help improve their health.
 2) We are developing products that can span a person’s lifetime, from childhood through adulthood—supporting their cognitive health through chronic conditions, acute illness and aging.
 3) Our products can be continually iterated for long-term engagement.
 4) We have rich data infrastructure that can enable patients to engage with their health care providers in a new way.
 5) We also have the ability to offer premium content and services, like our recently launched EndeavorRx Insight, a companion app for parents to participate in and support their child’s treatment journey. This has the potential to provide additional revenue streams alongside the treatment.
 This revenue potential only accounts for treating inattention in ADHD in the U.S. Akili’s platform has the capability of addressing multiple potential markets, and we can activate other key programs to enter clinical trials and expand our presence in ADHD outside of the U.S. We are estimating a total addressable market of 15.5 million patients across our initial target patient populations in the U.S. and Japan.
 Current Programs and Clinical Validation
We have completed 20 clinical studies of our SSME technology to evaluate its potential to diagnose, treat and monitor certain cognitive functions in patients. Our studies, including large prospective randomized controlled trials, have been conducted in over 2,600 patients across nine disease areas. Our research has been published in leading peer-reviewed scientific journals, including The American Journal of Psychiatry, The Lancet Digital Health and Nature: Digital Medicine.
SSME is the therapeutic engine underlying our first commercial product in ADHD, EndeavorRx, and we have achieved pilot and/or proof of concept with SSME in MDD, MS and ASD, though clinical programs in MDD, MS, and ASD have been deprioritized and will be evaluated in connection with Akili’s capital raising and business development activities, as we focus on commercializing EndeavorRx and furthering clinical development of AKL-T01 in ADHD as we pursue an expanded label to cover additional patient populations.
 Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (“ADHD”)
ADHD is a neurobehavioral disorder characterized by a persistent pattern of symptoms such as inattention, hyperactivity and impulsive behavior that interferes with functioning and development. ADHD can have a profound impact on an individual’s life, causing disruption at school, work, home and in relationships. It is one of the most common developmental disorders in children and often persists into adulthood.

ADHD market size
 Current ADHD treatment options represent a $10 billion market with over 70 million prescriptions written every year for drugs in the U.S. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly half the pediatric ADHD population uses also behavioral therapy. The total ADHD population in the U.S. is 10.8 million and our initial target population includes those with inattentive or combined type ADHD, or 8.1 million of the total U.S. ADHD population. EndeavorRx is currently cleared in the U.S. to treat patients in the 8-12 age group, which represent approximately 22% (1.8 million) of our target 8.1 million ADHD population.
Current ADHD treatment guidelines recommend a multi-faceted approach that uses medications in conjunction with behavioral interventions. For children with ADHD younger than 6 years of age, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends parent training in behavior management as the first line of treatment, before medication is tried. For children 6 years of age and older, the recommendations include medication and behavior therapy used in combination. About 77% of children aged 2 to 17 with ADHD in the U.S. receive treatment, with about 47% receiving behavioral treatment and about 15% receiving only behavioral treatment without any medication. First- line medications used to treat ADHD are stimulants such as methylphenidate, marketed as Ritalin and Methylin, dexmethylphenidate, marketed as Focalin, dextroamphetamine, marketed as Dexedrine and Zenzedi, amphetamine-dextroamphetamine, marketed as Adderall, and lisdexamfetamine, marketed as Vyvanse. Other approved medications include atomoxetine, extended-release guanfacine, and extended-release clonidine. As of 2018, stimulants command 88% of the U.S. ADHD market at a value of $8 billion, with approximately 50% of the total market being amphetamines.
It is estimated that 44% of patients are not currently on or well controlled by ADHD medication, and 64% experience adverse effects from medication. Data show that 55% of patients have tried, are trying or plan to try non-pharmacological treatments. However, current validated non-pharmacological treatments and approaches—e.g. behavioral therapy—can lead to mixed results and can have accessibility and cost issues.
Our initial targeted population in ADHD was U.S. children ages 8-12 with a demonstrated impairment in attention function. This market represents a large and growing opportunity with caregivers actively searching for new non-drug solutions and allows us to build relationships with consumers that can be extended to support future market opportunities.
We are now focused on working to broaden and expand the age range we are targeting within the ADHD population.
 Our first commercial product—EndeavorRx for pediatric ADHD patients
Supported by data across five clinical trials, in June 2020, EndeavorRx was granted marketing authorization and was classified as a Class II medical device by the FDA through FDA’s de novo process. EndeavorRx is indicated to improve attention function as measured by computer-based testing in children ages 8-12 years old with primarily inattentive or combined-type ADHD, who have a demonstrated attention issue. Patients who engage with EndeavorRx demonstrate improvements in a digitally assessed measure Test of Variables of Attention (“TOVA®”) of sustained and selective attention and may not display benefits in typical behavioral symptoms, such as hyperactivity. EndeavorRx should be considered for use as part of a therapeutic program that may include clinician-directed therapy, medication and/or educational programs, which further address symptoms of the disorder. EndeavorRx is available by prescription only. It is not intended to be used as a stand-alone therapeutic and is not a substitution for a child’s medication.
According to the FDA, EndeavorRx represents the first game-based digital therapeutic to improve attention function associated with ADHD and the first game-based therapeutic to be granted FDA marketing authorization for any type of condition.
The impact of EndeavorRx as a digital therapeutic treating children with ADHD is two-fold—it is transforming how the world experiences medicine and bringing a new clinically-validated non-drug solution to patients living with ADHD. It is the first and only FDA-authorized treatment of its kind and is currently being prescribed by health care providers and helping patients with ADHD and their families.
Created by a team of neuroscientists and game designers, EndeavorRx is built on our SSME therapeutic engine and uses sensory stimuli and simultaneous motor challenges designed to target areas of the brain that play a key role in attention function. Patients who engaged with AKL-T01 in clinical studies demonstrated improvements in specific ADHD impairments and symptoms in daily life, as detailed in our clinical study data below.
Clinical evidence supporting EndeavorRx
The EndeavorRx research program includes three studies in ADHD (STARS-ADHD, STARS-Adjunct and ADHD-POC) and pilot studies in ADHD with Sensory Processing Disorder and in ADHD with Autism Spectrum Disorder (see below section for a description of the Autism Spectrum Disorder study).

STARS-ADHD pivotal study
 

The pivotal STARS-ADHD study was a 4-week multi-center, randomized, blinded, controlled trial conducted between July 2016 and November 2017 in 348 children aged 8-12 years and diagnosed with ADHD. Children enrolled into the study were instructed to use AKL-T01 or an educational-style video game control for approximately 25 minutes a day for 28 days.The predefined primary endpoint of the study was the change from baseline in the TOVA Attention Performance Index (TOVA API), a measure of objective attention for which the study was statistically powered. TOVA is a computerized test cleared by the FDA to assess attention deficits and evaluate the effects of interventions in ADHD; the API is a composite measure of attention functioning. This objective attention endpoint was the primary endpoint for which the study was statistically powered. The control condition used in this study was specifically designed to enable the assessment of changes in the primary endpoint of objective attention. The control was in the form of an educational style word search digital game matched to AKL-T01 for expectation of benefit and time on task. AKL-T01 showed a statistically significant improvement on the TOVA API compared to the control (p=0.006).

 The mean (“SD”) change from baseline on the TOVA API was 0.93 in the AKL-T01 group and 0.03 in the control group. Forty-seven percent of children met the prespecified clinical responder analysis for TOVA API improvement, which was greater than control (47% vs 32%, p=0.0058). In addition to the improvement in the TOVA API, treatment with AKL-T01 resulted in significantly greater improvements across other objective TOVA attention-related measures (sustained attention, attentional consistency, and long attentional lapses). Overall, after treatment with AKL-T01, 36% of children moved into the normative range of objective attention as measured by TOVA and no longer showed an objective attention deficit in at least one aspect of attention functioning, which was statistically greater than control (36% vs 21%, p=0.0027).
In addition to these objective measures of attention, the study also looked at secondary outcome measures comparing AKL-T01 to control on parent- and clinician-reported ADHD impairment and symptom ratings scales, specifically the Impairment Rating Scale (“IRS”), ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS-IV—Total, Inattentive, Hyperactive subscales), Clinical Global Impressions of Improvement (“CGI-I”) and the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (“BRIEF”). Children using AKL-T01 showed statistically significant change from baseline improvement across all measures. Though there was not a statistically significant separation on the mean magnitude of improvement between AKL-T01 and control on these secondary outcome measures, there was a trend towards differential improvement in IRS and ADHD-RS-Inattentive for children using AKL-T01.
Predefined responder analyses of these parent- and clinician-reported measures also showed differential improvement, with a significantly greater proportion of children benefiting from AKL-T01 versus control in the clinician-administered IRS, a parent-reported scale of ADHD-specific impairments (48% vs 37%, p=0·049). Further, 24% of children in the AKL-T01 group were considered responders on the ADHD-RS (≥30% reduction in ADHD-RS) compared to 19% in the control group (p=0.23; post-hoc analysis). Additionally, 56% of parents said the intervention helped their child’s attention in real life, and 73% of children reported feeling an improvement in their attention when asked via an exit survey. Overall, the effects of AKL-T01 were strongest

for measures of attention function, and weakest for measures of hyperactivity in ADHD. We further investigated these and similar secondary endpoints in other studies described herein.


AKL-T01 was shown to be safe in this study, with no serious adverse events observed. All adverse events reported were mild in 7% of patients, and included frustration (3%), headache (2%), emotional reaction (1%), dizziness (1%), nausea (1%) and aggression (1%).
STARS-ADHD Adjunctive clinical study
The STARS-ADHD Adjunctive clinical study was a three-month open-label study conducted between December 2018 and September 2019 which enrolled 206 children, aged 8-14 years with a diagnosis of ADHD. The children were separated into two groups: one with children on stimulant medications and one with children not taking ADHD medication. Both groups received a first period of AKL-T01 treatment in the first month of the study, followed by a pause in AKL-T01 treatment in the second month, and then a second period of AKL-T01 treatment in the third month. The primary efficacy outcome of the study was change in IRS after one month of treatment.
 

The study demonstrated statistically significant improvement in the IRS from baseline after one month as well as to the end of the three- month trial in both the children on-stimulants and off-stimulants (both cohorts: p<0.001). The second period of AKL-T01 treatment resulted in further increases in efficacy on this primary outcome measure, beyond the effects already seen after the first period of treatment. The magnitude of improvement in IRS throughout the study was similar for children independent of their ADHD medication use. Responder rates for IRS (improvement of greater than 1 point or more on the IRS scale) were 41% and 56% at the end of the first period of treatment with AKL-T01 in the off-stimulant and on-stimulant groups respectively (50% across both groups). This increased to 69% and 68% respectively by the end of the second period of treatment. Further, across both groups, responder rates for ADHD-RS Total (% children with ≥30% improvement) after the first period of treatment was 27% and increased to 45% after the second period of treatment. Additionally, after the second period of treatment, 60% of parents said the intervention helped their child’s attention in real life, and 75% of children reported feeling an improvement in their attention when asked via an exit survey.

 The treatment was well-tolerated. There were no serious adverse events and the total reported adverse events were in 18% of patients. The most common treatment-related adverse events reported were frustration (13.1%), headache (1.9%), irritability (1.5%), dizziness (1%), agitation (0.5%), anxiety (0.5%), asthenopia (0.5%), nausea (0.5%), feeling abnormal (0.5%) and pruritis (0.5%).

ADHD proof of concept study in pediatric ADHD
Our proof of concept (“POC”) study in ADHD was a 4-week study with recruitment conducted between January 2014 and August 2014 in children between the ages of 8-12 with a primary aim to assess treatment safety and acceptability and explore outcomes for AKL-T01 as a novel digital treatment targeting cognitive processes implicated in pediatric ADHD. Participants included 40 children with ADHD and 40 children without an ADHD diagnosis. Following psychiatric screening, ADHD ratings, and baseline neuropsychological measures (TOVA, CANTAB and BRIEF), participants completed the 28-days of at-home treatment and then returned to the clinic for follow-up safety, acceptability and neuropsychological measures. A neuropsychological assessment was repeated at the end of the study, and treatment satisfaction measures were assessed.
Eighty-four percent of treatment sessions were completed and AKL-T01 was feasibly deployed in the home setting over the treatment period of four weeks with positive ratings of acceptability by both parents and children. AKL-T01 was well-tolerated by children with ADHD, with no treatment-related adverse events reported. The results of the neurocognitive measures were as follows:
Significant improvements compared to baseline were observed in the ADHD group on the TOVA Attention Performance Index (TOVA API) (p = 0.033, Effect Size (d) = 0.35). There was no significant change in TOVA API scores for the non-ADHD group (p = 0.30, Effect Size (d) = 0.17).
The ADHD group showed significant improvement compared to baseline (p < 0.05) on 8 of 12 variables within the CANTAB Spatial Working Memory (SWM) test, 3 of 10 variables within the CANTAB Rapid Visual Processing (RVP) test, and 0 of 16 within the CANTAB Delayed Match to Sample (DMS) test. The non-ADHD group showed significant improvement (p < 0.05) on 5 of 12 variables within the SWM, 6 of 10 variables within the RVP, and 9 of 16 within the DMS.
The BRIEF summary scores (i.e., Metacognition, Behavioral Regulation, Global Executive Composite) did not change significantly for any of the groups. Findings from the study provided preliminary support that this digital therapy intervention may be effective for improving attention in pediatric ADHD, especially among children with greater symptom severity and impaired attention.
Studies in ADHD with sensory processing disorder
AKL-T01 was evaluated in a pilot study in children between 8-12 years old with Sensory Processing Dysfunction (“SPD”) who also met research criteria for ADHD. Recruitment for this study began in February 2014 and ended in January 2015. These children experience attention deficits that often impact their academic and social development. A sample of 38 SPD and 25 typically developing children were tested on behavioral, neural and parental measures of attention before and after a four-week iPad-based at-home cognitive remediation program. The primary endpoints were a Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA) reaction time (mean RT first half) and RT variability (RT-var first half) and ADHD-inattention symptoms (as measured with Vanderbilt inattention subscale, parent report). The secondary endpoints were Neurophysiology EEG Midline Frontal Theta (MFT) during TOVA and perceptual discrimination task. This was a feasibility study and a power analysis was not conducted. At baseline, 54% of children with SPD met or exceeded criteria on a parent report measure for inattention/hyperactivity. Notable deficits involving sustained attention, selective attention and goal management were observed only in the subset of SPD children with parent-reported inattention. This subset of children also showed reduced midline frontal theta activity, a well-established measure of attentional control derived from the electrical activity of the brain. Following the cognitive intervention, only the SPD children with inattention/ hyperactivity showed both improvements in midline frontal theta activity and on a parental report of inattention. Notably, 33% of these individuals no longer met the clinical cut-off for inattention, with the parent-reported improvements persisting for nine months. These findings support the benefit of a targeted attention intervention for a subset of children with SPD, while simultaneously highlighting the importance of having a multifaceted assessment for individuals with neurodevelopmental conditions to optimally personalize treatment.
 

A 9 months follow up study (no intervention with AKL-T01 and continued treatment as usual) revealed that participants showed a significant decrease in parent-observed inattentive behaviors (p = 0.66, Cohen’s D = 0.14), which remained stable in a nine-month follow-up assessment. A Generalized Estimating Equations analysis was used to assess changes in symptoms over time, specifically to determine whether the initial improvements were retained. The SPD plus inattention cohort continued to show sustained benefits on their parent-reported scores of inattention, with 54% of SPD plus inattention individuals no longer meeting criteria for ADHD three years following intervention.

Consistent and Clinically Meaningful Improvements in Objective Attention across Studies in ADHD
We observed consistent improvements in TOVA API and related key measures of objective attention (reaction time (RT Mean H1) and reaction time variability (RT Var)) across all studies of AKL-T01 in children with attention impairment.
We believe the overall efficacy profiles of the ADHD studies described herein reflect the targeted nature of the treatment and underlying technology, i.e., to target attention networks. We believe these efficacy profiles meet an important need for children in ADHD, which is reinforced by the indication of EndeavorRx. Specifically, the FDA-authorized indications for use specify that EndeavorRx is intended to improve attention function, and that EndeavorRx is for children ages 8-12 years old with primarily inattentive or combined-type ADHD, who have a demonstrated attention issue, and to be used alongside their current treatment program, and that EndeavorRx should be considered for use as part of a therapeutic program that may include clinician-directed therapy, medication, and/or educational programs, which further address symptoms of the disorder.
 

Electroencephalography (“EEG”) study of AKL-T01 in ADHD
This single-arm, unblinded 4-week study was conducted at UCSF and assessed a sample of 25 children with ADHD (8–12 years old) on neural, behavioral, and clinical metrics of attention before and after a four-week at-home intervention with AKL-T01. The primary endpoints were neural assessment of attentional control, change in midline frontal theta (MFT) power as measured by Perceptual Discrimination Task (PDT)-Locked Electroencephalogram (EEG) from day 0 to day 28. The exploratory endpoints were objective behavioral measures of attention, such as a perceptual discrimination task, reaction time and reaction time variability metrics, and sustained attention task (a continuous performance task similar to TOVA). The parent reported ADHD symptoms were measured on the Vanderbilt inattention subscale. This was a feasibility study and a power analysis was not conducted.
The study found that children showed enhancements on MFT, as well as on objective behavioral measures of attention and parent reports of clinical ADHD symptoms. There were also observed relationships between the neural and behavioral cognitive improvements, demonstrating that those children who showed the largest intervention-related neural gains were also those that improved the most on the behavioral tasks indexing attention.
Graph (a) shows the time course of MFT EEG changes during treatment with AKL-T01 and shows there was a general increase in MFT magnitude following four weeks of treatment with AKL-T01 (change from pre- to post- intervention).

Graph (b) illustrates improvements in MFT following four weeks of treatment with AKL-T01 at the corresponding early, peak and late time windows during treatment, through topographic heat maps with the MFT area of interest highlighted with a dotted bounding box.


Clinical development program in ADHD
We are conducting several clinical trials to expand our leadership in prescription digital therapeutics in ADHD, building on our flagship product EndeavorRx, which is FDA authorized in 8-12 year old children with primarily inattentive or combined-type ADHD, who have a demonstrated attention issue.
U.S. study of TALi technology in early childhood
 Planning is underway to conduct a clinical trial of technology exclusively licensed from TALi Digital in children ages 3-8 to support a path to regulatory clearance in the U.S. The technology has demonstrated improved attention in both neurotypical (those with brain functions, behaviors, and processing considered standard or typical) and neurodivergent (those having brain functioning that is not typical) children and is currently available in the following countries:
•Australia, in which the technology does not require a medical prescription; 
 •India, in which the technology does not require a medical prescription; and
 •Singapore, in which the technology does not require a medical prescription. 
 U.S. study of AKL-T01 in adolescents (STARS-ADHD-Adolescents)
Akili has conducted a multi-center pivotal trial to evaluate objective attention functioning and ADHD symptoms and impairments in adolescents, ages 13 to 17, with a diagnosis of ADHD (combined or Inattentive subtypes), who are stable on or off ADHD medication, after four-weeks of SSME treatment.
In January 2023, we announced top-line results of this STARS-ADHD-Adolescents label expansion trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of AKL-T01 (marketed and branded as EndeavorRx in the U.S.) in 162 adolescents ages 13-17 with ADHD, with the trial meeting its primary endpoint and showing statistically-significant improvement in a number of other symptom outcomes. In addition, we intend to use this study data in our planned regulatory submission to the FDA in 2023 to seek an expanded label for EndeavorRx and plan to present full data from this study at a future medical meeting.


U.S. study of AKL-T01 in adults (STARS-ADHD-Adults)
In January 2023, we announced that based on the slower-than anticipated trial recruitment and the positive clinical data from the above STARS-ADHD-Adolescents pivotal trial and our desire to maximize capital efficiency, we discontinued recruitment of STARS-ADHD-Adults, the multi-center pivotal trial to assess the efficacy of AKL-T01 in adults 18 years and older diagnosed with ADHD in order to analyze the trial data. The study enrolled 223 patients and is evaluating objective attention functioning and ADHD symptoms/impairments in adults with a diagnosis of ADHD (combined or inattentive subtype), stably on or off ADHD medication, after six-weeks of AKL-T01 treatment.
Shionogi study of SDT-001 in Japan
Through our strategic partnership with Shionogi announced in March 2019, Akili conducted a study of SDT-001, which is substantially the same SSME-based software as the AKL-T01 product candidate, but localized for Japanese language and culture for distribution in Japan, in children with ADHD in Japan. The study was designed to evaluate the feasibility, safety and efficacy of the investigational digital therapeutic in children with ADHD and to inform the design of a future pivotal study. To enable this clinical trial, Akili localized AKL-T01 for use in the Japanese market, which included adapting for language and culture and establishing infrastructure in Japan to support the investigational device.
The randomized, controlled study of SDT-001 enrolled children ages 6-17 years diagnosed with ADHD whose ADHD RS-IV Inattention score was 15 or over. A total of 261 patients were enrolled across three study groups: (1) participants who received the Akili SDT-001 digital treatment, (2) participants who continued treatment as usual (“TAU”), consisting of psychoeducation and environmental support, and (3) participants who received a version of the treatment with reduced cognitive tasks and adaptability (“Sham”). The SDT-001 treatment group showed larger improvements across the clinical endpoints compared to both the TAU and the Sham groups. In the total population, the improvements seen over Sham did not meet statistical significance, but post hoc analysis applying the propensity score suggested that SDT-001 improvements over TAU were statistically significant (p < 0.05). SDT-001 was generally well-tolerated and there were no serious adverse events. Adverse events reported were consistent with previous clinical studies of AKL-T01. There were 4 adverse device reactions reported in patients treated with SDT-001, which were mild in severity including irritability, headache, tinnitus and nausea.
In August 2022, we announced that following a successful Phase 2 trial, Shionogi had commenced a pivotal Phase 3 portion of this study, that clinical trial sites had begun enrolling patients, and that results from the study are expected in the second half of 2023.
 Upcoming Milestones in ADHD

 •Top-line pivotal trial data in adult ADHD patients to be presented published: Expected H2 2023 
 Autism spectrum disorder (“ASD”)
ASD is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impairments in social communication and social interaction and restricted repetitive patterns of behavior, interests and activities. Children with ASD are at high risk for impairments in attention function and are often initially diagnosed because of delays in language development or deviant language skills, or because of lack of the intent to communicate. The presence of ADHD symptoms in children with ASD is associated with worse cognitive (attention) control.
Individuals with ASD have varying degrees of impairment that require customized management based on the child’s age and needs. Treatment for ASD is focused on behavioral and educational interventions as well as pharmacological interventions to treat targeted symptoms such as hyperactivity, inattention, impulsivity, aggression, anxiety and obsessive-compulsive behaviors. Risperidone and aripiprazole are the only approved treatments for the behavioral disturbances associated with ASD. Common adverse effects from these drugs include weight gain, sedation and Parkinson’s-like symptoms such as muscle spasms and stiffness.

Clinical evidence in ASD
We have conducted a pilot study of an investigational new treatment product built on our SSME technology engine in patients with ADHD with ASD, utilizing the AKL-T02 variation of our treatment software. While leveraging the same SSME core mechanics and video game interface found in our EndeavorRx product, to address the distinct needs of ASD patients, the rate of change in challenge levels of our investigational treatment product in ASD is decreased. Our pilot study demonstrated high acceptability and engagement of the treatment and an improvement in attention measures compared to a control condition. The study demonstrated an improvement in TOVA scores following use of the Akili investigational treatment compared to a control educational style video game. The primary endpoint was TOVA API. The secondary endpoints were the ADHD Rating Scale IV, parent report and the Behavior Regulation Inventory of Executive Function-2 (BRIEF-2), social skills improvement system and the spatial working memory task from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB). This study was a feasibility study and no power analysis was performed.


The study was conducted at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia Center for Autism Research, which enrolled 19 children with autism, aged 9-13 years old and with an average age of 10 years old. Patients received either our investigational treatment (AKL-T02) or a control educational style video game based on a word challenge game. Patients were asked to play the game for 30 minutes a day, five days a week, for four weeks.This pilot study found that not only did the child participants like and engage with our investigational treatment, their attention on the TOVA test of attention improved similar to what was seen in our studies of children with only an ADHD diagnosis. The control video game did not demonstrate improvement in the mean TOVA score. There was one adverse event (decreased frustration tolerance) in the AKL-T02 group; no serious adverse events were reported.

 Clinical development program and upcoming milestones in ASD
As noted previously with our updated 2023 operating plan, this clinical program has been de-prioritized temporarily while we focus resources on EndeavorRx market growth in the ADHD population and assess our strategy for advancing products with the ASD population.
 Major depressive disorder (“MDD”)
Major depressive disorder is the most prominent subtype of depression, and people suffering from MDD typically have a depressed spirit or mood, known as dysphoria, reduced energy and decreased activity level. They also have a reduced capacity for enjoyment, a lowered self-esteem and reduced self-confidence.
Cognitive impairment is a fundamental diagnostic criterion of depression. Data show that cognitive symptoms are present during up to 94% of depressive episodes and, for many patients, persist even after successful antidepressant treatment (seen in up to 44% of periods of remission). Such cognitive impairments have been shown to be a predictor of daily function.
The most common treatments for a person diagnosed with depression are medication and psychotherapy. There are approximately three dozen medications approved by FDA for managing depression. Commonly prescribed antidepressant medications include fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine, escitalopram, venlafaxine, desvenlafaxine and duloxetine. While these drugs are effective for many patients, approximately two-thirds of subjects do not achieve remission with a single medication, and approximately one-third of subjects did not achieve remission despite trying four medications. As such, there are large numbers of MDD patients for whom medication therapy is insufficient to alleviate their symptoms. Non-pharmacological approaches for depression include psychotherapy, physical activity and neurostimulation (interventions that deliver mild electrical or magnetic pulses to the brain) for severe, treatment-resistant depression.
Clinical evidence in MDD
Our development program in MDD utilizes the same SSME core mechanics and video game interface found in our EndeavorRx product, but is customized to appeal to an adult patient population.



Our proof of concept study in MDD was a multi-center, randomized, controlled trial of our SSME technology engine, utilizing the AKL-T03 variation of our treatment software, in 74 adult patients diagnosed with mild-to-moderate MDD symptoms and with mild-to-moderate cognitive impairment. All participants were on stable antidepressant medication. Participants were randomized 1:1 to AKL-T03 or a control game. Both groups used the treatment/control at home, five days per week for 25 minutes per day, on a tablet device for six weeks. Following the treatment period, an in-clinic assessment was conducted to assess key outcomes. The primary outcome of the study assessed sustained attention as measured by TOVA, an FDA-cleared objective measure of attention.

 In the study, AKL-T03 showed a statistically significant improvement in sustained attention compared to control (p=0.002) on the predefined primary endpoint, as measured by the TOVA engagement with AKL-T03 also showed a strong correlation with improved processing speed. There were no serious adverse events observed for AKL-T03. Two (5.5%) of 37 patients using AKL-T03 reported an intervention-related adverse event (headache) Results of the study have been accepted for publication in The American Journal of Psychiatry.
Clinical development program and upcoming milestones in MDD
As noted previously with our updated 2023 operating plan, this clinical program has been de-prioritized temporarily while we focus resources on EndeavorRx market growth in the ADHD population and assess our strategy for advancing products with the MDD population.
 Multiple sclerosis (“MS”)
Multiple sclerosis is an inflammatory neurologic disease in which the destruction of myelin inhibits communications between the nerves in the brain. MS frequently causes extreme fatigue, numbness, weakness, difficulty with eyesight, spasticity, speech problems, problems with coordination and problems with memory and concentration.
Cognitive symptoms in patients with MS are predictive of loss of employment, loss of quality of life, and affects all aspects of daily life.
Treatment of MS focuses on symptom management, treatment of attack, and reduction of disease progression. A number of immunosuppressive disease-modifying therapies have been approved that reduce the rate of disease progression, but they do not stop it. Therefore, MS treatment management includes symptomatic treatments as well as rehabilitative and psychological approaches such as physical therapy, speech therapy, occupational therapy and cognitive rehabilitation. There are no current treatments for MS that are specifically designed to address cognitive impairments.
Clinical evidence in MS
Our development program in MS leverages the SSME therapeutic engine and is focused on treating adult patients. We initially conducted a pilot study in 21 patients with UCSF. Participants completed an in-clinic baseline neurological evaluation and then used our investigational digital therapeutic in-home for 25 minutes daily, five days weekly, for four weeks. This was followed by a repeat in-clinic evaluation. The study showed significant improvement in processing speed in patients who used our investigational digital therapeutic.
We then conducted a proof of concept study designed to assess our investigational digital therapeutic’s ability to improve processing speed in adults with MS as compared to control. Recruitment for this study was between March and September 2018 for adults between the ages of 18-70 years old. The double-blind randomized controlled clinical trial enrolled 40 adults with MS and baseline Symbol Digit Modalities Test (“SDMT”) z- scores between -2 and 0. After completing a baseline in-clinic evaluation (Visit 1), subjects were randomized to complete our in-home investigational digital therapeutic utilizing the AKL-T03 variation of our treatment software or a control word game for up to 25 minutes/day, five days/week, for six weeks. A repeat in-clinic evaluation occurred at six weeks (Visit 2), and again eight weeks later to determine persistence of effects (Visit 3). The primary endpoint was SDMT and the secondary endpoint was Paced auditory Serial Addition Test (“PASAT”). No power analysis was reported by the study investigators.
 The pre-specified primary outcome was change in SDMT score between Visits 1 and 2. The study demonstrated clinically significant improvement in SDMT (>4) following six weeks of AKL-T03 use (vs. baseline). This clinically meaningful 4+ point

increase in SDMT was maintained after a further eight weeks observation period. No adverse events were reported. The statistical analysis from the study showed:
•SDMT: No difference between group, p=0.21. Both the AKL-T03 and control groups showed statistically significant improvements, p<0.001 and p=0.024, respectively. 
 •At 8 weeks follow up, responders analysis (clinically meaningful +4 point increase in SDMT relative to baseline SDMT score) was statistically significant favoring AKL-T03, p=0.038. 
 •PASAT: No difference between group, p=0.93. Both the AKL-T03 and control groups showed statistically significant improvements, p=0.002 and p=0.07 (marginally significant), respectively. 
 Clinical development program and upcoming milestones in MS
As noted previously with our updated 2023 operating plan, this clinical program has been de-prioritized temporarily while we focus resources on EndeavorRx market growth in the ADHD population and assess our strategy for advancing products with the MS population.
 

Acute cognitive dysfunction
Cognitive impairments can occur after acute insults to the brain due to trauma, infection, hypoxia, inflammation, medication, toxins, critical illness, cancer and more. Patients with acute cognitive dysfunction may experience issues related to attention, processing speed, multi-tasking, immediate recall and short- and long-term memory among other impairments.
These impairments can have a significant impact on individuals’ daily functioning and quality of life. Cancer- related cognitive dysfunction (“CRCI”) has a negative impact on survivors’ ability to work, carry out routine activities, and engage in social and family relationships. And, in a recent study of COVID-19 survivors, for instance, “COVID fog” symptoms including cognitive impairment impacted their ability to work for six months or more.


Clinical evidence in acute cognitive function Evaluating the ability of our SSME technology to improve impairments related to acute cognitive dysfunction, we conducted a pilot study between September 2015 and April 2019 of 84 patients with TBI, including 60 85-year-old veterans with a history of multiple mild TBIs, or at least one incident of moderate TBI, and related subjective cognitive complaints. The primary endpoint was attention as measured by TOVA API, RT, and RT variability. The secondary endpoints were working memory as measured by WAISS Letter number sequencing, and the symbol span, processing speed as measured by the WAISS symbol search, Trail Making Test A and the color naming, color reading response time, executive functioning as measured by Trail Making Test B, the color word inhibition test, and tower test, and memory as measured by HVLT-R learning, delayed recall and recognition. 

 

The data from the study showed significant improvement in measures of attention (reaction time) and working memory, compared to controls.
This was a feasibility study and no specific power analysis was conducted. There was a statistically significant difference for attention, p=0.045. Only AKL-T01 showed significant improvement, p=0.006. Neither the control group (p=0.43) nor the no contact group (p=0.79) changed their attention performance. This improvement was maintained for 3 months post-intervention. There were no other changes on the other cognitive domains, all p<0.05. No adverse events were reported.
Clinical development program and upcoming milestones in acute cognitive dysfunction
As noted previously with our updated 2023 operating plan, this clinical program has been de-prioritized temporarily while we focus resources on EndeavorRx market growth in the ADHD population and assess our strategy for advancing products with the acute cognitive dysfunction population.
 Pilot studies in COVID fog
There are currently no FDA-approved treatments for cognitive impairments in COVID-19 survivors (“COVID fog”) and recent research suggests that it can affect between 20-80% of COVID-19 survivors who had been hospitalized. We are working with research teams at Weill Cornell Medicine, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital and Vanderbilt University Medical Center to conduct randomized, controlled clinical studies evaluating the ability of our investigational digital therapeutic to target and improve cognitive functioning in COVID-19 survivors who have exhibited a deficit in cognition.
The ongoing Akili, Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital randomized, controlled study is evaluating AKL-T01 in approximately 100 COVID-19 survivors ages 18-89 who have exhibited a deficit in cognition. The study will take place over 10 weeks, with six weeks of treatment and four weeks of follow-up. Half of the study participants will receive the investigational digital treatment and half will serve as a control group. The primary endpoint of the study is mean change in cognitive function, as assessed by a measure of attention and processing speed. Secondary endpoints include additional measures of cognitive functioning. The study is being conducted remotely in patients’ homes, and patients in the control arm will have the option to receive the AKL-T01 intervention after the conclusion of their participation in the control group.
The ongoing Akili and Vanderbilt randomized, controlled study is evaluating AKL-T01 in approximately 100 COVID-19 survivors ages 18 and older who have exhibited a deficit in cognition. The study is recruiting from subjects who have completed the SARS-CoV-2 Household Transmission Study. Half of the study participants will receive the investigational digital treatment for four weeks and half will serve as a control group. The primary endpoint of the study is mean change in cognitive function, as measured by CNS Vital Signs (composite score of cognitive function, especially attention and processing speed). Secondary endpoints include additional measures of cognitive functioning. The study is being conducted remotely in patients’ homes.
We expect data from our pilot studies in COVID fog in the first half of 2023.
Pilot study in postoperative patients
Working with Vanderbilt’s Critical Illness, Brain Dysfunction and Survivorship (CIBS) Center, we are conducting pilot studies of AKL-T01 in older surgical patients. The ongoing COPE-iOS study will assess the efficacy of AKL-T01 in improving cognitive outcomes in post-op patient populations by combining cognitive and physical training as part of interventions that occur before surgery and up to three months after hospital discharge.
The COPE-iOS controlled study will randomize approximately 250 patients over 60 years old undergoing elective major non-cardiac surgery to evaluate the efficacy of a comprehensive cognitive training program (digital cognitive intervention and supervised progressive multimodal physical exercise) in improving long-term cognitive outcomes as compared to an active control (control computer game, health information, stretching exercises) for two to four weeks prior to surgery and for three months after discharge. The primary endpoint of the five year study is the difference in global cognition between intervention and active control three and 12 months after discharge. Neuropsychological professionals blinded to treatment assignment and hospital course will assess global cognition at baseline and after discharge using the CNS Vital Signs neurocognitive battery. In addition, Vanderbilt will obtain blood to evaluate biomarkers of neuronal injury and will be performing brain MRI imaging at baseline and three months after discharge, providing a robust mechanistic aim of the study in addition to evaluation of cognition and physical function outcomes. This is a long term study and no results are expected before mid-to late 2024.
 Pilot study in CRCI
We are working with UCSF to conduct a pilot study in patients with cancer-related cognitive dysfunction. The study will randomize approximately 60 patients to evaluate the feasibility, safety and initial signals of efficacy of AKL-T01 as compared to control game. Half of the study participants will receive the investigational digital treatment for four weeks and half will serve as

a control group. They will use the treatment or control game for 25 minutes per day, five days a week for four weeks. Cognitive measures will include TOVA and Adaptive Cognitive Evaluation (“ACE”), a mobile cognitive control assessment battery.
Cognitive Assessment
Cognition is often only assessed when there is a specific, subjective complaint from patients, family members or caregivers. There is no consistent clinical protocol for how to use cognitive assessment tools. Most cognitive assessments have not changed in decades, and many are still performed on pen and paper.
Clinical evidence in cognitive assessment
Our development program in this space leverages our SSME therapeutic engine, but with a focus on assessment as opposed to treatment.
A pilot study was conducted in 100 patients with MS, which showed positive correlation between our SSME technology and a recognized cognitive function measure, known as SDMT, in assessing cognition in MS (graph on left below).


We also conducted a pilot study in 54 healthy older adults in collaboration with Pfizer. The study showed the potential for SSME assessment to detect cognitive differences between amyloid positive and amyloid negative status, where amyloid is a protein biomarker associated with a higher risk of progression to dementia, in otherwise healthy individuals (graph on right).

 Clinical development program and upcoming milestones in acute cognitive dysfunction
There is an ongoing collaborative study that is being conducted for cognitive monitoring in a healthy aging population
 Additional technology engines
We have previously developed or licensed two additional technologies beyond SSME – SNAV and BBT. SNAV targets spatial navigation and episodic memory, and BBT targets attention, goal management and working memory. These technologies have potential to improve certain cognitive impairments associated with a number of medical conditions, including Alzheimer’s and Mild Cognitive Impairment (“MCI”). In addition to the technology engines in our current portfolio, we continuously assess new innovative technologies through our internal R&D efforts and through potential licensing and acquisition.
Intellectual Property
We actively seek to obtain patent protection in the U.S. and other countries for inventions covering our products and technologies. We also license patents and technologies from third parties. Further, we rely on copyrights (including copyright registrations for software designs), trademarks and trade secrets relating to our proprietary PDT algorithms or processes, in order to develop, strengthen and maintain our proprietary position in the PDT field.

Our commercial success may depend in part on our ability to: obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business; defend and enforce our patents, copyrights, trademarks and other proprietary rights; preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and operate without infringing the valid, enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. Our ability to limit third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our products may depend on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable licenses, patents, copyrights or trade secrets that cover these activities. In some cases, enforcement of these rights may depend on third-party licensors or co-owners. With respect to both company-owned and licensed intellectual property, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our commercial products.
Agreements/Third Parties
Shionogi Collaboration Agreement
In March 2019, Shionogi & Co. Ltd. exercised its option to enter into an exclusive collaboration and license agreement (the “Shionogi Agreement”) with us, pursuant to which we and Shionogi agreed to collaborate in the development and commercialization of certain digital therapeutic products, including EndeavorRx and AKL-T02, variations of Akili’s SSME technology, in the licensed field in Japan and Taiwan. Under the agreement, Shionogi will be primarily responsible for the development and commercialization of such licensed products at its own cost and expense. Shionogi has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain regulatory approval for certain licensed products, including EndeavorRx and AKL-T02, in each indication in the licensed field throughout Japan and Taiwan. The development and commercialization of the licensed products are overseen by a joint steering committee comprised of an equal number of representatives from each of us and Shionogi. We maintain control over the development and commercialization of the licensed products worldwide for all indications, and in Japan and Taiwan for all indications outside of Shionogi’s licensed field. Additionally, we provide certain technical support services to Shionogi, and we have agreed to certain responsibilities with respect to licensed product development activities under the agreement.
Pursuant to the Shionogi Agreement, for a given licensed product, we have granted to Shionogi an exclusive license, with the right to grant sublicenses, under certain patent rights and know-how controlled by us (1) to clinically develop such licensed product anywhere in the world for the purposes of obtaining regulatory approval and commercializing such licensed product in the licensed field in Japan and Taiwan and (2) commercialize such licensed product in the licensed field in Japan and Taiwan.
To date, we have received an aggregate amount of approximately $25.4 million from Shionogi under the Shionogi Agreement, which includes an initial upfront fee payment of $10.0 million, an additional $10.0 million option exercise payment, proceeds from a $5.0 million corporate bond and $0.4 million to produce a control version of our software for the trials in Japan. We are also entitled receive up to a total of $105.0 million in total development and commercial milestones across all licensed products. Additionally, we are entitled to royalties, in a range between 20-30%, on annual net sales of licensed products in the territory so long as Shionogi continues to sell the licensed products in such territory, subject to certain specified reductions. Shionogi will also help fund development costs in Japan and Taiwan.
In connection with Shionogi exercising its option to enter into the agreement, we issued a $5.0 million corporate bond to Shionogi for cash. The corporate bond is unsecured and is subordinated to our obligations under indebtedness for borrowed money owed by us to any bank or other financial institution.
Unless earlier terminated, the Shionogi Agreement will continue in effect until the expiration of all of Shionogi’s payment obligations thereunder. Either party may terminate the agreement upon an uncured material breach of the agreement by the other party or upon the occurrence of certain events of insolvency of the other party. Additionally, Shionogi may terminate the agreement for any or no reason, in its entirety or on a licensed product-by-licensed product basis, upon specified written notice to us. Shionogi may also terminate the agreement on a licensed product-by-licensed product basis for safety reasons, certain clinical failures, or in the event that any third-party in-license entered into by us is terminated and cannot be reestablished within a specified period to allow Shionogi to continue exercising its rights under the agreement.
In the event that Shionogi has the right to terminate the Shionogi Agreement, in whole or with respect to a particular target, upon our uncured material breach, then in lieu of so terminating, Shionogi has the right to elect to the have the agreement continue in full force and effect; provided that Shionogi shall pay a reduced royalty. In the event that Shionogi terminates the agreement at will, or if we terminate for a breach or insolvency, we are entitled to certain reversionary rights with respect to the terminated licensed products.

In the event that we want to develop or commercialize certain digital therapeutic products (other than the licensed products) in Japan or Taiwan, we agreed to allow Shionogi a one-time first right of negotiation to expand the scope of the agreement to include such products.
UCSF NeuroRacer Agreement
On October 18, 2013, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with The Regents of the University of California (the “UCSF NeuroRacer Agreement”), which was amended on May 17, 2018, and February 25, 2019. Certain granted patent claims licensed under the agreement cover aspects and/or functionality of EndeavorRx. Under the agreement, UCSF grants us an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license under UCSF’s rights in certain patents and copyrights controlled by UCSF, to, in the case of the licensed patents, make, use, sell, offer for sale and import, and to reproduce, prepare derivative works, distribute, perform, and, in the case of the licensed copyrights, display, certain licensed products, services, software, and methods covered by such patents and copyrights. Under the agreement, UCSF retains the right to use the licensed technology for educational and research purposes, including sponsored researching performed for or on behalf of commercial entities. Under this agreement, we have rights to two U.S. patents, five Japanese patents and one Canadian patent. These patents expire as early as 2031 (for the Japanese and Canadian patents) and 2032 (for the U.S. patents).
As consideration for entering into the UCSF NeuroRacer Agreement, we paid UCSF a license issue fee of $10,000. We also paid UCSF an aggregate license maintenance fee of $25,000 ($5,000 annually for five years up to the first sale of a licensed product). Additionally, we are obligated to pay to UCSF up to a total of $1.1 million in total milestone payments for products covered by the license (including EndeavorRx), including for certain patent-related, regulatory and commercial milestones. As of January 31, 2023, we have paid UCSF a total of $185,000 in such milestone payments.
In addition, we are obligated to pay to UCSF certain mid-single digit percentage royalties on annual net sales of licensed products, methods, or services depending on if such products, methods, or services are clinically tested or not, subject to certain specified reductions. Royalties are payable to UCSF from the date of first commercial sale of a licensed product or licensed service on a country-by-country basis until the later of expiration or abandonment of the licensed patents or on the tenth anniversary of the first commercial sale of each such licensed product or licensed service in such country. As of January 31, 2023, we have paid to UCSF a total of $424,947 in such royalty payments. In total, we have paid UCSF $644,947 under the UCSF NeuroRacer Agreement.
We are also obligated to pay UCSF certain tiered payments upon a change of control transaction (as defined in the agreement), up to a maximum of $2.5 million in such payments, depending on the total amount of payments to shareholders resulting from such transaction.
We must also pay to UCSF a tiered, low- to mid-double-digit percentage of any sublicensee revenue (as defined in the agreement), depending on the regulatory status of the licensed product applicable to such sublicense agreement. To date, we have not made any payments to UCSF in sublicensee revenue.
The UCSF NeuroRacer Agreement will remain in effect until the later of (i) expiration or abandonment of the last of the licensed patents or (ii) expiration of the licensed copyrights in all countries. UCSF may terminate the agreement upon an uncured breach of the agreement by us and the agreement will automatically terminate upon our insolvency. Additionally, we may terminate the agreement for any or no reason, in its entirety, or terminate our rights under the licensed patents on a country-by-country basis, upon specified written notice to UCSF.
TALi Agreement
In August 2021, we entered into a license agreement with TALi Digital Limited (the “TALi Agreement”) pursuant to which we license TALi’s technology designed to address early childhood attention impairments. Under the agreement, TALi grants us an exclusive license to develop, supply and commercialize certain technology controlled by TALi for the treatment of attention or cognitive conditions in children 12 years of age and younger, in the U.S.. TALi agreed to provide us a first right of refusal to any new use or functionality for the licensed technology, including for indications or applications outside of the licensed field or age cohort.
The development and commercialization of the licensed technology are overseen by a joint steering committee comprised of an equal number of representatives from each of us and TALi. TALi is responsible for certain initial development activities with respect to certain of the licensed technology, and we must reimburse TALi for such activities up to $2.0 million. We control all other development activities and all commercialization activities with respect to the licensed technology.
Pursuant to the TALi Agreement, we are obligated to pay to TALi up to a total of $2.0 million in regulatory milestone payments and up to a total of $35.5 million in commercial milestone payments. In addition, we are obligated to pay to TALi certain tiered mid-single digit percentage royalties on annual net sales of the licensed technology in the U.S. for the term of the agreement,

subject to certain specified reductions. As of January 31, 2023, we have paid $0.1 million to TALi pursuant to the TALi Agreement.
Under the TALi Agreement, the patents in the patent family TALi has licensed to us will expire as early as 2035. The TALi Agreement will continue in effect until otherwise terminated. We may terminate the agreement for any or no reason upon notice after the completion of a clinical study approved by the joint steering committee or within 60 days after FDA marketing authorization of the TALi technology. Either party may terminate the agreement upon an uncured or uncurable material breach of the agreement by the other party, or upon the occurrence of certain events of insolvency of the other party. Additionally, TALi may also terminate the agreement if we have not consummated at least $1.0 million of sales for a product related to the licensed technology by the third anniversary of the first commercial sale of a product related to the licensed technology. However, we have the opportunity to pay TALi an amount equal to the difference between the actual sales and such threshold to avoid termination.
Government Regulation
Coverage and Reimbursement
Sales of any product depend, in part, on the extent to which such product will be covered by third-party payers, such as federal, state and foreign government healthcare programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations and the level of reimbursement for such product by third-party payers. Decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a plan-by-plan basis. These third-party payers are increasingly reducing reimbursements for medical products, drugs and services.
In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost- containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit sales of any product. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for any product or a decision by a third-party payer not to cover a product could reduce physician usage and patient demand for the product and also have a material adverse effect on sales.
Health Care Laws and Regulations
Our business operations and current and future arrangements with investigators, healthcare professionals, consultants, third-party payers, patient organizations and customers, may be subject to broadly applicable healthcare laws and regulations, including fraud and abuse laws. These laws may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we conduct our operations, including how we research, market, sell and distribute our product candidates, if approved. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include, but are not limited to:
•the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe, or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce, or in return for, either the referral of an individual, or the purchase, lease, order or recommendation of any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;
 •federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the False Claims Act (“FCA”), which can be enforced through civil “qui tam” or “whistleblower” actions and civil monetary penalty laws, impose criminal and civil penalties against individuals or entities for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment or approval from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal health care programs that are false or fraudulent; knowingly making or causing a false statement material to a false or fraudulent claim or an obligation to pay money to the federal government; or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing such an obligation. Manufacturers can be held liable under the FCA even when they do not submit claims directly to government payers if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the FCA. The FCA also permits a private individual acting as a “whistleblower” to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the FCA and to share in the proceeds of any monetary recovery; 
 •the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the 


payer (e.g., public or private) and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity can be found guilty of violating these statutes without actual knowledge of the statutes or specific intent to violate them in order to have committed a violation;
•the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, created under the ACA and its implementing regulations, which require manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to the US Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), other licensed health care practitioners and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; 
 •federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers; and 
 •analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state and foreign anti-kickback, false claims, consumer protection and unfair competition laws which may apply to pharmaceutical business practices, including but not limited to, research, distribution, sales and marketing arrangements as well as submitting claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government that otherwise restricts payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require drug manufacturers to file reports with states regarding pricing and marketing information, such as the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensations and other remuneration and items of value provided to healthcare professionals and entities; and state and local laws requiring the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives.
 In the U.S., to help patients afford our approved product, we may utilize programs to assist them, including patient assistance programs and co-pay coupon programs for eligible patients. Government enforcement agencies have shown increased interest in pharmaceutical companies' product and patient assistance programs, including reimbursement support services, and a number of investigations into these programs have resulted in significant civil and criminal settlements. In addition, at least one insurer has directed its network pharmacies to no longer accept co-pay coupons for certain specialty drugs the insurer identified. Our co-pay coupon programs could become the target of similar insurer actions. In November 2013, the CMS issued guidance to the issuers of qualified health plans sold through the ACA's marketplaces encouraging such plans to reject patient cost-sharing support from third parties and indicating that the CMS intends to monitor the provision of such support and may take regulatory action to limit it in the future. The CMS subsequently issued a rule requiring individual market qualified health plans to accept third-party premium and cost-sharing payments from certain government-related entities. In September 2014, the OIG of the HHS issued a Special Advisory Bulletin warning manufacturers that they may be subject to sanctions under the federal anti-kickback statute and/or civil monetary penalty laws if they do not take appropriate steps to exclude Part D beneficiaries from using co-pay coupons. Accordingly, companies exclude these Part D beneficiaries from using co-pay coupons. It is possible that changes in insurer policies regarding co-pay coupons and/or the introduction and enactment of new legislation or regulatory action could restrict or otherwise negatively affect these patient support programs, which could result in fewer patients using affected products, and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our sales, business, and financial condition.
 Third party patient assistance programs that receive financial support from companies have become the subject of enhanced government and regulatory scrutiny. The OIG has established guidelines that suggest that it is lawful for pharmaceutical manufacturers to make donations to charitable organizations who provide co-pay assistance to Medicare patients, provided that such organizations, among other things, are bona fide charities, are entirely independent of and not controlled by the manufacturer, provide aid to applicants on a first-come basis according to consistent financial criteria and do not link aid to use of a donor's product. However, donations to patient assistance programs have received some negative publicity and have been the subject of multiple government enforcement actions, related to allegations regarding their use to promote branded pharmaceutical products over other less costly alternatives. Specifically, in recent years, there have been multiple settlements resulting out of government claims challenging the legality of their patient assistance programs under a variety of federal and state laws.
On December 2, 2020, the HHS published a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), unless the price reduction is required by law. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between PBMs and manufacturers. Implementation of this change and new safe harbors for point-of-sale reductions in price for prescription pharmaceutical products and PBM service fees are currently under review by the current U.S. presidential administration and may be amended or repealed. Further, on December 31, 2020, CMS published a new rule, effective January 1, 2023, requiring manufacturers to ensure the full value of co-pay assistance is passed on

to the patient or these dollars will count toward the Average Manufacturer Price and Best Price calculation of the drug ("Accumulator Rule"). On May 17, 2022, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia granted the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America's (PhRMA) motion for summary judgement invalidating the Accumulator Rule. We cannot predict how the implementation of and any further changes to this rule will affect our business. Although a number of these and other proposed measures may require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, and the current U.S. presidential administration may reverse or otherwise change these measures, both the current U.S. presidential administration and Congress have indicated that they will continue to seek new legislative measures to control drug costs.
 Healthcare Reform
In 2010, the ACA was enacted, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly affected the pharmaceutical industry. The ACA contained a number of provisions, including those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement adjustments and changes to fraud and abuse laws. For example, the ACA:
•increased the minimum level of Medicaid rebates payable by manufacturers of brand name drugs from 15.1% to 23.1% of the average manufacturer price; 
 •required collection of rebates for drugs paid by Medicaid managed care organizations; and
 •imposed a non-deductible annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell “branded prescription drugs” to specified federal government programs. 
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the U.S. since the ACA was enacted. The Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers up to 2% per fiscal year.
 There has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the U.S. with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs.
 President Biden has issued multiple executive orders that have sought to reduce prescription drug costs. Although a number of these and other proposed measures may require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, and the Biden administration may reverse or otherwise change these measures, both the Biden administration and Congress have indicated that they will continue to seek new legislative measures to control drug costs.
In addition, other legislative and regulatory changes have been proposed and adopted in the U.S. since the ACA was enacted:
•The U.S. American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. 
 •On April 13, 2017, CMS published a final rule that gives states greater flexibility in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the ACA for plans sold through such marketplaces. 
 •On May 30, 2018, the Right to Try Act, was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a pharmaceutical manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act. 
 •On May 23, 2019, CMS published a final rule to allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option of using step therapy for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2020. 
 The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA includes several provisions that may impact our business to varying degrees, including provisions that reduce the out-of-pocket cap for Medicare Part D beneficiaries to $2,000 starting in 2025; impose new manufacturer financial liability on certain drugs under Medicare Part D, allow the U.S. government to negotiate Medicare Part B and Part D price caps for certain high-cost drugs and biologics without generic or biosimilar competition, require companies to pay rebates to Medicare for certain drug prices that increase faster than inflation, and delay the rebate rule that would limit the fees that pharmacy benefit managers can charge. Further, under the IRA, orphan drugs are exempted from the Medicare drug price

negotiation program, but only if they have one rare disease designation and for which the only approved indication is for that disease or condition. If a product receives multiple rare disease designations or has multiple approved indications, it may not qualify for the orphan drug exemption. The effects of the IRA on our business and the healthcare industry in general is not yet known.
 Individual states have also been increasingly active in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional health care authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other health care programs. These measures could reduce the ultimate demand for our products, once approved, or put pressure on our product pricing. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, particularly in light of the new presidential administration, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing pressures.
Data Privacy and Security Laws
Personal privacy and data security have become significant issues in the U.S., Europe, and in many other jurisdictions. The regulatory framework for privacy and security issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. Many federal, state, and foreign government bodies and agencies have adopted, or are considering adopting, laws and regulations regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information, including protected health information. These laws and regulations, including their interpretation by governmental agencies, are subject to frequent change and could have a negative impact on our business. In addition, in the future, industry requirements or guidance, contractual obligations, and/or legislation at both the federal and the state level may limit, forbid or regulate the use or transmission of health information outside of the U.S..
These varying interpretations can create complex compliance issues for us and our partners and potentially expose us to additional expense, adverse publicity and liability, any of which could adversely affect our business.
Federal and state consumer protection laws are increasingly being applied by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and states’ attorneys general to regulate the collection, use, storage and disclosure of personal or personally identifiable information, through websites or otherwise, and to regulate the presentation of website content.
The security measures that we and our third-party vendors and subcontractors have in place to ensure compliance with privacy and data protection laws may not protect our facilities and systems from security breaches, acts of vandalism or theft, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and human errors or other similar events. Even though we provide for appropriate protections through our agreements with our third-party vendors, we still have limited control over their actions and practices. A breach of privacy or security of personally identifiable health information or other personal information may result in an enforcement action, including criminal and civil liability, against us. We are not able to predict the extent of the impact such incidents may have on our business. Enforcement actions against us could be costly and could interrupt regular operations, which may adversely affect our business. While we have not received any notices of violation of the applicable privacy and data protection laws and believe we are in compliance with such laws, there can be no assurance that we will not receive such notices in the future.
There is ongoing concern from privacy advocates, regulators and others regarding data privacy and security issues, and the number of jurisdictions with data privacy and security laws has been increasing. Also, there are ongoing public policy discussions regarding whether the standards for de-identification, anonymization or pseudonymization of health information are sufficient, and the risk of re-identification sufficiently small, to adequately protect patient privacy. We expect that there will continue to be new proposed and amended laws, regulations and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection and information security in the U.S., such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (the “CCPA”), as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (the “CPRA”), which went into effect on January 1, 2023. The CCPA and the CPRA create additional obligations with respect to processing and storing personal information, as well as a new state agency that is vested with authority to implement and enforce the CCPA and the CPRA. Additionally, some observers have noted that the CCPA and CPRA could mark the beginning of a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the U.S., which could increase our potential liability and adversely affect our business. Already, in the U.S., we have witnessed significant developments at the state level. For example, on January 1, 2023, the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (the “CDPA”) became effective. Further, many additional US state privacy laws will go into effect throughout 2023: the Colorado Privacy Act (the “CPA”) (July 1, 2023); the Connecticut Data Privacy Act (the “CTDPA”) (July 1, 2023); and the Utah Consumer Privacy Act (the “UCPA”) (December 31, 2023). The CDPA, CPA, CTDPA, and UCPA are substantially similar in scope and contain many of the same requirements and exceptions as the CCPA, including a general exemption for clinical trial data and limited obligations for entities regulated by HIPAA. Any of these laws may broaden

their scope in the future, and similar laws have been proposed on both a federal level and in more than half of the states in the U.S.
A number of other states and Congress have proposed new privacy laws, some of which are similar to the above discussed recently passed laws. Such proposed legislation, if enacted, may add additional complexity, variation in requirements, restrictions and potential legal risk, require additional investment of resources in compliance programs, impact strategies and the availability of previously useful data and could result in increased compliance costs and/or changes in business practices and policies. The existence of comprehensive privacy laws in different states in the country would make our compliance obligations more complex and costly and may increase the likelihood that we may be subject to enforcement actions or otherwise incur liability for noncompliance.
Our international operations are subject to international laws and regulations, regulatory guidance, and industry standards relating to data protection, privacy, and information security. For our EU and UK future operations, this includes the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) as well as other national data protection legislation in force in relevant EU member states (including the GDPR in such form as incorporated into the law of England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 and any regulations thereunder and the UK Data Protection Act 2018 (the “UK GDPR”). The GDPR and the UK GDPR are currently still aligned but there may be further divergence in the future, including with regard to administrative burdens. The UK has announced plans to reform the country’s data protection legal framework in its Data Reform Bill, which will introduce significant changes from the GDPR. This may lead to additional compliance costs and could increase our overall risk exposure as we may no longer be able to take a unified approach across the EU and the UK.
 The GDPR and UK GDPR are wide-ranging in scope and impose numerous additional requirements on companies that process personal data, including imposing special requirements in respect of the processing of health and other sensitive data, requiring that consent of individuals to whom the personal data relates is obtained in certain circumstances, requiring disclosures to individuals regarding data processing activities, requiring that safeguards are implemented to protect the security and confidentiality of personal data, creating mandatory data breach notification requirements in certain circumstances, requiring data protection impact assessments for high risk processing and requiring that certain measures (including contractual requirements) are put in place when engaging third-party processors. The GDPR and the UK GDPR also provide individuals with various rights in respect of their personal data, including rights of access, erasure, portability, rectification, restriction and objection. The GDPR and UK GDPR define personal data to include pseudonymized or coded data and requires different informed consent practices and more detailed notices for clinical trial participants and investigators than apply to clinical trials conducted in the U.S. We are required to apply GDPR and UK GDPR standards to any clinical trials that our EU and UK established businesses carry out anywhere in the world.
The GDPR and UK GDPR impose strict rules on the transfer of personal data to countries outside the EU, including the U.S. The UK and Switzerland have adopted similar restrictions. Although the UK is regarded as a third country under the GDPR, the European Commission (“EC”) has now issued a decision recognizing the UK as providing adequate protection under the GDPR and, therefore, transfers of personal data originating in the EU to the UK remain unrestricted. Like the GDPR, the UK GDPR restricts personal data transfers outside the UK to countries not regarded by the UK as providing adequate protection. The UK government has confirmed that personal data transfers from the UK to the EU remain free flowing.
To enable the transfer of personal data outside of the EU or the UK, adequate safeguards must be implemented in compliance with European and UK data protection laws. On June 4, 2021, the EC issued new forms of standard contractual clauses for data transfers from controllers or processors in the EU (or otherwise subject to the GDPR) to controllers or processors established outside the EU (and not subject to the GDPR). The new standard contractual clauses require exporters to assess the risk of a data transfer on a case-by-case basis, including an analysis of the laws in the destination country. The UK is not subject to the EC’s new standard contractual clauses but has published a UK-specific transfer mechanism, which enables transfers from the UK. The UK-specific mechanism, the “International Data Transfer Agreement”, requires a similar risk assessment of the transfer as the standard contractual clauses. We are required to implement these new safeguards when conducting restricted data transfers under the EU and UK GDPR and doing so requires significant effort and cost.
The GDPR and UK GDPR may increase our responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process where such processing is subject to the GDPR and UK GDPR. Implementing legislation in applicable EU member states and the UK, including by seeking to establish appropriate lawful bases for the various processing activities we carry out as a controller or joint controller, reviewing security procedures and those of our vendors and collaborators, and entering into data processing agreements with relevant vendors and collaborators, we cannot be certain that our efforts to achieve and remain in compliance have been, and/or will continue to be, fully successful. Given the breadth and depth of changes in data protection obligations, preparing for and complying with the GDPR and UK GDPR and similar laws’ requirements are rigorous and time intensive and require significant resources and a review of our technologies, systems and practices, as well as those of any third-party collaborators, service providers, contractors or consultants that process or transfer personal data.

Other countries around the world in which we conduct trials or otherwise do business have also enacted strict privacy and data protection laws. For example, the Act on the Protection of Personal Information (“APPI”) of Japan regulates privacy protection issues in Japan. The APPI shares similarities with the GDPR, including extraterritorial application and obligations to provide certain notices and rights to citizens of Japan. We may be required to modify our policies, procedures, and data processing measures in order to address requirements under these or other privacy, data protection, or cyber security regimes, and may face claims, litigation, investigations, or other proceedings regarding them and may incur related liabilities, expenses, costs, and operational losses.
In addition to general privacy and data protection requirements, many jurisdictions around the world have adopted legislation that regulates how businesses operate online and enforces information security, including measures relating to privacy, data security and data breaches. Many of these laws require businesses to notify data breaches to the regulators and/or to data subjects. These laws are not consistent, and compliance in the event of a widespread data breach is costly and burdensome.
In many jurisdictions, enforcement actions and consequences for non-compliance with protection, privacy and information security laws and regulations are rising. In the EU and the UK, data protection authorities may impose large penalties for violations of the data protection laws, including potential fines of up to €20 million (£17.5 million in the UK) or 4% of annual global revenue, whichever is greater. The authorities have shown a willingness to impose significant fines and issue orders preventing the processing of personal data on non-compliant businesses. Data subjects also have a private right of action, as do consumer associations, to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies, and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations of applicable data protection laws. The APPI allows for fines of up to ¥100M for violations of the law. In the U.S., possible consequences for non-compliance include enforcement actions in response to rules and regulations promulgated under the authority of federal agencies and state attorneys general and legislatures and consumer protection agencies.
In addition, privacy advocates and industry groups have regularly proposed, and may propose in the future, self- regulatory standards that may legally or contractually apply to us. If we fail to follow these security standards, even if no customer information is compromised, we may incur significant fines or experience a significant increase in costs.
The risk of our being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that the interpretation and enforcement of them is not entirely clear. Efforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business. The shifting compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with multiple jurisdictions with different compliance and/or reporting requirements increases the possibility that a healthcare company may run afoul of one or more of the requirements.
Compliance with data protection laws and regulations could require us to take on more onerous obligations in our contracts, restrict our ability to collect, use and disclose data, or in some cases, impact our ability to operate in certain jurisdictions. It could also require us to change our business practices and put in place additional compliance mechanisms, may interrupt or delay our development, regulatory and commercialization activities and increase our cost of doing business. Failure by us or our collaborators and third-party providers to comply with data protection laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions (which could include civil or criminal penalties and orders preventing us from processing personal data), private litigation and result in significant fines and penalties against us. Moreover, clinical trial participants about whom we or our potential collaborators obtain information, as well as the providers who share this information with us, may contractually limit our ability to use and disclose the information. Claims that we have violated individuals’ privacy rights, failed to comply with data protection laws or breached our contractual obligations, even if we are not found liable, could be expensive and time-consuming to defend, could result in adverse publicity and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
U.S. Medical Device Regulations
General Requirements
Our products and product candidates are medical devices subject to extensive and ongoing regulation by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”) and its implementing regulations, as well as other federal and state regulatory bodies in the U.S. and comparable authorities in other countries under other statutes and regulations. These laws and regulations govern, among other things, product design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, storage, recordkeeping and reporting, clearance or approval, marketing, distribution, promotion, import and export and post-marketing surveillance. Failure to comply with applicable requirements may subject a device and/or its manufacturer to a variety of administrative sanctions, such as issuance of warning letters, import detentions, civil monetary penalties and/or judicial sanctions, such as product seizures, injunctions and criminal prosecution.

In the U.S., medical devices considered to be moderate to high risk by FDA generally require premarket review and marketing authorization from the FDA prior to commercial distribution. The primary types of FDA marketing authorization applicable to a medical device are clearance of a premarket notification (also called 510(k) clearance), approval of a premarket approval application (”PMA”), or grant of a de novo request for classification, or de novo grant. Each 510(k), PMA, or de novo request must be accompanied by a user fee, although the fee may be waived under certain circumstances.
Each product candidate we seek to commercially distribute in the U.S. will require either a prior de novo classification grant, 510(k) clearance, unless it is exempt, or a PMA from the FDA under its medical device authorities.
510(k) Clearance Process
Under the FDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes – Class I, Class II or Class III – depending on the degree of risk associated with the device and the level of control necessary to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness.
Class I devices are those for which safety and effectiveness can be reasonably assured by adherence to a set of regulations referred to as General Controls, which require compliance with the applicable portions of FDA’s Quality System Regulation (“QSR”), facility registration and device listing, reporting of adverse events and malfunctions, which is referred to as medical device reporting, and appropriate, truthful and non-misleading labeling and promotional materials. Most Class I devices are exempt from the premarket notification requirements.
Class II devices are those that are subject to General Controls, as well as Special Controls, which can include performance standards, specialized labeling and post-market surveillance. Most Class II devices are subject to the premarket notification requirements.
To obtain 510(k) clearance, a manufacturer must submit a premarket notification, or 510(k), to the FDA and demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction that the proposed device is “substantially equivalent” to a previously 510(k)-cleared device or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 for which the FDA has not yet called for the submission of a PMA. The previously cleared device is known as a predicate device. A proposed device is substantially equivalent if, with respect to the predicate device, it has the same intended use and has either (i) the same technological characteristics or (ii) different technological characteristics and does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness, and the information submitted to the FDA that the device is substantially equivalent to the predicate device contains information that demonstrates that the proposed device is as safe and effective as a legally marketed device.
Before the FDA will accept a 510(k) for substantive review, the FDA will first assess whether the submission satisfies a minimum threshold of acceptability to ensure that the 510(k) is administratively complete. The acceptance review, which occurs prior to the substantive review, is generally conducted and completed within 15 calendar days of the FDA receiving the 510(k). If the FDA determines that the 510(k) is incomplete, the FDA will issue a “Refuse to Accept” letter which generally outlines the information the FDA believes is necessary to permit a substantive review and to reach a determination regarding substantial equivalence. The 510(k) submitter must submit the requested information within 180 days before the FDA will proceed with additional review of the submission. As specified in FDA’s Medical Device User Fee Amendments of 2022 (“MDUFA V”) commitment letter, which defines performance goals for the FDA for fiscal years 2023 through 2027, the FDA aims to review and issue a determination on most 510(k)s within 90 FDA Days, although clearance often takes longer in practice. “FDA Days” are those calendar days when a submission is considered to be under review at the FDA for submissions that have been accepted or filed, as applicable. The FDA may require additional information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence.
If the FDA determines that the device is “not substantially equivalent” to a previously cleared device, for example, due to a finding of a lack of a predicate device, or that the proposed device has a new intended use or different technological characteristic that raise different questions of safety or effectiveness when the proposed device is compared to the cited predicate device, the device is automatically designated as a Class III device. The device sponsor must then fulfill more rigorous PMA requirements, or can request a risk-based classification determination for the device in accordance with the de novo process.
Alternatively, if the FDA determines that the information provided in a 510(k) is insufficient to demonstrate substantial equivalence to the predicate device, the FDA generally identifies the specific information that is needed so that the FDA may complete its evaluation of substantial equivalence, and such information may be provided by the 510(k) sponsor within the time allotted by the FDA or in a new 510(k) should the original 510(k) be withdrawn.
If the FDA agrees that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device currently on the market, it will grant 510(k) clearance to commercially market the device. After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change or modification in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance, or depending on the modification, PMA approval. The determination as to whether or not a modification could significantly affect the device’s safety or effectiveness is initially left to the manufacturer. Many minor modifications are accomplished by a “letter to file” in which the manufacturer documents the rationale for the change and why a new 510(k) is not required. However, the FDA may review such letters to file to evaluate the regulatory status of the modified

device at any time and may require the manufacturer to cease marketing and recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA approval is obtained. The manufacturer may also be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties for marketing a modified device without the requisite 510(k) clearance or PMA approval.
De Novo Classification Process
For novel medical devices that are low to moderate risk and are not substantially equivalent to a predicate device, a manufacturer may request a risk-based classification determination, called a “Request for Evaluation of Automatic Class III Designation,” for the device in accordance with de novo classification process. This procedure allows a de novo requester whose novel device is automatically classified into Class III to request down-classification of its medical device into Class I or Class II on the basis that the device presents low or moderate risk, rather than requiring the submission and approval of a PMA. A requestor may submit a de novo request for classification after receiving a “not substantially equivalent” determination in response to a 510(k) submission. Alternatively, a requestor may submit a de novo request absent the submission of a 510(k) when the sponsor determines that there is no legally marketed device upon which to base a determination of substantial equivalence. Under the FDCA, FDA must make a classification determination for the device that is the subject of a de novo request within 120 days of receipt of the request. However, as specified in FDA’s MDUFA V commitment letter, the FDA’s goal is to make a decision on most de novo requests within 150 FDA Days, although in practice the FDA’s review may take significantly longer. During the pendency of FDA’s review, the FDA may issue an additional information letter, which places the de novo request on hold and stops the review clock pending receipt of the additional information requested. In the event the de novo requestor does not provide the requested information within 180 calendar days, the FDA will consider the de novo request to be withdrawn.
The FDA may reject the de novo request if it identifies a legally marketed predicate device that would be appropriate for a 510(k) or determines that the device is not low to moderate risk or that General Controls would be inadequate to control the risks and Special Controls cannot be developed. In the event the FDA determines that the data and information submitted demonstrate that General Controls or General and Special Controls are adequate to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness, the FDA will grant the de novo request and a classification regulation will be established for the device type. When the FDA grants a de novo request for classification, the device is granted marketing authorization and can further serve as a predicate device for a future 510(k) by any person for future devices of that type.
PMA Process
Class III devices include devices deemed by FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-supporting or life- sustaining devices, or implantable devices, in addition to those deemed not substantially equivalent following the 510(k) process. The safety and effectiveness of Class III devices cannot be reasonably assured solely by the General Controls and Special Controls described above. With few exceptions for certain types of devices classified into Class III that were in commercial distribution in the U.S. before May 28, 1976, Class III devices are subject to the PMA process, which is generally more costly and time consuming than the 510(k) process. The PMA process requires proof of safety and effectiveness of the device to the FDA’s satisfaction.
After a PMA is submitted, the FDA has 45 days to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review and thus whether the FDA will file the application for review. Under the FDCA, the FDA has 180 days to review a filed PMA, although the review of an application generally occurs over a significantly longer period of time and can take up to several years. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of the information already provided. Also, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. Although the FDA is not bound by the advisory panel decision, the panel’s recommendations are important to the FDA’s overall decision making process. In addition, the FDA may conduct a preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with QSR requirements. The agency also may inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with FDA’s regulations.
Upon completion of the PMA review, the FDA may: (i) approve the PMA which authorizes commercial marketing with specific prescribing information for one or more indications, which can be more limited than those originally sought; (ii) issue an approvable letter which indicates the FDA’s belief that the PMA is approvable and states what additional information the FDA requires, or the post-approval commitments that must be agreed to prior to approval; (iii) issue a not approvable letter which outlines steps required for approval, but which are typically more onerous than those in an approvable letter, and may require additional clinical trials that are often expensive and time consuming and can delay approval for months or even years; or (iv) deny the application. If the FDA issues an approvable or not approvable letter, the applicant has 180 days to respond, after which the FDA’s review clock is reset.
Approval by the FDA of original PMAs or PMA supplements may be required for modifications to the manufacturing process, labeling, device specifications, materials or design of a device that is approved through the PMA process. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as an original PMA, except that the supplement is limited to information

needed to support any changes from the device covered by the approved PMA and may or may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel.
Exempt Devices
If a manufacturer’s device falls into a generic category of Class I or Class II devices that FDA has exempted by regulation, a premarket notification is not required before marketing the device in the U.S. Manufacturers of such devices are required to comply with FDA’s General Controls, including FDA’s establishment registration and device listing requirements. Some 510(k)-exempt devices are also exempt from QSR requirements, except for the QSR’s complaint handling and recordkeeping requirements.
Clinical Trials
Clinical trials are almost always required to support a PMA or de novo request and are sometimes required for a 510(k). For significant risk devices, the FDA regulations require submission of an application for an investigational device exemption (“IDE”) to the FDA prior to commencement of a human clinical investigation. A nonsignificant risk device does not require the submission of an IDE application; however, the clinical trial must still be conducted in compliance with certain requirements of FDA’s IDE regulations. An IDE application is considered approved 30 calendar days after it has been received by the FDA, unless the FDA informs the sponsor prior to the 30 days that the IDE is approved, approved with conditions, or disapproved.
An IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE application must also include a description of product manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. The FDA typically grants IDE approval for a specified number of patients to be treated at specific study centers. The FDA’s approval of an IDE allows clinical testing to go forward but does not bind the FDA to accept the results of the trial as sufficient to prove the device’s safety and efficacy, even if the trial meets its intended success criteria.
During the study, the sponsor must comply with the FDA’s IDE requirements for investigator selection, trial monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping. The investigators must rigorously follow the investigational plan and study protocol, control the disposition of investigational devices, and comply with all reporting and recordkeeping requirements. These IDE requirements apply to all investigational devices, whether considered a significant or nonsignificant risk.
Clinical trials must further comply with the FDA’s regulations for approval by an institutional review board (IRB) and for informed consent and other human subject protections. The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial subjects. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions.
Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes for public dissemination on the ClinicalTrials.gov website. Required records and reports are subject to inspection by the FDA. The results of clinical testing may be unfavorable or, even if the intended safety and efficacy success criteria are achieved, may not be considered sufficient for the FDA to grant clearance or approval of a device.
Post-Market Regulation
After a device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include:
•establishment registration and device listing; 
 •compliance with FDA’s QSR requirements; 
 •labeling regulations; 
 •medical device reporting regulations, which, for example, require that manufacturers report to the FDA if a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur; 


•voluntary and mandatory device recalls to address problems when a device is defective and/or could be a risk to health; and 
 •corrections and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health. 
 Also, the FDA may require manufacturers of certain devices to conduct post-market surveillance studies or order such manufacturers to establish and maintain a system for tracking their devices through the chain of distribution to the patient level. The FDA enforces regulatory requirements, such as those set forth in the QSR, by conducting periodic, unannounced inspections and market surveillance.
Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, including those applicable to the conduct of clinical trials, can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may lead to any of the following sanctions:
•warning letters or untitled letters that require corrective action; 
 •fines, injunctions and civil penalties; 
 •recall or seizure of products; 
 •operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production; 
 •withdrawing PMA approvals already granted; and 
 •criminal prosecution. 
 Labeling and promotional activities are subject to scrutiny by FDA and, in certain circumstances, by the Federal Trade Commission. Medical devices approved or cleared by FDA may not be promoted for unapproved or uncleared uses, otherwise known as “off-label” promotion. FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including substantial monetary penalties and criminal prosecution.
FCPA and Other Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Laws
The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) prohibits U.S. corporations and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. The scope of the FCpPA would include interactions with certain health care professionals in many countries. We maintain a compliance program designed to comply with the FCPA and anti-bribery laws and regulations applicable to our business. Our present and future business has been and will continue to be subject to various other U.S. and foreign laws, rules and/or regulations.
International Regulation
International sales of medical devices are subject to foreign government regulations, which may vary substantially from country to country. The time required to obtain approval in a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval or clearance, and the requirements may differ. There is a trend towards harmonization of quality system standards among the European Union, U.S., Canada and various other industrialized countries.
The primary regulatory body in Europe is that of the European Union, which includes most of the major countries in Europe. Other countries, such as Switzerland, have voluntarily adopted laws and regulations that mirror those of the European Union with respect to medical devices. The European Union has adopted numerous directives and standards regulating the design, manufacture, clinical trials, labeling and adverse event reporting for medical devices. Devices that comply with the requirements of a relevant directive will be entitled to bear the CE conformity marking, indicating that the device conforms to the essential requirements of the applicable directives and, accordingly, can be commercially distributed throughout Europe. The method of assessing conformity varies depending on the class of the product, but normally involves a combination of self-assessment by the manufacturer and a third-party assessment by a “Notified Body.” This third-party assessment may consist of an audit of the manufacturer’s quality system and specific testing of the manufacturer’s product. An assessment by a Notified Body of one country within the European Union is required in order for a manufacturer to commercially distribute the product throughout the European Union. Outside of the European Union, regulatory approval needs to be sought on a country-by-country basis in order for us to market our products. The European Union regulatory bodies finalized a new Medical Device Regulation (“MDR”) in 2017, which replaced the existing Directives on May 26, 2021 and provided three years for transition and compliance. However, in response to concerns raised about Notified Body capacity and the ability for devices to be re-certified within such time period,

the EC has adopted a proposal to extend the transition period by some years, depending on the risk class of the device. Such proposal is currently being considered for adoption by the European Parliament and Council. The MDR has changed several aspects of the regulatory framework for medical devices.
Outside the U.S. a range of anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, as well as some industry-specific laws and codes of conduct, apply to the medical device industry and interactions with government officials and entities and health care professionals. Further, the EU member countries have emphasized a greater focus on healthcare fraud and abuse and have indicated greater attention to the industry by the European Anti-Fraud Office. MedTech Europe, the medical device industry association, also introduced the Code of Ethical Business Practices, which came into effect on January 1, 2017. Countries in Asia have also become more active in their enforcement of anti-bribery laws and with respect to procurement and supply chain fraud.
Employees and Human Capital
At Akili, we are passionate about bringing together elements of science, technology and entertainment, along with a great user experience, to change how medicine is designed and delivered. We represent a combination of backgrounds and skills that are not typically found together in a single company, bringing talent together from various industries including biotech, medical device, entertainment and engineering. Aligning such a diverse group around this lofty goal requires a unique culture—one that is inclusive, bold and creative.
In response to the dramatic shift in the economic environment, we took decisive action to become a more capital-efficient company and, in January 2023, made the difficult decision to announce a workforce reduction of approximately 30% of our employees. The cost reduction efforts related to this announcement include scaling back budgets and operating expenses, restructuring teams, and reprioritizing our clinical pipeline to increase efficiency – and a necessary but difficult part of this was parting ways with 46 colleagues and friends. We made it a priority to treat outgoing employees with respect and announced a severance package for these employees that included severance payment of at least two months’ salary, plus additional compensation in recognition of employee contributions. The severance package also extended exercise deadlines for vested stock options and helped pay for any elected COBRA healthcare benefits during the length of severance. We also made available services from a professional career and job placement company for all employees impacted.
 As of February 1, 2023 we had 109 full-time employees, of which ten have M.D., D.Phil. or Ph.D. degrees. Of our full-time employees, 40 were engaged in research and development activities and 69 were engaged in commercial activities, business development, finance and general management and administration. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
 Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, motivating and integrating our existing and future employees. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and motivate selected employees, consultants and directors through grants of stock-based compensation awards and payments of cash-based performance bonus awards, in order to increase stockholder value and the success of our company by motivating our employees to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives.
