 Item 1.  Business.
 (a) General Development of Business.  North European Oil Royalty Trust (the "Trust") is a grantor trust which, on behalf of the owners of beneficial interest in the Trust (the "unit owners"), holds overriding royalty rights covering gas and oil production in certain concessions or leases in the Federal Republic of Germany. The rights are held under contracts with local German exploration and development subsidiaries of ExxonMobil Corp. ("ExxonMobil") and the Royal Dutch/Shell Group of Companies ("Royal Dutch/Shell Group"). Under these contracts, the Trust receives various percentage royalties on the proceeds of the sales of certain products from the areas involved. At the present time, royalties are received for sales of gas well gas, oil well gas, crude oil, condensate and sulfur. See Item 2 of this Report for descriptions of the relationships of these companies and certain of these contracts.
 The royalty rights were received by the Trust from North European Oil Company (the "Company") upon dissolution of the Company in September 1975. The Company was organized in 1957 as the successor to North European Oil Corporation (the "Corporation"). The Trust is administered by trustees (the "Trustees") under an Agreement of Trust dated September 10, 1975, as amended (the "Trust Agreement").
 Neither the Trust nor the Trustees on behalf of the Trust conduct any active business activities or operations. The function of the Trustees is to monitor, verify, collect, hold, invest and distribute the royalty payments made to the Trust. Under the Trust Agreement, the Trustees make quarterly distributions of the net funds received by the Trust on behalf of the unit owners. Funds temporarily held by the Trust prior to their distribution are invested in interest bearing bank deposits, money market accounts, certificates of deposit, U.S. Treasury Bills or other government obligations.
 There has been no significant change in the principal operation or purpose of the Trust during the past fiscal year. 
 As part of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 ("SOX"), the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") adopted rules implementing legislation concerning governance matters for publicly held entities. The Trust is complying with the requirements of the SEC and SOX and, at this time, the Trustees have chosen not to request any relief from those provisions based on the passive nature of the Trust but may do so in the future. In that connection, the Trustees have directed that certain of the additional statements and disclosures set forth or incorporated by reference in this Report, which the SEC requires of corporations, be made even though some of such statements and disclosures might not now or in the future be required to be made by the Trust.
 In addition, the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE"), where units of beneficial interest of the Trust are listed for trading, has additional corporate governance rules as set forth in Section 303A of the NYSE Listed Company Manual. Most of the governance requirements promulgated by the NYSE are not applicable to the Trust, which is a passive entity acting as a royalty trust and holds only overriding royalty rights. The Trustees have, however, chosen to constitute an Audit Committee and a Compensation Committee but may not necessarily continue to do so in the future.
 (b) Narrative Description of Business.  Under the Trust Agreement, the Trust conducts no active business operations and is restricted to collection of income from royalty rights and distribution to unit owners of the net income after payment of administrative and related expenses.
 The overriding royalty rights held by the Trust are derived from contracts and agreements originally entered into by German subsidiaries of the predecessor Corporation during the early 1930s. The Trust's primary royalty rights are based on government granted concessions and remain in effect as long as there are continued production activities and/or exploration efforts within the concession. It is generally anticipated that production activities will continue as long as they remain economically profitable. The Trust holds other royalty rights, which are based on leases which have passed their original expiration dates. These leases remain in effect as long as there is continued production or the lessor does not cancel the lease. Individual lessors will normally not seek termination of the rights originally granted because the leases provide for royalty payments to the lessors if sales of oil or gas result from discoveries made on the leased land. Additionally, termination by individual lessors would result in the escheat of mineral rights to the applicable state.
 Royalties are paid to the Trust on sales from production under these leases and concessions on a regular monthly or quarterly basis pursuant to the royalty agreements. The Trust receives the royalty payments exclusively in Euros. After the royalties have been deposited in the Trust's account with Deutsche Bank in Germany, sufficient funds are reserved to handle any outstanding or anticipated expenses and maintain a minimal balance of 10,000 Euros. The Trust's standing instructions with Deutsche Bank are then executed converting the remainder of Euro denominated funds into U.S. dollars based upon the available exchange rates. Following this conversion to U.S. dollars, the royalties are automatically transferred to the Trust's bank account in the U.S. The Trust does not engage in activities to hedge against currency risk; and the fluctuations in the conversion rate impact its financial results. Since the actual royalty deposits are held as Euros for such a limited time, the market risk with respect to these deposits is small. The Trust has not experienced any difficulty in effecting the conversion of Euros into U.S. dollars.
 As the holder of overriding royalty rights, the Trust has no legal ability, whether by contract or operation of law, to compel production or exploration. Moreover, if an operator should determine to terminate production in any concession or lease area and to surrender the concession or lease, the royalty rights for that area would thereby be terminated. Under certain royalty agreements, it is a requirement that the Trust be advised of any intention to surrender lease or concession rights. While the Trust itself is precluded from undertaking any production activities, possible residual rights might permit the Trust to take up a surrendered concession or lease and attempt to retain a third-party operator to develop such concession or lease. There is no assurance that the Trust could find such a third party.
 The exploration for and the production of gas and oil is a speculative business. The Trust has no means of ensuring continued income from its royalty rights at either their present levels or otherwise. The Trust has no role in any of the operating companies' decision-making processes, such as gas pricing, gas sales or exploration, which can impact royalty income. In addition, fluctuations in prices and supplies of gas and oil and the effect these fluctuations might have on royalty income to the Trust and on reserves net to the Trust cannot be accurately projected. Finally, natural gas and crude oil are wasting assets. While known reserves may increase as additional development adds quantities to the reserve amount, the amount of known and unknown reserves is finite and will decline over time. Given these factors, along with the uncertainty in worldwide and local German economic conditions and the fact that the Trustees have no information beyond that information which is generally available to the public, the Trustees make no projections regarding future royalty income.
 While Germany has laws relating to environmental protection, the Trustees do not have detailed information concerning the present or possible effect of such laws on operations in areas where the Trust holds royalty rights on production and sale of products from those areas. The Trustees were informed by the Trust's German consultant that on July 8, 2016, a hydraulic fracturing ("fracking") law was passed in Germany permitting fracking in sandstone at any depth. The law requires that an environmental impact study be performed and that permission by the relevant water authority be granted in order to ensure the protection of drinking water supplies. Based upon an analysis of the details of this law, the Trust's German consultant has informed the Trust that fracking will be permitted in all current productive zones within the Oldenburg concession both due to the depths involved and the nature of the productive zones. However, the operating companies would still have to comply with all regulatory requirements governing the use of fracking. The failure by the operating companies to comply with all regulatory requirements could affect the volume of gas, sulfur and oil production by the operating companies and could adversely affect the royalties paid to the Trust. 
 The Trust, in cooperation with a parallel royalty owner (Unitarian Universalist Congregation at Shelter Rock)("UUCSR")), arranges for periodic examinations of the books and records of the operating companies to verify compliance with the computation provisions of the applicable agreements. As a cost savings measure, the royalty examination is conducted on a biennial basis. From time to time, these examinations disclose computational errors or errors from inappropriate application of existing agreements and appropriate adjustments are requested to be made. As a result of the amendments to the Trust's royalty agreements which effect pricing simplification (see Item 7 of this Report), examinations by the Trust's German accountants have been simplified since these examinations are primarily limited to the verification of the gas quantities sold. Although these periodic examinations may also disclose other matters that are subject to dispute between the parties, these disputes have historically been resolved through negotiations without the need for litigation. The Trust's accountants in Germany began their examination of the operating companies for calendar 2017 and 2018 in November 2019 when the final sales figures and the German Border Import gas Prices (see Item 7 of this Report) became available.
 (c) Financial Information about Geographic Areas.  In Item 2 of this Report, there is a schedule (by product, geographic area and operating company) showing the royalty income received by the Trust during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2019.
 (d) Information about our Trustees and Executive Officers.  As specified in the Trust Agreement, the affairs of the Trust are managed by not more than five individual Trustees who receive compensation determined under that same agreement. One of the Trustees is designated as Managing Trustee. Robert P. Adelman has served in a non-executive capacity as Managing Trustee since November 1, 2006.
 Ahron H. Haspel is independent and has been determined to be a financial expert (both as defined in the SEC rules). Mr. Haspel serves as Chairman for the Audit and Compensation Committees. Lawrence A. Kobrin serves as Clerk to the Trustees (a role similar to that of a corporate secretary). For these services, these three individuals receive additional compensation.
 Day-to-day matters are handled by the Managing Director, John R. Van Kirk, who also serves as CEO and CFO. John R. Van Kirk has held the position of Managing Director of the Trust since November 1990. As a cost saving measure, the Trust shifted to a virtual office in fiscal 2019. This shift has not and is not expected to impact the operations or administration of the Trust. In addition to the Managing Director, the Trust has one administrative employee in the United States, whose title is Administrator.
 The Trust and UUCSR have retained the services of a consultant, an accounting firm and a legal firm in Germany. The consultant has broad experience in the petroleum industry and provides reports on a regular basis. The accounting firm and the legal firm advise and represent as needed. The Trust and the co-royalty holder share the costs of these services in Germany.
 (e) Available Information.  The Trust maintains a website at www.neort.com. The Trust's Annual Reports, Form 10-K annual reports, Form 10-Q quarterly reports and the Definitive Proxy Statements are available through the Trust's website as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports are filed with or furnished to the SEC. Press releases and tax letters are available through the website as soon as practicable after release. The North European Oil Royalty Trust Agreement (as amended), the Trust's Code of Conduct and Business Ethics, the Trustees' Regulations and the Trust's Audit Committee Charter are also available through the Trust's website. The Trust's website and the information contained in it and connected to it shall not be deemed incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K.
