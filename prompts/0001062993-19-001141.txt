ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
General 
 We were incorporated on July 17, 2006 under the laws of British Columbia, Canada under the name Golden Predator Mines Inc. We were incorporated as a wholly owned subsidiary of Energy Metals Corp. for the purpose of holding precious metals and certain specialty metals assets. In order to focus on specialty metals, during February 2009 we transferred most of our precious mineral assets to our then wholly-owned subsidiary Golden Predator Corp., and on March 6, 2009 we completed a spin-out of Golden Predator Corp. to our shareholders. Effective March 12, 2009, we changed our name to EMC Metals Corp. In order to reflect a new emphasis on mining for scandium minerals, effective November 19, 2014, we changed our name to Scandium International Mining Corp (SCY or the Company). 
 We are a reporting issuer in the Canadian Provinces of British Columbia, Alberta and Ontario and our common shares are listed for trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the trading symbol SCY.
 Our head office is located at 1430 Greg Street, Suite 501, Sparks, Nevada 89431. The address of our registered office is 1200 - 750 West Pender Street, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, V6C 2T8.
 Our focus of operations is the development of the Nyngan scandium project located in New South Wales, Australia (the Nyngan Scandium Project). We also hold a scandium mineral property located nearby Nyngan known as the Honeybugle Scandium property and a reservation on an exploration license in Finland, known as the Kiviniemi Scandium property. 
 Our plan of operation for the remainder of 2019 is to obtain offtake sales agreements with counterparties for Nyngan Scandium Project product and seek additional funding for project construction and corporate working capital. We plan to conduct exploration activities at the Kiviniemi Scandium property and also continue to test and develop unique scandium recovery and finishing techniques, including the processing of intermediate scandium aluminum products.

Recent History 
 Nyngan Feasibility Study 
 On April 18, 2016, the Company announced the results of an independently prepared feasibility study on the Nyngan Scandium Project. The technical report on the feasibility study entitled Feasibility Study  Nyngan Scandium Project, Bogan Shire, NSW, Australia is dated May 4, 2016 and was independently compiled pursuant to the requirements of NI 43-101. The report was filed on May 6, 2016 and is available on SEDAR (www.sedar.com) and on the Companys website (www.scandiummining.com) and the SECs website (www.sec.gov). A summary of the report is provided herein under Item 2. Properties  Description of Mineral Projects  Nyngan Scandium Project  Nyngan Feasibility Study.
 Transactions with Scandium Investments LLC
 On June 24, 2014, SCY entered into a $2.5 million loan facility with Scandium Investments LLC (SIL), a company owned by a US private investor group (the 2014 Loan). In accordance with the terms of the 2014 Loan, the outstanding principal and interest were converted in 2015 into a 20% ownership interest in EMC Metals Australia Pty Ltd (EMC Australia), with SCY holding an 80% ownership interest. EMC Australia holds our interests in the Nyngan Scandium Project and Honeybugle Scandium property. As a result, from Q3 2015 until October 2017, EMC Australia was operated as a joint venture between SIL and SCY with SIL holding a carried interest in the Nyngan Scandium Project until the Company met certain development milestones. The Company completed the development milestones during May 2017 and triggered a limited period option whereby SIL had a right to convert the fair market value of its 20% interest in EMC Australia into an equivalent value of SCY common shares, at then prevailing market prices. 
 In June of 2017, the Company entered into a share exchange agreement with SIL for the purchase of SILs 20% interest in EMC Australia in exchange for 57,371,565 common shares of SCY as well as an additional 1,459,080 common shares as a royalty adjustment payment. Closing of the purchase of the EMC Australia shares was subject to shareholder approval, which the Company obtained at a special meeting of shareholders held on September 11, 2017. The transaction subsequently closed on October 9, 2017. Under the terms of the share purchase agreement, SIL was granted the right to nominate two individuals to the board of the Company for so long as SIL held at least 15% of SCYs issued and outstanding shares, and one director for so long as they held at least 5% but less than 15% of SCYs issued and outstanding shares. Pursuant to the nomination rights, Peter Evensen and R. Christian Evensen were appointed as directors to the SCY Board on closing of the transaction. 
 Business Operations 
 Company Summary 
 We are a mineral exploration and development company that is primarily focused on the development of scandium mineral resources, and scandium end-use markets, through identification of value-added applications for scandium in aluminum alloys and end products. The Company has also considered exploration and development interest in rare earth minerals, and other specialty metals, including nickel, cobalt, boron, manganese, tantalum, titanium and zirconium. We have not commenced development of any of our scandium projects, and as a result we are an exploration stage company.
 We have established a 16.9 million tonne measured and indicated resource on the Nyngan property (grading 235ppm at a 100ppm cut-off) and we have also established a 1.43 million tonne mineral reserve (combined proven and probable) on the Nyngan Scandium Project, based on economics presented in our 2016 feasibility study.

Our principal project is the Nyngan Scandium Project located in New South Wales, Australia, over which we own 100% of the mineral rights, including exploration licenses and a mining lease grant on the portion of the property that corresponds to the feasibility study development. In April 2014, we also acquired an exploration license referred to as the Honeybugle Scandium property, a prospective scandium exploration property located 24 kilometers from the Nyngan Scandium Project. During August 2018, we were granted an exploration license for the Kiviniemi Scandium property in central Finland from the Finnish regulatory body governing mineral exploration and mining in Finland.
 Corporate Objectives and Strategy 
 Our corporate focus is to produce and sell scandium (Sc) and scandium-based products. None of our current properties has advanced to the development or production stage and we are currently an exploration stage company. We have completed an independently prepared definitive feasibility study (DFS) of the Nyngan Scandium Project. Subject to successfully financing of construction costs, we intend to develop the Nyngan Scandium Project for production, with a view to supplying anticipated future demand for scandium oxide and scandium-content materials. For further information on the Nyngan Scandium Project, please refer to Item 2. Properties - Description of Mineral Projects  Nyngan Scandium Project and Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 Concurrently with our analysis of the Nyngan Scandium Project, we are developing and testing unique mineral recovery techniques as well as techniques to produce high quality intermediate scandium-content aluminum alloy products. If effective at a commercial level, these mineral recovery techniques, scandia finishing techniques and intermediate product developments are expected to provide increased economic margins and returns on capital on any future scandium production.
 Presently our recovery and finishing technology is completed to a degree that supports engineering and flow sheet design for our +15%/-5% DFS, although further development work will continue in both areas. There is no guarantee that we will be able to benefit from the commercial application of such techniques or that we will have scandium production in the future. 
 Global Scandium Production and Market
 Scandium is the 31st most abundant element in the earths crust (average 33 ppm), which makes it more common than lead, mercury and precious metals, but less common than copper. Scandium has characteristics that are similar to rare earth elements, and it is often classified as a member of that group, although it is technically a light transition metal. Scandium occurs in nature as an oxide, rarely occurs in concentrated quantities because it does not selectively combine with the common ore-forming anions, and is very difficult to reduce to a pure metal state. Scandium is typically produced and sold as scandium oxide (Sc2O3), more properly known as scandia.
 Global annual production estimates of scandium range from 10 tonnes to 15 tonnes, but accurate statistics are not available due to the lack of public information from countries in which scandium is currently being produced. There are five known, primary production sources globally today: stockpiles from the former Zhovti Voty uranium mine in Ukraine, the rare earth mine at Bayan Obo in China, apatite mines on the Kola Peninsula in Russia, by-product production from titanium dioxide (TiO2) pigment refiners in China, and recent start-up production of scandium oxide concentrates from the Taganito Nickel Mine in the Philippines (Sumitomo Metal Mining Co., Ltd.)

There is no reliable pricing data on global scandium oxide trading. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) in its latest report (February 2018) documents the 2017 price of scandium oxide (99.99% grade) at US$4,600/kg, indicating no change from the 2016 price estimate. Small quantities of scandium oxide are currently offered on the internet by traders for prices at this level, although product of slightly lower grade is commonly available at considerably lower prices. Scandium oxide grades of 95% or greater are considered commercially suitable, with 99.9% grade used for electrical applications, and grades higher than 99.9% reserved for science and new technical applications. Scandium oxide grades of 95-99% are generally considered suitable for aluminum alloy applications.
 Scandium oxide is typically traded in small quantities, between private parties, and pricing is not transparent to other buyers or sellers as there is no clearing facility as is more common with commercially traded metals and commodities. Prices do vary, based on purity and quantity supplied. Small sale quantities tend to command premium prices, and large quantities (over one tonne) are simply not available to establish appropriate commercial pricing. 
 Scandium can also be effectively purchased in the form of aluminum-scandium (Al-Sc) master alloy, typically containing 2% scandium by weight. This product is tailored for use in aluminum alloy production containing scandium. The 2017 USGS report indicates the 2017 price for Al-Sc 2% master alloy at US$350/kg. This 2017 price estimate represents a slightly higher estimate than the 2015 USGS average. USGS estimated prices for Al-Sc 2% master alloy over the last five years show significant year-by-year volatility, ranging from a low of US$ 220/kg (2012) to a high of US$386/kg (2014).
 Principal uses for scandium are in high-strength aluminum alloys, high-intensity metal halide lamps, electronics, and laser research. Recently developed applications include welding wire and fuel cells which are expected to be in future demand. Approximately 15 different commercial aluminum-scandium alloys have been developed, and some of them are used for aerospace applications. In Europe and the U.S., scandium-containing alloys have been evaluated for use in structural parts in commercial airplanes and high stress parts in automobile engines and brake systems. Military and aerospace applications are known to be of interest, although with less specificity. The combination of high strength, weldability and ductility makes aluminum-scandium alloys potentially attractive replacements for existing aluminum alloys in a number of applications where improved alloy properties can add value to final products. 
 Competitive Conditions
 We compete with numerous other companies and individuals in the search for and the acquisition or control of attractive rare earth and specialty metals mineral properties. Our ability to acquire further properties will depend not only on our ability to operate and develop our properties but also on our ability to select and acquire suitable properties or prospects for development or mineral exploration.
 In regard to our plan to produce scandium, there are a limited number of scandium producers presently. If we are successful at becoming a producer of scandium, our ability to be competitive will require that we establish a reliable supply of scandium to the market, delivered at purity levels demanded by various applications, and that our operating costs generate margins at prices that will be set by customers and competitors in a market yet to mature.
 Governmental Regulations and Environmental Laws
The development of any of our properties, and specifically the Nyngan Scandium Project, will require numerous local and national government approvals and environmental permits. For further information about governmental approvals and permitting requirements, please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors.
