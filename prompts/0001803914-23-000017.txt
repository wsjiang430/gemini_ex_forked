Overview
We are a pleasure and leisure company. We provide consumers around the world with products, content and experiences that help them lead happier, healthier and more fulfilling lives. Our flagship consumer brand, Playboy, is one of the most recognizable brands in the world, driving billions of dollars annually in global consumer spending with products and content available in approximately 180 countries.
Our mission — to create a culture where all people can pursue pleasure — builds upon almost seven decades of creating groundbreaking media and hospitality experiences and fighting for cultural progress rooted in the core values of equality, freedom of expression and the idea that pleasure is a fundamental human right.
Driven by our cause of “Pleasure for All,” our goal is to build the leading pleasure and leisure lifestyle platform for all people around the world.
For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, our consolidated revenue was $266.9 million and $246.6 million, respectively, and our consolidated net loss was $277.7 million and $77.7 million, respectively. Our consolidated net loss for the year ended December 31, 2022 was largely driven by non-cash asset impairment charges of $308.2 million related to the write-down of goodwill, trademarks and certain other assets in the third quarter of 2022.
Our Products
Our products and content connect consumers to a lifestyle of pleasure and leisure. Our offerings help consumers around the world look good, feel good, and enjoy their lives. Our offerings are focused on areas where nearly 70 years of building consumer trust give us a unique position to lead:
•Sexual Wellness is a category that encompasses products, content and experiences that enable a state of physical, emotional, mental, and social sexual health and fulfillment. Offerings include products that enhance sexual experience, lingerie, bedroom accessories and intimacy products, as well as offerings that improve sexual health. Our sexual wellness offerings today include lingerie, intimates and other adult products.
•Style and Apparel includes a variety of apparel and accessories products for men and women globally, including one of the leading men’s apparel brands in China, and collaborations with fashion and streetwear brands such as PacSun, Yves Saint Laurent and Lids available to consumers in the US and UK. Our style and apparel offerings build on seven decades of standing for free expression.
•Digital Entertainment and Lifestyle is a category that encompasses all the ways we stand for sophisticated, fun and leisure-filled living. Our content creator platform on playboy.com lets customers interact directly with influencers and other creators that generate their own array of content. Playboy programming distributed through various websites and domestic and international TV providers offers on-demand entertainment. Our spirits joint venture, Playboy Spirits, offers premium spirits under the Rare Hare brand, while playboy.com sells a variety of home goods and personal accessories. Collaborations with strategic partners in the nightlife, hospitality, metaverse, and digital casino and online gaming industries allow our customers to further experience the Playboy lifestyle in-person and from their electronic devices. 
•Beauty and Grooming builds on our long role serving as a platform for beauty and the brand’s commercial success in the fragrance category. Today, we approach this category through the lens of confidence, providing our consumers with products and content that inspire body positivity and creative expression. With strong adjacency to Sexual Wellness, Beauty and Grooming offerings include men's and women’s skincare, haircare, bath and body, grooming, cosmetics and fragrance. These offerings are primarily delivered by our strategic licensing partners, and some products are offered for resale on playboy.com.
Each of the foregoing categories represent very large and growing markets, providing us with significant opportunities for growth from the increased sales of our current products, as well as through the introduction of new products within these categories.
Our Business Segments
We generate revenue through the sales of our products to consumers around the world. We employ multiple business models, including brand licensing, direct-to-consumer and third-party retail sales, and digital sales and subscriptions, to help maximize the value of our assets and promote long-term revenue and profitability growth. We report on our business operations in three segments:
•Licensing, including licensing our brand to third parties for products, services, venues, online gaming and events.
•Direct-to-Consumer, including sales of third-party products through our owned-and-operated e-commerce platforms, and sales of our proprietary products through our platforms and/or third-party retailers; and
•Digital Subscriptions and Content, including revenues generated from the sales of creator offerings to consumers on playboy.com, the sale of subscriptions to Playboy programming, which is distributed through various channels, including websites and domestic and international TV, and the sales of tokenized digital art and collectibles.
Licensing
We license the Playboy name, Rabbit Head Design, and other trademarks and related properties to partners around the world. Our licensing agreements permit licensees the right to use certain Playboy trademarks for certain categories of products in certain territories for a fee, which is typically a royalty calculated as a percentage of net revenue from wholesale and/or retail sales of such products, subject to an annual, bi-annual or quarterly minimum royalty payment. Our top five license agreements range from three to ten years in length and generated approximately $46.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, our licensing contracts included future royalty guarantee payments of approximately $345.5 million through 2031, assuming no renewals of such contracts.
Creative Artists Agency, a brand agency with significant global reach and infrastructure, acts as our exclusive licensing agent for the Playboy brand trademarks and intellectual property for consumer products in a broad range of categories in most of the world. We are entering into a joint venture, Playboy China Limited, with Charactopia Licensing Limited, a Fung Retailing brand management company, representing many global brands in China, to jointly own and operate the Playboy licensed business in China (including Hong Kong and Macau). We expect the Playboy China joint venture to invigorate our China-market Playboy apparel business, including online and offline retail strategies, product design and assortment, and brand marketing to its multi-generational audience. 
During the year ended December 31, 2022, our Licensing segment contributed $60.9 million in revenue and $74.0 million in operating loss, which was due to $116.0 million of non-cash impairment charges on Playboy-branded trademarks in the third quarter of 2022. 
Direct-to-Consumer
Our owned digital commerce retail platforms include playboy.com, honeybirdette.com and Honey Birdette retail stores (as of August 9, 2021), yandy.com, and loversstores.com and Lovers retail stores (as of March 1, 2021). We manage the inventory and shipping for our owned digital and retail commerce channels through a combination of our own warehouse and fulfillment centers and through third-party logistics centers, providing a flexible and scalable base from which to continue the expansion of our direct-to-consumer sales platform model. In addition to our owned channels, we have actively expanded the third-party sales of our proprietary products across major retailers in Western markets.
During the year ended December 31, 2022, our Direct-to-Consumer segment contributed $186.6 million in revenue and $207.0 million in operating loss, of which $184.8 million was due to non-cash impairment charges on certain of our intangible assets, including goodwill, in the third quarter of 2022. See Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations--Key Factors and Trends Affecting Our Business, for additional matters that affect our consumer products business, including seasonality.
Digital Subscriptions and Content
Our Digital Subscriptions and Content today comprise our creator-led platform on playboy.com (initially launched in December 2021), non-fungible token (“NFTs”) art and collectibles offerings (initially launched in early 2021), and Playboy’s adult content offerings, including playboyplus.com and playboy.tv.
Playboy-branded digital content offerings reach more than 150,000 subscribers and users across Playboy-managed digital platforms. In addition, Playboy TV is offered through leading MSOs (multiple-system operators) around the globe, including U.S. MSOs DIRECTV, Comcast, Dish, Charter, Cox, Altice, and Mediacom. Pursuant to its agreements with the MSOs, Playboy programs the Playboy TV and typically receives a royalty based on the numbers of subscribers to the service.
During the year ended December 31, 2022, our Digital Subscriptions and Content segment contributed $18.7 million in revenue and $13.0 million of operating loss, of which $4.9 million was related to non-cash impairment of our crypto assets and certain other assets.
Our Strategy
We aim to build the leading pleasure and leisure lifestyle platform for all people around the world. In 2021 and 2022, we built up our direct-to-consumer business, including expanding our licensing categories, and developed our digital capabilities, including launching our creator platform. As of 2023, we will pursue a commercial strategy that relies on a more capital-light model focused on revenue streams with higher margin and higher growth potential. We will do this by leveraging our flagship Playboy brand to attract best-in-class strategic partners and scale our creator platform with influencers who embody our brands aspirational lifestyle.
We will refocus our three key growth pillars: first, strategically expanding our licensing business in key categories and territories. Our Playboy China joint venture is expected to invigorate our China-market Playboy apparel business, building on Playboy’s current roster of licensees and online storefronts by adding new licensees. We will continue to use our licensing business as a marketing tool and brand builder, in particular through our high-end designer collaborations and our large-scale partnerships with partners such as PacSun. Second, investing in our Playboy digital platform as we return to our roots as a place to see and be seen for creators and up and coming cultural influencers. Third, building upon Honey Birdette’s existing high margin retail business by expanding the brand in the United States.
Our content creator-led platform dedicated to creative freedom, artistic expression and sex positivity, is the cornerstone of our digital strategy. Creators’ fans can subscribe or pay to view exclusive content, message with Playboy creators directly, and receive special access to their daily lives in a manner they cannot do anywhere else. Top creators earn special opportunities throughout the Playboy ecosystem including Playboy photo shoots, fashion design collaborations and the opportunity to serve as Playboy fashion ambassadors.
Our Competition
We operate in the consumer goods space across a variety of different industries and face competition from broad direct-to-consumer platforms such as Amazon, as well as brands and retailers that are more targeted to particular markets. In the men’s apparel space in China, we compete with other leading men’s apparel brands such as Uniqlo, Semir, Levi’s, Nautica and Lacoste on the breadth and quality of our products, and in Western markets, our apparel collaborations and owned and operated e-commerce business compete with retailers and brands more focused on lingerie, costumes, accessories and streetwear. In the sexual wellness industry, we compete with lingerie brands and e-commerce businesses such as La Perla, Fleur du Mal, Victoria’s Secret and AdoreMe, and other suppliers of products in this fragmented and rapidly growing space, as well as with Sexual Wellness e-commerce platforms and brick and mortar retail chains, such as Lovehoney, Fashion Nova and Adam & Eve. Our digital products and services compete with social content and creator-led platforms and providers of digital art, collectibles and paid and free adult content, and our digital games compete with other real-money and social casino-style games available in the iOS and Android app stores. We compete with much larger companies, including the brands referenced above, that have significantly greater financial and operational resources and pose meaningful competitive challenges. However, we believe we have successfully competed, and will continue to do so, with such companies because of our strong brands with extensive consumer followings, high quality products and relationships with creators and influencers that we have developed.
Our Corporate History
Playboy was founded in 1953 as a men’s lifestyle magazine. Over the following decades, Playboy grew into a leader and pioneer in the entertainment, hospitality, and licensing businesses.
From 1973 to 2011, Playboy's stock was publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Playboy’s current corporate entity, Playboy Enterprises, Inc., was incorporated in the State of Delaware in April 1998. On March 4, 2011, Icon Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Icon Acquisition Holdings, L.P. (“Icon”), an affiliate of Rizvi Traverse Management, LLC, successfully completed its offer to purchase all of the issued and outstanding shares of Playboy, which was further reorganized effective August 14, 2018. As part of the restructuring, Icon was dissolved and liquidated its equity interest in Playboy to its members, consisting of RT-ICON Holdings LLC (with its affiliates, "RT") and the Hugh M. Hefner 1991 Trust (the “Trust”), resulting in RT holding 3,034,192 shares of common stock in Playboy and the Trust holding 1,868,910 shares of common stock in Playboy. The Trust then sold to Playboy, and Playboy redeemed, all of the common stock in Playboy held by the Trust for a total of $35 million. 
On February 10, 2021, we consummated the transactions contemplated by that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of September 30, 2020 (the “Merger Agreement”), by and among Mountain Crest Acquisition Corp (“MCAC”), MCAC Merger Sub Inc. (“Merger Sub”), and Playboy, and Suying Liu. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Playboy merged with and into Merger Sub, with Playboy surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of MCAC, and MCAC changed its name to “PLBY Group, Inc.” upon consummation of the Business Combination.
Over the past several years, we have undertaken a process of transforming and streamlining our business model to transition Playboy’s primary business from a print and digital media entity, generating advertising and sponsorship revenues, to our primarily commerce business which markets consumer products and digital content. 
In December 2019, we acquired the assets of yandy.com, a leading online retailer of lingerie, dresses, costumes and accessories, as part of the expansion of our proprietary sales platform. In March 2021, we acquired TLA Acquisition Corp., the parent company of the Lovers family of stores, a leading omni-channel online and brick-and-mortar sexual wellness chain. In August 2021, we acquired Honey Birdette (Aust) Pty Limited, owner of the luxury lingerie brand Honey Birdette. In October 2021, we acquired GlowUp Digital Inc., owner of the Dream platform that was redeveloped as the technology foundation for our curated and creator-led platform on playboy.com, which initially launched in December 2021 under the Centerfold name. We are entering into a Playboy-controlled joint venture, Playboy China Limited, for the operation of the Playboy licensed business in China (including Hong Kong and Macau). 
Our Team
We seek to recruit, retain, and incentivize highly talented existing and future employees. We believe that creating a respectful and inclusive environment where team members can be themselves and be supported is critical to attracting, developing and retaining talent. A set of fundamental values guide our thinking and actions both inside the company and as we pursue our mission through our interaction with our consumers and our partners around the world. We created these values with the goal of holding ourselves accountable, of preserving what is special, and to inspire and guide ourselves moving forward as we grow and take on new challenges. We believe staying true to these values will drive the long-term value we create in consumers’ lives.
Our Employees
As of December 31, 2022, we had 497 full-time and full-time-equivalent employees and 566 part-time employees. None of the employees are represented by a labor union. Our team values support our employee relations, which we believe to be positive and productive. We promote the well-being of our employees through programs and benefits that support physical health, financial security and good morale. 
Our Values
Do You (But Do No Harm). We’re authentic to who we are. We say what we mean, and we mean what we say. We create a safe and encouraging environment for others to do the same, bringing their authentic selves forward. We welcome and value varying perspectives and opinions, and we assume best intentions. We celebrate and bring out the best in each other. We pay attention to others discomfort. We respect boundaries. And we fiercely believe that our diversity positions us for greater success and impact in the world.
Embrace the Next Challenge. We have a growth mindset. We don’t let ourselves get too comfortable. We are constantly questioning our existing knowledge and recognize that our blind spots are bigger than we think. We actively seek out opportunities to learn. We come from a place of curiosity. The next challenge may be in a place we’ve never thought to look, and we leverage a vast diversity of perspectives to find it. We know we can always do better, and good enough is not enough. We believe in questioning taboos. We are bold and thoughtful in challenging the status quo and finding fault in the default, even when it seems we are alone. We are okay with uncertainty, and we aim to adapt quickly and be resourceful in an ever-changing environment.
Debate, Then Commit. We take the time to make sure we are informed. We provide a platform and make space for the different voices in the room, ask thoughtful questions, and consider all angles before coming to a conclusion. We question everything. We engage in self-reflection, and we recognize and share openly when we are wrong. We are solutions oriented. We take an active approach to solving problems and coming to decisions rather than fixating on them. We passionately discuss ideas but respect when a decision is reached and abide by the process to execute it. We communicate decisions thoroughly and thoughtfully.
Be a Leader. We develop and exercise inclusive leadership. So, everyone knows they belong, and equitable treatment is our standard. We recognize that trust, respect, and responsibility go hand-in-hand and must be heard. With that, it is up to each of us to earn that responsibility every day. We listen first, ask questions, speak up and are accountable for our work (and our mistakes). We help others feel confident and comfortable doing the same. We take initiative. We don’t wait for things to happen to us or wait to be told. We are willing to wear many hats and roll our sleeves up when others need help, even if it means working outside our job description. We lead by example.
Stay Playful. We are a fun team and though we often deal with heavy subject matter, we recognize the importance of a playful spirit and a positive outlook. We realize that we are a work in progress, and that we won’t always get it right the first time. We pride ourselves in being able to pick ourselves up, be positive about our mistakes (while learning from them) and move forward. We celebrate creativity and the importance of trying new things out. We know you to have a good time and we understand boundaries. We celebrate each other. We value our time both in and out of work.
