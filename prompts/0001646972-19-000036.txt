Overview
Albertsons is one of the largest food and drug retailers in the United States, with both strong local presence and national scale. We also manufacture and process some of the food for sale in our stores. We maintain a website (www.AlbertsonsCompanies.com) that includes additional information about the Company. We make available through our website, free of charge, our annual reports on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, our current reports on Form 8-K and our interactive data files, including amendments. These forms are available as soon as reasonably practicable after we have filed them with, or furnished them electronically to, the SEC.
Stores
As of February 23, 2019, we operated 2,269 stores across 34 states and the District of Columbia under 20 well-known banners, including Albertsons, Safeway, Vons, Jewel-Osco, Shaw's, Acme, Tom Thumb, Randalls, United Supermarkets, Market Street, Pavilions, Star Market, Carrs and Haggen as well as meal kit company Plated. We provide our customers with convenient and value-added services, including through our 1,739 pharmacies, 1,282 in-store branded coffee shops and 397 adjacent fuel centers. Our Plated meal kit offering is supported by six fulfillment centers. Complementary to our large network of stores, we aim to provide our customers a seamless omni-channel shopping experience by offering a growing set of digital offerings, including home deliveries, "Drive up and Go" curbside pickup, meal kits and online prescription refills. 
Segments
We are engaged in the operation of food and drug retail stores that offer grocery products, general merchandise, health and beauty care products, pharmacy, fuel and other items and services. Our retail operating divisions are geographically based, have similar economic characteristics and similar expected long-term financial performance and are reported in one reportable segment. Our operating segments and reporting units are made up of 13 divisions, which have been aggregated into one reportable segment. Each reporting unit constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and for which management regularly reviews the operating results. Across all operating segments, the Company operates primarily one store format. Each store offers the same general mix of products with similar pricing to similar categories of customers, have similar distribution methods, operate in similar regulatory environments and purchase merchandise from similar or the same vendors. 
Merchandising and Manufacturing
We offer more than 11,000 high-quality products under our Own Brands portfolio. Our Own Brands products resonate well with our shoppers as evidenced by Own Brands sales of over $12.5 billion in fiscal 2018. Year over year, we have demonstrated significant progress and increased sales penetration of Own Brands by 50 basis points to 25.1%, excluding pharmacy, fuel and in-store branded coffee sales. 
Own Brands continues to deliver on innovation with more than 1,100 new items launched in fiscal 2018 and more than 1,000 in the pipeline for fiscal 2019. We are excited about our O Organics and Open Nature brands, which posted a combined 13.6% growth in sales year-over-year, with over 1,900 items, and we plan to introduce approximately 350 new items in fiscal 2019. In addition to new item innovation and brand development, Own Brands continues to focus on package redesign to refresh shelf presence and comply with new regulatory nutrition guideline changes. 
As measured by units for fiscal 2018, 10.2% of our Own Brands merchandise was manufactured in Company-owned facilities, and the remainder of our Own Brands merchandise was purchased from third parties. We closely monitor make-versus-buy decisions on internally sourced products to optimize their quality and profitability. In addition, we believe that the Company's scale will provide opportunities to leverage our fixed manufacturing costs in
