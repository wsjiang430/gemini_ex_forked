Item 1. Business
Overview and History 
ASGN Incorporated ("ASGN," "we," or "us") is a leading provider of information technology (IT) services and professional solutions, including technology and creative digital marketing, across the commercial and government sectors. We operate through two segments, Commercial and Federal Government, which promote balance and strength through economic cycles. Our Commercial Segment, which is our largest segment, provides consulting, creative digital marketing and permanent placement services primarily to large enterprises and Fortune 1000 companies. Our Federal Government Segment provides mission-critical solutions to the Department of Defense, the intelligence community and federal civilian agencies. 
We have grown through a combination of organic growth and strategic acquisitions. Over the last five years, we acquired ECS Federal, LLC ("ECS") in April 2018 and 11 "tuck-in" acquisitions that align with our strategy to expand our IT consulting services and solutions capabilities in the commercial and federal government markets.

ASGN was incorporated in 1992. Our principal office is located at 4400 Cox Road, Suite 110, Glen Allen, Virginia 23060, and our telephone number is (888) 482-8068. 

Commercial Segment
Our Commercial Segment (75.0 percent of 2022 consolidated revenues) provides a broad spectrum of IT services and solutions and creative digital marketing services primarily to Fortune 1000 and large enterprise clients. Growth in this segment is being driven by digital transformation and innovation requirements, workforce mobilization and modern enterprise needs across five industry verticals and their respective subsectors. Our talent pool – which includes onshore, nearshore and offshore resources, can be deployed in short duration solution-specific engagements or long-term consultative roles. Our roots in IT staffing offer a strong account base and foothold in our clients’ businesses, while our consulting offerings enable us to offer more value to our accounts, with higher growth and high-end, high margin work. Corporate support activities are primarily based in Richmond, Virginia, and there is a network of 97 branch offices across the United States, and six branch offices across Canada and Europe. In addition to our branch offices, we have one near-shore delivery center in Mexico and will open a second Mexican delivery center in early 2023 to expand our near-shore capabilities. We also maintain a smaller delivery center in India.
Assignment — We provide our clients with experienced IT and creative digital marketing contract professionals for temporary assignments and project engagements. Our contract professionals have knowledge and experience in specialized technical and creative digital marketing services that make them qualified to fill a given assignment or project. 
Consulting — We provide workforce mobilization, modern enterprise and digital innovation IT consulting services. Our contract professionals and subject matter experts deliver solutions that are customer focused and value driven. We provide a continuum of cloud, data and analytics, cyber/information security, artificial intelligence/machine learning and digital transformation solutions to support our clients’ modern enterprise and digital needs. 
Federal Government Segment
Our Federal Government Segment (25.0 percent of 2022 consolidated revenues) delivers advanced solutions in cloud and enterprise IT, cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, machine learning, application and digital transformation to some of the world's leading agencies in both the public and private sectors. Our team of skilled experts tackle critical and highly-complex challenges for customers in the U.S. defense, intelligence and federal civilian agencies. We maintain relationships with leading cloud, cybersecurity and artificial intelligence/machine learning providers and hold specialized certifications in these technologies. 
The segment provides services under time-and-materials, cost reimbursable and firm-fixed-price contracts. Contracts range from approximately three to five years in length. We have contract backlog of $3.3 billion as of December 31, 2022, which represents the estimated amount of future revenues to be recognized under awarded contracts including task orders and options. Corporate support activities are based in Fairfax, Virginia, and there are 28 branch offices located across the United States. 
Industry and Market Dynamics
ASGN is a leading provider of IT services and professional solutions, including technology and creative digital marketing, across the commercial and government sectors. ASGN helps leading corporate enterprises and government organizations develop, implement and operate critical IT and business solutions through its integrated offering of professional staffing and IT consulting services and solutions. Our total addressable market is approximately $572 billion. It includes $384 billion in commercial IT consulting, $124 billion in government IT services and solutions and $64 billion in professional staffing.

We anticipate that our clients will increase their use of contract labor, professional staffing and consulting services in 2023. By using our contract labor professional staffing and consulting services, our clients benefit from cost structure advantages, flexibility to address fluctuating demand in business, and access to greater expertise. Our business model continues to evolve in line with client needs and expectations to focus on higher-end, higher-margin IT consulting services and solutions capabilities, particularly those related to digital 
transformation and other areas of technology change and specialization including data analytics, artificial intelligence/machine learning, big data, process automation and information security. We intend to continue to grow our diverse client base by focusing on large, stable accounts that are quick adopters of new technologies. We will invest in our organic growth while simultaneously looking to execute acquisitions in the commercial and federal government end markets focusing on consulting companies that provide us with new solution capabilities, industry expertise or government contract awards.
Clients
We serve our clients by effectively understanding their IT, consulting and digital creative marketing services needs and providing them qualified professionals with a unique combination of skills, experience and expertise to meet those needs. Our clients set rigorous requirements for the talent they are seeking, and we use our extensive databases and deep relationships with our contract professionals to quickly identify and pre-screen candidates whose qualifications meet those requirements. We are responsible for recruiting, verifying credentials upon request, hiring, administering pay and benefits, compliance and training, as applicable. In 2022, revenues from contracts directly with U.S. federal government agencies were approximately 21 percent of consolidated revenues and no other client represented more than 10 percent of revenues.
Candidates
We recruit candidates with backgrounds in IT services and consulting and digital creative marketing who seek contract or permanent work opportunities. When we place these candidates on assignments or consulting projects with clients, they become our employees. Many of these contract professionals, and those we place via subcontractors, are paid hourly wage or contract rates based on their specific skills. We pay the related costs of employment including social security taxes, federal and state unemployment taxes, workers’ compensation insurance and other similar costs for our employees. After achieving minimum service periods and/or hours worked, our contract professionals are offered access to medical and other voluntary benefit programs (e.g., dental, vision, disability) and the right to participate in our 401(k) retirement savings plan. Each contract professional’s employment relationship with us is terminable at will. We employed approximately 50,000 contract professionals throughout 2022, or approximately 25,500 on a full-time-equivalent ("FTE") basis.
Strategy
ASGN's strategy is to be a leading provider of IT services and professional solutions, including technology and creative digital marketing, across the commercial and federal government sectors. We are focused on high-margin work with high-volume scalable clients and projects, for large commercial enterprise accounts and federal government customers. We have built a sizable commercial consulting platform, and we plan to continue to grow our revenues both organically and through acquisitions. Our acquisition strategy focuses on IT consulting companies that add new services, capabilities and contracts that support our commercial and federal government customer needs and that are in high demand by our customer base.
Our strategic innovation efforts and technology investments focus on putting the best productivity tools in the hands of our recruiters, our candidates and our clients, so that it is seamless for clients and contract professionals to work with ASGN. We position our teams to stay at the forefront of emerging trends in digitization and candidate sourcing to better position our businesses and improve how we serve clients and consultants.
Competition
We see ourselves as a hybrid between pure staff augmentation and pure-play consulting due to the way in which we provide human capital on a project-by-project basis. We compete with other large publicly-held and privately-owned providers of human capital in the professional staffing and IT and management consulting service segments on a local, regional, national and international basis across the commercial and government end markets. With an industry focus that is supported by our solutions, our unique deployment model allows us to provide the right services at the right time. Our experienced engagement leaders and methodologies help our clients solve critical problems and create incremental value for their organizations.
From a talent perspective, we offer more opportunities for the billable professional and are viewed as a better partner for their career objectives. In addition, competitive factors that attract qualified candidates are salaries and benefits; availability and variety of opportunities; quality, duration and location of assignments (if not remote/hybrid); and responsiveness to requests for placement. Many people seeking contract employment through us may also be pursuing employment through other means. Therefore, the speed at which we assign prospective professionals and the availability of attractive and appropriate assignments are important factors in our ability to fill open positions. 
From a client perspective, the principal competitive factors in obtaining and retaining clients are properly assessing the clients’ specific job and project requirements, the appropriateness of the professional assigned to the client, the price of services and monitoring our clients’ satisfaction. Although we believe we compete favorably with respect to these factors and maintain an intimacy and institutional knowledge with our clients that enables us to successfully compete in the market, we expect competition to continue to increase. Unlike our competitors, particularly in the traditional consulting space, for the majority of our business we do not rely upon a bench to support us; rather, we use our database and a deep labor pool of highly-skilled technical talent developed over decades to provide and build teams that offer our clients a full suite of services from staff augmentation to traditional consulting. This shared resource model provides sophisticated project delivery capabilities with a cost advantage that has enabled us to grow above industry averages.
Human Capital
Our workforce is the heart of our business. Our diverse talent pool helps build and maintain our competitive advantage as a global IT staffing and consulting firm. During 2022, we employed approximately 4,000 internal employees, including sales directors, account managers, recruiters and corporate office employees. We support our employees and contract professionals through the following initiatives:
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion — ASGN is committed to gender and racial equality goals across all levels of employment. We have diversity, equity and inclusion ("DEI") training, recruitment, retention and advancement programs across all brands, which include mandatory training to raise awareness and eliminate unconscious bias in hiring and promotion practices. Our DEI manager oversees a program designed to (i) encourage and support personal and professional development for employees from all ethnicities, races, religions and backgrounds and (ii) empower more women to become leaders. In 2022, a "mentee-led" mentorship pilot program was successful. Mentors reported the value of developing the next generation of leaders at ASGN while mentees reported help navigating interpersonal challenges as well as with preparations to take the next steps in their careers. 
Through our participation in the United Nations Global Compact’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Accelerator Program in 2022, ASGN aligned with SDG 5 (Gender Equality) and SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities). To encourage more participation from, and support of, diverse businesses in our supply chain, ASGN established a Company-wide Vendor Diversity Policy. We exceeded our Company-wide commitment to employ at least 40 percent women and diverse people (including racial and ethnic diversity, sexual orientation, physical abilities, and veteran status) in senior executive positions, ahead of our target date of 2025. Also in 2022, ASGN proudly became a signatory to the UN’s Women’s Empowerment Principles (WEPs) to help guide us toward a more gender equal workplace. Women accounted for over 40 percent of our internal workforce and employees from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups accounted for over 30 percent of our internal workforce based on our census data as of December 31, 2022. Three of ASGN’s eleven Board of Directors are women, and two members identify as being from an underrepresented group.
Health, Safety and Well-being — Our training and development opportunities aim to address, among other things, ethics and integrity; diversity and workplace inclusion; discrimination and harassment; unconscious bias; cybersecurity, privacy and information security; and workplace safety. We reward employees with attractive compensation and benefits packages, which may include medical, dental and vision plans; short- and long-term disability; life and accident insurance; health savings accounts and flexible spending accounts; and savings plans. We further support our employees emotional and physical health with wellness programming and personal growth workshops. In 2022 we adopted Company-wide Employee Wellness and Workplace Health and Safety policies. ASGN focused on providing a safe and healthy workplace. We understand that taking care of our employees’ health is an expression of our values, essential to our business, and a vital aspect of building a happier workplace. Through our employee wellness programming, we aspire to help our employees reduce stress, improve their physical health and stamina, and flourish mentally and emotionally. Finally, in the wake of COVID-19, and to support work-life balance, ASGN is continuing to offer flexible work schedules.
Employee Engagement, Retention and Development — We are committed to career advancement through training and development that supports both personal and professional growth. Employees are provided with a comprehensive training program of continuing education and professional development that helps them stay ahead and deliver excellent results. In 2022, we implemented our first Company-wide employee engagement survey and we achieved a 71 percent overall participation rate. To promote more employee engagement in areas that are most meaningful to our diverse array of employees, we support Employee Resource Groups ("ERGs"). ERGs are voluntary, employee-led groups whose aim is to foster a diverse and inclusive workplace aligned with the organizations they serve and are designed to provide personal support and/or career development and create a safe space where employees can bring their whole selves to the table. They are also designed to help diverse employees be better prepared to move up within the organization. All our Commercial Segment divisions have ERGs in place, while our Federal Government Segment plans to roll out 11 new ERGs in 2023. ERGs at ASGN include: Black, 50Forward, Pride, Valor, Families and Women. In addition to ERGs, ASGN and its brands also support Employee Community Groups (ECGs), voluntary social circles of employees who join based on shared values, interests, perspectives or goals. ECGs at ASGN include: Caregivers, Environment and Wellness. Both types of employee groups enhance the well-being of the employees who choose to participate.
Collaborative Performance Management — We strongly support the belief that our employees should be the primary drivers of their own career growth. Employees are encouraged to seek opportunities that align with their long-term career goals, whether that be lateral job changes, cross-functional training, serving on committees or special projects, or any activity that will help to progress their career. Our performance management process emphasizes clear goals with timely and constructive feedback.

Government Regulation

We take reasonable steps to ensure that our contract professionals possess all current licenses and certifications required for each placement. We provide state-mandated workers’ compensation insurance, unemployment insurance and professional liability insurance for our internal employees and our contract professionals who are our employees. These expenses have a direct effect on our costs of services, margins and likelihood of achieving or maintaining profitability.
