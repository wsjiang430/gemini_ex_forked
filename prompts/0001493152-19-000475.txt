The Company began taking reservations for the SmartDesk on May 22, 2018 with most customers starting to receive delivery of the SmartDesk in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. The Company has received reservations for a total number of 815 reservations for SmartDesk as of December 15, 2018. The Company expects to convert these reservations in to orders and thus sales in fiscal 2019. The Company anticipates that demand will continue to rise for the SmartDesk as the Company increases its marketing efforts and deliveries start taking place.
 
In December 2017, Company set up a subsidiary named Cemtrex Technologies Pvt. Ltd., by acquiring certain fix assets consisting of computers, hardware and proprietary software from a private third party located in Pune, India, to carry out software and prototype development work related to new Virtual & Augmented Reality applications and Smart Technology products to be produced by Cemtrex Advanced Technologies Inc., located in New York.
 
In January 2018, the Company completed the consolidation of its Paderborn EM factory into the EM factory at Neulingen, Germany to create economies of scale. However, the ROB Logistics and ROB Assets subsidiaries remained at the Paderborn location.
 
The Company continues to experience weakness in new orders in its environmental control products markets both domestically and internationally. Revenues in that segment continue to be down as fewer number of projects are being decided and awarded due to relaxation of numerous environmental regulations under the United States Presidential administration. Company has shifted its focus into smart devices and virtual reality applications, and hence the Company will continue to reduce its presence in the environmental control products markets in the coming year.
 
VICON INDUSTRIES, INC.
 
On March 23, 2018, in a private resale transaction, Cemtrex purchased 7,284,824 shares of common stock and a warrant to purchase an additional 1,500,000 shares of common stock of Vicon Industries, Inc. (OTCMKTS: VCON), (“Vicon”), from former Vicon shareholder NIL Funding Corporation, pursuant to the terms of a Securities Purchase Agreement. Cemtrex’s purchase of the Vicon Industries common stock and warrant resulted in its beneficial ownership of approximately 46% of the outstanding shares of common stock of Vicon. Cemtrex purchased the shares of common stock and warrant of Vicon Industries in exchange for 1,012,625 shares of Cemtrex common stock. Following the closing of the transaction, Saagar Govil, Cemtrex’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Aron Govil, Cemtrex’s Executive Director, joined the Vicon Industries Board of Directors and Saagar Govil assumed the position of Chief Executive Officer of Vicon Industries. The Company had elected to account for Vicon using the equity method.
 
On August 8, 2018, the Company entered into a Research and Development Services Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Vicon to provide Vicon with outsourced software development services. Vicon is transitioning its principal Israeli based software development activities to the Company’s India based services group, which has now assumed principal software coding and test responsibilities for Vicon. The outsourcing of these activities is expected to materially reduce the Vicon’s software development costs and provide development efficiencies, which should help expedite its software roadmap. The terms of the Agreement, among other things, set forth the scope of services, consideration, developed technology ownership, non-disclosure and safeguard of Vicon’s software code. Pursuant to an informal agreement, $356,055 of fees were billed to Vicon during the year ended September 30, 2018 in connection with the transition of software development activities.

SUPPLIERS
 
The Company is not dependent on, nor expects to become dependent on, any one or a limited number of suppliers. The Company buys parts and components to assemble and manufacture its equipment and products. The Company also utilizes sub-suppliers and third-party vendors to procure from or fabricate its components based on its design, engineering and specifications. The Company also enters into subcontracts for field installation, which the Company supervises; and the Company manages all technical, physical and commercial aspects of the performance of the Company contracts. To date, the Company has not experienced difficulties either in obtaining fabricated components and other materials and parts or in obtaining qualified subcontractors for installation work. The Company seeks to have many sources of supply for each of its major requirements in order to avoid significant dependence on any one or a few suppliers. However, the supply of materials or other items could be disrupted by natural disasters or other events. Despite market price volatility for certain requirements and materials pricing pressures at some of our businesses, the raw materials and various purchased components needed for the Company’s products have generally been available in sufficient quantities.
PARTS, REPAIR AND REFURBISHMENT SERVICES
 
The Company also provides replacement and spare parts and repair and refurbishment services for all its systems following the expiration of the warranties which generally range up to 12 months. The Company has experienced only minimal costs from its warranties.
 
The Company’s standard terms of sale disclaim any liability for consequential or indirect losses or damages stemming from any failure of its products or systems or any component thereof. The Company seeks indemnification from its subcontractors for any loss, damage or claim arising from the subcontractors’ failure to perform.
 
COMPETITION
 
To the best of Company’s knowledge, the Company believes that its flagship product SmartDesk does not have any competition at the present time. However, Company faces substantial competition in each of its other products & services and principal markets. Most of its competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than the Company; several are divisions of multi-national companies. The Company competes on the basis of price, engineering and technological expertise, know-how and the quality of its products, systems and services. Additionally, the Company’s management believes that the successful delivery, installation and performance of the Company’s products and systems is a key factor in gaining business as customers typically prefer to make significant purchases from a company with a solid performance history.
 
The Company obtains virtually all its contracts through competitive bidding. Although price is an important factor and may in some cases be the governing factor, it is not always determinative, and contracts are often awarded on the basis of the efficiency or reliability of products and the engineering and technical expertise of the bidder. Several companies market products that compete directly with Company’s products. Other companies offer products that potential customers may consider to be acceptable alternatives to Company’s products and services. The Company faces direct competition from companies with far greater financial, technological, manufacturing and personnel resources.
 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
 
Over the years, the Company has developed proprietary technologies that give it an edge in competing with its competitors. Thus, the Company relies on a combination of trade secrets and know-how to protect its intellectual property. The Company has filed 18 patent applications related to the development of SmartDesk. Cemtrex continues to invest in research and development with intention of developing proprietary technology and intellectual property.

MARKETING
 
The Company sells its products globally and relies on direct sales force, manufacturing representatives, distributors, commission sales agents, magazine advertisements, internet advertising, trade shows, trade directories and catalogue listings to market its products and services. The Company uses independent sales representatives in the United States backed by its sales management and technical professionals. The Company’s arrangements with independent sales representatives accord each a defined territory within which to sell some or all of its products and systems, provide for the payment of agreed-upon sales commissions and are terminable at will. The Company’s sales representatives do not have authority to execute contracts on the Company’s behalf.
 
The Company’s sales representatives also serve as ongoing liaison function between Company and its customers during the installation phase of the products and systems and address customers’ questions or concerns arising thereafter. The Company selects representatives based upon industry reputation, prior sales performance including number of prospective leads generated and sales closure rates, and the breadth of territorial coverage, among other criteria.
 
Technical inquiries received from potential customers are referred to the engineering personnel. Thereafter, the Company’s sales and engineering personnel jointly prepare a budget proposal, or a final bid. The period between initial customer contact and issuance of an order is generally between two and twelve months.
 
The Company has been selling SmartDesk directly from its website whereby customers can place pre-orders and give a nominal deposit. Company has been marketing SmartDesk on social media sites such as Facebook and Instagram as well as showcasing the product at several trade shows. The Company plans to bring on resellers to market the product to enterprise clients and increase its overall marketing and sales efforts.
 
CUSTOMERS
 
The Company’s principal customers are engaged in automotive, medical, industrial automation, power, manufacturing, chemical, packaging, printing, electronics, mining, and metallurgical processing. Historically, most of the customers have purchased individual products or systems which, in many instances, operate in conjunction with products and systems supplied by others. For several years, the Company has marketed its products as integrated custom engineered systems and solutions. No one single customer accounts for more than 10% of its annual sales.
 
For the AT segment, the Company is responsible for the design, production, supply, and delivery of products to its customers. In order to satisfy customer orders, the Company must consistently meet production deadlines and maintain a high standard of quality.
 
For the IT segment, the Company is responsible to its customers for all phases of the design, assembly, supply and, if included, field installation of its products and systems. The successful completion of a project is generally determined by a successful operational test of the supplied equipment conducted by our field service technician in the presence of the customer.
 
For the EM segment, the company is responsible for the prototype design, production, supply, and delivery of products to its customers. In order to satisfy customer orders, the Company must consistently meet production deadlines and maintain a high standard of quality.
 
INSURANCE
 
The Company currently maintains different types of insurance, including general liability and property coverage. The Company also maintains product liability insurance with respect to its products and equipment.

EMPLOYEES
 
The Company employs approximately 496 full-time employees and approximately 24 part-time employees as of January 4, 2019, including 70 engaged in engineering, 315 in manufacturing & field service and 135 in administrative, sales and marketing functions.
GOVERNMENT REGULATION
 
The Company’s operations are subject to certain foreign, federal, state and local regulatory requirements relating to, among others, environmental, waste management, labor and health and safety matters. Management believes that the Company’s business is operated in material compliance with all such regulations.
 
Management believes that the existence of governmental regulations creates demand for the Company’s environmental control systems. Significant environmental laws, particularly the Federal Clean Air Act, have been enacted in response to public concern about the environment. The Company believes that compliance with and enforcement of these laws and regulations create the demand for its environmental control related products and systems. When these regulations are relaxed or aren’t enforced then the demand for the Company’s Environmental control products goes down.
