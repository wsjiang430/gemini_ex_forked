 Description of Business
 ﻿
 Land acquisition process
 ﻿
 We acquire land for our homebuilding operations with the primary intent to develop and construct single family detached or attached homes for sale on the acquired land.  From time to time we may sell land to other developers and homebuilders where we have excess land positions. We generally acquire land for cash, either through bulk acquisitions of land or through option contracts. Option contracts are generally structured where we have the right, but not the obligation, to buy land at predetermined prices on a defined schedule. Potential land acquisitions are identified by our local management within the markets in which we operate. Our land acquisition process typically includes soil tests, independent environmental studies, other engineering work and financial analysis which include an evaluation of expected returns, projected gross margins, estimated sales paces and pricing. Potential land acquisitions are approved by our Corporate office to ensure appropriate capital allocations taking into consideration current and projected inventory levels and risk adjusted returns.

 Homebuilding marketing and sales process – Century Communities brand
 ﻿
 Our Century Communities brand builds an extensive range of home types across a variety of price points. The core of our business plan is to acquire and develop land strategically, based on our understanding of population growth patterns, local markets, entitlement restrictions and infrastructure development. We focus on locations within our markets that are generally characterized by diverse economic and employment bases and demographics and increasing populations. We believe these conditions create strong demand for

new housing, and these locations represent what we believe to be attractive opportunities for long-term growth. We also seek assets that have desirable characteristics, such as good access to major job centers, schools, shopping, recreation and transportation facilities, and we strive to offer a broad spectrum of product types in these locations. Location, product, price point and customer service are key components of the connection we seek to establish with each individual homebuyer. Our construction expertise across an extensive product offering allows us flexibility to pursue a wide array of land acquisition opportunities and appeal to a broad range of potential homebuyers, from entry-level to first- and second-time move-up buyers and lifestyle homebuyers. Additionally, we believe our diversified product strategy enables us to adapt quickly to changing market conditions and to optimize returns while strategically reducing portfolio risk. 
 ﻿
 Our goal is to provide a positive experience to our homeowners by actively engaging them in the homebuying process. In many of our communities, we provide our customers with customization options to suit their lifestyle needs and have developed a number of home designs with features such as outdoor living spaces, one-story living and first floor master bedroom suites to appeal to broad design needs. We also engineer our homes for energy efficiency, which is aimed at reducing the impact on the environment and lowering energy costs to our homebuyers. As part of these efforts, we often offer homebuyers environmentally friendly alternatives, such as solar power to supplement a home’s energy needs.
 ﻿
 We sell our homes through our own sales representatives and through independent real estate brokers. Our in-house sales force typically works from sales offices located in model homes close to or in each community. Sales representatives assist potential buyers by providing them with basic floor plans, price information, development and construction timetables, tours of model homes where available and the selection of available options. Sales personnel are trained by us and generally have had prior experience selling new homes in the local market. Our personnel, along with subcontracted marketing and design consultants, carefully design the exterior and interior of each home to coincide with the needs of targeted homebuyers. 
 We advertise directly to potential homebuyers through the internet and digital marketing, marketing brochures and to a lesser extent newspapers. We may also use billboards, radio and television advertising, along with our website, to market the location, price range and availability of our homes. We also attempt to operate in conspicuously located areas that permit us to take advantage of local traffic patterns. Model homes play a significant role in our marketing efforts by not only creating an attractive atmosphere, but also by displaying options and upgrades. Our Century Complete line, which is geared towards the entry level buyer, provides for limited options and design choices.
 ﻿
 Homebuilding marketing and sales process – Wade Jurney brand
 ﻿
 Our Wade Jurney Homes brand primarily sells homes through our own sales representatives located in retail locations which we refer to as Studios, as opposed to model homes.  We lease our Studios within strip malls or other high traffic retail centers, located centrally to our homes under construction.  Our Studios are generally leased for a period of three years and average approximately 1,500 square feet.  We also sell homes directly through our Wade Jurney Homes website, as well as through independent real estate brokers.  
 ﻿
 Our Wade Jurney brand primarily competes with resales within the submarkets in which we operate and strives to offer a new home offering to our customers at prices that are equal or lower than resale competition, and significantly lower than other new home offerings.  Our philosophy is to be the price leader through providing a limited number of floor plans, with no options or upgrades offered.  Our advertising and marketing efforts are focused on cost effective means of reaching potential customers including centralized digital marketing, and direct outreach to independent real estate brokers.  Our goal is to leverage our Studios, and advertising and marketing efforts to generate homebuyer leads, which are then actively pursued by our sales associates.  
 Customer relations and warranty programs
 We pay particular attention to the product design process and carefully consider choice of materials in order to attempt to eliminate building deficiencies. We maintain customer service staff whose role includes providing a positive experience for each customer throughout the homebuying process and beyond. This group is also responsible for providing after sales customer service. Our customer service initiatives include using customer survey results to improve our standards of customer satisfaction. Generally, we provide each homeowner with product warranties covering workmanship and materials for one year from the time of closing, and warranties covering structural systems from the time of closing through the statute of repose with the states we operate in, or ten years, whichever is shorter. The subcontractors who perform most of the actual construction also provide to us customary warranties on workmanship.
 Financial services
 We offer home financing for our customers through our wholly owned subsidiary, Inspire Home Loans, Inc. (which we refer to as “Inspire”). Inspire is authorized to originate Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”), Federal Housing Administration-insured (“FHA”), and Department of Veterans Affairs-guaranteed (“VA”) mortgages (which we refer to collectively as the “government 

 
3



 

sponsored entities”). We also offer title and home owners insurance services through our wholly owned subsidiaries, Parkway Financial Group, LLC (which we refer to as “Parkway”) and IHL Home Insurance Agency, LLC (which we refer to as “IHL”). These operations along with Inspire collectively comprise our Financial Services operating segment. We believe that our customers’ use of Inspire, Parkway, and IHL provides us with a competitive advantage by enabling more control over the quality of the overall home buying process for our customers, while also helping us align the timing of the house construction process with our customers’ financing, title and insurance needs.
 The results of operations of our Financial Services operating segment are primarily driven by the results of Inspire. Because Inspire originates mortgage loans almost exclusively for our homebuilding customers, Inspire is dependent on our homebuilding operations and its results of operations are highly correlated with our homebuilding operations, and to a lesser degree the overall market demand for mortgages. 
 Inspire finances the origination of these loans primarily with borrowings under its mortgage repurchase facilities. As of December 31, 2018, Inspire had facilities maturing through September 2019, with a total maximum aggregate commitment of $160 million including an uncommitted amount of $55.4 million. We expect the facilities to be renewed or replaced with other facilities when they mature. 
 Inspire sells substantially all of the loans it originates and their related servicing rights in the secondary mortgage market within a short period of time after origination, generally within 30 days. This strategy results in owning the loans and related servicing rights for only a short period of time. After the loans are sold, Inspire may be responsible for potential losses associated with mortgage loans originated and sold in the event of errors or omissions relating to customary industry-standard representations and warranties made by Inspire that the loans met certain requirements, including representations as to underwriting standards, the existence of primary mortgage insurance, and the validity of certain borrower representations in connection with the loans.
 The mortgage industry is highly competitive, and Inspire competes with other mortgage bankers, as well as mortgage brokers, credit unions and banks, over speed, efficiency, quality of customer service, the variety and attractiveness of mortgage products offered, interest rates offered, financing availability and costs, in order to provide mortgage financing to our customers. We compete with other title insurance agencies and underwriters for closing services and title insurance. Principal competitive factors include service and price.
 Inspire is also subject to various state and federal statutes, rules, and regulations, including those that relate to licensing, lending operations, and other areas of mortgage origination and financing, rules and regulations of the government sponsored entities, and other rules of investors that purchase the mortgages we originate. We are also subject to regulations of those that have oversight over the government sponsored entities, including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which contains a number of requirements relating to mortgage lending and securitization. These include, among others, minimum standards for lender practices, limitations on certain fees and a requirement that the originator of loans that are securitized retain a portion of the risk, either directly or by holding interests in the securitizations. The impact of those statutes, rules, and regulations can be to increase our home buyers’ cost of financing, increase our cost of doing business, and restrict our home buyers’ access to some types of loans.
 Design and construction
 We engage architects, engineers and other professionals in connection with the home design process who are familiar with local market preferences, constraints, conditions and requirements. We serve as the general contractor, with all construction work typically performed by subcontractors. While we maintain long-standing relationships with many of our subcontractors and design professionals, we typically do not enter into long-term contractual commitments with them. 
 ﻿
 When constructing homes, we use various construction materials and components including lumber, steel and concrete. It has typically taken us four to eight months or more to construct a home, during which time materials are subject to price fluctuations. Such price fluctuations are caused by several factors, among them seasonal variation in availability and demand for materials. We may experience shortages in the availability of materials and/or labor in each of our markets. These shortages and delays may result in delays in the delivery of homes under construction, and/or reduced gross margins from home sales.  
 Seasonality 
 We experience seasonal variations in our quarterly operating results and capital requirements. Historically, new order activity is highest during the spring and summer months. As a result, we typically have more homes under construction, close more homes, and have 

 
4



 

greater revenues and operating income in the second half of our fiscal year.  Historical results are not necessarily indicative of current or future homebuilding activities. 
 Governmental regulation and environmental matters 
 We are subject to numerous local, state, federal and other statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning zoning, development, building design, construction and similar matters which impose restrictive zoning and density requirements in order to limit the number of homes that can eventually be built within the boundaries of a particular area. Projects that are not entitled may be subjected to periodic delays, changes in use, less intensive development or elimination of development in certain specific areas due to government regulations. We may also be subject to periodic delays or may be precluded entirely from developing in certain communities due to building moratoriums or “slow-growth” or “no-growth” initiatives that could be implemented in the future. Local and state governments also have broad discretion regarding the imposition of development fees for projects in their jurisdiction. Projects for which we have received land use and development entitlements or approvals may still require a variety of other governmental approvals and permits during the development process and can also be impacted adversely by unforeseen municipal, regulatory, health, safety and welfare issues, which can further delay these projects or prevent their development. 
 ﻿
 We are also subject to a variety of local, state, federal and other statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning the environment. The particular environmental laws which apply to any given homebuilding site vary according to the site’s location, its environmental conditions, and the present and former uses of the site, as well as adjoining properties. Environmental laws and conditions may result in delays, may cause us to incur substantial compliance and other costs, and can prohibit or severely restrict homebuilding activity in environmentally sensitive regions or areas. From time to time, the Environmental Protection Agency and similar federal or state agencies review homebuilders’ compliance with environmental laws and may levy fines and penalties for failure to strictly comply with applicable environmental laws or impose additional requirements for future compliance as a result of past failures. Any such actions taken with respect to us may increase our costs. Further, we expect that increasingly stringent requirements will be imposed on homebuilders in the future. Environmental regulations can also have an adverse impact on the availability and price of certain raw materials such as lumber. 
 Under various environmental laws, current or former owners of real estate, as well as certain other categories of parties, may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases, and may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred by such parties in connection with the contamination. In addition, in those cases where an endangered species is involved, environmental rules and regulations can result in the elimination of development in identified environmentally sensitive areas. 
 Our mortgage, title, and insurance subsidiaries must comply with applicable real estate, lending and insurance laws and regulations. The subsidiaries are licensed in the states in which they do business and must comply with laws and regulations in those states. These laws and regulations include provisions regarding capitalization, operating procedures, investments, lending and privacy disclosures, forms of policies and premiums. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contains a number of requirements relating to mortgage lending and securitizations. These include, among others, minimum standards for lender practices, limitations on certain fees and a requirement that the originator of loans that are securitized retain a portion of the risk, either directly or by holding interests in the securitizations.
 Several federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations and ordinances, including, but not limited to, the Federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (“FDCPA”) and the Federal Trade Commission Act and comparable state statutes, regulate consumer debt collection activity. Although, for a variety of reasons, we may not be specifically subject to the FDCPA or to some state statutes that govern debt collectors, it is our policy to comply with applicable laws in our collection activities. To the extent that some or all of these laws apply to our collection activities, our failure to comply with such laws could have a material adverse effect on us. We are also subject to regulations promulgated by the Federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau regarding residential mortgage loans.

  ﻿
 We have also identified our Financial Services operations, which provides mortgage, title and insurance services to our homebuyers, as a sixth reportable segment.  Our Corporate operations are a nonoperating segment, as it serves to support our homebuilding and other operations through functions, such as our executive, finance, treasury, human resources, legal, and accounting departments.     Footnote 2 (Reporting Segments) of our Consolidated Financial Statements contains information regarding the operations of our reportable segments. 
 ﻿
 Competition
 ﻿
 We face competition in the homebuilding industry, which is characterized by relatively low barriers to entry. Homebuilders compete for, among other things, home buying customers, desirable land parcels, employees, financing, raw materials and skilled labor. Increased competition may prevent us from acquiring attractive land parcels on which to build homes or make such acquisitions more expensive, hinder our market share expansion or lead to pricing pressures on our homes that may adversely impact our margins and revenues. Our competitors may independently develop land and construct housing units that are superior or substantially similar to our products, or may be significantly larger, have a longer operating history and have greater resources or lower cost of capital than us; accordingly, they may be able to compete more effectively in one or more of the markets in which we operate or plan to operate. We also compete with other homebuilders that have long-standing relationships with subcontractors and suppliers in the markets in which we operate or plan to operate and we compete for sales with individual resales of existing homes and with available rental housing.
 ﻿
 Our Financial Services operations compete with other mortgage lenders, including national, regional and local mortgage bankers and brokers, banks, savings and loan associations and other financial institutions, in the origination and sale of residential mortgage loans. Principal competitive factors include interest rates and other features of mortgage loan products available to the consumer. We compete with other title insurance agencies and underwriters for closing services and title insurance. We also compete with other insurance agencies. Principal competitive factors include service and price.
 Employees
 ﻿
 The total number of employees as of December 31, 2018 was 1,389. We consider our employee relations to be good. We do not have collective bargaining agreements relating to any of our employees. However, we subcontract many phases of our homebuilding operations and some of the subcontractors we use have employees who are represented by labor unions. Available Information
