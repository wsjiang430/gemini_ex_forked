ITEM 1. BUSINESS
The Company. Kellogg Company, founded in 1906 and incorporated in Delaware in 1922, and its subsidiaries are engaged in the manufacture and marketing of ready-to-eat cereal and convenience foods.
The address of the principal business office of Kellogg Company is One Kellogg Square, P.O. Box 3599, Battle Creek, Michigan 49016-3599. Unless otherwise specified or indicated by the context, “Kellogg,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to Kellogg Company, its divisions and subsidiaries.
Financial Information About Segments. Information on segments is located in Note 18 within Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Principal Products. Our principal products are snacks, such as crackers, cookies, savory snacks, toaster pastries, cereal bars, granola bars and bites, fruit-flavored snacks; and convenience foods, such as, ready-to-eat cereals, frozen waffles, veggie foods and noodles. These products were, as of February 25, 2019, manufactured by us in 21 countries and marketed in more than 180 countries. They are sold to retailers through direct sales forces for resale to consumers. We use broker and distributor arrangements for certain products and channels, as well as less-developed market areas or in those market areas outside of our focus. 
Our snacks brands are marketed under brands such as Kellogg’s, Keebler, Cheez-It, Pringles, Murray, Austin, Famous Amos, Parati, and RXBAR.  Our cereals and cereal bars are generally marketed under the Kellogg’s name, with some under the Kashi and Bear Naked brands.  Our frozen foods are marketed under the Eggo and Morningstar Farms brands.
We also market cookies, crackers, crisps, and other convenience foods, under brands such as Kellogg’s, Keebler, Cheez-It, Pringles, Murray, Austin and Famous Amos, to supermarkets in the United States through a variety of distribution methods.
Additional information pertaining to the relative sales of our products for the years 2016 through 2018 is located in Note 18 within Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which are included herein under Part II, Item 8.
Corporate responsibility and sustainability. Climate change and food security are core business issues for Kellogg to ensure the long-term health and viability of the ingredients we use in our products. The Social Responsibility & Public Policy Committee of our Board of Directors oversees the company's sustainability efforts and climate policy. All four committee members are independent. At the executive level, environmental and social issues in our supply chain are overseen by our Chief Sustainability Officer and are aligned and included in parallel work streams within internal audit and audit committee. Policies and strategies regarding these topics are aligned in the organization’s lobbying, advocacy, and membership efforts. In multi-stakeholder initiatives, Kellogg partners with suppliers, customers, governments and non-governmental organizations, including the World Business Council for Sustainable Development and the Consumer Goods Forum. 
Kellogg Company relies on natural capital including energy for product manufacturing and distribution, water as an ingredient, for facility cleaning and steam power, and food crops and commodities as an ingredient. These natural capital dependencies are at risk of shortage, price volatility, regulation, and quality impacts due to climate change which is assessed as part of Kellogg’s overall enterprise risk management approach. Specific risks including water stress and social accountability are specifically identified and assessed on a regular basis, especially in emerging market expansion that fuels company growth. Due to these risks, Kellogg has implemented major short- and long-term initiatives to mitigate and adapt to these environmental pressures, as well as the resulting challenge of food security.
Global sustainability commitments. Kellogg has committed to improving efficiency in its owned manufacturing footprint by reducing water use, total waste, energy use, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 15% per metric tonne of food produced by 2020 from a 2015 baseline. We will report 2018 energy, GHG, and water use reductions in our 2018/2019 Corporate Responsibility Report. The goal is to reduce the risk of disruptions from unexpected constraints in natural resource availability or impacts on raw material pricing. Additionally, Kellogg is committed to implement water reuse projects in at least 25% of our plants by 2020 from a 2015 baseline, with a specific focus on plants located in water stressed areas. Kellogg has committed to responsibly sourcing our ten priority ingredients as determined by environmental, social, and business risk by 2020 by partnering with suppliers and farmers to 
1

measure continuous improvement. In addition, Kellogg established third-party approved science-based targets to reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse emissions by 65% and Scope 3 greenhouse emissions by 50% by 2050 from a 2015 baseline. Through these commitments, Kellogg supports the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal #13 to take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts. 
In 2017, the manufacturing organization led sustainability efforts that resulted in a reduction in water use by 1.8%, energy use by 2.1%, and GHG emissions by 11.4% per metric tonne of food produce compared to a 2015 baseline. In the first year of our science-based targets, we’ve reduced absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 13.6%. In September 2017, Kellogg joined RE100, an industry platform working together towards 100% renewable electricity. Increasing our use of renewable electricity will lower business risk and reduce GHG emissions. 
Food Loss and Waste: As a global food company, Kellogg is committed to addressing the critical issues of climate and food security, and we’re committed to address food loss and waste. Kellogg supports the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 12.3, to halve per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels and reduce food losses along production and supply chains, including post-harvest losses, by 2030. These goals are aligned with Kellogg commitments to reduce waste, with a focus on food waste across our end-to-end supply chain. And through our global signature cause platform, Breakfasts for Better Days™ we’re donating food for hunger relief that may otherwise go to waste.
Breakfasts for Better Days: In 2016, this global social purpose platform expanded with the intent to contribute to food security - aligned to United Nations Sustainable Development Goal #2 (SDG 2): End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture. The goal of the program is to create 3 billion Better Days by 2025 to address food security risks that can impact the Company as well as create opportunity to engage consumers. The Company’s five key commitments include food donations, expansion of breakfast clubs, supporting 500,000 farmers, committing to 45,000 employee volunteer days, and engaging 300 million people to join Kellogg in its hunger relief efforts. Through Breakfasts for Better Days, Kellogg has helped make billions of days better for people in need, providing 2.5 billion servings of food since 2013.
As a grain-based food company, the success of Kellogg Company is dependent on having timely access to high quality, low cost ingredients, water and energy for manufacturing globally. Risks are identified annually through annual reporting and evaluated in the short (<3 years), medium (3 - 6 years) and long terms (>6 years). The Company has incorporated the risks and opportunities of climate change and food security as part of the Global 2020 Growth Strategy and global Heart and Soul Strategy by continuing to identify risk, incorporate sustainability indicators into strategic priorities, and report regularly to leadership, the Board, and publicly. While these risks are not currently impacting business growth, they must be monitored, evaluated, and mitigated. 
Raw Materials. Agricultural commodities, including corn, wheat, potato flakes, vegetable oils, sugar and cocoa, are the principal raw materials used in our products. Cartonboard, corrugate, and plastic are the principal packaging materials used by us. We continually monitor world supplies and prices of such commodities (which include such packaging materials), as well as government trade policies. The cost of such commodities may fluctuate widely due to government policy and regulation, weather conditions, climate change or other unforeseen circumstances. Continuous efforts are made to maintain and improve the quality and supply of such commodities for purposes of our short-term and long-term requirements.
The principal ingredients in the products produced by us in the United States include corn grits, wheat and wheat derivatives, potato flakes, oats, rice, cocoa and chocolate, soybeans and soybean derivatives, various fruits, sweeteners, vegetable oils, dairy products, eggs, and other ingredients, which are obtained from various sources. While most of these ingredients are purchased from sources in the United States, some materials are imported due to regional availability and specification requirements.
We enter into long-term contracts for the materials described in this section and purchase these items on the open market, depending on our view of possible price fluctuations, supply levels, and our relative negotiating power. While the cost of some of these materials has, and may continue to increase over time, we believe that we will be able to purchase an adequate supply of these items as needed. As further discussed herein under Part II, Item 7A, we also use commodity futures and options to hedge some of our costs.
Raw materials and packaging needed for internationally based operations are available in adequate supply and are sourced both locally and imported from countries other than those where used in manufacturing.

We consider that, taken as a whole, the rights under our various patents, which expire from time to time, are a valuable asset, but we do not believe that our businesses are materially dependent on any single patent or group of related patents. Our activities under licenses or other franchises or concessions which we hold are similarly a valuable asset, but are not believed to be material.
Seasonality. Demand for our products has generally been approximately level throughout the year, although some of our convenience foods have a bias for stronger demand in the second half of the year due to events and holidays. We also custom-bake cookies under a trademark license agreement with the Girl Scouts of the U.S.A., which cookies are principally sold in the first quarter of the year.
Working Capital. A description of our working capital is included in the Liquidity section of MD&A within Item 7 of this report.
Customers. Our largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates, accounted for approximately 19% of consolidated net sales during 2018, comprised principally of sales within the United States. No other customer accounted for greater than 10% of net sales in 2018. During 2018, our top five customers, collectively, including Wal-Mart, accounted for approximately 33% of our consolidated net sales and approximately 49% of U.S. net sales. There has been significant worldwide consolidation in the grocery industry and we believe that this trend is likely to continue. Although the loss of any large customer for an extended length of time could negatively impact our sales and profits, we do not anticipate that this will occur to a significant extent due to the consumer demand for our products and our relationships with our customers. Our products have been generally sold through our own sales forces and through broker and distributor arrangements, and have been generally resold to consumers in retail stores, restaurants, and other food service establishments.
Backlog. For the most part, orders are filled within a few days of receipt and are subject to cancellation at any time prior to shipment. The backlog of any unfilled orders at December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 was not material to us.
Competition. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, intense competition for sales of all of our principal products in our major product categories, both domestically and internationally. Our products compete with advertised and branded products of a similar nature as well as unadvertised and private label products, which are typically distributed at lower prices, and generally with other food products. Principal methods and factors of competition include new product introductions, product quality, taste, convenience, nutritional value, price, advertising and promotion.
Research and Development. Research to support and expand the use of our existing products and to develop new food products is carried on at the W. K. Kellogg Institute for Food and Nutrition Research in Battle Creek, Michigan, and at other locations around the world. Our expenditures for research and development were approximately (in millions): 2018-$154; 2017-$148; 2016-$182.
Regulation. Our activities in the United States are subject to regulation by various government agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration, Federal Trade Commission and the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce and Labor, as well as voluntary regulation by other bodies. Various state and local agencies also regulate our activities. Other agencies and bodies outside of the United States, including those of the European Union and various countries, states and municipalities, also regulate our activities.
Environmental Matters. Our facilities are subject to various U.S. and foreign, federal, state, and local laws and regulations regarding the release of material into the environment and the protection of the environment in other ways. We are not a party to any material proceedings arising under these regulations. We believe that compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations will not materially affect our consolidated financial condition or our competitive position.
Employees. At December 29, 2018, we had approximately 34,000 employees.
Financial Information About Geographic Areas. Information on geographic areas is located in Note 18 within Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which are included herein under Part II, Item 8.
