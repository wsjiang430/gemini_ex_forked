Overview
 
Novavax, Inc., together with our wholly-owned Swedish subsidiary, Novavax AB, is a late-stage biotechnology company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative vaccines to prevent serious infectious diseases. Using innovative proprietary recombinant nanoparticle vaccine technology, we produce vaccine candidates to efficiently and effectively respond to both known and emerging disease threats.
 
We were incorporated in 1987 under the laws of the State of Delaware. Our principal executive offices are located at 20 Firstfield Road, Gaithersburg, Maryland, 20878, and our telephone number is (240) 268-2000. Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “NVAX.”
 
Our vaccine candidates, including our lead candidates, ResVaxTM and NanoFluTM, are genetically engineered, three-dimensional nanostructures of recombinant proteins critical to disease pathogenesis and may elicit differentiated immune responses, which may be more efficacious than naturally occurring immunity or traditional vaccines. Our product pipeline (see below) targets a variety of infectious diseases. We are also developing immune stimulating saponin-based adjuvants through our wholly owned Swedish subsidiary, Novavax AB. Our lead adjuvant, Matrix-M™, has been shown to enhance immune responses and was well-tolerated in multiple clinical trials.

A summary and status of these vaccine programs follows:
 
Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV)
 
Currently, there is no approved RSV vaccine available to combat the estimated 64 million RSV infections that occur globally each year. We have identified three susceptible target populations that we believe could benefit from the development of our respiratory syncytial virus fusion (F) protein nanoparticle vaccine candidate (“RSV F Vaccine”) in different formulations: (1) infants via maternal immunization, (2) older adults (60 years and older) and (3) children six months to five years old (“pediatrics”). With our current estimates of the annual global cost burden of RSV in excess of $88 billion, we believe our RSV F Vaccine represents a multi-billion dollar worldwide opportunity.
ResVax Program (Infants via Maternal Immunization)
 
ResVax, our adjuvanted RSV F Vaccine for infants via maternal immunization, is our lead vaccine program. RSV is the most common cause of lower respiratory tract infections and the leading viral cause of severe lower respiratory tract disease in infants and young children worldwide. In the U.S., RSV is the leading cause of hospitalization of infants and, globally, is second only to malaria as a cause of death in children under one year of age.

In February 2019, we announced top-line data from the Prepare trial, which we initiated in December 2015 to determine the efficacy of ResVax against medically significant RSV-positive lower respiratory tract infection (“LRTI”) in infants through a minimum of the first 90 days of life and up through the first six months of life. While the Prepare trial did not meet its pre-specified primary efficacy endpoint, it did demonstrate efficacy against one of the secondary objectives (RSV LRTI hospitalizations), the first RSV vaccine to show efficacy in a Phase 3 clinical trial. In addition, in the Prepare trial, other pre-specified exploratory endpoints and post-hoc analyses highlight ResVax’ potential to improve global health against RSV disease in this vulnerable population. Like previous clinical trials, ResVax showed a favorable safety and tolerability profile from the Prepare trial. With these results, we plan to meet with both the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) later in 2019, to discuss and assess opportunities for submitting a Biologics License Application (“BLA”) with the FDA and/or a Marketing Authorization Application (“MAA”) with the EMA, in 2020. We are also considering seeking licensure strategically in a number of geographic regions, other than the U.S. and Europe, where the Prepare results support such efforts. The development of ResVax and the conduct of the Prepare trial are supported by a grant of up to $89.1 million from BMGF for development activities, product licensing efforts and World Health Organization (“WHO”) prequalification of ResVax.
 
RSV Older Adults Program
 
Older adults (60 years and older) are at increased risk for RSV disease due in part to immunosenescence, the age-related decline in the human immune system. RSV infection can also lead to exacerbation of underlying co-morbidities such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma and congestive heart failure. In the U.S. alone, a reported RSV incidence rate of 5.5% in older adults would account for approximately 2.5 million infections per year. We estimate that approximately 900,000 medical interventions are caused by RSV disease in this U.S. population each year. In our 2017 Phase 2 clinical trial of our RSV F Vaccine in older adults, we assessed safety and immunogenicity of one and two dose regimens of our RSV F Vaccine, with and without aluminum phosphate or our proprietary Matrix-M adjuvant. Immunogenicity results indicate that both adjuvants increase the magnitude, duration and quality of the immune response versus the non-adjuvanted RSV F Vaccine. The 2016 Phase 3 clinical trial of our RSV F Vaccine failed to meet it pre-specified primary or secondary efficacy objectives and did not demonstrate vaccine efficacy. We are currently assessing the development opportunities for our RSV F Vaccine in older adults.
RSV Pediatrics Program
 
By the age of five, essentially all children will have been exposed to RSV and will likely develop natural immunity against the virus; however, children under five remain vulnerable to RSV disease, offering a strong rationale for a pediatric vaccine that could offer enhanced protection. In 2015, we announced positive results in our Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating the safety and immunogenicity of our RSV F Vaccine in healthy children between two and six years of age. To the extent we receive regulatory approval for ResVax, we expect to continue development of our RSV F Vaccine for pediatrics.
Seasonal Influenza
 
NanoFlu Program (Older Adults)
 
Influenza is a world-wide infectious disease with serious illness generally occurring in more susceptible populations such as pediatrics and older adults, but also occurring in the general population. According to influenza vaccines forecasts by Datamonitor in 2013, the market for seasonal influenza vaccines is expected to grow from approximately $3.2 billion in the 2015-16 flu season to approximately $5.3 billion in the 2021-22 flu season (in the countries comprising the top seven markets). The Center for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that each year since 2010, influenza in the U.S. has resulted in between 9.2 million and 35.6 million illnesses, between 140,000 and 710,000 hospitalizations and between 12,000 and 56,000 deaths.
 
In January 2019, we announced positive top-line data from our Phase 2 clinical trial of NanoFlu in older adults. Top-line results showed that all formulations of NanoFlu were well-tolerated and elicited vigorous immune responses to all four strains included in the vaccine; importantly, use of our Matrix-M adjuvant resulted in significantly enhanced immune responses when compared to a non-adjuvanted formulation. NanoFlu also showed superior hemagglutination inhibition antibody responses against wild-type A(H3N2) viruses, including drifted strains, when compared to Fluzone High-Dose, the leading flu vaccine in older adults. During a pre-investigational new drug application meeting in 2018, the FDA indicated that an accelerated approval pathway for seasonal influenza vaccines could be available for NanoFlu. We plan to discuss the Phase 2 clinical trial data and the proposed Phase 3 study design, and reach agreement on the use of accelerated approval with the FDA during an End-of-Phase 2 meeting in the first half of 2019. We are currently planning a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of NanoFlu that could begin as early as the second half of 2019 in the United States.

Combination Seasonal Influenza/RSV F Vaccine
 
With the ongoing development of our NanoFlu and RSV F Vaccine, a strong rationale exists for developing a combination respiratory vaccine that is designed to protect susceptible populations against both diseases. Although testing is at an early stage, we believe that a combination vaccine against both influenza and RSV may be achievable.
Early-stage Vaccine Candidates
 
Because our nanoparticle technology targets antigens with conserved epitopes essential for viral function, our vaccine candidates have the potential to be applied broadly to a wide variety of human infectious diseases. Our nanoparticle vaccine technology has already demonstrated the ability to produce vaccine candidates against a wide variety of infectious diseases: in addition to our ResVax and NanoFlu vaccines, we have also developed nanoparticle vaccine candidates for clinic testing against ebola virus (positive Phase 1 clinical trial results) and MERS coronavirus (positive animal studies). While we have focused most of our corporate efforts towards our RSV and seasonal influenza vaccine candidates, we stand ready to continue work on emerging infectious disease vaccine candidates as circumstances warrant.
CPLB Joint Venture
 
CPL Biologicals Private Limited (“CPLB”), our joint venture between Novavax and Cadila Pharmaceuticals Limited (“Cadila”), is actively developing a number of vaccine candidates in India. In July 2018, we amended and restated our joint venture and license agreements with respect to CPLB to align them with our current and planned interactions with CPLB. CPLB continues to be owned 20% by Novavax and 80% by Cadila.
Vaccine Technology
 
Our recombinant protein nanoparticle vaccine technology is based on self-assembly of surface protein antigens from pathogenic organisms including viruses, bacteria or parasites. The conformations of these nanoparticles are similar but not identical to the natural structure of surface antigens of disease organisms, and lack the genetic material required for replication and therefore are not infectious. Potential immunological advantages of protein nanoparticles may be associated with the nanoparticle conformation and the presentation of key functional epitopes that are often immunologically hidden in the native pathogen. This leads to efficient recognition by the immune system’s antigen presenting cells that trigger robust immune responses. Recognition of the nanoparticle vaccine’s repeating protein patterns by the antigen presenting cells’ toll-like receptors to stimulate innate immunity and the high purity and lack of synthetic material adds to the potential safety of recombinant nanoparticle vaccines. Protein nanoparticle vaccine technology has expanded our early-stage vaccines in development to include both virus and non-virus disease targets. Our most advanced protein nanoparticle vaccine candidate is our RSV F Vaccine, which self-assembles from our highly purified F-protein antigen.
Matrix Adjuvants
 
Adjuvants are predominantly used to enable a vaccine to increase the amplitude of the immune response and qualitatively change it, broadening the immune systems attack against microorganisms and allow for effective immunization with much lower doses of antigen. Novavax AB has developed a number of adjuvant formulations, all based on our proprietary Matrix technology. These adjuvant formulations possess excellent immunostimulatory features with the ability to increase and prolong the protective benefits of vaccines.
 
While adjuvants based on novel, poorly characterized substances have been hampered by safety concerns and limited efficacy, Matrix adjuvants stimulate strong antibody and cell-mediated immune responses. Matrix adjuvants may allow for lower antigen doses, longer-duration immune responses and carry a lower risk for allergic reactions or other adverse events. Our Matrix technology typically induces strong cellular activation of both Th1 and Th2 types, thereby generating all classes and subclasses of antibodies, as well as potent cellular responses, including cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Our Matrix-M adjuvant provides a potent adjuvant effect that has been well-tolerated in clinical trials. We also believe that the strong immune response and opportunity to reduce the quantity of antigen dose can significantly reduce the production cost of our vaccines. This means that our Matrix-M adjuvant has the potential to be of significant value when there is inadequate vaccine manufacturing capacity during an emerging disease threat such as an influenza pandemic.

Competition in RSV and Influenza 
 
The vaccine market is intensely competitive, characterized by rapid technological progress. Our technology is based upon utilizing the baculovirus expression system in insect cells to make recombinant vaccines. We believe this system offers many advantages when compared to other technologies and is uniquely well-suited for developing RSV and influenza vaccines, as well as vaccines against a number of other infectious diseases.
 
There is currently no approved RSV vaccine for sale in the world; however, a number of vaccine manufacturers, academic institutions and other organizations currently have, or have had, programs to develop such a vaccine. These groups are developing products to prevent disease caused by RSV using a variety of technology platforms, including viral vectors, nucleic acid (RNA/DNA), live attenuated chimeric, antigens or monoclonal antibodies (“Mab”), and competitive recombinant technologies. Despite the recent announcement of results from the Prepare trial of ResVax, we continue to believe that our RSV F vaccine candidate, which is a recombinant prefusogenic F-protein nanoparticle, is likely to be more effective than other RSV vaccine candidates or other products in development by our competitors. We further believe that ResVax, our RSV vaccine program for infants via maternal immunization, is the only RSV vaccine to have ever demonstrated efficacy in a Phase 3 clinical trial. At this time, there are a number of companies and other organizations with vaccine candidates in Phase 1 and 2 trials, including Pfizer, GlaxoSmithKline, Sanofi, Bavarian Nordic, Janssen, Moderna, Ablynx, Immunovaccine, Intravaac, Vaxart and the NIAID. Presently, the two lead Mab programs seeking to develop product candidates to prevent RSV in young infants are being conducted by AstraZeneca PLC (“AstraZeneca”), and Merck. The AstraZeneca Mab, which is partnered with Sanofi Pasteur and Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB, is completing Phase 2 trials for preterm infants and has recently obtained breakthrough designation from the FDA, while the Merck Mab is currently in Phase 1 trials in preterm and full-term infants.
 
There are a number of companies developing and selling vaccines for seasonal influenza employing both traditional (egg-based) and new vaccine technologies (cell-based). Many seasonal influenza vaccines are currently approved and marketed, and most of these are marketed by major pharmaceutical companies that have significantly greater financial and technical resources, experience and expertise. Competition in the sale of seasonal influenza vaccines is intense. Therefore, newly developed and approved products must be differentiated from existing vaccines in order to have commercial success. In order to show differentiation in the seasonal influenza market, a product may need to be more efficacious and/or be less expensive and quicker to manufacture. Many of our competitors are working on new products and new generations of current products, some by adding an adjuvant that is used to increase the immunogenicity of that product, each of which is intended to be more efficacious than currently marketed products. Despite the significant competition and advancing technologies, some of which are similar to our own, based on our recently completed Phase 2 trials results, we believe that NanoFlu, our nanoparticle seasonal influenza product could be as efficacious as, or more so than, current products or products being developed by our competitors. However, our seasonal influenza vaccine may not prove to be efficacious or our manufacturing system may not prove to be sufficiently effective and differentiated to ensure commercial success.
 
In general, competition among pharmaceutical products is based in part on product efficacy, safety, reliability, availability, price and patent position. An important factor is the relative timing of the market introduction of our products and our competitors’ products. Accordingly, the speed with which we can develop products, complete the clinical trials and approval processes and supply commercial quantities of the products to the market is an important competitive factor. Our competitive position also may depend upon our ability to show differentiation with a product that is more efficacious and/or less expensive and quicker to manufacture. Other factors affecting our competitive position include our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, obtain patent protection or otherwise develop proprietary products or processes and secure sufficient capital resources for the lengthy period between technological conception and commercial sale.
 
Patents and Proprietary Rights
 
We generally seek patent protection for our technology and product candidates in the U.S. and abroad. The patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical firms generally is highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions. Our success will depend, in part, on whether we can:

• | obtain patents to protect our own technologies and product candidates;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | obtain licenses to use the technologies of third-parties, which may be protected by patents;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | protect our trade secrets and know-how; and
--+--------------------------------------------


• | operate without infringing the intellectual property and proprietary rights of others.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Patent Rights; Licenses.
 
We have intellectual property (patents, licenses, know-how) related to our vaccines, manufacturing processes and other technologies. Currently, we have or have rights to over 350 U.S. patents and corresponding foreign patents and patent applications relating to vaccines and vaccine-related technologies.
 
Patents related to our VLP program include U.S. Patent No. 7,763,450, which covers, in part, the use of influenza gene sequences for high-yield production of consistent influenza VLP vaccines to protect against current and future seasonal and pandemic strains of influenza viruses. Corresponding European patent, European Patent No. 1644037 also covers this technology. U.S. Patent Nos. 8,080,255, 8,551,756, 8,506,967 and 8,592,197 are directed to methods of producing VLPs and inducing substantial immunity to an influenza virus infection by administering VLPs comprising HA and NA proteins, and our M1 protein derived from the avian influenza strain, A/Indonesia/5/05. Certain claims also encompass similar methods and compositions where the M1 protein is from a different strain of influenza virus than the influenza HA protein and the influenza NA protein. Related patent protection in Europe is provided by European Patent No. 2343084, which covers, in part, vaccine compositions containing VLPs that contain M1, HA, and NA proteins. Our VLP patent portfolio contains many other patents, including U.S. Patent Nos. 8,951,537, 8,992,939, 9,144,607, 9,050,290, 9,180,180, 9,381,239, 9,464,276, 9,474,799, and other patents in multiple ex-U.S. jurisdictions, and we continue to prosecute patents related to this program.
 
In addition to our VLP program, we have issued patents and pending applications directed to other programs, including our RSV and rabies programs. Issued patents directed to various aspects of the RSV program include U.S. Patent Nos. 8,715,692, 9,675,685, 9,731,000, 9,717,786, and 10,022,437. Additional patents in the family include EP237009 in Europe, as well as others throughout the world. Patents related to our rabies program include 9,724,405 and 10,086,065 in the U.S. and EP2635257 in Europe. Related patents have been issued in other world markets. In addition to our focus on vaccine programs, we also pursue patent protection for our Matrix Adjuvant program. Issued U.S. Patent Nos. 7,838,019, 9,205,147, 9,901,634 and 8,821,881 provide examples of patents related to our Matrix Adjuvant program.
 
We continue to prepare, file, and prosecute patent applications to provide broad and strong protection of our proprietary rights, including next generation applications focused on our RSV Program, our influenza nanoparticle program, and our adjuvant program.
 
The Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 and related statutory guidance encourages the dissemination of science and technology innovation. While our expired contract with the Department of Health and Human Services, Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (“HHS BARDA”) provided us with the right to retain ownership in our inventions that may have arisen during performance of that contract, with respect to certain other collaborative research efforts with the U.S. government, certain developments and results that may have commercial potential are to be freely published, not treated as confidential, and we may be required to negotiate a license to developments and results in order to commercialize products. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully obtain any such license at a reasonable cost, or that such development and results will not be made available to our competitors on an exclusive or non-exclusive basis.
 
Trade Secrets.
 
We also rely significantly on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests. It is our policy to require employees, consultants, contractors, manufacturers, collaborators and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment, consulting or collaborative relationships with us. We also require confidentiality agreements from any entity that is to receive confidential information from us. With respect to employees, consultants and contractors, the agreements generally provide that all inventions made by the individual while rendering services to us shall be assigned to us as our property.

Government Regulations
 
The development, production and marketing of biological products, which include the vaccine candidates being developed by Novavax or our collaborators, are subject to regulation for safety, efficacy and quality by numerous governmental authorities in the U.S. and other countries. Although, we focus on the U.S. regulatory process and the standards imposed by the FDA, the International Conference on Harmonisation (“ICH”) and other agencies because we believe meeting U.S. and ICH standards generally allows us to satisfy regulatory agencies in other countries where we intend to do business; however we are mindful that expectations in some venues, notably in the European Union, differ to some degree and we take proactive steps to address such differences by maintaining regular filings and correspondence and attending regular meetings with many other non-U.S. regulatory agencies. In the U.S., the development, manufacturing and marketing of human pharmaceuticals and vaccines are subject to extensive regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and biological products are subject to regulation under provisions of that act and the Public Health Service Act. The FDA not only assesses the safety and efficacy of these products but it also regulates, among other things, the testing, manufacture, labeling, storage, record-keeping, advertising and promotion of such products. The process of obtaining FDA licensure for a new vaccine is costly and time-consuming.
 
Vaccine clinical development follows the same general regulatory pathway as drugs and other biologics. Before applying for FDA licensure to market any new vaccine candidate, we expect to first submit an investigational new drug application (“IND”) that explains to the FDA, among other things, the results of preclinical toxicology testing conducted in laboratory animals, the method of manufacture, quality control tests for release, the stability of the investigational product and what we propose to do for human testing. At this stage, the FDA decides whether it is reasonably safe to move forward with testing the vaccine candidate in humans. We must then conduct Phase 1 clinical trials and larger-scale Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials that demonstrate the safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of our vaccine candidate to the satisfaction of the FDA. Once these trials are complete, a BLA can be submitted to the FDA requesting licensure of the vaccine for marketing based on the vaccine’s safety and efficacy. Similar pathways exist in Europe and other geographies.
 
The FDA will only approve a BLA if the vaccine is demonstrated to be safe, pure, and potent. During the FDA’s review of a BLA, the proposed manufacturing facility undergoes a pre-approval inspection during which the FDA examines in detail the production of the vaccine, the manufacturing facility and the quality documentation related to the vaccine. Vaccine licensure also requires the provision of adequate product labeling to allow health care providers to understand the vaccine’s proper use, including its potential benefits and risks, to communicate with patients and parents, and to safely deliver the vaccine to the public. Until a vaccine is given to the general population, all potential adverse events cannot be anticipated. Thus, the FDA typically requires Phase 4 post-marketing clinical trials for vaccines after licensure to continue gathering safety, and sometimes effectiveness/efficacy data in the indicated and additional populations.
 
In order to ensure continuing safety, the FDA and most other non-U.S. based regulatory agencies continue to oversee the production of vaccines even after the vaccine and manufacturing processes are approved. For example, monitoring of the vaccine and of production activities, including periodic facility inspections, must continue as long as the manufacturer holds a license for the product. Manufacturers may also be required to submit the results of their own tests for potency, safety and purity for each vaccine lot, if requested by the relevant regulatory agency. They may also be required to submit samples of each vaccine lot to the agency for testing.
 
In addition to obtaining FDA licensure for each product, each domestic manufacturing establishment must be registered with the FDA, is subject to FDA inspection and must comply with current Good Manufacturing Practices (“GMP”) regulations. To supply products for use either in the U.S. or outside the U.S., including clinical trials, U.S. and foreign manufacturing establishments, including third-party facilities, must comply with GMP regulations and are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA or by corresponding regulatory agencies in their home country.
 
In 1992, the FDA instituted regulations that allow accelerated approval of certain products that treat serious or life-threatening illnesses and provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments based on a surrogate endpoint, versus a clinical outcome, which can take many more years to demonstrate. Surrogate endpoints, generally a laboratory measurement or other physical sign shown to have some correlation with clinical benefit, can considerably shorten the development time leading up to FDA licensure. The FDA bases its decision on whether to accept a proposed surrogate endpoint on the scientific support for that endpoint. The company developing the product is required to conduct further studies to confirm the clinical benefit in Phase 4 confirmatory efficacy trials. We plan to seek accelerated approval for our seasonal influenza vaccine for older adults, but have not ruled out the potential use of traditional approval.

In addition to regulatory approvals that must be obtained in the U.S., an investigational product is also subject to regulatory approval in other countries in which it is intended to be marketed. No such product can be marketed in a country until the regulatory authorities of that country have approved an appropriate marketing application. FDA licensure does not guarantee approval by other regulatory authorities. In addition, in many countries, the government is involved in the pricing of the product. In such cases, the pricing review period often begins after market approval is granted.
 
We are also subject to regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Environmental Protection Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other present and potential federal, state or local regulations, including national and local regulations that govern our facility in Sweden. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological and chemical substances used in, and waste generated by our operations. Our research and development involves the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals and viruses. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with the standards prescribed by state and federal regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated. In the event of such an accident, we could be held liable for any damages that result and any such liability could exceed our resources. Additionally, for formulations containing controlled substances, we are subject to Drug Enforcement Act regulations.
 
In both domestic and foreign markets, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payers. Third-party payers include government authorities or programs, private health insurers (including managed care plans) and other organizations. These third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services. In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products. Our product candidates may not be considered cost-effective. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. Third-party payers may also control access to, or manage utilization of, our products with various utilization management techniques.
 
Within the U.S., if we obtain appropriate approval in the future to market any of our product candidates, those products could potentially be covered by various government health benefit programs as well as purchased by government agencies. The participation in such programs or the sale of products to such agencies is subject to regulation. In exchange for coverage, we may be obligated to provide rebates or offer discounts under government health programs or to government and private purchasers.
 
The U.S. and state governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reform delivery of, or payment for, health care, which include initiatives to reduce the cost of healthcare. For example, in March 2010, the U.S. Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (“Healthcare Reform Act”) which includes changes to the coverage and reimbursement of drug products under government health care programs. Under the Trump administration, there have been ongoing efforts to modify or repeal all or certain provisions of the Healthcare Reform Act, and some modifications have been implemented. Recently, there has been considerable public and government scrutiny in the U.S. of pharmaceutical pricing and proposals to address the perceived high cost of pharmaceuticals. There have also been several recent state legislative efforts to address drug costs, which generally have focused on increasing transparency around drug costs or limiting drug prices or price increases. Adoption of new legislation at the federal or state level could affect demand for, or pricing of, our product candidates if approved for sale. We cannot predict the ultimate content, timing or effect of any federal and state reform efforts. There is no assurance that federal or state health care reform will not adversely affect our future business and financial results.
 
Within the U.S., we may be subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to health care “fraud and abuse,” including anti-kickback laws and false claims laws, for activities related to future sales of any of our product candidates that may in the future receive regulatory and marketing approval. Anti-kickback laws generally prohibit a pharmaceutical manufacturer from soliciting, offering, receiving, or paying any remuneration to generate business, including the purchase, prescription or use of a particular drug. Although the specific provisions of these laws vary, their scope is generally broad and there may not be regulations, guidance or court decisions that apply the laws to particular industry practices. There is therefore a possibility that our practices might be challenged under such anti-kickback laws. False claims laws prohibit anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented, any claims for payment for reimbursed drugs or services to third party payers (including Medicare and Medicaid) that are false or fraudulent.

Laws and regulations have been enacted by the federal government and various states to regulate the sales and marketing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers with marketed products. The laws and regulations generally limit financial interactions between manufacturers and health care providers and/or require disclosure to the government and public of such interactions. Many of these laws and regulations contain ambiguous requirements or require administrative guidance for implementation. Given the lack of clarity in laws and their implementation, any future activities (if we obtain approval and/or reimbursement from federal healthcare programs for our product candidates) could be subject to challenge.
 
Manufacturing
 
Our primary manufacturing facility is located at our corporate headquarters at 20 Firstfield Road in Gaithersburg, Maryland. The facility has 53,000 square feet of combined GMP manufacturing, laboratory and office space. Our Rockville, Maryland facility houses our 10,000 square foot GMP pilot manufacturing facility that produces clinical trial material. Novavax AB, located in Uppsala, Sweden, produces our Matrix adjuvants in an approximately 24,000 square foot facility comprised of GMP manufacturing, laboratory and office space.
Sources of Supply
 
Most of the raw materials and other supplies required in our business are generally available from established vendors in quantities adequate to meet our needs. In some cases, we have only qualified one vendor for certain of our manufacturing components. Prior to the initiation of commercial production, we plan, where feasible, to qualify multiple vendors of critical raw materials. One key vendor is GE Healthcare Company (“GEHC”), which supplies disposable components, resins, media and buffers used in our manufacturing process. GEHC and other vendors that supply our key manufacturing materials have been or will be audited for compliance with GMP standards.
 
An important component of our Matrix adjuvant technology is extracted from a species of soap-bark tree (Quillaja saponaria) that grows mainly in Chile, and we have been able to acquire high-quality quillaja extract as needed from our current suppliers.
 
Business Development
 
We believe our proprietary vaccine technology affords us a range of traditional and non-traditional commercialization options. We strive to create sustainable value by working to obtain non-dilutive funding, similar to our agreement with BMGF to fund our maternal RSV program, that would allow for:

• | continued development of our vaccine candidates until such vaccines can be licensed;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | retained commercial rights in one or more major markets;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


• | product sales revenue; and/or
--+------------------------------


• | commercialization through partners and other strategic relationships.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------

Employees
 
As of March 12, 2019, we have 379 full-time employees, of whom 66 hold M.D. or Ph.D. degrees and 117 of whom hold other advanced degrees. Of our total workforce, 329 are engaged primarily in research, development and manufacturing activities and 50 are engaged primarily in executive, business development, finance and accounting, legal and administrative functions. None of our U.S. employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements; 41 of our 42 Swedish employees are covered by typical collective bargaining agreements.

We use our website (www.novavax.com) as a means of disclosing material non-public information and for complying with our disclosure obligations under Regulation Fair Disclosure promulgated by the SEC. These disclosures are included on our website (www.novavax.com) in the “Investors” or “News” sections. Accordingly, investors should monitor these portions of our website (www.novavax.com), in addition to following our press releases, SEC filings and public conference calls and webcasts.
 
Also available on our website is information relating to corporate governance at Novavax and our Board of Directors, including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. We intend to disclose on our website any future amendments to and waivers from this code that apply to our Chief Executive Officer, Principal Financial Officer, Principal Accounting Officer and Controller, and persons performing similar functions, as promptly as practicable, as may be required under applicable SEC and Nasdaq rules.
 
We webcast our earnings calls and certain events we participate in or host with members of the investment community on the investor relations section of our website. Additionally, we provide notifications of news or announcements regarding press and earnings releases as part of the investor relations section of our website. The contents of our website are not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, or any other report we file with, or furnish to, the SEC.
