ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Unless otherwise indicated by the context, we use the terms “Havertys,” “we,” “our,” or “us” when referring to the consolidated operations of Haverty Furniture Companies, Inc. and subsidiary.
Overview
Havertys is a specialty retailer of residential furniture and accessories. Our founder, J.J. Haverty began the business in 1885 in Atlanta, Georgia with one store and made deliveries using horse-drawn wagons. The Company grew to 18 stores and was incorporated in September 1929. Anticipating further growth, the Company accessed additional capital through its initial public offering in October 1929.
Havertys has grown to over 120 stores in 16 states in the Southern and Midwest regions. All of our retail locations are operated using the Havertys name, and we do not franchise our stores. Our brand recognition is very high in the markets we serve, and consumer surveys indicate Havertys is associated with a high level of quality, fashion, value, and service.
Customers
Havertys customers are typically well-educated women in middle to upper-to-middle income households. They generally own homes in the suburbs, and their diverse personalities are reflected in their unique sense of style. These consumers research and shop online and in-store, often engaging friends or family members in the purchasing process. They are discerning buyers, desiring furnishings that fit their style, but never sacrificing quality. Our marketing, merchandising, stores, online presence, and customer service are targeted to attract and meet the needs of our distinctive customers.
Merchandise and Revenues
We develop our merchandise selection with the diverse taste of our typical “on trend” customer in mind. A wide range of styles from traditional to contemporary are in our core assortment, and virtually all of the furniture merchandise we carry bears the Havertys brand. We also tailor our product offerings to the needs and tastes of the local markets we serve, emphasizing more “coastal,” “western” or “urban” looks as appropriate. Our custom upholstery programs and eclectic looks are an important part of our product mix and allow the on-trend consumer more self-expression.
We have avoided offering lower quality, promotional price-driven merchandise favored by many regional and national chains, which we believe would devalue the Havertys brand with the consumer. We carry nationally well-known mattress product lines such as Tempur-Pedic®, Serta®, Sealy® and Stearns and Foster®.
Our customers use varying methods to purchase or finance their sales. As an added convenience to our customers, we offer financing by third-party finance companies. Sales financed by the third-party providers are not Havertys’ receivables; accordingly, we do not have any credit risk or servicing responsibility for these accounts, and there is no credit or collection recourse to Havertys. Slightly less than one-third of our sales are third-party-financed. The fees we pay to the third parties are included in our selling, general, and expenses (“SG&A”) as a selling expense.
We have a seasoned, commissioned-based sales team serving our customers. Their product knowledge is important in assisting customers in evaluating Havertys' merchandise as compared to our competitors. We also offer a free in-home design service to those customers seeking a more in-depth personalized shopping experience. The average sales ticket for a customer that has a designer visit their home is generally twice that of our average in-store sales ticket. Approximately 24.7% of our business in 2022 resulted from consultations with our in-home designers.

Stores
As of December 31, 2022, we operated 122 stores serving 85 cities in 16 states with approximately 4.4 million retail square feet. Our stores range in size from 15,000 to 60,000 selling square feet, with the average being approximately 35,000 square feet. We strive to have our stores reflect the distinctive style and comfort consumers expect to find when purchasing their home furnishings. The store’s location and curb appeal are important to the middle to upper-middle income consumer that we target, and attractive facades complement the quality and style of our merchandise. Interior details are also important for a pleasant and inviting shopping experience. We are very intentional in having open shopping spaces and our disciplined merchandise display ensures uniformity of presentations in-store, online and in our advertising.
Our goal, subject to market conditions and identifying suitable sites, is to open five new stores per year and expect an approximate 2.2% increase in our retail square footage in 2023. We are evaluating various "big box" former retail sites in the 30,000 to 32,000 square feet size range and other new locations for expansion. We currently have no plans to add stores outside our distribution footprint. 
Online Presence
We consider our website an extension of our brick-and-mortar locations and not a separate segment of our business. Most customers will use the internet for inspiration and as a start to their shopping process to view products and prices. Our website features a variety of helpful tools including a design center with a 3-D room planner, upholstery customization, and inspired accessories.A large number of product reviews written by our customers are also provided, which some consumers find important in the decision-making process.
The next stop in the purchase journey for most consumers is a visit to a store to touch, sit, and see merchandise in person. Our sales consultants also use online tools to further engage our customers while they are in the store. Customers may make their purchase in the store or opt to return home and finalize their decisions, place their orders online and set delivery. We limit internet sales of our furniture to within our delivery network, and internet sales of our accessories to within the continental United States. Our total sales completed online for 2022 were approximately 3.8% of our total 2022 sales. This level of sales makes our website our highest performing "store."
We made significant investments in our website during 2022. The new design and enhancements were launched in the fourth quarter and include better search functionality, improved navigation, enriched product pages, and faster site speed. We also implemented a new content management system, AI driven automation, and improved site reporting to gain insight around customer pathing and content effectiveness.
We believe offering a direct-to-customer business complements our retail store operations as we serve the customer in the method of their choosing and leverage the power of high-touch service and online capabilities.
Suppliers and Supply Chain
We buy our merchandise from numerous foreign and domestic manufacturers and importers, the largest ten of which accounted for approximately 41.3% of our product purchases during 2022. Most of our wood products, or “case goods,” are imported from Asia. Upholstered items are largely produced domestically, with the exception of our leather products which are primarily imported from Asia or Mexico.
We purchase our furniture merchandise produced in Asia through sourcing companies and also buy direct from manufacturers. We have dedicated quality control specialists on-site during production to ensure the items meet our specifications. Our direct import team works with industry designers and manufacturers in some of the best factories throughout Asia. Approximately 20.2% of our case goods sales and 9.2% of our upholstery sales in 2022 were generated by our direct imports.
The longer lead times required for deliveries from overseas factories and the production of merchandise exclusively for Havertys makes it imperative for us to have both warehousing capabilities and end-to-end supply chain visibility. Our merchandising team provides input to the automated procurement process in an effort to maintain overall inventory levels within an appropriate range and reduce the number of written sales awaiting

product delivery. We use real-time information to closely follow our import orders from the manufacturing plant through each stage of transit and using this data can more accurately set customer delivery dates prior to receipt of product.
Manufacturers were challenged by raw material and labor shortages as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Product manufactured in Asia was also impacted by shipping capacity challenges. Each of these factors, in addition to others, led to significantly constrained and delayed supply chains in the home furnishings industry which began to abate during 2022. In the second half of 2022, we experienced a return to more predictable lead times from most of our suppliers.
Distribution
We believe that our distribution and delivery system is one of the best in the retail furniture industry and provides us with a significant competitive advantage. Our distribution system uses a combination of three distribution centers (“DCs”) and four home delivery centers (“HDCs”). The DCs receive both domestic product and containers of imported merchandise. A warehousing management system, using radio frequency scanners, tracks each piece of inventory in real time and allows for random storage in the warehouse and efficient scheduling and changing of the workflow. The DCs are also designed to shuttle prepped merchandise up to 250 miles for next-day home deliveries and serve HDCs within a 500-mile radius. The HDCs provide service to markets within an additional 250 miles. We had announced the conversion of our Virginia HDC to a DC during 2022 but given the dramatic construction cost increases e have deferred that project. We use third parties to handle over-the-road delivery of product from the DCs to the HDCs and market areas. We use Havertys team members for executing home delivery, and have branded this service “Top Drawer Delivery,” an important function serving as the last contact with our customers in the purchase process. Operating standards in our warehouse and delivery functions provide measurements for determining staffing needs and increasing productivity. 
On the whole, our staffing, delivery capacity, and vendor response times returned to their pre-pandemic levels during 2022. Time between purchase and delivery averages 3 to 5 days for in-stock items and 5 to 7 weeks for special order items.

Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2022, Havertys’ total workforce was 2,831: 1,599 in our retail store operations, 990 in our warehouse and delivery points, 179 in our corporate operations, and 63 in our customer-service call centers. None of our team members is a party to a union contract. 
Health and Safety
We care about our teammates, customers, and the communities we serve. We believe a hazard-free environment is a critical enabler for the success of our business. We have a strong safety program that focuses on implementing policies and training programs to ensure our team members can leave their job and return home safely every day.
Diversity
Integrity and teamwork are two of our core values. These drive our approach in our everyday operations with our customers, suppliers and teammates and we believe that the best results happen when we work together. At Havertys, we see strength in America’s many faces, cultures, and colors. Each person offers a unique point of view and presents a fresh perspective. We are committed to diverse representation across all levels of our workforce to reflect the vibrant and thriving diversity of the communities in which we live and work.
Retention and Development
Our compensation programs are designed to attract, retain, and motivate team members to achieve superior results. Havertys’ total compensation for teammates comprises a variety of components, including competitive pay consistent with positions, skill levels, experience, and knowledge. We also offer competitive benefits, including access to healthcare plans, financial and physical wellness programs, paid time off, parental leave and retirement benefits.
We periodically conduct an Employee Engagement Survey (the “Survey”) as a means of measuring employee engagement and satisfaction, and offering employees the chance to feel heard.
We are committed to supporting our teammates’ continuous development of professional, technical and leadership skills through corporate training programs, access to digital learning resources and through partnerships with local technical learning institutions. In 2022, Havertys team members consumed approximately 123,000 hours of learning. We also offer the opportunity for team members to pursue degree programs, professional certificates, and individual courses in strategic fields of study through our tuition reimbursement program. 
Competition
The retail sale of home furnishings is a highly fragmented and competitive business. There has been growth in the e‑commerce channel both from internet only retailers, from start-up furniture retailers and larger more established retailers, and those with a brick-and-mortar presence. The degree and sources of brick-and-mortar retail competition varies by geographic area. We compete with numerous individual retail furniture stores as well as national and regional chains. Retail stores opened or operated by furniture manufacturers in an effort to control and protect the distribution prospects of their branded merchandise compete with us in certain markets. Mass merchants, certain department stores, and some electronics and appliance retailers also have limited furniture product offerings.
We believe Havertys is uniquely positioned in the marketplace, with a targeted mix of merchandise that appeals to customers who are somewhat more affluent than those of promotional price-oriented furniture stores. Our online presence provides most elements of a seamless, omni-channel approach that many of our competitors do not have or cannot replicate. We consider the expansion of our custom order capabilities, free in-home design service, the tailoring of merchandise on a local market basis, and the ability to make prompt delivery of orders through maintenance of inventory to be significant competitive advantages.

Seasonality
Our business is affected by traditional retail seasonality, advertising and promotion programs, and general economic trends. We historically achieve our smallest quarter by revenues in the second quarter and the largest in the fourth quarter. The “nesting” response generated by COVID-19 created outsized demand beginning in the second quarter of 2020 and, when combined with the strong housing market contributed to the strong sales levels we experienced through 2021. During 2022, our business began reverting to its more historical patterns, with a return to increased shopping on weekends and during traditional extended holiday periods. 
Trademarks and Domain Names
We have registered our various logos, trademarks and service marks. We believe that our trademark position is adequately protected in all markets in which we do business. In addition, we have registered and maintain numerous internet domain names including “havertys.com.” Collectively, the logos, trademarks, service marks and domain names that we hold are of material importance to us.
