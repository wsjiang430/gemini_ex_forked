ITEM 1.   BUSINESS.
General
 
Hartford Great Health Corp. ("the Company", “Hartford” "we", "us" or our") was incorporated in the State of Nevada on April 2, 2008 ("Inception) under the name PhotoAmigo, Inc. It changed its name to Hartford Great Health Corp. on August 20, 2018 and since then we have been engaged in activities to formulate and implement our business plan as set forth below.
Overview
 
Up until August 2018, we provided social networking and photo sharing from the website PhotoAmigo.com.   We also maintained the domain names PhotoAmigo.net, fotoamigo.com and fotoamigo.net.  These domain names all redirect incoming traffic to our main website, PhotoAmigo.com.
In August 2018, the Company changed its future plans of operations. On December 28, 2018, the Company acquired Hangzhou Hartford Comprehensive Health Management, Ltd (“HZHF”). On March 22, 2019, the Company acquired 60 percent of Hangzhou Longjing Qiao Fu Vacation Hotel Co., Ltd. (“HZLJ”). On March 20, 2019, the Company acquired Shanghai Hartford Comprehensive Health Management, Ltd. (“HFSH”) with 90 percent of Shanghai Qiao Garden International Travel Agency (“Qiao Garden Int’l Travel”), and formed a joint venture entity, Hartford International Education Technology Co., Ltd (“HF Int’l Education”).
 The following business plan is based on research and discussions between the board and third party suppliers and experts. Only preliminary activities relating to the following objectives have been undertaken and therefore, there is no assurance that any of the proposed activities set forth below will be started by the Company or if started will be successful.
Strategy
 
The plan focuses on the development of the Sino-U.S. health industry in the following four areas:
 
A. Membership based program:
 
The company will develop an international membership-based program (International Anti-Aging Program) for middle to high-income Chinese members. Enrollment into the program will allow members to travel to the United States on a yearly basis for state-of-the-art stem cell treatments including stem cell extraction, storage, and injection from a collaborative of American biomedical stem cell experts. Members will receive stem cell treatments in the United States with a larger goal of enhancing immunity, youthfulness, and longevity. The initial estimated number of annual members is approximately 1800-2000 members.
B. Artificial Intelligence and Medical Equipment Sales:
 
The company will broker sales of cutting-edge artificial intelligence equipment (particularly robotics) to the United States to enhance the overall standard of personal health and the healthcare experience in the U.S. The company will also sell general health and wellness equipment to individual consumers in the United States with the overall goal of improving the personal healthcare experience of customers in the United States.
C. Mobile Lifestyle Management Platform:
 
The company will create an internet-based health consultation platform for Chinese and Chinese-American individuals. This online platform is designed to connect customers with health and wellness information curated by experts in the health consultation and wellness management fields. The online platform will keep customers informed about new wellness-related technologies and advances available to them through the company as well as about general health and wellness lifestyle advice catered towards Chinese-American audiences.
 
D. Integrated management of metabolic diseases:
 
The company plans to target three high-risk populations, individuals with: 1) hyperglycemia, 2) hypertension, and 3) hyperlipidemia. These three conditions are incredibly common amongst both Chinese and American populations; thus, the company plans to introduce an integrated approach to management and overall reduction of these three conditions using a unique combination of Western style supplements and over-the-counter products as well as traditional Chinese Meridian Acupoint Massage.

The Company has also expanded its strategy over the past year into the hospitality industry, focusing on hotels, restaurants, and travel arrangements. The Company plans to integrate hospitality with health management through its membership-based program by arranging travel accommodations for Chinese citizen members to the United States to obtain stem cell beauty treatments.
 
This year, the Company has found another opportunity to expand its market reach in the Chinese childhood education industry. The Company plans to formulate a proprietary early childhood education center management model beginning with the opening of several early childhood education centers in the greater Shanghai area with the goal of demonstrating the management model in action in order to attract interest from potential franchisees.
 
There can be no assurance following consummation of any of the business ventures will develop into a going concern or,
 if the business is already operating, that it will continue to operate successfully. Many of the potential business opportunities available to the Company may involve new and untested products, processes or market strategies which may not ultimately prove successful.
 
The Company's independent auditors have issued a report raising substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. At present, the Company has limited operations and the continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon financial support from its stockholders, its ability to obtain necessary equity financing to continue operations and/or to successfully locate and negotiate with a business entity for the combination of that target company with the Company. There is no assurance that the Company will ever be profitable.
 
 Competition
 
We believe there are only limited barriers to entry in our business. Current and future competitors may have more resources than we have. 
 Health development is a highly competitive business. We will compete with numerous health organizations of which almost all of them have longer operating histories, better brand recognition and greater financial resources than we do. Regarding the hospitality industry, the Company acts as an investor into existing businesses with existing operational expertise and management structures that simply lack sufficient funding to perform optimally. As such, the Company was already aware of what competition these businesses faced prior to investment and purposefully selected to invest in small scale businesses to avoid competition from major international hospitality groups. Similarly, with regards to the education industry, the Company carefully selected to invest in a business with established expertise and knowledge of the early childhood education industry in China. The Company recognizes that there are numerous childcare centers throughout China; however, these centers lack standard curriculums for educating children and many fall into the designation of daycares rather than education centers. As such, the Company’s interests with regards to early childhood education mainly relate to creating a nationwide standardized curriculum to be implemented throughout all of China which is an idea that faces little competition as it has remained unexplored by other childcare businesses. To successfully compete in our industries, we will need to:  

● | Ensure that investments in our projects are affordable; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | That our investment strategy is simple to understand; and 
● | That we provide outstanding customer service and rigid integrity in our business dealings. 

 
However, there can be no assurance that even if we do these things we will be able to compete effectively with the other companies in our industry. We believe that we have the required management expertise in sourcing properties with good development potential and affordable price. We are committed to work and communicate with our investors and sales consultants to identify their goals and needs which will make it easier to continually provide them with the best products and services.
