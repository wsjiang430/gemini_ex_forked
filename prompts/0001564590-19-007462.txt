Overview 
 Our mission is to cure Duchenne muscular dystrophy, or DMD, a genetic muscle-wasting disease predominantly affecting boys, with symptoms that usually manifest between three and five years of age. DMD is a progressive, irreversible and ultimately fatal disease that affects approximately one in every 3,500 to 5,000 live male births and has an estimated prevalence of 10,000 to 15,000 cases in the United States alone. DMD is caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene, which result in the absence or near-absence of dystrophin protein. Dystrophin protein works to strengthen muscle fibers and protect them from daily wear and tear. Without functioning dystrophin and certain associated proteins, muscles suffer excessive damage from normal daily activities and are unable to regenerate, leading to the build-up of fibrotic, or scar, and fat tissue. There is no cure for DMD and, for the vast majority of patients, there are no satisfactory symptomatic or disease-modifying treatments. Our lead product candidate, SGT-001, is a gene transfer under investigation for its ability to drive functional dystrophin protein expression in patients’ muscles. Based on our preclinical program that included multiple animal species of different phenotypes and genetic variations, we believe the mechanism of action of SGT-001, if our clinical trials prove to be successful, has the potential to slow or even halt the progression of DMD, regardless of the type of genetic mutation or stage of the disease. 
 SGT-001 has been granted Rare Pediatric Disease Designation, or RPDD, and Fast Track Designation, in the United States and Orphan Drug Designations in both the United States and European Union. The safety and efficacy of SGT-001 are currently being evaluated in a Phase I/II clinical trial called IGNITE DMD. 
 For patients suffering from DMD, symptoms usually begin to manifest between three and five years of age, when they fail to reach developmental milestones or experience motor function challenges, such as difficulty walking or climbing stairs. As the disease progresses, patients with DMD experience frequent falls; can no longer run, play sports or perform most daily functions; and are further weakened by physical activity. By their early teens, DMD patients typically lose their ability to walk and ultimately become dependent on a wheelchair for mobility. By their 20s, patients essentially become paralyzed from the neck down and require a ventilator to breathe. Though disease severity and life expectancy vary, a DMD patient’s quality of life dramatically decreases over time, with death typically occurring by early adulthood from either cardiac or respiratory complications. 
 Our founders, who are personally touched by the disease, created a biotechnology company purpose-built to accelerate the discovery and development of meaningful therapies for all patients affected by DMD. Through this disease-focused business model, our research team, led by experts in DMD biology and drug development, along with key opinion leaders in DMD, continuously evaluate emerging science to identify high-potential product candidates. Our selection process includes extensive diligence and initial pharmacology research with highly specific, predefined criteria, which provide us with confidence in our development program decisions. Through this data-driven selection process, we have evaluated a number of programs and identified gene therapy as a potentially beneficial approach for DMD, and thus initiated development of our lead product candidate SGT-001. We will continue to apply this rigorous approach and reject the majority of the candidates we evaluate in our effort to develop only programs that we believe have the greatest likelihood of becoming therapies for DMD patients. 
 Our product candidates 
 SGT-001 is our lead gene transfer candidate. Gene transfer, a type of gene therapy, is designed to address diseases caused by mutated genes through the delivery of functional versions of those genes, called transgenes. The transgenes are then utilized by the body to produce proteins that are absent or not functional prior to treatment, potentially offering long-lasting beneficial clinical effects. SGT-001 is designed to address the underlying genetic cause of DMD by delivering a synthetic transgene that produces dystrophin-like protein that is only expressed in muscles of the body, including cardiac and respiratory muscles. Our SGT-001 vector is derived from a naturally occurring, non-pathogenic virus called adeno-associated virus, or AAV, which was selected for its ability to efficiently enter skeletal, diaphragm and cardiac muscle tissues. The vector is designed to carry a synthetic dystrophin transgene construct, called microdystrophin, that retains the most critical components of the full-size dystrophin gene yet is small enough to fit within AAV packaging constraints. SGT-001 is designed to drive microdystrophin protein expression in affected muscles throughout the body. In our Investigational New Drug Application-, or IND, enabling preclinical program, we have studied the efficacy, safety and durability of SGT-001 in multiple preclinical models and its functional benefits in DMD animal studies. In contrast to other therapeutic approaches that are designed to target specific mutations in the dystrophin gene, we believe SGT-001 is a mutation agnostic approach. 
 1

In the fourth quarter of 2017, we initiated a randomized, controlled, open-label, single-ascending dose Phase I/II clinical trial, called IGNITE DMD, to evaluate SGT-001 in ambulatory and non-ambulatory males with DMD aged four to 17 years. The primary objectives of IGNITE DMD are to assess the safety and tolerability of SGT-001, as well as efficacy as defined by microdystrophin protein expression. The clinical trial is also designed to assess muscle function and mass, respiratory and cardiovascular function, serum and muscle biomarkers associated with microdystrophin production, patient reported outcomes and quality of life measures, among other endpoints. IGNITE DMD is anticipated to enroll 16 to 32 patients with DMD.
In February 2019, we announced preliminary findings based on three-month biopsy data from the first three patients dosed with 5E13 vg/kg of SGT-001, the lowest dose outlined in the study protocol. In one patient, microdystrophin was detected via western blot below the five percent level of quantification of the assay and in approximately 10 percent of fibers via immunofluorescence. There were also signs of co-localization of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and beta-sarcoglycan associated with microdystrophin expression. In the second and third patients, microdystrophin was detected via immunofluorescence at very low levels, but it was undetectable via western blot. Based on our preclinical data, we believe that a higher dose of SGT-001 may result in meaningfully higher levels of microdystrophin protein. Therefore, we have amended the protocol to dose escalate after three patients have been dosed instead of after four patients as originally planned.  In addition, we received approval from the IGNITE DMD clinical study Data Safety Monitoring Board, or DSMB, and University of Florida Investigational Review Board, or IRB, to begin dosing the next cohort of patients at 2E14 vg/kg. We plan to continue enrolling children in this cohort as soon as possible and intend to resume dosing adolescents in the future.
 Based on additional data from the clinical trial we will determine next steps for SGT-001 clinical development, including additional clinical trials that may include other patient populations, as well as the need for larger confirmatory clinical trials. 
 If successfully developed and approved, we intend to commercialize SGT-001, and we may enter into licensing agreements or strategic collaborations to do so in select markets. 
 Taking into account the prevalence and incidence of DMD and the anticipated dosing requirements for gene transfer, we anticipate that there will be a need for a substantial supply of SGT-001 for clinical trials and, if approved, for commercial markets. Through significant targeted investments to address this challenge, we have developed a manufacturing process that we believe can scale to adequately meet our needs for clinical trials, commercial launch and beyond. 
 While we believe gene transfer may be able to slow or halt DMD disease progression, many patients would still suffer from the manifestations of the disease, such as tissue damage to their muscles, inflammation, cardiac dysfunction and fibrosis. As part of our disease-focused business model, we are also building a portfolio of complementary disease modifying therapies to address these manifestations. Our portfolio currently includes an initial disease modifying candidate, Anti-LTBP4, a monoclonal antibody designed to reduce fibrosis and inflammation, as well as a number of emerging and complementary programs. Preclinical activities for the Anti-LTBP4 program are on-going. 
 In addition to developing our pipeline of product candidates, we believe it is critical to invest time and resources in tools and technologies designed to help us more effectively understand DMD, accurately monitor disease progression and assist patients in daily life. As part of this goal, we are developing biomarkers and sensors that may allow us to identify treatment targets faster, measure the therapeutic impact of potential product candidates better and reach decision points earlier. In addition, through our Solid Suit program, we are developing wearable assistive devices with the goal of providing functional and therapeutic benefits to DMD patients.

Our pipeline 
 

We seek to protect our proprietary and intellectual property position through a combination of patents, trade secret laws, proprietary know-how, continuing technological innovation, and entering into non-disclosure, confidentiality and invention assignment agreements. For our gene transfer programs, we have exclusively licensed three issued U.S. patents, one pending U.S. non-provisional patent application, and seven issued patents and eleven pending patent applications in foreign jurisdictions. We have filed four pending U.S. provisional patent applications, two pending PCT international patent applications, and two pending patent applications in Taiwan. We intend to continue building out our intellectual property protection to further strengthen our position in the DMD field. 
 Who we are 
 Solid Biosciences was founded in 2013 by our Chief Executive Officer, Ilan Ganot, our Chairman of the Board, Andrey Zarur, our former President, Gilad Hayeem, our board member Matthew Arnold and our Head of Patient Advocacy Annie Ganot, with the goal of developing meaningful therapies for patients with DMD. Solid is the English translation of Eytani, the Hebrew name of Ilan and Annie Ganot’s son, who was diagnosed with the disease in 2012. Our founders, unsatisfied with the existing therapeutic landscape, proceeded to raise funds to execute on our disease-focused business model. We assembled a passionate management team and scientific advisory board composed of individuals with extensive experience in DMD, gene therapy, product discovery, research and development, manufacturing, business strategy and finance. 
 In 2015, we began exclusively licensing the elements of the construct for SGT-001 and other elements of our gene transfer program from the University of Michigan, the University of Missouri and the University of Washington. Since then, we have continued to use our extensive network across the academic, business and patient communities to identify, vet and pursue high-potential complementary product candidates to address the needs of DMD patients. 
 Since our inception, we have raised private capital from a group of top-tier corporate and private investors. In addition, three leading U.K.-based DMD charities provided initial seed funding for our gene transfer program in return for equity in our company, and we have accepted additional contributions from several DMD charities to fund our early-stage research programs. In January 2018, we completed our initial public offering resulting in net proceeds of $129.1 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. 
 We operated as a Delaware limited liability company under the name Solid Biosciences, LLC until immediately prior to the effectiveness of our registration statement on Form S-1 on January 25, 2018, at which time we converted into a Delaware corporation pursuant to a statutory conversion and changed our name to Solid Biosciences Inc.

 About Duchenne muscular dystrophy 
 DMD is an X-chromosome-linked, muscle-wasting disease, predominantly affecting boys. Progressive, irreversible and ultimately fatal, DMD occurs in approximately one in every 3,500 to 5,000 live male births and has an estimated prevalence of 10,000 to 15,000 cases in the United States alone. In DMD, mutations in the dystrophin gene result in the body’s inability to produce functioning dystrophin protein, which works to strengthen muscle fibers and protect them from daily wear and tear. Dystrophin protein also serves as the cornerstone of the dystrophin glycoprotein complex, or DGC, a group of proteins that links the inner and outer components of muscle cells to ensure proper muscle function. 
 Without dystrophin and the DGC, muscles suffer excessive damage from normal daily activities and are unable to regenerate, leading to the build-up of scar and fat tissue. More than 1,000 dystrophin gene mutations, which can be inherited or can occur spontaneously, have been identified in people with DMD. 
 For patients suffering from DMD, symptoms usually begin to manifest between three and five years of age, when they fail to reach developmental milestones or experience motor function challenges, such as difficulty walking or climbing stairs. Muscle wasting initially presents in the legs and pelvic area, then in the muscles of the shoulders, neck and arms. As the disease progresses, patients with DMD experience frequent falls, can no longer run, play sports or perform most daily functions, and are further weakened by physical activity. In addition to physical challenges, DMD also commonly involves cognitive difficulties and behavioral challenges. 
 By their early teens, DMD patients typically lose their ability to walk and become dependent on a wheelchair for mobility. By their 20s, patients essentially become paralyzed from the neck down and require a ventilator to breathe. Though disease severity and life expectancy vary, a patient’s quality of life dramatically decreases over time, with death typically occurring by early adulthood from either cardiac or respiratory complications. 
 Need for effective therapies 
 There is no cure for DMD and, for the vast majority of patients, there are no satisfactory symptomatic or disease-modifying treatments. 
 Glucocorticoid treatment, the current standard-of-care, has been shown to temporarily improve muscle strength, prolong the period of ambulation and slow the progression of DMD. However, glucocorticoid use is associated with well-known adverse events, such as severe weight gain, stunted growth, weakening of bone structure and metabolic dysfunctions, among others. The most commonly used glucocorticoids include prednisone and deflazacort (EMFLAZA). 
 In recent years, certain regulators have conditionally approved two new therapies, eteplirsen (EXONDYS 51) and ataluren (Translarna), which target specific mutations in the dystrophin gene. These therapies are indicated for only a small portion of the DMD patient population, and their respective efficacy profiles still need to be fully understood. 
 Eteplirsen is an antisense oligonucleotide indicated for DMD patients who have a confirmed mutation of the dystrophin gene amenable to exon 51 skipping, which affects approximately 13% of DMD patients. Eteplirsen is administered as a weekly intravenous infusion. In 2016, eteplirsen was granted accelerated approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, based on an increase in dystrophin in skeletal muscle observed in some patients who received the therapy. However, the FDA concluded that a clinical benefit, including improved motor function, has not been established. As of September 21, 2018, the European Medicines Agency’s or the EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, adopted a negative opinion for a Conditional Marketing Application for eteplirsen.
 Ataluren is a small molecule indicated for the treatment of patients who have DMD resulting from nonsense mutations in the dystrophin gene, which also affect approximately 13% of DMD patients. In 2014, ataluren received conditional 
 4

marketing authorization from the European Commission, and has since been approved in several other countries outside of the United States. Ataluren’s indication is currently limited to ambulatory patients five years of age and older. In February 2018, the FDA reiterated its denial of PTC Therapeutics, Inc.’s appeal of the complete response letter for the new drug application for ataluren. 
 Current best practices for treating DMD patients also dictate a multidisciplinary approach to disease management, which includes physical and occupational therapy to preserve strength, function and flexibility, orthopedic management to reduce the risk of scoliosis and other bone and joint problems, pulmonary, cardiac and gastrointestinal management, and psychosocial management to support behavior and learning. 
 Burden of disease 
 Despite recent therapeutic advances, DMD represents a significant societal and economic burden. The economic burden, estimated at $1.2 billion annually in the United States (excluding costly mortality and end-of-life care expenses), includes costs associated with hospital admissions, medication, frequent doctor visits and investment in assistive devices, as well as indirect costs related to productivity losses for the caregivers and costs due to pain, anxiety and social handicap. Of this amount, approximately 45% is represented by indirect costs. Only a small proportion of DMD patients are employed and many caregivers reduce their hours or stop working altogether to care for their children, who progressively require more help with everyday tasks, such as eating, dressing and using the bathroom. In some cases, patients also experience serious mental health issues that require additional support and treatment. 
 Solid’s 360-degree solution 
 We aim to address the full spectrum of DMD disease manifestation, from its underlying genetic cause to other disorders that result from disease progression. We are advancing corrective therapies, disease-modifying therapies and assistive devices, as well as tools to accelerate drug development. 
 Gene transfer—A corrective therapy 
 Gene therapy is a therapeutic approach that aims to address diseases caused by gene mutations. A gene is a portion of deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, that provides the instructions for the body to construct proteins that perform functions needed for life. Genes are prone to mutations, which can either be inherited or occur spontaneously. While many mutations are harmless, some lead to the absence of crucial proteins, resulting in serious genetic diseases like DMD. 
 Gene transfer, a type of gene therapy, is designed to address diseases caused by mutated genes through the delivery of functional versions of those genes, called transgenes. The transgenes are then utilized by the body to produce proteins that are absent or not functional prior to treatment, potentially offering long-lasting beneficial effects. 
 We have focused our initial efforts on gene transfer because we believe it has the greatest potential to address the root cause of DMD: the absence or near-absence of dystrophin protein. If successful, we believe gene transfer can slow or stop the progression of DMD in a majority of patients, irrespective of their genetic mutation, by producing long-term, muscle-specific expression of a functional dystrophin-like protein. 
 Our gene transfer candidate, or vector, includes three components: 
  
• | a viral capsid—a protein shell utilized as a vehicle to deliver a transgene to cells in the body;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a transgene—a functional gene intended to produce a functional protein; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a promoter—a specialized DNA sequence that directs cells to produce the protein in specific tissues.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 SGT-001 
 SGT-001, our lead gene transfer candidate, is designed to preserve muscle function in DMD patients after a single administration. The SGT-001vector is comprised of a functional transgene and a muscle-specific promoter, which are delivered via an AAV capsid.
 The vector is modified to no longer self-replicate, yet retains its ability to effectively introduce new genetic material directly into patients’ cells. AAV vectors have been extensively studied in human clinical trials in multiple disease 
 5

indications, including in clinical trials of high-dose, systemically delivered AAV gene therapies being conducted by third parties.
 Capsid: The capsid of the SGT-001 vector is derived from a naturally occurring, non-pathogenic virus called AAV. There are several subtypes of AAV capsids that differ based on the proteins that make up their structure. These capsids have affinities for different sites in the body. We selected the AAV9 serotype capsid for clinical development based on our preclinical data, which demonstrated the capsid’s ability to enter skeletal, diaphragm and cardiac muscle tissues, as well as its favorable tolerability reported in other gene transfer clinical programs. 
 Transgene: Dystrophin, the largest gene in the body, exceeds the carrying capacity of AAV vectors. To overcome this challenge, we advanced development of the SGT-001 transgene, a synthetic, dystrophin-like gene that fits into AAV and has the ability to drive functional protein expression in skeletal, diaphragm and cardiac muscle tissue. 
 The concept of a modified therapeutic dystrophin gene originated from research on Becker muscular dystrophy, or BMD, where researchers discovered that certain BMD patients had mutations in the dystrophin gene that drove expression of a functional form of dystrophin protein, allowing patients to live relatively normal lives. This discovery led scientists to engineer a number of synthetic, dystrophin transgene constructs, called microdystrophins, that retained only the most critical components of the full-size dystrophin gene yet were small enough to fit within AAV packaging constraints. There are several types of microdystrophins that differ based on the configuration of their components. Microdystrophins were subsequently demonstrated to functionally protect muscle in mouse models of DMD. 
 The SGT-001 microdystrophin construct, which is our lead clinical candidate for DMD, is based on three decades of development and optimization work at the University of Missouri and the University of Washington as well as other academic institutions. In preclinical studies, Jeffrey Chamberlain, Ph.D., from the University of Washington, and Dongsheng Duan, Ph.D., from the University of Missouri, identified a proprietary configuration of genetic components that, when administered systemically, produces functional microdystrophin protein expression that not only stabilizes muscle membranes and protects muscle against injury, but also simultaneously restores the localization of DGC to the muscle membrane, notably increasing neuronal nitric oxide synthase, or nNOS, concentration. In subsequent published studies, Drs. Duan and Chamberlain demonstrated in animal models that, in comparison to earlier configurations, nNOS-restoring microdystrophins were more effective in improving muscle function and resistance to fatigue. 
 Promoter: The expression of the SGT-001 microdystrophin transgene is regulated by a modified, synthetic muscle-specific promoter cassette called CK8, which is derived from the naturally occurring muscle creatine kinase promoter. Regulatory cassettes, such as CK8, are used to prompt gene expression specifically in muscle tissues. In comparison to other regulatory cassettes, we chose CK8 due to its small size and its ability to drive microdystrophin transgene expression in skeletal, diaphragm and cardiac muscle tissues. In our preclinical studies in small and large animal models, CK8 restricted microdystrophin transgene expression to these muscles. 
 SGT-001 preclinical program 
 Our comprehensive preclinical program for SGT-001 was comprised of studies that inform efficacy, durability and safety, as well as dose response and the kinetics of transgene expression. Our program includes three different animal species: mice, dogs and non-human primates, or NHPs. Our preclinical studies were performed by third-party collaborators. 
 Well-established mouse and dog disease models for DMD offered us the opportunity to better evaluate the potential translatability of SGT-001 to humans. While studies in dystrophic mice, such as the mdx mouse, provide important efficacy rationale, we chose to perform additional functional studies in dystrophic dogs because they exhibit a more severe dystrophic phenotype and progress similarly to human patients at earlier stages of the disease. Dog models enabled us to assess various endpoints, including biodistribution, expression, durability and function in a large animal species. 
 Because DMD is a disease defined by a lack of dystrophin protein, it is important to reliably detect microdystrophin expression in muscle after SGT-001 treatment. As part of our core preclinical program, we developed well-characterized and well-recognized analytic approaches to confirm transgene expression and localization, using the following assays: 
  
• | Immunofluorescence: A qualitative method to determine if a transgene is expressed and localized to muscle membrane.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 6

 
• | Western blot: A recognized method to quantify dystrophin expression.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Mass spectrometry: A highly sensitive analytical method to quantify transgene expression.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We also employed immunofluorescence to confirm if our microdystrophin construct restored the DGC, including key proteins such as sarcoglycan and nNOS. 
 Efficacy in dystrophic mice 
 Multiple studies in both dystrophic, or mdx, and healthy, or wild-type, mice have demonstrated that a single intravenous administration of SGT-001 induces measurable levels of microdystrophin protein expression. In all studies, microdystrophin protein expression was measured using immunofluorescence, Western blot and mass spectrometry. 
 In an mdx dose-response study, a clear dose-dependent pattern of transgene expression was observed at day 28 by all three assays. As an example, at a dose of 1E14 vg/kg, transgene expression as quantified by positive immunofluorescence staining in the quadriceps and heart muscle tissues was 50% and 80%, respectively, of the full-length dystrophin levels quantified in healthy wild-type control muscles. Similar levels of microdystrophin expression were found in all mdx studies completed to date. Efficacy studies performed in dystrophic mice treated with SGT-001 demonstrated significant, dose-responsive improvements in both muscle morphology and multiple physiological parameters. In a blinded efficacy study performed in mdx mice dosed at approximately six weeks of age, SGT-001 treatment showed a statistically significant improvement in grip strength, which assesses arm and leg strength, at multiple doses. 
 In addition, using a treadmill exhaustion assay, the total distance run by the SGT-001-treated mdx mice was approximately two- to fifteen-fold longer compared to the untreated mice at all time points five-weeks post-dose. 
 At study termination, muscle force was measured ex vivo in the extensor digitorum longus muscle in all animals. SGT-001-treated mdx mice, dosed at either 2E14 or 4.5E14 vg/kg, exhibited a 1.3-fold increase in specific muscle force over untreated controls when compared to the untreated mdx mice. 
 In a second efficacy study employing a more severe dystrophic mouse model, or DBA/2J-mdx, a version of SGT-001 was administered at a dose of 1E15 vg/kg. Treated mice exhibited functional results that were similar to untreated wild-type animals. In the SGT-001-treated DBA/2J-mdx mice, the specific muscle force was similar to wild-type mice. Further, the treated animals were protected against muscle damage associated with eccentric contractions, a type of contraction related to muscle lengthening under load that is known to be highly damaging to dystrophic muscles. In contrast, untreated DBA/2J-mdx mice showed significantly reduced specific force and no protection against eccentric contraction induced muscle damage. 
 Efficacy in dystrophic dogs 
 Two independent studies in dystrophic dogs assessed durability of microdystrophin expression and efficacy, respectively. These studies were performed in two distinct dystrophic dog models (mixed breed dystrophic dogs, or cDMD, and Golden Retriever Muscular Dystrophy, or GRMD), collectively encompassing a number of genetic mutations that lead to the absence of dystrophin protein. This enabled us to assess SGT-001 across multiple mutations, which is more reflective of the composition of the DMD patient population. Both studies used a canine-optimized version of the microdystrophin gene. 
 In a long-term dose-ranging study, five three-month-old, juvenile cDMD dogs received an intravenous dose of either 5E13 vg/kg (n=1), 1E14 vg/kg (n=2), 3E14 vg/kg (n=1) or 5E14 vg/kg (n=1). In this study, muscle biopsies were collected from the skeletal muscles at one, three, six, 12, 16, 20, 24 and 30 months after injection. Robust transgene expression was detected by immunofluorescence at all time points and at all of the dose levels. In animals dosed with 1E14 vg/kg, approximately 70-90% of the muscle fibers were positive for microdystrophin. In treated muscle samples, transgene expression was associated with stabilization of the DGC, including nNOS. To date, all doses have been well tolerated and there has been no observed immune response to the transgene. This study is currently ongoing. 
 A blinded dose-ranging study in the GRMD model assessed the general safety and efficacy of the canine construct of SGT-001. The three dose levels (1E13, 1E14 and 2E14 vg/kg) were administered at three months of age and animals were followed for three months following administration. All doses were well tolerated and there was no observed immune response to the transgene. 
 7

Dose-dependent transgene expression was detected in interim biopsies of skeletal muscles at day 28 and 45 and at the end of the study at day 91 in skeletal, diaphragm and cardiac muscles. A blinded histological evaluation of the muscle tissue revealed a reduction of dystrophic pathology at the higher dose levels. In the mid- and high-dose groups, all muscles biopsied at the end of the study exhibited improved pathology compared to low dose and untreated controls. Biodistribution studies demonstrated dose dependent transgene expression that was only detectable in the muscle tissues. 
 The observed dose response was detectable by both immunofluorescence and Western blot. Quantification by Western blot averaged less than 10% of wild-type in the low-dose (1E13 vg/kg) animals. In the mid-dose animals, the level of expression among the skeletal muscles ranged from an average of approximately 20% to approximately 50% of wild-type control muscles. At 2E14 vg/kg, the level of expression ranged from 30% to 70% of wild-type dystrophin. This data also correlates to quantification of microdystrophin via mass spectrometry. 
 Dose-dependent, sustained expression of microdystrophin not only correlated with histological improvements in muscle, but also provided statistically significant improvements in measures of muscle function. At day 90, muscle force generation was improved in both the 1E14 vg/kg and 2E14 vg/kg cohorts, indicating that the microdystrophin produced by SGT-001 is highly protective in a large animal dystrophic species. 
 The efficacy data collectively described above in both dystrophic mouse and dog models was incorporated into an overall nonclinical model to inform dose selection for our clinical program. 
 Manufacturing comparability 
 As part of our manufacturing process development, we have run comparability studies at each stage of our process scale-up. These comparability studies were carried out using in vivo mouse models to ensure that our drug product produced at different scales is comparable to each other. 
 Safety 
 As part of our preclinical program, we performed necessary good laboratory practices, or GLP, toxicology studies to establish the overall safety profile of SGT-001 in wild-type mice and NHPs. The data and our conclusions from these studies were included in our IND submission to the FDA. Systemic administration of SGT-001 was generally well tolerated in both species. We observed no evidence of test-article-related toxicity for up to 13 weeks after systemic administration of SGT-001 in either species that would prevent us from initiating clinical trials. In the NHP study, test-article-related effects were self-limited, mild chemistry and hematology changes with no microscopic correlates at the end of the study. There was a transient and asymptomatic increase in liver function enzymes observed in NHPs starting on day 9, which returned to normal levels by day 21. We believe there were no other relevant test-article-related adverse events associated with SGT-001 administration in either GLP study. In the NHP toxicology study, a single animal from the high dose cohort was euthanized after it did not recover from an anesthetic procedure. We believe this event was attributed to procedural errors. However, AAV vector cannot be completely ruled out as a contributing factor to the toxicity that gave rise to the event. 
 Clinical development of SGT-001 
 We are developing SGT-001 for the treatment of DMD through a single intravenous administration. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we announced the initiation of IGNITE DMD, a randomized, controlled, open-label, single-ascending dose Phase I/II clinical trial designed to evaluate SGT-001 in ambulatory and non-ambulatory males with DMD aged four to 17 years. The primary objectives of IGNITE DMD are to assess the safety and tolerability of SGT-001, as well as efficacy as defined by microdystrophin protein expression. The clinical trial is also designed to assess muscle function and mass, respiratory and cardiovascular function, serum and muscle biomarkers associated with microdystrophin production, patient reported outcomes and quality of life measures, among other endpoints. IGNITE DMD is anticipated to enroll 16 to 32 patients with DMD. Key inclusion criteria include: established clinical diagnosis of DMD and documented dystrophin gene mutation predictive of DMD phenotype; anti-AAV9 antibodies below pre-specified thresholds; stable cardiac and pulmonary function; and a stable daily dose of oral corticosteroids for 24 weeks. There is no enrollment restriction in the clinical trial protocol based on a patient’s underlying dystrophin gene mutation. 
 IGNITE DMD participants will be randomly assigned to either an active treatment group or a delayed treatment control group. The selection of our starting dose, 5E13 vg/kg, was based on safety and efficacy data observed in our preclinical studies. Dose escalation between cohorts and decisions regarding clinical trial progression will occur after review by the Data Safety Monitoring Board, or DSMB. Efficacy will be assessed by comparing microdystrophin protein expression in muscle 
 8

biopsy before and 12 months after treatment for each patient. An intermediate biopsy at either 45 days, three months, six months or nine months will inform the time course of microdystrophin expression. Other endpoints will be compared against the control group. We anticipate that the delayed treatment control group will be rolled into an active treatment phase after 12 months, as long as participants continue to meet clinical trial criteria. Long-term follow up will continue per regulatory guidelines. 
 In February 2019, we announced preliminary findings based on three-month biopsy data from the first three patients dosed with 5E13 vg/kg of SGT-001, the lowest dose outlined in the study protocol. In one patient, microdystrophin was detected via western blot below the five percent level of quantification of the assay and in approximately 10 percent of fibers via immunofluorescence. There were also signs of co-localization of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and beta-sarcoglycan associated with microdystrophin expression. In the second and third patients, microdystrophin was detected via immunofluorescence at very low levels, but it was undetectable via western blot. Based on our preclinical data, we believe that a higher dose of SGT-001 may result in meaningfully higher levels of microdystrophin protein. Therefore, we have amended the protocol to dose escalate after three patients have been dosed instead of after four patients as originally planned. In addition, we received approval from the IGNITE DMD clinical study DSMB and University of Florida IRB to begin dosing the next cohort of patients at 2E14 vg/kg. We plan to continue enrolling children in this cohort as soon as possible and intend to resume dosing adolescents in the future.
 Based on data from the clinical trial, we will determine next steps for SGT-001 clinical development, including additional clinical trials that may include other patient populations, as well as the need for larger confirmatory clinical trials. 
 Manufacturing SGT-001 
 The prevalence and incidence of DMD, combined with average patient weight and anticipated dosing requirements for SGT-001, result in a substantial supply need for clinical trials and, if approved, for commercial markets. To address this challenge, we developed a manufacturing process that we believe will be scalable to meet clinical and commercial production needs for SGT-001. 
 Our suspension-based process is founded on seminal work by scientists at the University of Florida and has been optimized for manufacturability by our internal process development scientists with the support of our Contract Development Manufacturing Organizations, or CDMO, partners. The process consists of three steps. First, we produce two replication-incompetent Herpes Simplex Virus, or HSV, stocks, one containing our microdystrophin construct and the other containing the critical elements of the AAV9. Second, we then use these two HSV stocks to coinfect suspension-adapted human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293). Third, these cells are then purified and concentrated in our downstream process to produce our gene transfer candidate. Our team has developed the analytical testing methods needed to support consistency and strict standards of quality and potency. We believe that this approach will increase our speed of development, ensure consistent quality and regulatory compliance, and reduce the risk of delay or unexpected production costs. 
 Current status and plans for clinical and commercial scale-up 
 We believe that our investment in our scalable manufacturing process over the last several years will allow us to minimize the need for changes throughout clinical development and upon potential commercialization, while ensuring supply at the high volume required. We are supplying our clinical development program for SGT-001 with drug product produced at current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, - compliant facilities located at partner CDMOs. We are currently operating at 250-liter scale and have successfully produced multiple drug product batches at this scale. Our in-house scientists are continuing to work to increase the productivity and efficiency of our manufacturing process. In addition, we intend to establish the capability and capacity to supply SGT-001 at commercial scale from multiple sources, including potentially building our own GMP facility to ensure redundancy and reliability. 
 Complementary disease-modifying therapies 
 While we believe gene transfer may be able to slow or halt DMD disease progression, many patients would still suffer from the manifestations of the disease, such as tissue damage to their muscles, impaired muscle strength, inflammation, cardiac dysfunction and fibrosis. We are building a portfolio of complementary disease-modifying therapies designed to address these manifestations. 
 Our portfolio currently includes Anti-LTBP4, our initial disease modifying candidate that is aimed at addressing fibrosis, as well as several emerging and complementary programs. We have chosen to focus our efforts on these programs 
 9

following rigorous preclinical testing and our assessment of clinical potential given natural human modifiers. If initial preclinical studies are successful, we envision initiating additional studies for our disease-modifying programs in combination with SGT-001. We continue to assess additional emerging therapeutic approaches from academia and industry through our highly focused product candidate selection process to further build our portfolio. 
 Anti-LTBP4
 Anti-LTBP4 is a program with the goal of identifying and developing a monoclonal antibody intended to reduce fibrosis and inflammation by targeting and stabilizing the LTBP4 protein. LTBP4 is highly expressed in muscle and, when stable, prevents fibrosis and inflammation by inhibiting the activation of the TGF-beta pathway. 
 The rationale for targeting LTBP4 originated from observations in DMD natural history studies. Researchers found that subsets of patients with genetic variants in the LTBP4 gene maintained their ability to walk longer compared to patients in the study who did not. Researchers discovered that these genetic variants lead to reduced TGF-beta signaling. Elizabeth McNally, M.D., Ph.D., Director of the Center for Genetic Medicine at Northwestern University, hypothesized that stabilization of the LTBP4 protein in DMD patients could mimic the effect. 
 In order to assess the efficacy of potential human antibody clinical candidates in preclinical models, mice expressing the human version of LTBP4 were crossed with mdx mice to generate a DMD model that expressed human LTBP4 (hLTBP4:mdx). Preliminary studies showed that the hLTBP4:mdx animals treated with an anti-LTBP4 antibody showed significantly lower levels of fibrosis and inflammation due to the stabilization of the LTBP4 protein. 
 Tools to accelerate discovery and development 
 We believe it is critical to invest time and research into tools designed to help us more effectively measure disease progression and the therapeutic impact of our product candidates. We are focused on developing biomarkers and sensors that will allow us to identify treatment targets faster, better measure the therapeutic impact of potential product candidates and reach therapeutic decision points earlier. 
 Blood-based and imaging biomarkers 
 We are working to identify non-invasive blood-based and imaging biomarkers that could potentially reduce or eliminate the need for muscle biopsies in clinical trials, reducing stress on patients and allowing better evaluation of potential product candidates. We are developing a platform technology that may enable the non-invasive measurement of changes associated with increased dystrophin and dystrophin-like protein expression in DMD patients by using established imaging techniques. We are also currently using leading, robust platforms to perform extensive analysis on blood-based samples to establish molecular signatures based on various stages of DMD disease progression. 
 Sensor-less mobility tracking 
 We are working to develop naturalistic motor function measurement at home with an ambient measurement system, which is based on sensors such as Microsoft Kinect. This system uses infrared technology to detect body movement and is designed to collect mobility data for DMD patients without requiring wearable sensors. If successful, this new non-invasive technology would enable us to understand in greater detail the therapeutic impact of potential product candidates as they relate to everyday activities, and could provide information to establish and measure clinical endpoints in future clinical trials. 
 Assistive devices 
 Solid Suit 
 In partnership with Silicon Valley’s Seismic and Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy (PPMD), we are developing wearable assistive devices that may have both functional and therapeutic benefits, with the goal of helping patients perform day-to-day activities with greater ease and preserving their muscle function. We refer to these devices as the Solid Suit. This work is being done with the insight and oversight of technology innovators and engineering and disease experts, and each step is informed by input from the patient community. The Solid Suit utilizes cutting-edge technologies to power soft, light-weight comfortable exoskeletons with the potential to offset muscle fatigue and augment muscle strength. We are developing 
 10

the Solid Suit in three separate components, two of which are currently in prototype development, and the third has initiated design development. 
 Intellectual property 
 Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary or intellectual property protection for our product candidates, including SGT-001, and other know-how, to operate without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the intellectual property rights of others, and to prevent others from infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating our intellectual property rights. We also rely on patents, trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our proprietary and intellectual property position. 
 As of February 15, 2019, we have filed four pending U.S. provisional patent applications, two pending PCT international patent applications, and two pending patent applications in Taiwan. For our gene transfer programs, we have exclusively licensed three issued U.S. patents, one pending U.S. non-provisional patent application, and seven granted patents and eleven pending patent applications in foreign jurisdictions. The issued U.S. patents are projected to expire between 2021 and 2028, excluding any patent term adjustments and any patent term extensions, and any U.S. patents that may issue from the pending U.S. non-provisional patent application and U.S. provisional patent applications (assuming U.S. non-provisional patent applications are timely filed with respect to such provisional patent applications and all other applicable requirements are satisfied) would be projected to expire between 2036 and 2039, excluding any patent term adjustments and any patent term extensions. 
 With respect to our gene transfer programs, we exclusively licensed patent families that relate to microdystrophin genes. With respect to SGT-001, we exclusively licensed one issued U.S. patent and one pending U.S. non-provisional patent application, which generally claim the structural elements of SGT-001 and the promoter sequence used in SGT-001. This issued U.S. patent is projected to expire in 2028, excluding any patent term adjustments and any patent term extensions. Relating to SGT-001, we also own one pending U.S. provisional patent application, one pending PCT international patent application, and one pending patent application in Taiwan. Any patents that may be issued from the pending PCT and Taiwanese patent applications and our pending U.S. provisional patent application (assuming a U.S. non-provisional patent application is timely filed with respect to such provisional patent application and all other applicable requirements are satisfied) would be projected to expire between 2036 and 2039, excluding any patent term adjustments and any patent term extensions. Substantive prosecution of our patent applications has not yet commenced at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO. We cannot predict whether such pending patent applications will result in the issuance of a patent that effectively protects SGT-001, or if such issued patent or any of our licensor’s issued patents will effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive products. In any event, patent prosecution is a lengthy process, during which the scope of the claims initially submitted for examination by the patent offices in various jurisdictions are often significantly narrowed by the time they issue, if they issue at all. 
 With respect to our Anti-LTBP4 program, we do not currently own or in-license any issued patents or patent applications relating to such product candidate. We have exercised an exclusive option to negotiate for licenses of certain patents and patent applications relating to Anti-LTBP4 from Ikaika Therapeutics, LLC. Ikaika Therapeutics, LLC is only required to negotiate the terms of a potential license agreement with us for certain specified periods of time and we may be unable to enter into such a definitive license agreement within the required timeframe or under terms that are acceptable to us. If we are unable to enter into such a definitive license agreement, we will not have any license to such patents and patent applications. 
 The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest filing date of a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the USPTO in examining and granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier filed patent. The term of a patent that covers a drug or biological product may also be eligible for patent term extension when FDA approval is granted, subject to certain limitations and provided statutory and regulatory requirements are met (for more information, please see “Business— Government regulation and product approval —U.S. patent term restoration and marketing exclusivity”). In the future, if and when our product candidates receive approval from the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on issued patents we may obtain in the future covering those products, depending upon the length of the clinical trials for each product and other factors. There can be no assurance that any of our pending patent applications will issue or that we will benefit from any patent term extension or favorable adjustment to the term of any of our patents. 
 11

As with other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary and intellectual property position for our product candidates will depend on our success in obtaining effective patent claims and enforcing those claims if granted. However, our owned and licensed pending patent applications, and any patent applications that we may in the future file or license from third parties may not result in the issuance of patents. We also cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents. Any issued patents that we may receive in the future may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. In addition, because of the extensive time required for clinical development and regulatory review of a product candidate we may develop, it is possible that, before any of our product candidates can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby limiting protection such patent would afford the respective product and any competitive advantage such patent may provide. 
 In addition to patents, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, by executing confidentiality agreements with our collaborators and scientific advisors, and non-competition, non-solicitation, confidentiality, and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants. We have also executed agreements requiring assignment of inventions with selected scientific advisors and collaborators. The confidentiality agreements we enter into are designed to protect our proprietary information and the agreements or clauses requiring assignment of inventions to us are designed to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through our relationship with the respective counterparty. We cannot guarantee, however, that these agreements will afford us adequate protection of our intellectual property and proprietary information rights. 
 We also seek trademark protection in the United States and internationally where available and when appropriate. We currently own U.S. federal registrations for the marks SOLID, SOLID GT and SOLID BIOSCIENCES and a European Union registration for the mark SOLID GT. 
 Strategic partnerships and collaborations/licenses 
 We have certain obligations under licensing agreements with third parties that include annual maintenance fees and payments that are contingent upon achieving various development, commercial and regulatory milestones. Pursuant to many of these license agreements, we are required to make milestone payments if certain development, regulatory and commercial sales milestones are achieved, and may have certain additional research funding obligations. Also, pursuant to the terms of many of these license agreements, when and if commercial sales of a licensed product commence, we must pay royalties to our licensors on net sales of the respective licensed products. 
 University of Washington License Agreement 
 In 2015, we entered into a license agreement with the University of Washington, acting through UW CoMotion, under which we obtained an exclusive, royalty-bearing, sublicensable, worldwide license under certain patent applications owned by the University of Washington relating to novel micro-dystrophins to develop, manufacture, and commercialize products for use in the treatment of DMD and related disease indications caused by a lack of functional dystrophin. We have the right to grant sublicenses to third parties contingent upon written approval by the University of Washington prior to executing such sublicense, which approval may not be unreasonably withheld. 
 In consideration for the rights granted by the agreement, we paid a one-time, non-refundable license fee, which was recorded as a research and development expense in 2015. We are required to reimburse the University of Washington for costs incurred in applying for, prosecuting and maintaining patents and pay up to an aggregate of approximately $1 million upon the achievement of certain milestones. There were no milestones achieved during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2016. In October 2017, the first milestone was achieved under this agreement. The milestone payment was recorded as a research and development expense in the fourth quarter of 2017. We must also pay royalties of a low single digit percentage of future sales by us and our sublicensees of products developed under the licensed patent rights. In addition, we must pay an annual maintenance fee until certain milestones are achieved, at which time a minimum annual royalty requirement will replace such maintenance fee and will apply to us and our sublicensees. 
 We are obligated to use our commercially reasonable efforts, consistent with sound and reasonable business practices and judgment, to commercialize the inventions covered by the licensed patent rights and to make and sell products based on that patent as soon as practicable and maximize sales thereof. 
 12

The University of Washington controls the prosecution and maintenance of the licensed patents in consultation with us and at our expense. In countries in which we have not requested prosecution or maintenance of licensed patents, the University of Washington may prosecute and maintain such licensed patents at its own cost. We have the first right to enforce such licensed patents at our expense. However, we may not enter into any settlement in any manner relating to the licensed patents without the University of Washington’s prior written consent. 
 The license agreement remains in effect until the expiration of the last-to-expire patent licensed under the agreement. We may terminate the agreement at any time upon providing sixty days’ written notice to the University of Washington. The University of Washington may terminate the agreement upon our uncured, material breach of the agreement or if we enter into an insolvency-related event. 
 The University of Missouri License Agreement 
 In 2015, we entered into a license agreement with the Curators of the University of Missouri, or the University of Missouri, a public corporation of Missouri, under which we obtained an exclusive, royalty-bearing, sublicensable, worldwide license under certain patents and patent applications owned by the University of Missouri relating to a novel synthetic microdystrophin gene to make, sell and distribute products for use in the treatment of DMD and related disease indications resulting from a lack of functional dystrophin. 
 In consideration for the rights granted by the agreement, we paid a one-time, non-refundable license fee, which was recorded as a research and development expense in 2015. We are required to reimburse the University of Missouri for costs incurred in applying for, prosecuting and maintaining the licensed patents and pay up to an aggregate of approximately $1 million upon the achievement of certain milestones for each product developed based on the licensed patents. There were no milestones achieved during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2016. In October 2017, the first milestone was achieved under this agreement. The milestone payment was recorded as a research and development expense in the fourth quarter of 2017. We must pay a royalty of a low single digit percentage of future sales by us or our sublicensees of products developed using the licensed patents. In addition, we must pay an annual maintenance fee until certain milestones are achieved, after which time a minimum annual royalty will replace such maintenance fee. 
 Under the agreement, we granted the University of Missouri a non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable, paid-up license, with the right to grant sublicenses to non-profit, academic, educational or governmental institutions, to practice and use improvements made by us using the licensed patent rights, solely for non-commercial research purposes. 
 We are obligated to use our reasonable best efforts to introduce products based on the licensed patent rights into the commercial market as soon as possible, consistent with sound and reasonable business practices and judgment, and thereafter to keep such products reasonably available to the public. 
 The University of Missouri controls the prosecution and maintenance of the licensed patents in consultation with us and at our expense. In countries in which we have not requested prosecution or maintenance of licensed patents, the University of Missouri may prosecute and maintain such licensed patents at its own cost. We have the first right to enforce such licensed patents at our expense. However, any settlement, consent judgment or other voluntary disposition of litigation that materially limits the scope, validity or enforceability of the licensed patent or admits fault or wrongdoing on the part of the University of Missouri must be pre-approved in writing by the University of Missouri. 
 The license agreement remains in effect until the expiration of the last-to-expire patent or the abandonment of the last to be abandoned patent application licensed under the agreement. The University of Missouri may terminate the agreement, or render the license granted thereunder non-exclusive, in individual countries if we and our sublicensees fail to achieve certain milestones. We may terminate the license agreement at any time upon providing six months’ written notice to the University of Missouri and paying a termination fee. Each of the University of Missouri and we may also terminate the agreement for an uncured default or breach of the agreement by the other party. Our ability to cure such breach only applies to the first two notices of such breach provided by the University of Missouri, and thereafter, the University of Missouri may terminate the agreement for our default or breach of the agreement upon thirty days’ written notice without an opportunity to cure such default or breach. 
 The University of Michigan License Agreement 
 In 2016, we entered into a license agreement with the Regents of the University of Michigan, or the University of Michigan, a constitutional corporation of Michigan, under which we obtained an exclusive, royalty-bearing, sublicensable, 
 13

worldwide license to make, sell and distribute products under certain patents owned by the University of Michigan related to microdystrophin and utrophin spectrin-like nucleic acid sequences for any use that, but for this agreement, would comprise an infringement of a valid claim included in the licensed patent rights. 
 In consideration for the rights granted by the agreement, we paid a one-time license fee and a separate fee to cover past patent prosecution costs. We recorded the upfront license fee as a research and development expense in 2016. We are required to reimburse the University of Michigan for costs incurred in applying for, prosecuting and maintaining patents, and pay up to an aggregate of approximately $1 million upon the achievement of certain milestones. There were no milestones achieved during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. We must also pay royalties of a low single-digit percentage of future sales by us or our sublicensees of products developed using the licensed rights, with a minimum annual royalty after certain milestones are achieved. In addition, we must pay an annual maintenance fee in any year in which the minimum annual royalty is not reached. 
 Under the agreement, the University of Michigan reserves for itself and its affiliates the right to use the licensed rights for non-commercial research, public service, internal and educational purposes and the right to grant the same limited non-commercial rights to other non-profit research institutions. 
 We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to bring one or more products based on the licensed patents to market through a diligence program for utilizing the licensed patents, to continue diligent marketing efforts throughout the term of the agreement, and to make reasonable amounts of such products commercially available, in each case consistent with prudent business practices and judgment. 
 The University of Michigan controls the prosecution and maintenance of the licensed patents in consultation with us and at our expense. In countries in which we have not requested prosecution or maintenance of licensed patents, the University of Michigan may prosecute and maintain such licensed patents at its own cost. We have the first right to enforce such licensed patents at our expense. However, we may only enter into a settlement with the advice and consent of the University of Michigan. 
 The license agreement remains in effect until the expiration of the last-to-expire patent licensed under the agreement. The University of Michigan may terminate the agreement upon our uncured material breach of the agreement, including failure to make required payments under the agreement or to achieve certain milestones, or if we become insolvent or bankrupt. We may terminate the license agreement at any time upon providing sixty days’ written notice to the University of Michigan. 
 Harvard College License Agreements 
 In 2016 and 2017, we entered into license agreements with the President and Fellows of Harvard College, or Harvard College, under which we obtained non-exclusive, royalty-bearing, sublicensable, worldwide licenses to use certain intellectual property owned by Harvard College to develop, manufacture, and commercialize products for use in the treatment of DMD. 
 In consideration for the rights granted by each agreement, we paid one-time, non-refundable license fees, which were recorded as a research and development expense in 2016 and 2017. We are required to pay an annual license maintenance fee until certain milestones are achieved, after which time the annual maintenance fee will increase annually. Such annual maintenance fees will further increase if we grant certain rights to a sublicensee or strategic partner with whom we collaborate on the development and commercialization of licensed products. The annual maintenance fees are creditable against royalty payments. We also must pay milestone payments within thirty days after achieving certain milestones. There were no milestones achieved during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 under either agreement. We must pay a royalty on future sales by us or our sublicensees of products developed using the licensed technology. 
 The license agreements each remain in effect for an initial term of fifteen years, with automatic three-year renewal periods thereafter unless one of the parties provides notice of non-renewal. We may terminate the license agreements at any time upon providing sixty days’ written notice to Harvard College. Harvard College may terminate the agreements in the event we become bankrupt or insolvent. Both Harvard College and we may also terminate the agreements for an uncured material breach of the agreements by the other party. 
 14

Other License Agreements
In 2016, we entered into a license agreement with Life Technologies Corporation, or Life Technologies. In consideration for obtaining a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide license to use certain technologies and associated know-how to develop our product candidates, we paid a one-time, non-refundable license fee. This fee was recorded as a research and development expense in 2016. The license agreement will remain effective in perpetuity unless earlier terminated. Life Technologies has the right to terminate the agreement upon our material, uncured breach of the agreement or in the event that it determines that continued performance of the agreement may violate any laws. We are obligated to diligently pursue regulatory approval necessary for the development, manufacture and sale of the licensed products. We have the right to terminate the agreement at any time upon providing thirty days’ written notice to Life Technologies. 
Competition 
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly changing technologies, significant competition and a strong emphasis on intellectual property. This is also true in treatments of DMD, as well as in gene therapy. While we believe that our focus, strength of team, expertise in gene therapy, scientific knowledge and intellectual property provide us with competitive advantages, we face competition from several different sources, including large and small biopharmaceutical companies, academic research institutions, government agencies and public and private research institutions. Not only must we compete with other companies that are focused on gene transfer technology, but any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. 
 Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, clinical trials, regulatory approvals and product marketing than we do. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. 
 We are aware of several companies and research institutions focused on developing systemic gene transfers for DMD, including Pfizer Inc., with a product candidate currently in Phase 1 clinical development, and Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc., with a product candidate currently in Phase I/II clinical trial development. In addition, there are two therapies, which are intended to be disease modifying, that are currently approved for DMD by certain regulators. These products are eteplirsen (EXONDYS 51) and ataluren (Translarna), each of which is indicated for approximately 13% of DMD patients. Any advances in gene transfer technology made by a competitor may be used to develop therapies that could compete with our lead product candidate or other product candidates we may develop. 
 Government regulation and product approval 
 U.S. government regulation and product approval 
 In the United States, biologic products including gene therapy products, such as our lead product candidate, are licensed for marketing by the FDA under the Public Health Service Act, or PHS Act, and regulated by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FD&C Act, as well as by other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. Both the FD&C Act and the PHS Act and their corresponding rules and regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, distribution, reporting, advertising and other promotional practices involving biologic products. FDA approval must be obtained before conducting human clinical testing of biologic products. Additionally, each clinical trial protocol for a gene therapy product candidate is reviewed by the FDA and, in limited instances, the U.S. National Institutes of Health, or the NIH, through its Office of Biotechnology Activities’ Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, or RAC. FDA must license a biologic product before it may be marketed within the United States. 
 Within the FDA, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, or the CBER, regulates gene therapy products. Within CBER, the review of gene therapy and related products is consolidated in the Office of Tissues and Advanced Therapies, or the OTAT, and the FDA has established the Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies Advisory Committee to advise CBER on its reviews. CBER, which works closely with the NIH and the RAC, makes recommendations to the NIH on gene therapy issues and engages in a public discussion of scientific, safety, ethical and societal issues related to proposed and ongoing gene therapy protocols. The FDA has licensed human gene therapies products for sale in the United States, and the agency has provided guidance for the development of other gene therapy products. This guidance includes a growing body of guidance documents on chemistry, manufacturing and control, or CMC, clinical investigations and other areas of gene therapy development, all of which are intended to facilitate the industry’s development of gene therapy products. 
 15

U.S. biologic products development process 
 The process required by the FDA before a biologic product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
  
• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests and in vivo studies according to the FDA’s GLP requirements and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an application for an IND, which allows human clinical trials to begin unless the FDA objects within 30 days;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an institutional review board, or IRB, reviewing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an institutional biosafety committee, or IBC, assessing the safety of the clinical research and identifying any potential risk to public health or the environment;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s regulations commonly referred to as good clinical practices, or GCPs, and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety, potency and purity of the proposed biologic product for its intended use;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | preparation and submission to the FDA of a biologics license application, or BLA, for marketing approval that includes substantive evidence of safety, purity and potency from results of preclinical testing and clinical trials, and detailed information about the CMC for the product, reports of the outcomes and full data sets of the clinical trials and proposed labeling and packaging for the product;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | review of the product candidate by an FDA advisory committee, if applicable;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biologic product candidate is produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biologic product candidate’s identity, safety, strength, quality and purity;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | potential FDA audit of the nonclinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | payment of user fees;
--+----------------------


• | FDA review and licensure of the BLA; and
--+-----------------------------------------


• | compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, and the potential requirement to conduct post-approval studies.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Before testing any biologic product candidate in humans, including a gene therapy product candidate, the product candidate must undergo preclinical testing. Preclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as in vivo studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate and to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of certain nonclinical studies must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLPs. 
 If a gene therapy trial is conducted at, or sponsored by, institutions receiving NIH funding for recombinant DNA research, prior to the submission of an IND to the FDA, a protocol and related documents must be submitted to, and the study registered with, the NIH Office of Biotechnology Activities, or OBA, pursuant to the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules, or NIH Guidelines. Compliance with the NIH Guidelines is mandatory for investigators at institutions receiving NIH funds for research involving recombinant DNA. However, many companies and other institutions, not otherwise subject to the NIH Guidelines, voluntarily follow them. NIH is responsible for convening the RAC that discusses protocols that raise novel or particularly important scientific, safety or ethical considerations at one of its quarterly public meetings. The OBA will notify the FDA of the RAC’s decision regarding the necessity for full public review of a gene therapy protocol. RAC proceedings and reports are posted to the OBA website and may be accessed by the public. 
 The clinical trial sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND is an exemption from the FD&C Act that allows an unapproved product to be shipped in interstate commerce for use in an investigational clinical trial and a request for FDA authorization to administer an investigational product to humans. Some preclinical tests may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA places the clinical trial on a full clinical hold or partial clinical hold. In such a case, the IND 
 16

sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. With gene therapy protocols, if the FDA allows the IND to proceed, but the RAC decides that full public review of the protocol is warranted, the FDA will request at the completion of its IND review that the sponsor delay initiation of the protocol until after completion of the RAC review process. The FDA also may impose clinical holds on a biologic product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, trials may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. 
 In addition, the FDA may impose a partial clinical hold at any time before or during clinical trials. A partial clinical hold is a delay or suspension of only part of the clinical work requested under the IND (e.g., a specific protocol or part of a protocol is not allowed to proceed; however, other protocols or parts of the protocol are allowed to proceed under the IND). If the FDA requires that progress to the next study is contingent on (i) FDA review of additional data and (ii) subsequent specific permission for the study to proceed, this represents a partial clinical hold. 
 Human clinical trials under an IND 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the biologic product candidate to healthy volunteers or subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by, or under the control of, the trial sponsor. Clinical trials are conducted under written study protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDA’s regulations comprising the GCP requirements, including the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent. 
 Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative, reviews and approves the study protocol and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. Additionally, some trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee, or DSMB. This group provides authorization as to whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access that only the group maintains to available data from the study. Clinical trials involving recombinant DNA also must be reviewed by an IBC a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees basic and clinical research and utilizes recombinant DNA at that institution. The IBC assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk to public health or the environment. 
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined: 
  
• | Phase I. The investigational biologic product is initially introduced into a small group of healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early understanding of its effectiveness. In the case of some product candidates for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product candidate may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients. Phase I clinical trials of gene therapies are typically conducted in patients rather than healthy volunteers.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase II. The biologic product candidate is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase III. Phase III clinical trials are commonly referred to as “pivotal” studies, which typically denotes a study that presents the data that the FDA or other relevant regulatory agency will use to determine whether or not to approve a biologic product. In Phase III clinical trials, the investigational biologic product is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites in adequate and well controlled clinical trials to generate sufficient data to statistically confirm the potency and safety of the product for approval. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product candidate and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.

 17

Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase IV clinical trials, may be conducted after initial approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up. 
 During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. 
 Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA, the NIH and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events, any findings from other trials, in vivo laboratory tests or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information. 
 The FDA or the sponsor or its DSMB may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the biologic product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 
 Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the NIH for public dissemination on its ClinicalTrials.gov website. 
  Expanded Access to an Investigational Drug for Treatment Use 
 Expanded access, sometimes called “compassionate use,” is the use of investigational new drug products outside of clinical trials to treat patients with serious or immediately life-threatening diseases or conditions when there are no comparable or satisfactory alternative treatment options. The rules and regulations related to expanded access are intended to improve access to investigational drugs for patients who may benefit from investigational therapies. FDA regulations allow access to investigational drugs under an IND by the company or the treating physician for treatment purposes on a case-by-case basis for: individual patients (single-patient IND applications for treatment in emergency settings and non-emergency settings); intermediate-size patient populations; and larger populations for use of the drug under a treatment protocol or Treatment IND Application. 
 When considering an IND application for expanded access to an investigational product with the purpose of treating a patient or a group of patients, the sponsor and treating physicians or investigators will determine suitability when all of the following criteria apply: patient(s) have a serious or immediately life-threatening disease or condition, and there is no comparable or satisfactory alternative therapy to diagnose, monitor, or treat the disease or condition; the potential patient benefit justifies the potential risks of the treatment and the potential risks are not unreasonable in the context or condition to be treated; and the expanded use of the investigational drug for the requested treatment will not interfere with initiation, conduct, or completion of clinical investigations that could support marketing approval of the product or otherwise compromise the potential development of the product.
 On December 13, 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act established (and the 2017 Food and Drug Administration Reauthorization Act later amended) a requirement that sponsors of one or more investigational drugs for the treatment of a serious disease(s) or condition(s) make publicly available their policy for evaluating and responding to requests for expanded access for individual patients. Although these requirements were rolled out over time, they have now come into full effect.  This provision requires drug and biologic companies to make publicly available their policies for expanded access for individual patient access to products intended for serious diseases. Sponsors are required to make such policies publicly available upon the earlier of initiation of a Phase II or Phase III study; or 15 days after the drug or biologic receives designation as a breakthrough therapy, fast track product, or regenerative medicine advanced therapy. 
 In addition, on May 30, 2018, the Right to Try Act, was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase I clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. 
 18

There is no obligation for a drug manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act, but the manufacturer must develop an internal policy and respond to patient requests according to that policy.

 Additional regulation for gene therapy clinical trials 
 In addition to the regulations discussed above, there are a number of additional standards that apply to clinical trials involving the use of gene therapy. The FDA has issued various guidance documents regarding gene therapies, which outline additional factors that the FDA will consider at each of the above stages of development, which relate to, among other things: the proper preclinical assessment of gene therapies; the CMC information that should be included in an IND application; the proper design of tests to measure product potency in support of an IND or BLA application; and measures to observe delayed adverse effects in subjects who have been exposed to investigational gene therapies when the risk of such effects is high. Further, the FDA usually recommends that sponsors observe subjects for potential gene therapy-related delayed adverse events for a 15-year period, including a minimum of five years of annual examinations followed by ten years of annual queries, either in person or by questionnaire. The FDA has issued various guidance documents regarding gene therapies, including draft guidance released in July 2018 relating to gene therapies for human retinal disorders and gene therapies for rare diseases, and on January 15, 2019, the FDA issued a statement that it would issue additional guidance to facilitate the development of gene therapy products.
 The NIH and the FDA have a publicly accessible database, the Genetic Modification Clinical Research Information System, which includes information on gene therapy trials and serves as an electronic tool to facilitate the reporting and analysis of adverse events on these trials. 
 Compliance with cGMP requirements 
 Manufacturers of biologics must comply with applicable cGMP regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. Manufacturers and others involved in the manufacture and distribution of such products also must register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Both domestic and foreign manufacturing establishments must register and provide additional information to the FDA upon their initial participation in the manufacturing process. Establishments may be subject to periodic, unannounced inspections by government authorities to ensure compliance with cGMP requirements and other laws. Discovery of problems may result in a government entity placing restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved BLA, and may extend to requiring withdrawal of the product from the market. The FDA will not approve a BLA unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specification. 
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional preclinical studies and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biologic product candidate as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product candidate in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents or of causing other adverse events with the use of biologic products, the PHS Act emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other requirements, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biologic product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biologic product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 U.S. review and approval processes 
 After the completion of clinical trials of a biologic product, FDA licensure of a BLA must be obtained before commercial marketing of the biologic product. The BLA must include results of product development, laboratory and animal studies, human studies, information on the manufacture and composition of the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information. In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the biologic product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. 
 Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each BLA must be accompanied by a significant user fee. Under federal law, the submission of most applications is subject to an application user fee, which for federal fiscal year 2019 is $2,588,478 for an application requiring clinical data. The sponsor of an approved application is also subject to an annual program fee, which for fiscal year 2019 is $309,915. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are 
 19

assessed on BLAs for product candidates designated as orphan drugs, unless the product candidate also includes a non-orphan indication. 
 The FDA reviews a BLA within 60 days of submission to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the BLA. 
 The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and potent, or effective, for its intended use, and has an acceptable purity profile, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel biologic products or biologic products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the biologic product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a REMS, is necessary to assure the safe use of the biologic product. REMS use risk minimization strategies beyond the professional labeling to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. To determine whether a REMS is needed, the FDA will consider the size of the population likely to use the product, seriousness of the disease, expected benefit of the product, expected duration of treatment, seriousness of known or potential adverse events and whether the product is a new molecular entity. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans and elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the BLA without a REMS, if required. 
 Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product candidate is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product candidate unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND study requirements and GCP requirements. cGMP, GLP and GCP compliance requires significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, recordkeeping, production and quality control. 
 Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval and deny approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than how we would interpret the same data. On the basis of the BLA and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the biologic product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the BLA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. If the agency decides not to approve the BLA in its present form, the FDA will issue a complete response letter that usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes; or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. 
 If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing or dispensing in the form of a REMS, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post-marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase IV clinical trials, designed to further assess a biologic product’s safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. 
 The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review of BLAs under the PDUFA. One such goal is to review standard BLAs in ten months after the FDA accepts the BLA for filing, and priority BLAs in six months, whereupon a review decision is to be made. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority BLAs and its review goals are subject to change from time to time. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by three 
 20

months if the FDA requests or the BLA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA goal date. 
 Biosimilars and exclusivity 
 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the companion Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or the Health Care Reform Law, which was signed into law on March 23, 2010, included a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA. That Act established a regulatory scheme authorizing the FDA to approve biosimilars and interchangeable biosimilars. 
 Under the BPCIA, a manufacturer may submit an application for licensure of a biologic product that is “biosimilar to” or “interchangeable with” a previously approved biological product or “reference product.” In order for the FDA to approve a biosimilar product, it must find that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the reference product and proposed biosimilar product in terms of safety, purity and potency. For the FDA to approve a biosimilar product as interchangeable with a reference product, the agency must find that the biosimilar product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product, and (for products administered multiple times) that the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. 
 Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date of approval of the reference product. The FDA may not approve a biosimilar product until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was approved. Even if a product is considered to be a reference product eligible for exclusivity, another company could market a competing version of that product if the FDA approves a full BLA for such product containing the sponsor’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of their product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law. 
 Pediatric exclusivity 
 Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity or patent protection, including the non-patent and orphan exclusivity. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if an application sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection cover the product are extended by six months. Thus, pediatric exclusivity adds six months to existing exclusivity periods applicable to biological products under the BPCIA—namely, the four-year period during which the FDA will not consider an application for a biosimilar product, and the 12-year period during which the FDA will not approve a biosimilar application. 
 Orphan drug designation 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a biologic product as an “orphan drug” if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition (generally meaning that it affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more in cases in which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a biologic product available in the United States for treatment of the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product). Orphan product designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan product designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. 
 If a product with orphan status receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, meaning that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or biologic product for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity or if the party holding the exclusivity fails to assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. This is the case despite an earlier court opinion holding that the Orphan Drug Act unambiguously required the FDA to recognize orphan exclusivity regardless of a showing of clinical superiority. 
 21

Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the same indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan medicinal product status in the European Union has similar, but not identical, benefits. 
 Expedited development and review programs 
 The FDA is authorized to expedite the review of BLAs in several ways. Under the Fast Track program, the sponsor of a biologic product candidate may request the FDA to designate the product for a specific indication as a Fast Track product concurrent with or after the filing of the IND. Biologic products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product candidate and the specific indication for which it is being studied. In addition to other benefits, such as the ability to have greater interactions with the FDA, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track BLA before the application is complete, a process known as rolling review. 
 Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a Fast Track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as breakthrough therapy designation, priority review and accelerated approval. 
  
• | Breakthrough therapy designation. To qualify for the breakthrough therapy program, product candidates must be intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence must indicate that such product candidates may demonstrate substantial improvement on one or more clinically significant endpoints over existing therapies. The FDA will seek to ensure the sponsor of a breakthrough therapy product candidate receives intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program, intensive involvement of senior managers and experienced staff on a proactive, collaborative and cross-disciplinary review and rolling review.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Priority review. A product candidate is eligible for priority review if it treats a serious condition and, if approved, it would be a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis or prevention compared to marketed products. FDA aims to complete its review of priority review applications within six months as opposed to 10 months for standard review.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Accelerated approval. Drug or biologic products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval. Accelerated approval means that a product candidate may be approved on the basis of adequate and well controlled clinical trials establishing that the product candidate has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity and prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biologic product candidate receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well controlled post-marketing clinical trials. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Regenerative advanced therapy. With passage of the 21st Century Cures Act, or the Cures Act, in December 2016, Congress authorized the FDA to accelerate review and approval of products designated as regenerative advanced therapies. A product is eligible for this designation if it is a regenerative medicine therapy that is intended to treat, modify, reverse or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. The benefits of a regenerative advanced therapy designation include early interactions with the FDA to expedite development and review, benefits available to breakthrough therapies, potential eligibility for priority review and accelerated approval based on surrogate or intermediate endpoints.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 None of these expedited programs change the standards for approval but they may help expedite the development or approval process of product candidates. 
 Post-approval requirements 
 After regulatory approval of a product is obtained, there may be a number of post-approval requirements. For example, as a condition of approval of a BLA, the FDA may require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the product’s safety or efficacy. In addition, holders of an approved BLA are required to keep extensive records, to report certain adverse reactions and production problems to the FDA, to provide updated safety and efficacy information and to comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for their products. Also, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMP regulations and practices, as well as the manufacturing conditions of approval 
 22

set forth in the BLA. The FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP requirements, which impose certain procedural, substantive and recordkeeping requirements. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. 
 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Products may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. If a company is found to have promoted off-label uses, it may become subject to adverse public relations and administrative and judicial enforcement by the FDA, the Department of Justice, or the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as state authorities. This could subject a company to a range of penalties that could have a significant commercial impact, including civil and criminal fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes drug products. 
 U.S. patent term restoration and marketing exclusivity 
 Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of product candidates, some of a sponsor’s U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent terms lost during product development and FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period generally is one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved biologic product is eligible for the extension, the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent, and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. Moreover, a given patent may only be extended once based on a single product. The USPTO in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. 
 Government regulation outside of the U.S. 
 In addition to regulations in the United States, a manufacturer is subject to a variety of regulations in foreign jurisdictions to the extent it chooses to sell any products in those foreign countries. Even if a manufacturer obtains FDA approval of a product, it must still obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Because biologically sourced materials are subject to unique contamination risks, their use may also be restricted in some countries. 
 Clinical trial approval in the European Union 
 Pursuant to the currently applicable Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC and the Directive 2005/28/EC on Good Clinical Practice, an applicant must obtain approval from the competent national authority of the European Union Member State, or the EU Member State, in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. If the clinical trial is conducted in different EU Member States, the competent authorities in each of these EU Member States must provide their approval for the conduct of the clinical trial. Furthermore, the applicant may only start a clinical trial at a specific study site after the competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion. In April 2014, the European Union adopted a new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014, which is set to replace the current Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC. The new Clinical Trials Regulation will be directly applicable to and binding in all EU Member States without the need for any national implementing legislation. Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 was published on June 16, 2014 but is not expected to apply until later in 2019. 
 PRIME designation 
 In March 2016, the EMA, launched the PRIority MEdicines, or PRIME, initiative to foster research and development of medicines that may offer a major therapeutic advantage over existing treatments, or benefit patients without treatment options. PRIME aims to strengthen clinical trial designs to facilitate the generation of high-quality data for the evaluation of an application for marketing authorization. To be accepted for PRIME, a medicine has to show its potential to benefit patients 
 23

with unmet medical needs based on preclinical and/or early clinical data. These medicines are considered priority medicines within the European Union. 
 After an investigational candidate has been selected for PRIME, developers are assigned a rapporteur from the CHMP, to provide continuous support and help to build knowledge ahead of a marketing authorization application, or MAA. A multidisciplinary group of experts will provide broader guidance on the overall development plan and regulatory strategy of the product. Companies are also eligible for accelerated assessment at the time of their regulatory application. 
 Marketing authorization 
 In the European Union, marketing authorizations for medicinal products may be obtained through several different procedures founded on the same basic regulatory process. 
 The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization by the European Commission that is valid across the European Economic Area (i.e. the EU as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway). The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicinal products produced by certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases. It is optional for those products that are highly innovative or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients. Under the centralized procedure in the European Union, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP. Accelerated evaluation may be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases. These are defined as circumstances in which a medicinal product is expected to be of a “major public health interest.” Three cumulative criteria must be fulfilled in such circumstances: the seriousness of the disease, such as severely disabling or life-threatening diseases, to be treated; the absence or insufficiency of an appropriate alternative therapeutic approach; and anticipation of high therapeutic benefit. In these circumstances, the EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days. 
 Specifically, the grant of marketing authorization in the European Union for products containing viable human tissues or cells such as gene therapy medicinal products is governed by Regulation 1394/2007/EC on advanced therapy medicinal products, read in combination with Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, commonly known as the Community code on medicinal products. Regulation 1394/2007/EC lays down specific rules concerning the authorization, supervision, and pharmacovigilance of gene therapy medicinal products, somatic cell therapy medicinal products, and tissue engineered products. Manufacturers of advanced therapy medicinal products must demonstrate the quality, safety, and efficacy of their products to EMA which provides an opinion regarding the application for marketing authorization. The European Commission grants or refuses marketing authorization in light of the opinion delivered by EMA. 
 The decentralized procedure provides for approval by one or more other concerned EU Member States of an assessment of an application for marketing authorization conducted by one EU Member State, known as the reference EU Member State. In accordance with this procedure, an applicant submits an application for marketing authorization to the reference EU Member State and the concerned EU Member States. This application is identical to the application that would be submitted to the EMA for authorization through the centralized procedure. The reference EU Member State prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. The resulting assessment report is submitted to the concerned EU Member States which, within 90 days of receipt, must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials. 
 If a concerned EU Member State cannot approve the assessment report and related materials due to concerns relating to a potential serious risk to public health, disputed elements may be referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all EU Member States. In accordance with the mutual recognition procedure, the sponsor applies for national marketing authorization in one EU Member State. Upon receipt of this authorization the sponsor can then seek the recognition of this authorization by other EU Member States. Authorization in accordance with either of these procedures will result in authorization of the medicinal product only in the reference EU Member State and in the other concerned EU Member States. 
 A marketing authorization may be granted only to an applicant established in the European Union. Regulation No. 1901/2006 provides that, prior to obtaining a marketing authorization in the European Union, an applicant must demonstrate compliance with all measures included in a Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, approved by the Pediatric Committee of the EMA, covering all subsets of the pediatric population, unless the EMA has granted a product-specific waiver, class waiver, or a deferral for one or more of the measures included in the PIP.

In specific circumstances, E.U. legislation on Conditional Marketing Authorizations for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or conditional marketing authorization, enables applicants to obtain a conditional marketing authorization prior to obtaining the comprehensive clinical data required for an application for a full marketing authorization. Such conditional approvals may be granted for product candidates (including medicines designated as orphan medicinal products) if the risk-benefit balance of the product candidate is positive, it is likely that the applicant will be in a position to provide the required comprehensive clinical trial data, the product fulfills unmet medical needs and the benefit to public health of the immediate availability on the market of the medicinal product concerned outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. A conditional marketing authorization may contain specific obligations to be fulfilled by the marketing authorization holder, including obligations with respect to the completion of ongoing or new studies, and with respect to the collection of pharmacovigilance data. 
 Conditional marketing authorization 
 Conditional marketing authorizations are valid for one year, and may be renewed annually, if the risk-benefit balance remains positive, and after an assessment of the need for additional or modified conditions and/or specific obligations. The timelines for the centralized procedure described above also apply with respect to the review by the CHMP of applications for a conditional marketing authorization. 
 The requirements and processes governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCPs and the applicable regulatory requirements of the country or countries in which the clinical trial is performed, as well as the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki (whichever provides the greater protection to the clinical trial participants). 
  General Data Protection Regulation
 The collection, use, disclosure, transfer, or other processing of personal data regarding individuals in the EU, including personal health data, is subject to the EU General Data Protection Regulation, or the GDPR, which became effective on May 25, 2018. The GDPR is wide-ranging in scope and imposes numerous requirements on companies that process personal data, including requirements relating to processing health and other sensitive data, obtaining consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, providing information to individuals regarding data processing activities, implementing safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of personal data, providing notification of data breaches, and taking certain measures when engaging third-party processors. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data to countries outside the EU, including the U.S., and permits data protection authorities to impose large penalties for violations of the GDPR, including potential fines of up to €20 million or 4% of annual global revenues, whichever is greater. The GDPR also confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies, and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations of the GDPR.  Compliance with the GDPR will be a rigorous and time-intensive process that may increase the cost of doing business or require companies to change their business practices to ensure full compliance.

 Healthcare law and regulation 
 Healthcare providers and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of products that are granted marketing approval. Arrangements with providers, consultants, third-party payors and customers are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse, anti-kickback, false claims laws, reporting of payments to physicians and teaching physicians and patient privacy laws and regulations and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain business and/or financial arrangements. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, include the following: 
  
• | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, paying, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties laws, which prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false, fictitious or fraudulent or knowingly making, using or causing to made or used a false record or statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created additional federal criminal laws that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to

execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final Omnibus Rule published in January 2013, which impose obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal false statements statute, which prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal transparency requirements known as the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, under the Health Care Reform Law, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, within the United States Department of Health and Human Services, information related to payments and other transfers of value made by that entity to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to healthcare items or services that are reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other health care providers or marketing expenditures. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
 Pharmaceutical insurance coverage and health care reform 
 In the United States and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated health care costs. Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of products approved by the FDA and other government authorities. Thus, even if a product candidate is approved, sales of the product will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations, provide coverage and establish adequate reimbursement levels for, the product. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication. 
 The Trump Administration has also taken executive actions to undermine or delay implementation of the Health Care Reform Law. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two Executive Orders designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the Health Care Reform Law or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the Health Care Reform Law. One Executive Order directs federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the Health Care Reform Law to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the Health Care Reform Law that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. The second Executive Order terminates the cost-sharing subsidies that reimburse insurers under the Health Care Reform Law. Several state Attorneys General filed suit to stop the administration from terminating the subsidies, but their request for a restraining order was denied by a federal judge in California on October 25, 2017. In addition, CMS has recently proposed regulations that would give states greater flexibility in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the Health Care Reform Law for plans sold through such marketplaces. Further, on June 14, 2018, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that the federal government was not required to pay more than $12 billion in Health Care Reform Law risk corridor payments to third-party payors who argued were owed to them. The effects of this gap in reimbursement on third-party payors, the viability of the Health Care Reform Law marketplace, providers, and potentially our business, are not yet known.

More recently, with enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which was signed by the President on December 22, 2017, Congress repealed the “individual mandate.” The repeal of this provision, which requires most Americans to carry a minimal level of health insurance, will become effective in 2019. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the repeal of the individual mandate will cause 13 million fewer Americans to be insured in 2027 and premiums in insurance markets may rise. Additionally, on January 22, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain Health Care Reform Law-mandated fees, including the so-called “Cadillac” tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices. The Congress will likely consider other legislation to replace elements of the Health Care Reform Law, during the next Congressional session. 
 Further, there have been several recent U.S. congressional inquiries and proposed federal and proposed and enacted state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the costs of drugs under Medicare and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. For example, there have been several recent U.S. congressional inquiries and proposed federal and proposed and enacted state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the costs of drugs under Medicare and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. At the federal level, Congress and the Administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. For example, on May 11, 2018, the Administration issued a plan to lower drug prices. Under this blueprint for action, the Administration indicated that the Department of Health and Human Services will: take steps to end the gaming of regulatory and patent processes by drug makers to unfairly protect monopolies; advance biosimilars and generics to boost price competition; evaluate the inclusion of prices in drug makers’ ads to enhance price competition; speed access to and lower the cost of new drugs by clarifying policies for sharing information between insurers and drug makers; avoid excessive pricing by relying more on value-based pricing by expanding outcome-based payments in Medicare and Medicaid; work to give Part D plan sponsors more negotiation power with drug makers; examine which Medicare Part B drugs could be negotiated for a lower price by Part D plans, and improving the design of the Part B Competitive Acquisition Program; update Medicare’s drug-pricing dashboard to increase transparency; prohibit Part D contracts that include “gag rules” that prevent pharmacists from informing patients when they could pay less out-of-pocket by not using insurance; and require that Part D plan members be provided with an annual statement of plan payments, out-of-pocket spending, and drug price increases.
 At the state level, individual states are increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional health care authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other health care programs. These measures could reduce the ultimate demand for our products, once approved, or put pressure on our product pricing. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing pressures.
