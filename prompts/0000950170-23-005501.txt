 Item 1. Business.
Since our inception in 2012, our mission has been to help clients and communities meet their environmental goals and needs. Today, we have emerged as one of the fastest growing companies in a highly fragmented and growing $ 1.34 trillion global environmental industry.
We service complex and often non-discretionary environmental needs of our diverse clients across our three business segments: Assessment, Permitting and Response; Measurement and Analysis; and Remediation and Reuse. Examples of our services include:


Our industry is highly fragmented with no single market leader. By focusing on environmental solutions, we believe we are uniquely positioned to become a leading platform in the industry. We provide a diverse range of environmental services to our private and public sector clients across the life cycle of their needs—whether they are launching new projects, maintaining operations, decommissioning operations, rehabilitating assets, managing the impacts of climate change or responding to unexpected environmental disruption. Our integrated platform has been a catalyst for our organic growth and we have built on this platform through strategic acquisitions.
Innovation is core to our strategy. The world’s environmental challenges continue to grow in number, scope and complexity, and mounting public pressure and regulatory changes continue to drive demand for better information and solutions. We focus on innovation in order to improve the quality of information we can provide to clients (such as more accurately measuring methane and greenhouse gas emissions or identifying variations of Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, in water) and provide better solutions to their environmental needs (such as the efficient removal of PFAS from contaminated water). We intend to continue innovating by investing in research, development, software development, and technology (directly and through strategic partnerships) to develop better solutions for our clients. We believe these investments—together with our investments in geographic expansion, sales and marketing initiatives, environmental service offerings and strategic acquisitions—will continue to distinguish us in the marketplace.
Our revenue and earnings are highly resilient. We are not dependent upon any single service, product, political approach or regulatory framework. We also serve a diverse set of approximately 5,600 clients across a wide variety of end markets and geographies within the private

and public sectors. Funding for our services is typically non-discretionary given regulatory drivers and public health concerns. As a result, our business is positioned to be less susceptible to political and economic cycles.
Our financial success is driven by both strong organic and acquisition-driven growth, and as a result, our total revenue has grown at a compounded annual growth rate of 30% since 2018.
Our environmental focus and reputation have enabled us to attract and retain some of the most highly sought-after employees in our industry. These employees have contributed to our organic growth, differentiated brand, reputation and culture.
Our approach has allowed us to successfully and consistently scale our business, and we believe we are well positioned to continue our trajectory and market leadership as we address the growing environmental needs of our clients and communities.
The Industry
The environmental industry is large, growing, highly fragmented and subject to complex regulatory frameworks. Federal, state, provincial and local environmental regulations dictate compliance requirements that create demand for environmental services. Increasingly, public and stockholder interest in environmental sustainability is also driving prudent management of our shared and finite environmental resources.
Global Environmental Industry is Large and Growing
According to data derived from environmental industry studies updated annually by Environmental Business International, Inc. ("EBI") and research commissioned by Montrose, as of 2022 the global environmental industry is estimated to generate approximately $1.34 trillion in revenues, with $444 billion concentrated in the United States. According to EBI, this $444 billion U.S. environmental market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 2.8% per year from 2023 through 2026, up from its previous forecast. EBI concludes that strong tailwinds of ESG, energy security, energy transition and climate resilience, in addition to traditional drivers of air quality, water quality, responsible waste management and resource recovery are leading to positive growth across all environmental sectors in the global market.
Public Demands, Industrial Activity, Climate Change and Regulations Each Increase Need for Environmental Services
Heightened public awareness and increasing stakeholder demand for environmental sustainability has increased the need and demand for environmental services. Many companies around the world have implemented initiatives on Sustainability and Corporate Social Responsibility, or CSR, and Environmental, Social and Governance, or ESG, making environmental impact a core factor in many business decisions. These initiatives are often focused on managing potential future risks, as opposed to past emphasis on regulatory compliance.
Steady increases in industrial activity and infrastructure investment, and the regulations underpinning these activities, are also driving demand for environmental services. In addition, environmental disruptions caused by climate change or aging infrastructure drive demand for environmental services. Infrastructure investments and environmental emergency responses often require substantial assessments, planning and/or permitting services in addition to environmental testing or remediation services. Testing and monitoring are typically recurring processes driven by regulations throughout the industrial production process.
In addition to current regulations, future regulatory changes may also drive demand for additional or different environmental services. In the United States, Canada, Australia and Europe, the federal, state, provincial and local regulations targeting air and water quality management, waste and contaminated soil management or reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, each of which drives portions of our business, have been implemented over many decades, and are subject to change.
We expect these trends to continue and to spur future growth in the environmental services industry.
The Environmental Services Industry is Highly Fragmented and Complex
According to EBI, thousands of firms operate in many of the markets in which we operate. Several larger firms provide environmental services as a part of their broader product portfolio. However, much of the industry is served by small firms that provide limited service offerings addressing specific regulations and geographies. It is difficult for small firms to expand given the technical expertise, accreditations and licenses necessary to serve a broad array of clients and industries across geographies and service lines. These dynamics create significant barriers to entry in our industry.

As clients increasingly focus on environmental solutions to address their impact on the environment, we believe they value environmental solutions providers with scale, technology and broad service capabilities. Providers able to address the full lifecycle of environmental concerns and needs, particularly for companies and organizations with multi-jurisdictional footprints subject to complex regulatory frameworks and impacts across environmental media (e.g., air, water and soil) will continue to enjoy competitive advantages.
Competitive Strengths
We are a leading global brand focused on environmental services with a resilient revenue base anchored on long-term client relationships. Our focus on innovation, our ability to acquire and integrate leading companies, our highly accredited businesses and our experienced and credentialed team provide our clients with quality solutions and create significant barriers to entry. Our competitive strengths include:
Resilient Revenue Across Political and Economic Cycles
Our revenues are largely resilient over political cycles primarily because our business is not dependent on any one industry, geography or regulatory framework. We have a diversified client and geographic footprint, and we often help clients comply with multiple regulatory frameworks. As a result, we are often insulated from major shifts in individual federal, state, provincial and local regulations. While federal governments set certain minimum standards, many state, provincial or local policies are more stringent. In addition, state, provincial and local governments often define how environmental standards will be met or implemented. These different levels of government often serve as counterweights to each other and minimize the risk and impact of sudden shifts in policy.
We believe our diverse portfolio of services and end markets also positions us to be resilient across economic cycles. For example, clients use our services when launching development projects, while maintaining ongoing operations, when decommissioning operations, and when remediating the release of contaminants into air, water or soil. These client activities can occur at different times for different industries, regardless of economic cycles. In addition, many of our service offerings are typically non-discretionary and our projects often create significant economic value for our clients (in the form of reduced liability, cost savings or revenue streams), further incentivizing the continued use of our services. Furthermore, community demands, such as those for PFAS-free water or better air quality monitoring in disadvantaged communities surrounding industrial facilities, continue regardless of political or economic cycles. As another example, during the COVID-19 shelter-in-place orders, most of our services were deemed essential and continued to be requested by clients. Though there were some delays in the scheduling of certain services due to travel restrictions or social distancing requirements, the environmental and/or regulatory implications of not completing environmental projects resulted in a resilient demand for our services, even during the heights of the pandemic. Including revenues generated by CTEH, whose clients do not necessarily recur each year due to the emergency response nature of their services, clients generating 95% of revenue in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 repeated in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. Excluding revenues generated by CTEH, clients generating 96% of revenue in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 repeated in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. Similarly, inclusive of CTEH clients generating 86% of our revenue in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 repeated in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 and excluding revenues from CTEH, clients generating 93% of our revenue in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 repeated in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021.
  Long-term Relationships Across a Large and Diversified Client Base
We currently serve approximately 5,600 clients. We have long-standing relationships with a number of Fortune 1000 companies and government entities, and our legacy acquired businesses have been operating for as long as a century.
We provide services to our largest clients across multiple projects and/or multiple locations, and the number of services we provide to these clients varies from one project per year to several dozen projects per year. With the exception of CTEH, whose environmental response business may at times experience higher customer concentration levels based on the severity, duration and outcome of certain types of environmental emergencies for which we provide response services, our revenues are not dependent on any one single client or industry. In fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, our largest client represented approximately 14% of revenue, with those revenues being generated by more than 30 separate projects. In fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, our largest client represented approximately 10% of revenue, with those revenues being generated by more than 20 separate projects. Further, the Industrial Manufacturing Industry, the industry from which we generated the most revenue in 2022, represented 23% of total revenue. The Media industry, the industry from which we generated the most revenue in 2021, represented 32% of total revenue.
Differentiated Technology, Processes and Applications
Our focus on innovation and on accessing and developing proprietary technologies, processes and applications is a key competitive advantage and differentiator of our brand and services. These innovative tools complement our professionals’ years of experience, technical expertise and industry knowledge and bolster the solutions we provide our clients. We have consistently used technology and process advancements across geographies, to accelerate growth and to address our clients’ environmental concerns.
In fiscal year 2022, our Research and Development team was awarded six patents in the United States related to water treatment technology. In total, our research and development team has been awarded eighteen patents and has an additional twenty patents submitted for

patent consideration in the United States. Our research and development team continued to innovate in the following areas: water treatment, particularly PFAS and selenium removal, PFAS destruction, PFAS testing, foam fractionation, and CO2 capture. In addition, with the acquisition of SensibleIoT in 2021, our software and environmental sensor connectivity platform targeting air and water quality continued to advance.
Significant Scale with Global Reach
Clients value our ability to provide coordinated, diversified services across many geographies, including domestic and international geographies that reach beyond our approximately 80 locations. Through our strategic acquisitions and targeted recruiting, we have achieved a scale that combines knowledge of local environments and regulations with global reach, which positions us to win and execute our projects globally. As a result, we expect to continue to capture market share.
Our global footprint supports our ability to gain market share by attracting new clients and by expanding offerings to our existing clients. As clients seek environmental solutions providers able to address the life cycle of their environmental concerns and needs across jurisdictions, we believe our footprint and diversified portfolio of services position us well to attract and retain clients, and expand our relationships with those clients over time.
Our scale has enabled us to leverage our investments in technology, innovation and process resources in a way that we believe will continue to support our industry leadership position.
Proven Ability to Identify, Execute and Integrate Acquisitions
We have acquired and integrated over 65 businesses over the last ten years, and we intend to continue selectively acquiring companies in our industry. Key characteristics of past and expected acquisition targets include quality management teams, complementary services, access to differentiated technologies and extension of our geographic reach.
We believe we add value to the businesses we acquire by introducing a culture focused on teamwork and innovation, and by providing superior operating discipline. As a result of our focus on integration, our acquired businesses typically begin contributing to our organic growth after the first year following acquisition. Post-acquisition performance is typically driven by revenue synergies, which, excluding the impact of CTEH, whose revenues are episodic, is demonstrated by our consistent organic revenue growth.
We maintain a robust acquisition pipeline primarily driven by word of mouth and existing relationships. As we have to-date, we intend to continue acquiring businesses at disciplined valuation levels. We believe our approach to acquisitions will enable us to continue creating substantial value for all our stakeholders.
Experienced Management Team Coupled with a Team-Centric Culture
Our leadership and culture define who we are. Our senior leadership team includes industry pioneers who have led a number of industry organizations and are considered among the foremost experts in the environmental services industry. The average tenure of our operational leadership in the environmental industry is more than 25 years. Our key executives and board members also have extensive experience in growing businesses both organically and through acquisitions. Finally, we review talent metrics, including those related to hiring, retention, and diversity with the Board on a quarterly basis.
 Our management and employees share a passion for the environment and a compassion for each other. In addition, The Montrose Community Foundation, a non-profit organization formed and operated by our employees for the benefit of our employees continued to offer assistance to employees in need. Through its volunteer board, The Montrose Community Foundation uses employee donations to provide resources to our employees in times of need. Our employees’ dedication of personal time and resources solely for the benefit of their colleagues exemplifies our team-oriented culture.
  We believe it is our strong management team and our culture that enables us to attract and retain our exceptional talent.
Growth Strategies
Our goal is to become a global leader in the growing environmental services industry. We expect to continue our long-term organic growth by maintaining and expanding existing client relationships, developing new client relationships and investing in sales and marketing infrastructure. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, 35% of our revenue came from customers buying more than one service. This is nearly double from the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 of 18%. We also expect to continue growing by strategically acquiring companies in our highly fragmented industry. Our proven ability to recruit and retain industry leaders and innovators across all our business segments will

further contribute to our success. We believe these growth strategies position us well to capture market share from competitors and accelerate beyond our industry’s attractive growth profile.
Continue Organic Growth
•Build Montrose brand awareness and marketing strategy: We believe we are uniquely positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for environmental solutions. We continue to expand and centralize our marketing resources to support both corporate and business-line specific needs, adding personnel, processes, and tools to drive brand awareness. Anchored on a content marketing strategy where we provide relevant, technical information through story-driven campaigns, our goal is to engage specific customers and support our sales teams with data-driven insights. Though our brand awareness is rapidly improving, our technical capabilities remain broadly unknown to most prospective customers; therefore, we believe our investments in brand development remain very additive to our ability to recruit talent, generate organic growth, and ultimately can create shareholder value. 
 •Provide sales training and deploy a targeted sales team to drive growth and acquire new clients: We are investing in our dedicated sales capabilities and intend to continue these efforts. We are providing sales and account management training to our technical practitioners, investing in customer relationship management systems and building sector-specific sales teams to help identify new clients and capture market share from competitors. We believe a targeted investment in sales and marketing will help facilitate cross selling across our products and geographies, and support ongoing market share capture within each individual environmental service.
 •Sell additional environmental services to existing clients: Many of our clients have historically hired us for a specific environmental service such as environmental audits or tests. As we have diversified our service offerings, and as clients have grown accustomed to the quality and consistency that our teams provide, clients have increasingly engaged us to perform additional environmental services. As a result, we have won new business historically served by competitors that are typically single service-line focused. We expect to continue cross-selling additional environmental services to existing clients with multidimensional needs, including where we can replace services provided in-house. 
 •Deploy innovative technologies, processes and applications to address unmet client needs: Newly identified contaminants, public health concerns and changes to regulations have created and are expected to continue to create unmet environmental service needs for many of our current and prospective clients. Our investments in innovation—both stand-alone and through partnerships—have better equipped us to address these client needs in a manner that differentiates us from our competitors. We have won and expect to continue winning business from both existing and new clients because of the innovative solutions we offer.
 •Capture environmental service opportunities arising from federal, state or provincial spending and stimulus measures: Government stimulus packages may include incentives and guidelines to target improved water treatment and water infrastructure, soil remediation and land development, air quality improvement, and infrastructure development initiatives (which often require environmental assessments). These types of initiatives can both directly or indirectly increase demand for our environmental services and would be additive to our ability to recruit talent, generate organic growth, and ultimately can create shareholder value. 
 •Expand existing local relationships into national and international relationships: Many of our clients have a broad national and international presence. Historically, these clients have often managed their environmental programs locally using regional service providers. However, these clients often have a desire to minimize the number of vendors they work with and standardize their programs across geographies, which requires their environmental services providers to have the scale, reach and capabilities to match their footprint. Meeting this need is challenging for many in our industry given their regional focus and limited service offerings. Our geographic reach, strong relationships and reputation for quality enable us to address our clients’ ever-growing and diverse needs in a way most of our regional competitors cannot. As a result, we have generated many intra-client referrals and won new business with existing clients in geographies historically served by competitors. We intend to continue to expand into new geographies where our existing clients operate.
 Pursue Strategic Acquisitions
The environmental services industry is highly fragmented and has no single leading brand. Through strategic acquisitions, we can continue to accelerate our growth, brand development and market leadership. Over the last ten years, we have acquired and integrated over 65 businesses that have provided us with talent, complementary services, access to differentiated technologies and geographic reach. Most of our acquisitions were initiated with personal introductions given our favorable reputation in the market. We believe our ability to identify, execute and integrate acquisitions and retain talent has been and remains a key driver of our operational and financial success.
Our pipeline of potential future acquisitions is robust, and we plan to continue pursuing acquisitions to enhance our strategic and competitive positions in existing and new markets.
Recruit, Develop, and Retain Industry Professionals and Leaders
Given the highly technical nature of many of our services, our ability to recruit and retain talent enhances our ability to capture market share. We believe our mission and focus on the environment, our emphasis on ownership opportunities for our employees and our team of renowned industry leaders creates a competitive advantage when competing for talent.
Segments
We provide environmental services to our clients through our integrated solutions across three business segments—Assessment, Permitting and Response, Measurement and Analysis and Remediation and Reuse.



Assessment, Permitting and Response. Our Assessment, Permitting and Response segment provides scientific advisory and consulting services to support environmental assessments, environmental emergency response and recovery, toxicology consulting and environmental audits and permits for current operations, facility upgrades, new projects, decommissioning projects and development projects. We work closely with clients to navigate the regulatory process at the local, state, provincial and federal levels, identify the potential environmental and political impacts of their decisions and develop practical mitigation approaches, as needed. In addition to environmental toxicology, and given our expertise in helping businesses plan for and respond to disruptions, our scientists and response teams have helped clients navigate their preparation for and response to COVID-19 infections.
We believe this segment maintains a number of competitive advantages, including:
•strong brands and market leadership, particularly with environmental preparedness and response;
 •strong relationships with key private and public sector clients with needs for multiple environmental services, facilitating cross selling opportunities; 
 •a core team of approximately 1,150 employees, including well-known technical experts with longstanding client relationships and significant experience across the key disciplines in the segment; 
 •technology, software and data management capabilities, particularly within our response segment;
 •our proven ability to help clients navigate regulatory, public and legal scrutiny; and 
 •a national reach established by having successfully assessed and permitted hundreds of projects in jurisdictions across the United States. 
 This segment, which is primarily based on a time and materials, or T&M, revenue model, generated approximately 34% of our revenue for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022.
Measurement and Analysis. Our Measurement and Analysis segment is one of the largest providers of environmental testing and laboratory services in North America. Supported by approximately 1,160 employees across more than 50 locations in the US and Canada, our highly credentialed teams test and analyze air, water and soil to determine concentrations of contaminants, as well as the toxicological impact of contaminants on flora, fauna and human health. Our offerings include source and ambient air testing and monitoring, leak detection, and advanced multi-media laboratory services, including air, soil, stormwater, wastewater and drinking water analysis.
We believe we have a variety of sustainable competitive advantages in this market, including:

 •comprehensive laboratory network in the United States, offering a complete suite of analytical solutions for virtually all environmental projects; 
 •one of the most experienced providers of advanced optical gas imaging “OGI” testing used to detect hydrocarbon gas leaks; and 
 •our proprietary software, technologies, processes and applications, including the ability to detect air contaminants in real time at ultra-trace concentrations.


This segment, which is primarily based on a fixed price and, for out-of-scope work, a T&M revenue model, generated approximately 32% of our revenue for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022.
Remediation and Reuse. Our Remediation and Reuse segment provides clients with engineering, design, and implementation services, primarily to treat contaminated water, remove contaminants from soil or create biogas from waste. Approximately 450 of our employees, including engineers, scientists and consultants, provide these services to assist our clients in designing solutions, managing products and mitigating environmental risks and liabilities at their locations. We do not own the properties or facilities at which we implement these projects or the underlying liabilities, nor do we own material amounts of the equipment used in projects.
We believe this segment’s competitive advantages include:
•strong brands;
 •advanced technologies and our owned and licensed intellectual property portfolio, such as our patented water treatment systems and proprietary process to optimize the generation of biogas; 
 •a team with industry-leading experts and several patent-generating scientists; and 
 •local expertise and capabilities with respect to unique soil, sediment and water table characteristics and contamination types. 
 This segment, which is primarily based on a fixed price and, for out-of-scope work, a T&M revenue model, generated approximately 34% of our revenue for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 through a combination of project-based work and recurring, monthly fee operating & maintenance (O&M) revenue stream.


This table illustrates a summary of our segments.


Differentiated Technology, Processes and Applications
Advanced technology and innovative processes and applications are key competitive advantages in the environmental services industry. Our team of industry leaders are integral drivers of our investments in differentiated services. As our brand and environmental platform grows, our experts are increasingly able to deploy innovative technologies that address our clients’ needs, further differentiate our services and create new barriers to entry. Recent examples of our investment and development activities are related to real time air quality and methane emissions monitoring, environmental data management and visualization software, and PFAS removal and destruction technologies.
 In fiscal year 2022, our Research and Development team was awarded six patents in the United States related to water treatment technology. In total, our research and development team has been awarded eighteen patents and has an additional twenty patents submitted for patent consideration in the United States. Our research and development team continued to innovate in the following areas: water treatment, particularly PFAS and selenium removal, PFAS destruction, PFAS testing, foam fractionation, and CO2 capture.
 Strategic Acquisitions
We operate in a growing and highly fragmented market with thousands of potential acquisition targets. Given our success in identifying, executing and integrating more than 65 acquisitions since our inception in 2012, we believe we can continue to selectively acquire additive businesses. We seek to acquire businesses at disciplined valuation levels that:
(1)are led by high quality scientists and management teams, 
 (2)expand our portfolio of services, 
 (3)provide access to differentiated technologies or processes, and 
 (4)extend our geographic coverage. 
 We have personnel specifically dedicated to identifying acquisition targets, exploring acquisition opportunities, negotiating terms and overseeing acquisition and post-acquisition integration. Our in-house acquisition team has established extensive relationships throughout the industry and maintains and regularly re-evaluates an established pipeline of potential acquisition opportunities, largely driven by word of mouth and personal introductions.
Since January 1, 2020 we have acquired the following businesses:

 We believe we add value to the businesses we acquire by emphasizing a team-centric culture focused on innovation and investment, expanding career opportunities for new employees from smaller businesses, providing a larger eco-system of environmental services and capabilities to further client relationships, and implementing award-winning safety programs and operating processes. Each business we acquire is systematically integrated into our systems and processes, thereby creating revenue synergy opportunities and operating leverage.
Clients
We provide environmental services to approximately 5,600 clients operating in a number of sectors and industries, including but not limited to technology, media, chemicals, energy (oil, gas and/or petrochemical), power and utilities, industrials and manufacturing, financial services, and engineering services as well as local, state, provincial and federal government entities. We have long-term, and through our legacy companies, decades-old relationships. We serve a diversified client base in both the private and public sectors. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, our revenues were derived approximately 89% from the private sector and 11% from the public sector.
Our largest client represented approximately 14% of revenue for fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, with these revenues derived from over 30 separate projects. As a result of the nature of CTEH’s environmental response business, our Assessment, Permitting and Response segment may at times experience higher customer concentration levels based on the severity, duration and outcome of certain types of environmental emergencies for which we provide response services, as was the case in 2022 when 38% of CTEH’s revenues were attributable to three customers, each of whom engaged CTEH in connection with COVID-19 response support. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors.”


For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, 35% of our revenue came from customers buying more than one service, which is nearly double from the 18% generated from this type of customer in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. We have expanded our relationships with our existing customer base with our vertically integrated business model. Our maturing client relationships coupled with our integrated structure across all our business lines has increased the level of client engagement.
 Contracts
Our client contracts are generally fixed price, including milestone-based fixed price contracts in our Remediation and Reuse segment, and, for out-of-scope work, T&M based. Our Assessment, Permitting and Response client contracts are generally T&M based. Our client contracts vary from purchase-order based contracts utilizing standard terms and conditions to comprehensive master services agreements with terms of multiple years. In accordance with industry practice, most of our contracts, both in the private and public sector, are subject to termination at the discretion of the client. In such situations, our contracts typically provide for reimbursement of costs incurred and payment of fees earned through the date of termination. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors.”
 Competition
We operate in a competitive, but fragmented, market. No single company or group of companies dominates across the entire environmental services market in which we operate. Our primary competitors are divisions of large companies, various small companies, which generally are limited to a specific service and focused on a niche market or geographic region and our clients’ own in-house resources. We believe that few, if any, of our competitors currently provide the full range of environmental solutions that we offer. Instead, each of our segments has competitors with narrower service offerings and/or geographies. Our Assessment, Permitting and Response segment competitors include the environmental divisions of ERM, Ramboll, Geosyntec, Exponent, and other large engineering companies and small businesses. Our Measurement and Analysis segment competitors include the environmental divisions of SGS, TRC Companies, Eurofins, Pace Analytical and other large testing companies and small businesses. Our Remediation and Reuse segment competitors include the environmental divisions or remediation segments of Tetra Tech, AECOM, Evoqua, Mead & Hunt, and other large engineering companies and other small businesses.
 We compete based on the following factors, among others: reputation, safety track record, quality, geographic reach, price, technical capabilities, access to innovative technology and breadth of services. We believe that our current capabilities position us to compete favorably in each of these factors.
The environmental services industry has significant barriers to entry which would make it difficult for new competitors to enter the market. These barriers include:
•highly technical, costly and time-consuming accreditation and licensure requirements; 
 •ability to deploy/services client needs across geographies; 
 •advanced quality and safety programs and mandated scores; 
 •the complex and geographically varying regulatory landscape that requires significant industry experience; 
 •the need to acquire or develop innovative technologies and processes that are acceptable to regulatory bodies, which in our case occurred over many years of client and regulator engagements and at significant research and development expense; and 
 •emphasis by large clients on size and scale, length of relationship and past service record. 
 Intellectual Property
We utilize a combination of intellectual property safeguards, including patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and licenses, as well as employee and third-party confidentiality agreements, to protect our intellectual property. However, we do not principally rely on any single piece of intellectual property, nor is any single piece of intellectual property material to our financial condition or results of operations.
Seasonality
Because demand for environmental services is not driven by specific or predictable patterns in one or more fiscal quarters, our business is better assessed based on yearly results. Additionally, due to the field-based nature of certain of our services, weather patterns generally impact our field-based teams’ ability to operate in the winter months. As a result, our operating results in our Measurement and Analysis segment experience some quarterly variability with generally lower revenues and lower earnings in the first and fourth quarters and typically we experience higher overall revenues and earnings in the second and third quarters. As we continue to grow and expand into new geographies and service lines, quarterly variability in our Measurement and Analysis segment may deviate from historical trends.
Human Capital Resources
 Employees
As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 2,900 employees, including approximately 2,250 full-time employees in the United States. Approximately 97% of our full-time employees work in our U.S. operations and approximately 3% work in foreign operations. None of our facilities are covered by collective bargaining agreements.
Employee Communication
 We continue to advance our employee communication strategy at Montrose. In 2022, we held an annual meeting for key leaders, an annual sales meeting targeting key business development initiatives, and townhalls for all employees and for specific business lines. The townhalls update all employees, to share progress on Diversity, Fairness, and Inclusion ("DF&I") initiatives, and to update individual business lines and divisions. The townhalls, which are open to all employees in the relevant group, provide comprehensive updates about the company or the business line’s talent and people strategy, key operational successes and focus areas, financial updates, and opportunities to ask questions of the leadership team.
In addition to live townhall events, we leverage internal newsletters published by our Human Resources ("HR") and Marketing departments, respectively. The HR newsletters inform employees of initiatives and accomplishments towards building a better workplace and the Marketing newsletters provide employees with information on new business projects, research and development updates, client updates, upcoming and completed marketing events, and Montrose in the news. 
Diversity, Fairness and Inclusion
At Montrose, diversity, fairness, and inclusion are key to fulfilling our Company aspirations to be the future of environmental solutions. Our DF&I Task Force, established in July 2020, continues to build awareness across Montrose and to establish and formalize employee development and policies that support diversity, inclusion and fairness. We conducted a DF&I survey in 2021 with the goal of understanding our employee’s perspectives and assessing areas of opportunity for the Company. The findings are continuing to inform our DF&I mission, vision, and roadmap, including: communicating and educating on DF&I topics, concerns, and holidays; prompting a review of our Montrose Handbook and DF&I-related policies; developing training and education programs on topics such as unconscious bias and inclusion; encouraging participation in community events, such as additional townhalls, supporting local causes, and celebrating our first company Diversity Day; and improving our programs and sharing milestones.
These roadmap initiatives could not be completed without the engagement of our various Montrose departments. Our operations team, for example, implemented changes intended to make employee gender identification more inclusive, and encouraged existing employees to complete and validate race and veteran status in our internal tracking systems. The DF&I Task Force also works with our executive leadership team and divisional leadership teams to propose changes in policies or work practices. Recent changes to policy include the addition of floating holidays and a dedicated Employee Appreciation & Diversity Day to the Company’s vacation policy, and various diversity, fairness and inclusion efforts globally. We have also deployed mandatory inclusion training to the Company’s full-time workforce, with 97% of such employees having completed the training in 2022, and our Task Force is continuing to evaluate other DF&I related trainings and updates for future roll-outs.
 Our DF&I Task Force actively works with our HR and Talent Acquisition teams to expand our recruiting efforts of science, technology, engineering and math ("STEM") professionals, as well as engaging with colleges and professional organizations that promote individuals from underrepresented populations. For example, we have sponsored events for the Society of Women Environmental Professionals in an effort to build a long-term relationship. Additionally, the Task Force, in coordination with HR, now reviews our job posting templates for inclusive and fair recruitment language.
We LEAD
The Montrose Environmental Group Women Empowering Leadership, or WeLEAD, program, which was established in January 2020, is focused on fostering the recruitment, retention and professional development of women at our company. Our WeLEAD program is developing an alliance of women leaders across Montrose, with a key emphasis on mentorship and talent development. Since the program’s inception, a standardized pay parity effort was launched across the organization to support fair pay across job titles and functions, both for existing employees and for new hires going forward. In addition, several prominent female leaders have been promoted into senior roles within the Company’s science and engineering departments and two female Board members have been added to the Company’s Board of Directors. In coordination with the DF&I Task Force, WeLEAD recently made policy recommendations which have been implemented to promote the development and retention of female talent within the organization. Most recently, based on these recommendations, the Company has adopted a new parental leave policy which expanded paid parental leave, expanded bereavement leave scope to include loss of pregnancy, and WeLEAD is creating a new liaison program for new mothers to navigate parental leave and subsequent return to work.

Further to its mission, WeLEAD has, since 2020, coordinated a formal annual mentorship program for women leaders within our Company.
 
Talent Acquisition and Development
 In 2022 we established a dedicated Talent Acquisition team that bring decades of combined recruitment experience to allow Montrose to be more competitive in today’s hiring. The team is actively engaged in ensuring the Company’s strong growth profile is matched by the recruitment and development of key talent.
 We have also advanced on a number of employee development initiatives in 2022, including:
 •The launch of our Talent Profile, an internal resume database that allows us to more easily collaborate internally by identifying individuals with particular experience and skills, as well as to understand employee career interests. The Talent Profile has been an important factor in furthering thoughtful career discussions between leaders and employees. 
 •The deployment of onsite Leadership Development Days, aimed at providing leaders with the right insight and tools on a variety of topics to better develop and lead their own teams. 
 •The launch of the Montrose Leadership Excellence Program, an 8-month leadership development program that focuses on building leadership skills for executive-nominated next level leaders and helps prepare them for more prominent leadership roles at Montrose. 
 •360-degree feedback surveys to identify key leader strengths and development opportunities.
 •Continued investments in training, including online platforms and content, on-the-job training and mentoring, and in person training programs, all of which are reviewed annually, to further employee development and compliance. 
 Compensation and Benefits
 We strive to maintain a fair and equitable compensation program for comparable roles, experience and performance that is independent of employee race, gender, sexual orientation or other personal characteristics. Moreover, we consistently review and adjust, as may be needed, salaries in each role, in each level, and in all business and corporate functions to ensure employees are paid fairly based on their positions and qualifications, regardless of gender.
As part of our dedication and commitment to motivating and rewarding our employees, we offer annual cash bonuses based on performance. We also offer equity incentives to a large number of our employees under our stock incentive plans. We believe strongly in employee ownership of Montrose and we believe our approach creates value for our clients, for our employees, for the communities in which our employees live, and for our shareholders.
We conduct annual employee benefit surveys and in 2022 have implemented solutions in response to some of this feedback we received. We expanded our parental leave and continue to offer a robust Employee Assistance Program, which we believe has been a positive impact to our employees’ lives during difficult times.
Engagement
 Our employees’ dedication to supporting each other has led to the establishment of The Montrose Community Foundation, a non-profit organization formed and operated by our employees for the benefit of our employees, in 2016. Through its volunteer board, The Montrose Community Foundation uses employee donations to provide resources to our employees in times of need. Our employees’ dedication of personal time and resources solely for the benefit of their colleagues exemplifies our team-oriented culture.
Health, Safety and Wellness
 We offer a spectrum of benefit plans to meet the needs of our diverse employee population, including health, dental, vision, life insurance, and various supplemental plans. In response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, we provided employees with paid time off to help address their personal or family needs during an unprecedented time and Personal Protective Equipment resources and a 24/7 emergency response hotline were and continue to be made available to our teams across the globe.
 Our culture of safety and wellbeing of our employees is supported by a dedicated team of health and safety professionals.
Across our organization, we demonstrate our strong commitment of safety to our employees with frequent communications and systems that actively engage employees and encourage all employee's input and involvement. The foundation of the safety program focuses on ensuring that our employees are sufficiently trained to perform their job duties, have properly operating equipment including correct Personal Protective Equipment such as gloves, eyewear and respirators, job hazards are properly identified, mitigated and planned for prior to work commencement, and the entire process is documented to validate and improve performance. All employee time associated with safety preparation and training is

fully paid to employees. Current initiatives include driving safety, job safety planning and job hazard analysis. Further to our commitment to our employees, we employ a third party occupational medical provider that is available to all employees 24/7 to discuss occupational health concerns. Finally, all of our employees have complete stop work authority and can stop any project or task if there is any concern about a safety issue without any fear of retribution.
 Our dedication and commitment to safety have resulted in us again receiving National Safety Council Award for Operational Excellence as well as the recognition of our CEO, Vijay Manthripragada as 2022’s CEOs Who "Get It" in recognition of our excellence in safety across our business.
 Additionally, CTEH was recognized for having received the Houston Outstanding Safety Performance “Best in Class” award in the ‘Technical Support - Medium’ category by The Houston Area Safety Council and the Houston Business Roundtable, which awards companies who operate regionally for their safety excellence.
 Compliance with Federal, State/Provincial and Local Laws
Our operations subject us to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in jurisdictions where we operate, including the United States, Australia and Canada. Such laws and regulations relate to, among other things, the discharge of wastewater, the discharge of hazardous materials into the environment, the handling, storage, use, transport, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and solid, hazardous and other wastes and workplace health and safety. These laws and regulations impose a variety of requirements and restrictions on some of our operations and the services we provide. The failure by us to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines, penalties, enforcement actions, third-party claims, damage to property or natural resources and personal injury claims, requirements to investigate or cleanup property or to pay for the costs of investigation or cleanup or regulatory or judicial orders requiring corrective measures, and could negatively impact our reputation with clients. We are not aware of any pending environmental compliance or remediation matters that, in the opinion of management, are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.
A portion of our revenue is derived from working with the U.S. federal government. When working with U.S. governmental agencies and entities, we must comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of contracts. Internationally, we are subject to various government laws and regulations (including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and similar non-U.S. laws and regulations). To help promote compliance with these and other laws and regulations, our employees are sometimes required to complete tailored ethics and other compliance training relevant to their position and our operations.
