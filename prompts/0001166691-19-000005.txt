In addition, pursuant to the current regulatory regime in the U.K. and Italy, Sky is able to access networks owned by third-party telecommunication providers for a fee to provide its high-speed internet and phone services in most cases, on regulated terms.
To offer video services, in addition to its owned channels, Sky licenses programming from third-party programming providers that operate television channels. Sky attempts to secure long-term programming distribution agreements with these programming providers. The fees associated with these programming distribution agreements are generally based on the number of customers who are able to watch the programming and the platforms on which Sky provides the content. Sky seeks to include in its distribution 

Comcast 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 9

agreements the rights to offer such programming through multiple delivery platforms, such as through its On Demand services, online portal, mobile apps and streaming services.
Customer and Technical Services
Sky’s customer service operations are increasingly a digital first offering. Its technical services group performs various tasks, including installations, plant maintenance and upgrades to its distribution system.
Sales and Marketing
Sky offers direct-to-consumer services to retail customers through customer service call centers, customer service centers, websites, telemarketing, a limited number of retail outlets, as well as through advertising via direct mail, television and the internet.

Corporate and Other

We are also pursuing other business development initiatives, such as a wireless phone service, which we launched in the second quarter of 2017, using our virtual network operator rights to provide the service over Verizon’s wireless network and our existing network of in-home and outdoor Wi-Fi hotspots. The wireless phone service is offered only as part of Comcast Cable’s bundled service offerings to residential customers that subscribe to its high-speed internet service within its cable distribution footprint and may in the future also be offered to our small business customers on similar terms. The wireless phone service has success-based working capital requirements, primarily associated with the procurement of handsets, which customers are able to pay for upfront or finance interest-free over 24 months, and other equipment.
Our other business interests consist primarily of the operations of Comcast Spectacor, which owns the Philadelphia Flyers and the Wells Fargo Center arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. 
Competition
All of our businesses operate in intensely competitive, consumer-driven and rapidly changing environments and compete with a growing number of companies that provide a broad range of communications products and services, and entertainment, news and information products and services to consumers. Technological changes are further intensifying and complicating the competitive landscape and challenging existing business models. In particular, consumers are increasingly turning to online sources for viewing and purchasing content, which has and likely will continue to reduce the number of our video customers and subscribers to our cable networks even as it makes our high-speed internet services more valuable to consumers. In addition, the increasing number of entertainment choices available has intensified audience fragmentation, which has and likely will continue to adversely affect the audience ratings of our cable networks and broadcast television programming.

Cable Communications Segment

High-Speed Internet Services
Cable Communications competes with a number of companies offering internet services, including:

• | wireline phone companies and other providers of wireline internet service


• | wireless phone companies and other providers of wireless internet service


• | municipal broadband networks and power companies


• | satellite broadband providers

Phone companies such as AT&T, CenturyLink, Frontier and Verizon have built and are continuing to build fiber-based network infrastructure farther into their networks, which allows them to provide data transmission speeds that exceed those that can be provided with traditional DSL technology, and are offering these higher-speed services in many of our service areas. Certain companies that offer DSL service have increased data transmission speeds, lowered prices or created bundled services to compete with our high-speed internet services.
Certain other companies have launched FTTH networks that provide high-speed internet services in a limited number of areas in which we operate, and certain municipalities in our service areas are also building fiber-based networks. 
Various wireless companies are offering internet services using a variety of network types, including 3G and 4G, and recently 5G, wireless broadband services and Wi-Fi networks. These networks work with devices such as smartphones, laptops, tablets and mobile wireless routers, as well as wireless data cards. A growing number of commercial venues, such as retail malls, restaurants 

10 | Comcast 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K

and airports, also offer Wi-Fi service. Numerous local governments are also considering or actively pursuing publicly subsidized Wi-Fi and other internet access networks. The availability of these wireless offerings could negatively impact the demand for our high-speed internet services.
Video Services
Cable Communications competes with a number of different sources in the United States that provide news, sports, information and entertainment programming to consumers, including:

• | DBS providers, including AT&T’s DIRECTV and DISH Network, that transmit satellite signals to substantially all U.S. households to provide video programming and other information similar to our video services


• | phone companies, including AT&T and Verizon, that have built and continue to build fiber-based networks that provide cable services similar to ours, which overlap a substantial portion of our service areas, and that in some cases offer bundled offerings that include wireless phone services


• | online video distributors including:


◦ | virtual multichannel video providers who offer streaming services for linear programming that generally involve smaller packages of programming networks at prices lower than our traditional video service package offerings


◦ | subscription video on demand services, such as those offered by Amazon, Hulu and Netflix, that offer online services and devices that enable internet streaming and downloading of movies, television shows and other video programming


◦ | premium, cable and broadcast networks that provide content directly to consumers


• | other providers that build and operate wireline communications systems in the same communities that we serve, including those operating as franchised cable operators


• | satellite master antenna television systems that offer to their subscribers both improved reception of local broadcast television stations and much of the programming offered by our cable systems and generally serve MDUs, office complexes and residential developments


• | other companies, such as local broadcast television stations, that provide multiple channels of free over-the-air programming, as well as video rental services and home entertainment and gaming products

Many of these competitors also have significant financial resources and have further intensified competition through mergers and acquisitions. 
Voice Services
Cable Communications’ voice services compete with wireline and wireless phone companies, including incumbent local exchange carriers (“ILECs”) and competitive local exchange carriers (“CLECs”), and other internet-based and VoIP service providers. Certain phone companies, such as the ILECs AT&T and Verizon, have longstanding customer relationships, and extensive existing facilities and network rights-of-way. A few CLECs also have existing local networks and significant financial resources. In addition, we are increasingly competing with other phone service providers as customers replace traditional wireline phone services with wireless and internet-based phone services, such as Skype.
Business Services
Cable Communications’ business services primarily compete with a variety of phone companies, including ILECs and CLECs and WAN Managed Service Providers. These companies either operate their own network infrastructure or use all or part of another carrier’s network. It also competes with satellite operators who offer video services to businesses and VoIP companies that target businesses of all sizes. Our video monitoring services compete with companies that provide video surveillance services that use both traditional and cloud-based/digital solutions.

Comcast 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 11


NBCUniversal Segments

Cable Networks and Broadcast Television
NBCUniversal’s cable networks, broadcast networks and owned local broadcast television stations compete for viewers’ attention and audience share with all forms of programming provided to viewers, including cable, broadcast and premium networks; subscription video on demand services; local broadcast television stations; home entertainment products; pay-per-view and video on demand services; online activities, such as social networking and viewing user-generated content; gaming products; and other forms of entertainment, news and information. 
NBCUniversal’s cable networks, broadcast networks and owned local broadcast television stations compete for the acquisition of programming and for on-air and creative talent with other cable and broadcast networks, local television stations, and subscription video on demand services. The market for programming is very competitive, particularly for sports programming, where the cost for such programming is significant.
NBCUniversal’s cable networks compete with other cable networks and programming providers for carriage of their programming by traditional and virtual multichannel video providers and subscription video on demand services. Its broadcast networks compete with the other broadcast networks in markets across the United States to secure affiliations with independently owned television stations, which are necessary to ensure the effective distribution of broadcast network programming to a nationwide audience.
In addition, NBCUniversal’s cable television and broadcast television studio production operations compete with other production companies and creators of content for the acquisition of story properties, for creative, performing and technical personnel, and for distribution of, and consumer interest in, their content.
Filmed Entertainment
The filmed entertainment business competes for audiences for its films and other entertainment content with other major studios and, to a lesser extent, with independent film producers, as well as with alternative forms of entertainment. The competitive position of the filmed entertainment business primarily depends on the number of films produced, their distribution and marketing success, and consumer response. The filmed entertainment business also competes to obtain creative, performing and technical talent, including writers, actors, directors and producers, as well as scripts for films. The filmed entertainment business also competes with the other major studios and other producers of entertainment content for the exhibition of its films in theaters and the distribution of its films on premium networks and on subscription video on demand services.
Theme Parks
NBCUniversal’s theme parks business competes with other multi-park entertainment companies. It also competes with other providers of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreational activities. To help maintain the competitiveness of our theme parks, we have invested and continue to invest in existing and new theme park attractions, hotels and infrastructure.

Sky Segment

Sky faces competition from a broad range of companies engaged in media, entertainment and communications services in Europe, including cable operators, providers of both paid-for and free-to-air programming, service providers making use of new fiber optic networks, other satellite television providers, digital terrestrial television providers, telecommunications providers, other internet service providers, content aggregators, home entertainment products companies, companies developing new technologies and devices, and other suppliers and providers of news, information, sports and entertainment that deliver streaming and downloading online video services. Sky’s competitive position may be negatively impacted by an increase in the capacity of, or developments in, the means of delivery which its competitors use to provide their services. Sky’s competitors also include organizations that are publicly funded, in whole or in part, which fulfill a public service broadcasting mandate. 
Sky competes for the acquisition of programming content with a wide range of providers, particularly for sports programming, where the cost for such programming is significant.

Advertising

The cable communications business, cable networks, broadcast networks, owned local broadcast television stations and Sky compete for the sale of advertising with other television networks and stations, as well as with all other advertising platforms, such as digital, radio and print media. The willingness of advertisers to purchase advertising from us may be adversely affected by lower audience ratings at NBCUniversal’s cable networks, broadcast networks and owned local broadcast television stations and Sky’s owned channels. Declines in audience ratings also can be caused by increased competition for the leisure time of viewers and by 

12 | Comcast 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K

audience fragmentation resulting from the increasing number of entertainment choices available, including content from subscription video on demand services and other digital sources. In addition, advertising revenue is adversely affected by the growing use of technologies, such as DVRs and video on demand services, which give consumers greater flexibility to watch programming on a time-delayed or on-demand basis or to fast-forward or skip advertisements within programming.
Seasonality and Cyclicality
Each of our businesses is subject to seasonal and cyclical variations. In our Cable Communications segment, our results are impacted by the seasonal nature of residential customers receiving our cable services in college and vacation markets. This generally results in fewer net customer relationship additions in the second quarter of each year. 
Revenue in our Cable Communications, Cable Networks and Broadcast Television segments is subject to cyclical advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels. Advertising revenue in the U.S. is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of each year, due in part to increases in consumer advertising in the spring and in the period leading up to and including the holiday season. Advertising revenue in the U.S. is also cyclical, with a benefit in even-numbered years due to advertising related to candidates running for political office and issue-oriented advertising. Revenue in our Cable Networks and Broadcast Television segments fluctuates depending on the timing of when our programming is aired, which typically results in higher advertising revenue in the second and fourth quarters of each year. 
Our revenue and operating costs and expenses (comprised of total costs and expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization expense and other operating gains) are cyclical as a result of our periodic broadcasts of major sporting events, such as the Olympic Games, which affect our Cable Networks and Broadcast Television segments, and the Super Bowl, which affects our Broadcast Television segment. In particular, our advertising revenue increases due to increased demand for advertising time and our distribution revenue increases in the period of these broadcasts. Our operating costs and expenses also increase as a result of our production costs for these broadcasts and the amortization of the related rights fees. 
Revenue in our Filmed Entertainment segment fluctuates due to the timing, nature and number of films released in movie theaters, on DVDs, and through various other distribution platforms. Release dates are determined by several factors, including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods. As a result, revenue tends to be seasonal, with increases experienced each year during the summer months and around the holiday season. Content licensing revenue in our Cable Networks, Broadcast Television and Filmed Entertainment segments also fluctuates due to the timing of when our content is made available to licensees.
Revenue in our Theme Parks segment fluctuates with changes in theme park attendance that result from the seasonal nature of vacation travel and weather variations, local entertainment offerings and the opening of new attractions, as well as with changes in currency exchange rates. Our theme parks generally experience peak attendance during the spring holiday period, the summer months when schools are closed and the holiday season.
Our Sky segment results are impacted by the seasonal nature of residential customers receiving our DTH and OTT video services, including the start of the new soccer seasons and the Christmas holiday. This generally results in greater net customer relationship additions and higher subscriber acquisition costs in the fourth quarter of each year due to higher marketing expenses. Growth in Sky’s wireless phone business is also similarly impacted by seasonal trends, as well as by the length of consumer cycles to upgrade their handsets.
Exclusive tier one sports rights, such as domestic and UEFA Champions League soccer, Formula 1, and English cricket, play a key role within Sky’s wider content strategy. In Europe broadcasting rights for tier one sports are usually tendered through a competitive auction process, with the winning bidder or bidders acquiring rights over a three to five-year period. This creates some level of cyclicality for Sky, although the staggered timing of tier one sports rights auctions usually gives Sky time to react to any material changes in the competitive dynamics of the prevailing market. 
The results of Sky’s advertising business are subject to cyclical advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels. This includes seasonally higher audience levels in winter months and increased competition during major sporting events where public service broadcasters lease the rights, such as the Olympic Games and the FIFA World CupTM. The results for Sky’s content business are also subject to fluctuations as a result of changes in timing, nature and quantity of original programming distributed to other markets. 

Comcast 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 13

Legislation and Regulation
The Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the “Communications Act”), and FCC regulations and policies affect significant aspects of our businesses that operate in the United States. These businesses are also subject to other regulation by federal, state and local authorities and to agreements we enter into with local cable franchising authorities. In addition, our international businesses are subject to the laws and the jurisdiction of the foreign regulatory authorities where they operate.
Legislators and regulators at all levels of government frequently consider changing, and sometimes do change, existing statutes, rules or regulations, or interpretations of existing statutes, rules or regulations, or prescribe new ones, any of which may significantly affect our businesses. These legislators and regulators have been active in considering rulemakings and legislation, and they, along with some state attorneys general and foreign governmental authorities, have also been active in conducting inquiries and reviews, regarding our services. Any future legislative, judicial, regulatory or administrative actions may increase our costs or impose additional restrictions on our businesses, some of which may be significant. The U.S. Congress may consider proposals to address communications issues, including whether it should rewrite the entire Communications Act to account for changes in the communications marketplace, whether it should enact new, permanent open internet requirements, and whether it should fund new broadband infrastructure. We are unable to predict the outcome or effects of any of these potential actions or any other legislative or regulatory proposals on our businesses. 
The following paragraphs summarize material existing and potential future legal and regulatory requirements affecting our businesses, although reference should be made to the Communications Act, FCC regulations and other legislation and regulations for further information. 

Cable Communications Segment

High-Speed Internet Services
We provide high-speed internet services to our customers. Many of these services are subject to a number of regulatory obligations described below. As an internet service provider (“ISP”), we are also subject to a requirement to implement certain network capabilities to assist law enforcement in conducting surveillance of persons suspected of criminal activity. From time to time, the FCC considers imposing new regulatory obligations on ISPs. New broadband regulations, if adopted, may have adverse effects on our businesses.
Open Internet Regulations
In 2015, the FCC reclassified broadband internet access service as a “telecommunications service” subject to new open internet regulations and certain common carrier regulations under Title II of the Communications Act. These included, among other things, prohibiting ISPs from blocking access to lawful content; impairing or degrading lawful internet traffic on the basis of content, applications or services (“throttling”); prioritizing certain internet traffic in exchange for consideration (“paid prioritization”); and generally prohibiting ISPs from unreasonably interfering with or unreasonably disadvantaging consumers’ ability to access and use the lawful internet content, applications, services or devices of their choosing or edge providers’ ability to make lawful content, applications, services or devices available to consumers (“general conduct”).
In 2017, the FCC reversed its prior classification of broadband internet access service as a Title II telecommunication service and classified it as an “information service” under Title I. In addition, it eliminated its prior no-blocking, no-throttling, no paid-prioritization and general conduct rules, stating that jurisdiction to regulate ISP conduct would rest at the FTC. In addition, it revised the transparency rule to require ISPs to disclose any blocking and throttling practices, and any paid or affiliated prioritization practices associated with their broadband offerings. We have disclosed that we do not block, throttle, or engage in affiliated or paid prioritization, and have committed not to block, throttle, or discriminate against lawful content. The FTC has authority to enforce these public commitments, and the FCC has authority to enforce compliance with its transparency rule. The Order also preempted any state and local laws and regulations that conflict with the FCC’s deregulatory policies. 
The FCC’s 2017 decision is currently on appeal in federal court. In addition, several states have passed or introduced legislation, or have adopted executive orders, that impose Open Internet requirements in a variety of ways. Certain of these state initiatives have been challenged in court, and additional challenges may be filed. Such attempts by the states to regulate have the potential to create a patchwork of differing and/or conflicting state regulations. Congress may also consider legislation addressing these regulations and the regulatory framework for broadband internet access services. We cannot predict whether or how the rules might be changed, the impact of potential new legislation or the outcome of any litigation.

14 | Comcast 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K

Broadband Deployment/Infrastructure Initiatives
In 2018, the FCC adopted rules aimed at removing barriers to the deployment of broadband infrastructure, including the preemption of certain state and local laws or regulations that may unreasonably impede the deployment of wireless broadband networks. These orders are being challenged in federal court, and we cannot predict the outcome of the litigation. If the orders are upheld, some of these reforms may create regulatory imbalances that favor wireless services over wireline broadband services like our own. The FCC is considering similar reforms for wireline networks, including our networks, as part of its ongoing efforts to promote broadband deployment. We cannot predict whether or how any FCC rules might be changed, how state or local laws or regulations may be impacted, or how such changes may affect our business. In addition, as part of any federal infrastructure program, governmental subsidies or funding of additional internet broadband networks may be encouraged. We cannot predict how successful those efforts will be and how they might affect our business.
Municipally Owned Broadband Networks
A number of local municipalities operate municipally owned broadband networks and there may be further efforts by local governments to expand or create government-owned networks. Certain states have enacted laws that restrict or prohibit local municipalities from operating municipally owned broadband networks, and there may be efforts in other state legislatures to restrict the development of government-owned networks, although some may choose to ease or facilitate such networks. We cannot predict how successful those efforts will be and how they might affect our business.
Video Services
Program Carriage
FCC regulations prohibit us from unreasonably restraining the ability of an unaffiliated video programming network to compete fairly by discriminating against the network on the basis of its non-affiliation in the selection, terms or conditions for its carriage. In addition, Cable operators and other multichannel video programming distributors (“MVPDs”) in the United States are prohibited from requiring as a condition of carriage a financial interest in, or exclusive distribution rights for, a video programming network. We have been involved in program carriage disputes at the FCC and may be subject to new complaints in the future.
Must-Carry/Retransmission Consent
Cable operators are required to carry, without compensation, programming transmitted by most local commercial and noncommercial broadcast television stations. As an alternative to this “must-carry” requirement, local broadcast television stations may choose to negotiate with the cable operator for “retransmission consent,” under which the station gives up its must-carry rights and instead seeks to negotiate a carriage agreement with the cable operator, which frequently will involve payments to the station. We currently pay certain local broadcast television stations in exchange for their required consent for the retransmission of the stations’ broadcast programming to our video services customers and expect to continue to be subject to demands for increased payments and other concessions from local broadcast television stations. In 2017, the FCC adopted an order relaxing the broadcast media ownership rules and is considering additional revisions to the rules, which could lead to further broadcast television station consolidation. The FCC also adopted an order authorizing voluntary implementation of a new broadcast technical standard that permits broadcasters to seek carriage of signals using the new standard through retransmission consent. Together, these actions may impact retransmission consent negotiations and the fees we pay broadcasters. For information on must-carry and retransmission consent issues relating to our broadcast television business, see “NBCUniversal Segments - Broadcast Television” below and refer to the “Must-Carry/Retransmission Consent” discussion within that section.
Pricing and Packaging
We are subject to rate regulation of charges for certain of our video service, equipment and installation in certain communities in Massachusetts, but all of the other areas we serve have unregulated prices. In addition to the FCC’s rate regulation rules, certain state entities monitor and may challenge the marketing and advertising of our services. For example, in 2016, the Washington State Attorney General filed a lawsuit, currently being litigated in state court, alleging that our service protection plan, an optional plan that protects customers from incurring charges for service visits to diagnose and repair installed in-home wiring for residential cable services, violates state consumer protection laws. We cannot predict the outcome of this litigation or whether other states may file similar suits.
Pole Attachments
The FCC regulates the rates, terms and conditions that most pole-owning utility companies charge cable operators and telecommunications carriers for allowing attachments to their poles. States are permitted to preempt FCC jurisdiction and regulate the rates, terms and conditions of attachments themselves, and many states in which we operate have done so and have generally followed the FCC’s pole attachment rate standards, which set rates for telecommunications service pole attachments to levels at or near the rates for cable service attachments. The rates, terms and conditions of some municipal and cooperative pole owners, however, are not regulated by the FCC or states.

Comcast 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 15

Franchising
Cable operators generally operate their cable systems under nonexclusive franchises granted by local or state franchising authorities. While the terms and conditions of franchises vary materially from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, franchises typically last for a fixed term, obligate the franchisee to pay franchise fees and meet service quality, customer service and other requirements, and are terminable if the franchisee fails to comply with material provisions. Franchising authorities also may establish reasonable requirements for public, educational and governmental access programming. The Communications Act also contains provisions governing the franchising process, including renewal procedures designed to protect incumbent franchisees against arbitrary denials of renewal, including unreasonable renewal conditions. We believe that our franchise renewal prospects are generally favorable but cannot guarantee the future renewal of any individual franchise. In response to a remand by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, the FCC has proposed to clarify that in-kind contribution requirements in a cable franchise are generally subject to the statutory five percent cap on franchise fees and reaffirm that state and local authorities are barred from imposing duplicative franchise and/or fee requirements on the operation of cable systems to provide non-cable services. We cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding or its impact on our businesses.
Voice Services
We provide voice services using VoIP technology. The FCC has adopted a number of regulations for providers of nontraditional voice services such as ours, including regulations relating to privacy of customer proprietary network information, local number portability duties and benefits, disability access, E911, law enforcement assistance, outage reporting, Universal Service Fund contribution obligations, rural call completion, back-up power, service discontinuance and certain regulatory filing requirements. The FCC has not yet ruled on whether VoIP services such as ours should be classified as an “information service” or a “telecommunications service” under the Communications Act. The classification determination is important because telecommunications services are regulated more extensively than information services. Recently, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit held that VoIP is an information service and preempted state regulation of VoIP, but that ruling is limited to the seven states located in the Eighth Circuit. State regulatory commissions and legislatures in other jurisdictions may continue to consider imposing regulatory requirements on our voice services as long as the regulatory classification of VoIP remains unsettled at the federal level. 
Voice Interconnection
Because the FCC has not determined the appropriate classification of our voice services, providers of VoIP services typically either secure CLEC authorization or obtain interconnection to traditional wireline phone company networks by contracting with an existing CLEC, which has the right, as a telecommunications carrier, to request and obtain interconnection with the traditional wireline phone companies. We have arranged for such interconnection rights through affiliated CLECs. If a regulatory or judicial authority were to deny our ability to interconnect through one of our affiliated CLECs, our ability to provide voice services and compete in the area in question would be negatively impacted. The FCC regulates the arrangements by which telecommunications carriers compensate one another for exchanged traffic and has affirmed the right of CLECs to collect intercarrier compensation when providing interconnection for VoIP providers.
Wireless Service
In 2017, we began offering a wireless voice and data service. We offer this service using our mobile virtual network operator (“MVNO”) rights to provide the service over Verizon’s wireless network. MVNOs are subject to many of the same FCC regulations as facilities-based wireless carriers (e.g., E911 services, local number portability, etc.), as well as certain state or local regulations. The FCC or other regulatory authorities may adopt new or different regulations for MVNOs and/or mobile broadband providers in the future, or impose new taxes or fees, which could adversely affect our wireless phone service offering or our business generally.
Universal Service
The federal Universal Service program generally requires us and other phone service providers to pay a fee based on revenue from interstate and international services into a fund used to subsidize the provision of voice services and broadband-capable voice networks in high-cost areas, the provision of voice services to low-income consumers, and the provision of internet, voice and telecommunications services to schools, libraries and certain health care providers. Some states also have analogous programs that support service in high-cost areas or to low-income consumers. 
The FCC has shifted its focus away from supporting traditional telephone service, and toward subsidizing deployment of broadband-capable networks and broadband facilities. This shift could assist some of our competitors. For example, the FCC has revised the high-cost federal Universal Service mechanism to support broadband-capable networks and substantially has revised the program that provides Universal Service support for services to schools and libraries to begin phasing out support for voice services, with greater support directed to broadband services and the deployment of Wi-Fi networks. Similarly, the FCC has expanded its Lifeline subsidy program for low-income consumers to include broadband services in addition to voice services. The FCC or Congress 

16 | Comcast 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K

may revisit these subsidy programs and how they are funded. We cannot predict whether or how these programs will be changed in the future.

NBCUniversal Segments

Cable Networks
Program Access
The Communications Act and FCC regulations generally prevent cable networks affiliated with cable operators from favoring cable operators over competing MVPDs. The FCC and Congress have considered proposals that would require companies that own multiple cable networks to make each of their networks available individually when negotiating distribution agreements with MVPDs and potentially with online video distributors. We currently offer our cable networks both on a bundled basis and, when requested, individually. We have been involved in program access disputes at the FCC and may be subject to new complaints in the future.
Children’s Programming
Under federal regulations, the amount of commercial content that may be shown on cable networks, broadcast networks and broadcast television stations during programming originally produced and broadcast primarily for an audience of children under 13 years of age is limited, and certain television station programming must serve the educational and informational needs of children under 17 years of age. In 2018, the FCC initiated a proceeding to review its regulations regarding children’s programming, and we cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding.
Broadcast Television
Licensing
Local broadcast television stations may be operated only in accordance with a license issued by the FCC upon a finding that the grant of the license will serve the public interest, convenience and necessity. The FCC grants broadcast television station licenses for specific periods of time, which may be renewed with or without conditions. The FCC recently renewed all of our broadcast television station licenses without conditions. Although our licenses have been renewed, there can be no assurance that we will always obtain renewal grants.
Local Television Ownership
The FCC recently revised its rules to generally permit a licensee to own up to two broadcast stations in the same DMA as long as at least one of the stations is not among the top four-ranked stations in the DMA based on audience share. In addition, the new rules permit a licensee to own up to two stations ranked in the top four in a DMA based on a case-by-case analysis of the circumstances surrounding the proposed combination. These recent changes are subject to judicial appeal. These ownership restrictions do not apply if the signal coverage of the stations involved do not overlap in the same market. As part of its 2018 quadrennial review of media ownership regulations, the FCC raised questions about the two-station-per-DMA ownership limit and the criteria by which top-four combinations should be assessed. 
National Television Ownership
The Communications Act and FCC regulations limit the number of broadcast television stations one entity may own or control nationally. No entity may have an attributable interest in broadcast television stations that reach, in the aggregate, more than 39% of all U.S. television households. The FCC also has a rule that affords a 50% discount to UHF stations (channels 14 and above) in calculating the extent of an individual station owner’s holdings under the national cap. The FCC has initiated a proceeding to consider whether to retain the 50% discount and whether to modify the national television ownership limit. Our owned broadcast television station reach does not exceed the current limit even without considering the discount for UHF stations, but elimination of the 50% discount without an increase in the 39% national cap would place us closer to the national cap and limit our flexibility to acquire stations in the future.
Foreign Ownership
The Communications Act generally limits foreign ownership in a broadcast television station to 20% direct ownership and 25% indirect ownership, although the limit on indirect ownership can be waived if the FCC finds it to be in the public interest. 
Dual Network Rule
Each of the four major broadcast television networks - ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC - is prohibited from being under common ownership or control with another of the four. As part of its 2018 quadrennial review of media ownership regulations, the FCC raised questions about whether the dual network rule remains necessary in the public interest.

Comcast 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 17

Must Carry/Retransmission Consent
Every three years, each commercial television station must elect for each cable system in its DMA either must carry or retransmission consent. A similar regulatory scheme applies to satellite providers. For the current three-year period, which commenced on January 1, 2018, all of our owned NBC broadcast television stations and our owned Telemundo broadcast television stations elected retransmission consent.
Indecency
A federal statute and FCC regulations prohibit the broadcast of obscene material on television stations at any time and indecent or profane material between the hours of 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. From time to time, we have received and may receive in the future letters of inquiry from the FCC prompted by complaints alleging that certain programming on our owned local broadcast television stations included indecent or profane material.
Filmed Entertainment
Our filmed entertainment business is subject to “trade practice laws” in effect in 25 states and Puerto Rico relating to theatrical distribution of motion pictures. In countries outside the United States, a variety of existing or contemplated laws and regulations may affect our ability to distribute and license motion picture and television products, as well as consumer merchandise products. The ability of countries to deny market access or refuse national treatment to products originating outside their territories is regulated under various international agreements.
Theme Parks
Our theme parks are subject to various regulations, including laws and regulations regarding environmental protection, privacy and data protection, consumer product safety and theme park operations, such as health, sanitation, safety and fire standards, as well as liquor licenses.

Sky Segment

Sky is subject to regulation primarily under Austrian, German, Irish, Italian, U.K. and European Union (“EU”) law, including telecommunications- and media-specific regulation described below, as well as regulation under generally applicable laws, such as competition, consumer protection, data protection and taxation. Sky is currently, and may be in the future, subject to proceedings or investigations from regulatory and antitrust authorities in the jurisdictions in which it operates. In addition, in connection with our acquisition of Sky, we have made certain legally binding commitments with respect to Sky’s operations, including for example, to maintain annual funding for Sky News in an amount no lower than Sky News’ 2017 fiscal year expenditures, as adjusted by inflation, until 2029. 
Platform Services
In the U.K., under the U.K. Communications Act of 2003, Sky is required to ensure that agreements to provide electronic program guide (“EPG”) and conditional access (“CA”) services to other programming providers are on fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory terms, among other things, so that those providers’ content is available on Sky’s satellite platform via the EPG on Sky’s set-top boxes. Sky also has voluntarily committed to Ofcom, the U.K. regulator, to provide access control services to third parties that enable them to provide interactive services. Sky is subject to similar EPG and CA obligations in Germany under the Interstate Treaty on Broadcasting and Telemedia, as amended by the 20th State Broadcasting Amendment Treaty (the “RStV”). 
Television Channels
Sky holds a number of licenses and authorizations for its portfolio of pay TV channels. In the U.K., as a broadcast licensee, Sky is subject to various codes issued by Ofcom affecting the content and delivery of these channels. These codes include, for example, Ofcom’s Broadcasting Code, the Code on the Scheduling of Television Advertising, and the Cross-Promotion Code. Sky also holds various nationwide broadcast licenses in Germany, and must comply with the RStV; the applicable laws of the federal state in Germany that has granted the broadcasting license; and with the Interstate Treaty on the Protection of Minors. These include regulations regarding media concentration, television advertising, accessibility, airtime for commercials and teleshopping, sponsorship, and the requirement for a clear distinction between program content and advertising. Sky is also a holder of broadcasting licenses in Austria and is subject to broadcast regulations under the Austrian Act on Audiovisual Media Services, such as regulations governing content, advertisements, and the protection of children. In addition, Sky is subject to Austrian rules on media plurality, which prohibit broadcasters in Austria from exceeding certain media coverage thresholds. In Italy, Sky must comply with various requirements regarding broadcast authorizations, including provisions that protect media plurality, obligations requiring broadcasters to guarantee equal treatment between political parties during elections, advertising limits, the protection of children and parental controls, the protection of IP rights, and consumer protections. NBCUniversal’s international television channels are subject to similar regulations in jurisdictions in which they operate.

High-Speed Internet and Voice Services
Sky provides broadband and voice services in the U.K. and Ireland pursuant to wholesale distribution agreements that third-party broadband and telecommunications companies are required to make available under applicable laws in those jurisdictions. Material changes to these regulations could affect Sky’s business. Sky is also subject to EU open internet regulations, which prohibit the blocking, throttling, or discrimination of online content, applications, and services and require ISPs to disclose their traffic management, throughput limitations, and other practices impacting quality of service in customer contracts.

Other Areas of Regulation

Intellectual Property
Copyright, trademark, unfair competition, patent, trade secret and other proprietary-rights laws of the United States and other countries help protect our intellectual property rights. In particular, unauthorized copying, distribution, and piracy of programming and films over the internet, through devices, software and websites, and through counterfeit DVDs, and other platforms, interfere with the market for copyrighted works and present challenges for NBCUniversal’s cable networks, broadcast television and filmed entertainment businesses and Sky’s businesses. We have actively engaged in the enforcement of our intellectual property rights and likely will continue to expend substantial resources to protect our content. Although many legal protections exist to combat such practices, the extent of copyright protection and the use of technological protections are controversial. Modifications to existing laws, a weakening of these protections, or a failure of existing laws, in the United States or internationally, to adapt to new technologies could have an adverse effect on our ability to license and sell our programming.
U.S. copyright laws also require that our video business contribute a percentage of revenue to a federal copyright royalty pool in exchange for retransmitting copyrighted material in broadcast signals under a cable compulsory license and that we pay standard industry licensing fees for the public performance of music in the programs we create or distribute. The cable compulsory license royalties we pay are subject to audit by copyright owners, and we cannot predict how any disputes regarding our royalty calculations will impact those fees in the future. In addition, the Copyright Office has initiated a rulemaking to consider how royalty payments should be calculated under the cable compulsory license. We cannot predict the outcome of this rulemaking, but there is a risk that it could result in higher royalty payments. It is also possible that Congress will eliminate or modify the cable compulsory license in the future, which could impact the retransmission of broadcast signals over cable systems. The music fees we pay are typically renegotiated when we renew licenses with performing rights organizations. The landscape for music licensing is constantly changing. New performing rights organizations have formed to seek higher royalties for the use of music they represent, and other organizations seek royalties for performance rights for which no compensation is currently required. We cannot predict how renegotiation of current rights and future changes in music royalties will affect the music fees that we pay.
Privacy and Data Security Regulation
The Communications Act generally restricts cable operators’ nonconsensual collection and disclosure to third parties of cable customers’ personally identifiable information, except for rendering service, conducting legitimate business activities related to the service, and responding to legal requests. We are also subject to various state and federal regulations that provide privacy protections for customer proprietary network information related to our voice services.
The FTC generally exercises oversight of consumer privacy protections using its enforcement authority over unfair and deceptive acts or practices. 
In addition, certain states have exercised oversight of consumer privacy protections in their respective states. The FTC and state attorney generals regularly initiate efforts to update or enforce transparency requirements about the collection and use of consumer information, which may require ongoing review of new and rapidly evolving technologies and methods for delivering content and advertising to ensure that appropriate notice is given to consumers and consent is obtained where required.
In May 2018, the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which broadly regulates the processing of personal data collected from individuals in the EU regardless of whether the processing actually takes place in the EU, came into effect. GDPR and the Member States’ legislation implementing the GDPR, affect our ability to process certain personal data. We cannot predict how regulators will interpret the scope or requirements of GDPR.
Privacy and data security legislation remained a priority issue in 2018 in many U.S. states and localities, as well as foreign jurisdictions outside of the EU. For example, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), which broadly regulates the sale of the consumer information of California residents and grants California residents certain rights to, among other things, access and delete data about them in certain circumstances. CCPA goes into effect on January 1, 2020, and compliance with the CCPA may increase the cost of providing our services in California. Other states are considering similar proposals. Such attempts by the states to regulate have the potential to create a patchwork of differing and/or conflicting state regulations.

Additionally, there are pending federal legislative proposals that, if enacted, could create new consumer privacy protections or impose new requirements on entities that collect and use consumer personal information, including us. We cannot predict whether such legislation will be enacted at the federal or state level and, if so, the impact of any such laws on our business.
We are also subject to stringent data security and data retention requirements that apply to website operators and online services directed to children under 13 years of age, or that knowingly collect or post personal information from children under 13 years of age. In addition, we are subject to state and federal laws and regulations regarding data security that primarily apply to any person’s sensitive personal information that could be used to commit identity theft. Most states have security breach notification laws that generally require a business to give notice to consumers and government agencies when certain information has been disclosed to an unauthorized party due to a security breach, and the FCC has adopted security breach rules for voice services. Several states have also enacted general data security requirements to safeguard consumer information, including the proper disposal of consumer information
We are also subject to state and federal “do not call” laws regarding telemarketing and state and federal laws regarding unsolicited commercial emails, as well as FCC regulations relating to automated telemarketing calls, texts and SMS messages.
FCC Spectrum Auction and Repacking
In 2017, as a result of an incentive auction conducted by the FCC to repurpose television broadcast spectrum for mobile broadband use, NBCUniversal sold broadcast spectrum rights associated with television stations in three of its markets. Those stations vacated their sold spectrum but continue to operate by sharing channels with other NBCUniversal stations in those markets. The FCC assigned 23 of NBCUniversal’s other television stations that did not sell their spectrum rights to new channels; those stations are in the process of transitioning to their new channels in a post-auction repacking process that is scheduled to conclude in the third quarter of 2020, and the FCC will reimburse those stations for a portion of their reasonable relocation costs (subject to a nationwide aggregate limit of $2.75 billion). As a result of the repacking process, Comcast will have to make changes to its cable systems to accommodate broadcasters on their newly assigned channels, and will be reimbursed by the FCC for a portion of those related costs (subject to a nationwide aggregate limit of $2.75 billion).
In addition, we acquired 73 new mobile broadband licenses in this auction for $1.7 billion. We will be obligated to meet certain regulatory requirements concerning the use of these licenses over the coming years.
FCC 5G Spectrum Proceedings and Other Wireless Laws and Regulations
In multiple regulatory proceedings, the FCC is currently considering establishing and/or modifying its rules to make available additional spectrum that will likely be used to provide the next generation of commercial wireless broadband services, commonly referred to as 5G services. Some of this spectrum is currently used for satellite delivery of broadcast and cable programming to cable headends and broadcast stations, including our own, and there is a risk that such satellite delivery could be disrupted if the FCC were to adopt certain proposals. In addition, there is potential for new legislation or FCC regulations that could enable wireless providers to offer video and other services over their networks subject to different, and possibly fewer, regulatory obligations than the services we provide. We cannot predict what rules or legislation, if any, will ultimately be adopted or how any such changes would affect our businesses. 
State and Local Taxes
Some states and localities have imposed or are considering imposing, through both legislative and administrative channels, new or additional taxes or fees on, or limiting or eliminating incentives or credits earned or monetized by, the businesses operated by our Cable Communications and NBCUniversal segments, or imposing adverse methodologies by which taxes, fees, incentives or credits are computed, earned or monetized. These include combined reporting or other changes to general business taxes, central assessments for property tax and taxes and fees on the businesses operated or services provided by our Cable Communications and NBCUniversal segments. In some situations, DBS providers and other competitors that deliver their services over a high-speed internet connection do not face the same state tax and fee burdens. Congress has also considered, and may consider again, proposals to bar or limit states from imposing taxes on these DBS providers or other competitors that are equivalent to the taxes or fees that we pay. The Internet Tax Freedom Act, which prohibits most states and localities from imposing sales and other taxes on our internet access charges, was made permanent by 2016 legislation; however, some jurisdictions have or may assert that certain taxes akin to right-of-way fees are not preempted by Internet Tax Freedom Act.

Environmental Matters
Certain of our business operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations since they involve air emissions, wastewater discharges and the use, disposal and cleanup of toxic and hazardous substances. Any failure to comply with environmental requirements could result in monetary fines, civil or criminal sanctions, third-party claims or other costs or liabilities. Environmental requirements have become more stringent over time, and pending or proposed new regulations could impact our operations or costs.
U.K. Exit from the European Union
The telecommunications and media regulatory framework applicable to Sky and NBCUniversal’s businesses in the U.K. and the EU may be subject to greater uncertainty in the event that the U.K. leaves the EU. We cannot predict the extent of any potential changes to the regulatory framework involving U.K. and EU regulation of telecommunications and media, or changes to certain mutual recognition arrangements for media and broadcasting.
Other Regulations
U.S. states and localities, and various regulatory authorities actively regulate other aspects of our businesses, including accessibility to our video and voice services and broadcast television programming for people with disabilities, customer service standards, inside wiring, cable equipment, leased access, loudness of commercial advertisements, advertising, Emergency Alert System, equal employment opportunity and other employment-related laws, lottery programming, recordkeeping and public file requirements, regulatory fees and technical standards relating to the operation of cable systems and television stations. In addition, our international businesses are subject to various international regulations, including those that cover television broadcasting, programming and advertising. We are occasionally subject to enforcement actions and investigations at the FCC and other federal, state, and local agencies, as well as foreign governments and regulatory authorities, which can result in us having to pay fines to the agency or being subject to other sanctions. 
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 184,000 full-time and part-time employees calculated on a full-time equivalent basis. Of these employees, approximately 88,000, 64,000 and 30,000 were associated with our cable communications business, our NBCUniversal businesses and our Sky business, respectively. We also use freelance and temporary employees in the normal course of our business.
Caution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements
The SEC encourages companies to disclose forward-looking information so that investors can better understand a company’s future prospects and make informed investment decisions. In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we state our beliefs of future events and of our future financial performance. In some cases, you can identify these so-called “forward-looking statements” by words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expects,” “believes,” “estimates,” “potential,” or “continue,” or the negative of these words, and other comparable words. You should be aware that these statements are only our predictions. In evaluating these statements, you should consider various factors, including the risks and uncertainties listed in “Risk Factors” and in other reports we file with the SEC.
Additionally, we operate in a highly competitive, consumer-driven and rapidly changing environment. This environment is affected by government regulation; economic, strategic, political and social conditions; consumer response to new and existing products and services; technological developments; and, particularly in view of new technologies, the ability to develop and protect intellectual property rights. Our actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements as a result of any of such factors, which could adversely affect our businesses, results of operations or financial condition. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.
