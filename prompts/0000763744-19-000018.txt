Item 1. BUSINESS.
Summary
LCI Industries (“LCII” and collectively with its subsidiaries, the “Company” or the “Registrant”), through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Lippert Components, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, “Lippert Components” or “LCI”), supplies, domestically and internationally, a broad array of engineered components for the leading original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) in the recreation and industrial product markets, consisting of recreational vehicles (“RVs”) and adjacent industries including buses; trailers used to haul boats, livestock, equipment and other cargo; trucks; boats; trains; manufactured homes; and modular housing. The Company also supplies components to the related aftermarkets of these industries, primarily by selling to retail dealers, wholesale distributors and service centers.
LCI’s products include steel chassis and related components; axles and suspension solutions; slide-out mechanisms and solutions; thermoformed bath, kitchen and other products; vinyl, aluminum and frameless windows; manual, electric and hydraulic stabilizer and leveling systems; furniture and mattresses; entry, luggage, patio, and ramp doors; electric and manual entry steps; awnings and awning accessories; electronic components; televisions and sound systems; navigation systems; backup cameras; appliances; and other accessories.
The Company has two reportable segments: the original equipment manufacturers segment (the “OEM Segment”) and the aftermarket segment (the “Aftermarket Segment”).
The Company is focused on profitable growth in its industries, both organic and through acquisitions. In order to support this growth, over the past several years the Company has expanded its geographic market and product lines, consolidated manufacturing facilities, and integrated manufacturing, distribution and administrative functions. At December 31, 2018, the Company operated over 65 manufacturing and distribution facilities located throughout the United States and in Canada, Ireland, Italy and the United Kingdom, and reported consolidated net sales of $2.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018.
The Company was incorporated under the laws of Delaware on March 20, 1984, and is the successor to Drew National Corporation, which was incorporated under the laws of Delaware in 1962. The Company’s principal executive and administrative offices are located at 3501 County Road 6 East, Elkhart, Indiana 46514; telephone number (574) 535-1125; website www.lci1.com; e-mail LCII@lci1.com. The Company makes available free of charge on its website its Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K (and amendments to those reports) filed or furnished with the SEC as soon as reasonably practicable after such materials are electronically filed or furnished.
Recent Developments
Sales and Profits
Consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased to a record $2.5 billion, 15 percent higher than the consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 of $2.1 billion. The increase in year-over-year net sales reflects growth across the Company’s segments, content growth, as well as the addition of sales from acquisitions completed by the Company over the twelve months ended December 31, 2018. Net sales from acquisitions completed by the Company over the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 contributed $231.0 million in 2018.
Net income for the full-year 2018 increased to $148.6 million, or $5.83 per diluted share, up from net income of $132.9 million, or $5.24 per diluted share, in 2017. Net income for 2018 and 2017 included one-time non-cash charges of $0.6 million ($0.03 per diluted share) and $13.2 million ($0.52 per diluted share), respectively, related to the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “TCJA”). Excluding the estimated impact of the TCJA, adjusted net income was $149.2 million, or $5.86 per diluted share, in 2018 compared to $146.1 million, or $5.76 per diluted share, in 2017. Adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share are non-GAAP financial measures. See “Non-GAAP Measures” included in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for additional information regarding the Company's use of non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.
In Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” the Company describes in detail the increase in its sales and profits during 2018.
Customer Concentrations
Thor Industries, Inc. (“Thor”), a customer of both segments, accounted for 31 percent, 38 percent and 37 percent of the Company’s consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (through its subsidiaries Forest River, Inc. and Clayton Homes, Inc.), a customer of both segments, accounted for 23 percent, 25 percent and 26 percent of the Company’s consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. No other customer accounted for more than 10 percent of consolidated net sales in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. International sales, primarily in Europe and Australia, and export sales represented approximately four percent, two percent and one percent of consolidated net sales in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Acquisitions
During 2018, the Company completed four acquisitions:
In November 2018, the Company acquired the business and certain assets of the furniture manufacturing operation of Smoker Craft Inc., (“Smoker Craft”), a leading pontoon, aluminum fishing, and fiberglass boat manufacturer located in New Paris, Indiana. The purchase price was $28.1 million paid at closing.
In June 2018, the Company acquired 100 percent of the equity interests of ST.LA. S.r.l., (“STLA”), a manufacturer of bed lifts and other RV components for the European caravan market, headquartered in Pontedera, Italy. The purchase price was $14.8 million, net of cash acquired, paid at closing, and is subject to potential post-closing adjustments related to net working capital.
In February 2018, the Company acquired substantially all of the business assets of Hehr International Inc., (“Hehr”), a manufacturer of windows and tempered and laminated glass for the RV, transit, specialty vehicle, and other adjacent industries, headquartered in Los Angeles, California. The purchase price was $51.5 million paid at closing.
In January 2018, the Company acquired 100 percent of the equity interests of Taylor Made Group, LLC (“Taylor Made”), a marine supplier to boat builders and the aftermarket, as well as a key supplier to a host of other industrial end markets, headquartered in Gloversville, New York. The purchase price was $90.4 million, net of cash acquired, paid at closing.
Other Developments
In November 2018, the Company announced its Board of Directors authorized a new $150.0 million stock purchase program over the next three years. The Company purchased 0.4 million of its common shares for $28.7 million in 2018.
In December 2018, the Company amended and restated its existing credit agreement (as amended and restated, the “Amended Credit Agreement”) providing for a senior secured revolving credit facility to increase the maximum borrowings thereunder from $325 million to $600 million, to allow for up to $250 million of borrowings by Foreign Borrowers (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) and to extend the maturity date of the revolving credit facility to December 14, 2023 (subject to certain extensions as provided in the Amended Credit Agreement).
OEM Segment
Through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, the Company manufactures and distributes a broad array of engineered components for the leading OEMs in the recreation and industrial product markets, consisting of RVs and adjacent industries, including buses; trailers used to haul boats, livestock, equipment and other cargo; trucks; boats; trains; manufactured homes; and modular housing.
In 2018, the OEM Segment represented 91 percent of the Company’s consolidated net sales and 84 percent of consolidated segment operating profit. Approximately 64 percent of the Company’s OEM Segment net sales in 2018 were of products to manufacturers of travel trailer and fifth-wheel RVs. RVs may be motorized (motorhomes) or towable (travel trailers, fifth-wheel travel trailers, folding camping trailers and truck campers).
Raw materials used by the Company’s OEM Segment, consisting primarily of steel (coil, sheet, tube and I-beam), extruded aluminum, glass, wood, fabric and foam are available from a number of sources, both domestic and foreign.
Operations of the Company’s OEM Segment consist primarily of fabricating, welding, thermoforming, painting, sewing and assembling components into finished products. The Company’s OEM Segment operations are conducted at over 65 manufacturing and distribution facilities throughout the United States, and in Canada, Ireland, Italy, and the United Kingdom, strategically located in proximity to the customers they serve. See Item 2. “Properties.”
The Company’s OEM Segment products are sold primarily to major manufacturers of RVs such as Thor Industries, Inc. (symbol: THO), Forest River, Inc. (a Berkshire Hathaway company, symbol: BRKA), Winnebago Industries, Inc. (symbol: WGO) and other RV OEMs, and to manufacturers in adjacent industries.
The RV industry is highly competitive, both among manufacturers of RVs and the suppliers of RV components, generally with low barriers to entry other than compliance with industry standards, codes and safety requirements, and the initial capital investment required to establish manufacturing operations. The Company competes with several other component suppliers on a regional and national basis with respect to a broad array of components for both towable and motorized RVs. The Company’s operations compete on the basis of product quality and reliability, product innovation, price, customer service and customer satisfaction. Although definitive information is not readily available, the Company believes it is a leading supplier for towable RVs for the following principal RV products:

● windows, | ● axles, 
● doors, | ● furniture, 
● chassis, | ● leveling systems, and 
● slide-out mechanisms, | ● awnings. 

In addition to LCI, Dexter Axle Company is also a leading supplier of axles and Carefree of Colorado and Dometic Corporation are also leading suppliers of awnings.
OEM Segment net sales to adjacent industries increased 49 percent from $411.2 million in 2017 to $614.6 million in 2018, or 27 percent and 21 percent of total OEM Segment net sales in 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Company’s market share for its products in adjacent industries cannot be readily determined; however, the Company continues to make investments in people, technology and equipment and is committed to expanding its presence in these industries.
Detailed narrative information about the results of operations of the OEM Segment is included in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
Aftermarket Segment
Many of the Company’s OEM Segment products are also sold through various aftermarket channels, including dealerships, warehouse distributors and service centers, as well as direct to retail customers. The Company has teams dedicated to product training and marketing support for its Aftermarket Segment customers. The Company also supports two call centers to provide quick responses to customers for both product delivery and technical support. This support is designed for a rapid response to critical repairs so customer downtime is minimized. The Aftermarket Segment also includes the sale of replacement glass and awnings to fulfill insurance claims. Many of the optional upgrades and non-critical replacements are purchased outside the normal product selling seasons, thereby causing Aftermarket Segment sales to be counter-seasonal.
According to the Recreation Vehicle Industry Association (“RVIA”), estimated RV ownership in the United States has increased to over nine million units. Additionally, as a result of a vibrant secondary market, one-third of current owners purchased their RV new while the remaining two-thirds purchased a previously owned RV. This vibrant secondary market is a key driver for aftermarket sales, as the Company anticipates owners of previously owned RVs will likely upgrade their units as well as replace parts and accessories which have been subjected to normal wear and tear. 
Aftermarket Segment net sales increased 36 percent from $171.1 million in 2017 to $233.2 million in 2018. The Company continues to make investments in people and technology to grow the Aftermarket Segment and is committed to continue these expansion efforts.
Detailed narrative information about the results of operations of the Aftermarket Segment is included in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
Sales and Marketing
The Company’s sales activities are related to developing new customer relationships and maintaining existing customer relationships, primarily through the quality and reliability of its products, innovation, price, customer service and customer satisfaction. As a result of the Company’s strategic decision to increase its sales to the aftermarket and adjacent industries, as well as expand into international markets, the Company has increased its annual marketing and advertising expenditures over the past few years, which were $4.1 million, $3.2 million and $3.0 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
The Company has several supply agreements or other arrangements with certain of its customers that provide for prices of various products to be fixed for periods generally not in excess of eighteen months; however, in certain cases the Company has the right to renegotiate the prices on sixty-days’ notice. The Company has agreements with certain customers that indexes their pricing to select commodities. Both the OEM Segment and the Aftermarket Segment typically ship products on average within one to two weeks of receipt of orders from their customers and, as a result, neither segment has any significant backlog.
Capacity
At December 31, 2018, the Company operated over 65 manufacturing and distribution facilities across the U.S. and in Canada, Ireland, Italy, and the United Kingdom. In 2018, the Company’s facilities operated at an average of approximately 55 percent of their practical capacity, assuming at least two shifts of production at all facilities. Capacity by facility varies significantly based on seasonal demand, as well as by product line and geographic region, with certain facilities at times operating below 50 percent utilization, and other facilities at times operating above 90 percent utilization. For most products, the Company has the ability to fill excess demand by shifting production to other facilities, usually at an increased cost. The ability to adjust capacity in certain product areas through lean manufacturing and automation initiatives, reallocation of existing resources and/or additional capital expenditures is monitored regularly by management in an effort to achieve a high level of production efficiency and return on invested capital. Capital expenditures for 2018 were $120 million, which included approximately $75 million for growth, lean and automation initiatives, and approximately $45 million of replacement capital expenditures.
Seasonality
Most industries where the Company sells products or where its products are used, historically have been seasonal and generally at the highest levels when the weather is moderate. Accordingly, the Company’s sales and profits have generally been the highest in the second quarter and lowest in the fourth quarter. However, because of fluctuations in dealer inventories, the impact of international, national and regional economic conditions and consumer confidence on retail sales of RVs and other products for which the Company sells its components, the timing of dealer orders, as well as the impact of severe weather conditions on the timing of industry-wide shipments from time to time, current and future seasonal industry trends may be different than in prior years. Additionally, sales of certain components to the aftermarket channels of these industries tend to be counter-seasonal.
International
Over the past several years, the Company has been gradually growing international sales, primarily in Europe and Australia, and export sales represented approximately four percent, two percent and one percent of consolidated net sales in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Company continues to focus on developing products tailored for international RV markets. The Company participates in the largest RV shows in Europe and has been receiving positive feedback on its products, especially its proprietary slide-out products. The Company’s Director of International Business Development spends time in Australia, Europe and other international markets, assessing the dynamics of the local marketplace, building relationships with OEMs and helping the Company introduce its existing products and develop new products for those markets, with the goal of identifying long-term growth opportunities. The Company estimates the addressable market for annual net sales of its products outside of North America to be over $1 billion. Financial information relating to the Company’s acquisitions is included in Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report.
Intellectual Property
The Company holds approximately 200 United States and foreign patents and has approximately 80 patent applications pending that relate to various products sold by the Company. The Company has also granted certain licenses that permit third parties to manufacture and sell products in consideration for royalty payments.
From time to time, the Company has received notices or claims it may be infringing certain patent or other intellectual property rights of others, and the Company has given notices to, or asserted claims against, others that they may be infringing certain patent or other intellectual property rights of the Company. The Company believes its patents are valuable and vigorously protects its patents when appropriate.
Research and Development
The Company strives to be an industry leader in product innovation and is focused on developing new products, as well as improving existing products. Research and development expenditures are expensed as they are incurred. Research and development expenses were approximately $16 million, $14 million and $9 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Regulatory Matters
We are subject to numerous federal, state and local regulations governing the manufacture and sale of our products. Sales and manufacturing operations in foreign countries are subject to similar regulations.
Rules promulgated under the Transportation Recall Enhancement, Accountability and Documentation Act require manufacturers of motor vehicles and certain motor vehicle related equipment to regularly make reports and submit documents and certain historical data to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”) of the United States Department of Transportation (“DOT”) to enhance motor vehicle safety, and to respond to requests for information relating to specific complaints or incidents.
Trailers produced by the Company for hauling boats, personal watercraft, snowmobiles and equipment must comply with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (“FMVSS”) promulgated by NHTSA relating to lighting, braking, wheels, tires and other vehicle systems.
Windows and doors produced by the Company for the RV industry must comply with regulations promulgated by NHTSA governing safety glass performance, egress ability, door hinge and lock systems, egress window retention hardware, and baggage door ventilation. Windows produced by the Company for buses also must comply with FMVSS promulgated by NHTSA.
Upholstered products and mattresses produced by the Company for RVs and buses must comply with FMVSS promulgated by NHTSA regarding flammability. In addition, upholstered products and mattresses produced by the Company for RVs must comply with regulations promulgated by the Consumer Products Safety Commission regarding flammability, as well as standards for toxic chemical levels and labeling requirements promulgated by the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment. Plywood, particleboard and fiberboard used in RV products are required to comply with standards for formaldehyde emission levels promulgated by the California Air Resources Board and adopted by the RVIA.
Windows and entry doors produced by the Company for manufactured homes must comply with performance and construction regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”) and by the American Architectural Manufacturers Association relating to air and water infiltration, structural integrity, thermal performance, emergency exit conformance, and hurricane resistance. Certain of the Company’s products must also comply with the International Code Council standards, such as the IRC (International Residential Code), the IBC (International Building Code), and the IECC (International Energy Conservation Code) as well as state and local building codes. Thermoformed bath products manufactured by the Company for manufactured homes must comply with performance and construction regulations promulgated by HUD.
The Company believes it is currently operating in compliance, in all material respects, with applicable laws and regulations and has made reports and submitted information as required. The Company does not believe the expense of compliance with these laws and regulations, as currently in effect, will have a material effect on the Company's operations, financial condition or competitive position; however, there can be no assurance this trend will continue as health and safety laws, regulations or other pertinent requirements evolve.
Environmental
The Company’s operations are subject to certain federal, state and local regulatory requirements relating to the use, storage, discharge, transport and disposal of hazardous materials used during the manufacturing processes. Although the Company believes its operations have been consistent with prevailing industry standards, and are in substantial compliance with
 applicable environmental laws and regulations, one or more of the Company’s current or former operating sites, or adjacent sites owned by third parties, have been affected, and may in the future be affected, by releases of hazardous materials. As a result, the Company may incur expenditures for future investigation and remediation of these sites, including in conjunction with voluntary remediation programs or third-party claims. In the past, environmental compliance costs have not had, and are not expected in the future to have, a material effect on the Company’s operations or financial condition; however, there can be no assurance that this trend will continue.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, the Company had 10,260 full-time employees. None of the employees of the Company in the U.S. are subject to collective bargaining agreements, although certain international employees are covered by national labor laws. The Company believes relations with its employees are good.
