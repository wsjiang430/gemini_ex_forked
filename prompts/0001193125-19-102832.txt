Our Business 
 Overview 
 We are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing small molecule drugs for the treatment of cancer. Our goal is to advance our drug candidates into late stage pivotal clinical trials and either sell marketing rights to a larger pharmaceutical company or seek FDA approval ourselves. However, for over the past year we have been operating under significant capital constraints, which has curtailed our ability to achieve meaningful progress in either of our clinical programs. 
 The two primary investigational drug candidates of ours are called CA4P and OXi4503. CA4P is an abbreviation for combretastatin A4-phosphate, and it is also referred to as fosbretabulin, fosbretabulin tromethamine and ZYBRESTAT. OXi4503 is a molecule that is closely related to CA4P, and this product candidate is also referred to as CA1P and combretastatin A1-phosphate.
We are seeking to develop CA4P as an immuno-oncology agent and seeking to develop OXi4503 as a treatment for acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes. 
 CA4P as an Immuno-oncology Agent 
 Over the last several years, there have been significant advances in cancer immunotherapy, which makes use of the immune system to treat cancer. Immuno-oncology agents stimulate the bodys immune system to fight cancer cells, resulting in tumor cell death and tumor regressions in patients who otherwise would not have responded to therapy. Despite these advances, current FDA-approved immuno-oncology agents have significant limitations when used alone to treat cancer, since relatively few patients achieve a durable clinical response following treatment. CA4P has the potential to increase the efficacy of these immuno-oncology agents  it has been shown in animal models of several different tumors to improve immune responses that lead to tumor cell death, resulting in increased tumor regressions compared to immune-oncology agents alone. 
 CA4P causes rapid and widespread tumor cell necrosis. This tumor-specific necrosis stimulates the immune system against the tumor. Animal models also show that CA4P significantly enhances the presence and activity of cancer-fighting T-cells within tumors, resulting in increased tumor cell death and tumor regressions. Given these data, we believe CA4P may result in more and/or better clinical responses in certain cancers when combined with immuno-oncology agents, including in patients who either have not experienced a response to therapy, or in patients who have initially responded but subsequently progressed after treatment with immuno-oncology agents alone. 
 The next step in the process of establishing CA4P as a safe and effective immuno-oncology agent will be to initiate a clinical study in a disease in which immuno-oncology agents are used as standard therapy. This clinical study would evaluate CA4P in combination with currently approved immuno-oncology agents in patients with advanced cancer who have previously failed treatment. We believe that the existing human safety database for CA4P, which includes over 500 patients, will help expedite the development timeline going forward. 
 Our initial immuno-oncology preclinical studies were completed in 2016. One of these studies combined CA4P with an anti-CTLA4 antibody, an approved and well-known immuno-oncology agent, in an EMT-6 mammary tumor model. This study showed that 7 out of 8 mice receiving a combination of CA4P and an anti-CTLA4 antibody experienced complete remission of their tumors, compared to only 1 of 8 in the CA4P monotherapy arm and 2 of 8 in the anti-CTLA4 antibody monotherapy arm. 
 Three of four follow-up preclinical studies confirmed that CA4P combined with immuno-oncology agents could delay tumor growth. These follow-up studies were conducted in a CT26 colon cancer model, a larger tumor EMT-6 mammary cancer model, and a C3H mammary cancer model. Studies in a CT-26 colon cancer animal model using CA4P combined with anti-CTLA4 antibodies demonstrated a 77% reduction in tumor size compared to immuno- oncology agents alone, and an 89% reduction in tumor size compared to control. This large tumor model also showed a survival benefit for the animals receiving combination therapy, with all animals in the combination surviving at the end of the study, compared to none on control and only half the animals receiving immuno-oncology agents alone. Initial data in an MC38 colon cancer model showed that when CA4P is combined with an anti-PD1 antibody there was a 53% reduction in tumor volume at the end of the study, compared with a 16% reduction for CA4P alone and a 15% reduction for the anti-PD1 antibody alone. 
 Additional analyses of changes induced within tumors following combination therapy have shown that CA4P increases tumor-fighting white blood cell counts, T-cells and cytotoxic T-cells compared to immuno-oncology agents alone. Tumor necrosis with the combination of CA4P and immuno-oncology agents is nearly double the necrosis with only immuno-oncology agents (63.9% compared to 32.8%, control = 25.8%). 
 
1 


 The overall data from all these studies provides evidence that CA4P may enhance the activity of immuno-oncology agents for the treatment of cancer, including anti-CTLA4 antibodies and anti PD-1 antibodies. We believe CA4P offers the following potential benefits when used in combination with immuno-oncology agents: 
 

 | A promising approach for enhancing the efficacy of immuno-oncology agents: CA4P induces rapid tumor cell death and stimulation of the immune system. It does this by blocking tumor blood flow after binding to and altering the shape of cells lining the tumor blood vessels, resulting in increased tumor cell death and tumor regressions. This is a promising approach for boosting the efficacy of immuno-oncology agents.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Potential to be used in many different cancers: Because CA4P works by obstructing tumor blood flow, it has the potential to be used in any tumor type where there is a large number of blood vessels upon which the growth of the tumor cells depends.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | A large clinical safety database supports its use in clinical trials: Over 500 patients have been treated with CA4P to date in clinical trials. These trials have shown CA4P to be generally well-tolerated, supporting the overall safety of CA4P and the initiation of additional clinical trials in new areas, including in immuno-oncology.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our goal for the immuno-oncology program is to establish CA4P as a safe and effective therapy for the treatment of advanced melanoma when it is combined with the checkpoint inhibitor anti-PD-1. To this end we plan to initiate and conduct a clinical trial in a setting where patients with advanced melanoma who have previously failed therapy with anti-PD-1 receive continued anti-PD-1 therapy in combination with CA4P. We have chosen this patient population because they historically have a very poor prognosis regardless of treatment, and consequently any responses to the combination including CA4P could be due to the addition of CA4P. We believe that CA4P has the potential to increase the beneficial clinical effects of anti-PD-1 monotherapy in these patients. We are in the process of completing the protocol for this study prior to its submission to regulatory authorities in Italy, which is where our anticipated principal investigator is located. An additional site, located in the United Kingdom, is also planned for this study. We will require additional funding before we will be able to treat any patients in this planned clinical trial. 
 OXi4503 for Acute Myeloid Leukemia and Myelodysplastic Syndromes 
 Acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, is a cancer of the myeloid blood cells, with approximately 21,000 new cases each year in the U.S. and approximately 10,500 deaths. AML is characterized by the rapid growth of abnormal white blood cells that pollute bone marrow and interfere with the production of normal blood cells. OXi4503 has been granted orphan drug designation in both the U.S. and the European Union for the treatment of AML. In addition, OXi4503 has received Fast Track designation from the FDA for the treatment of AML. 
 Patients with relapsed/refractory AML are most commonly treated with chemotherapy, and generally have a poor prognosis, with a one-year survival of only 29% after their first relapse. Over the past 20 years, no new therapies have consistently improved patient outcomes in this indication when compared to chemotherapy. 
 Myelodysplastic Syndromes, or MDS, are a group of cancers in which immature blood cells in the bone marrow do not mature and thus never become healthy blood cells. There are currently few available treatments for MDS. 
 Our most clinically advanced compound, OXi4503, is in development as a potential new treatment for relapsed/refractory AML/MDS. OXi4503 has been demonstrated in preclinical studies to work in AML by disrupting tumor blood vessels in the bone marrow, forcing otherwise-dormant leukemic stem cells, which are attached to these tumor blood vessels, into circulation in the blood stream as well as into the active cell cycle, where they become vulnerable to chemotherapy. OXi4503 has also been demonstrated to be cytotoxic itself and kill leukemic cells directly after it has been metabolized by enzymes located within leukemic cells. 
 In preclinical studies, OXi4503 has been shown to enhance the efficacy of cytarabine, idarubucin, azacitidine, and decitabine, which are each commonly-used chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of many cancers, including AML. In early clinical studies, OXi4503 has shown complete responses in high risk patients both as a monotherapy and in combination with cytarabine. 
 Study OX1222 is a clinical trial using escalating doses of OXi4503 in combination with cytarabine to treat relapsed/ refractory AML which we initiated in late 2015. In the fifth dose cohort of OX1222, two of four patients experienced complete remissions of their disease after just one cycle of treatment with 9.76 mg/m2 of OXi4503. In earlier, lower dose cohorts of OX1222 (doses ranging from 3.75 mg/m2 to 7.81 mg/m2), there were three patients with complete remissions, each of which occurred following two cycles of treatment, and two additional patients with meaningful AML blast count reductions. 
 In 2018 we initiated the sixth dose cohort and treated four patients with 12.2 mg/m2 of OXi4503. Among these four patients we observed two potential dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs). These two events consist of one patient experiencing hypotension shortly following initial treatment with OXi4503 and another patient experiencing acute hypoxic respiratory failure approximately two weeks after receiving OXi4503 and cytarabine. Both events were deemed possibly-related to OXi4503, and both patients recovered following treatment. The protocol for Study OX1222 generally defines a DLT as any grade 3 serious adverse event (SAE) where a relationship to OXi4503 cannot be ruled out. 
 Following the potential DLTs, the FDA placed OX1222 under a partial clinical hold, which prevented us from treating additional patients at 12.2 mg/m2 until we and the FDA evaluate additional safety data on patients receiving 9.76 mg/m2 of OXi4503. Three additional patients have enrolled into the trial, and each of them completed one cycle of treatment at 9.76 mg/m2 of OXi4503, which was the same as the level used in the fifth cohort. One of these patients experienced a meaningful AML blast count reduction over 50% from baseline after a single cycle of therapy, but for whom we were not able to continue treatment. The other two patients who were newly enrolled into the 9.76 mg/m2 dose cohort did not have AML blast count reductions.

 We believe OXi4503 offers the following potential benefits: 
 

 | A unique approach for AML: We believe that disrupting bone marrow tumor vessels for the treatment of AML is a new approach for a difficult to treat disease, with few competing clinical programs. Data show that OXi4503 destroys the protection tumor blood vessels offer to leukemic stem cells, resulting in the release of these leukemic stem cells into the bloodstream and thereby increasing their exposure and vulnerability to chemotherapy;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Dual mechanism of action: When metabolized, OXi4503 becomes both a vascular disrupting agent and a cytotoxic compound that targets and destroys malignant cells of myeloid lineage;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | A safer alternative to high dose chemotherapy: Many patients, especially those that are older, such as those over age 60, cannot tolerate high dose chemotherapy used in the treatment of AML. These patients generally resort to more tolerable but less efficacious therapies. OXi4503 to date has been observed to be relatively well tolerated in clinical studies when used in combination with moderate dose chemotherapy (cytarabine), and therefore may offer a new and better alternative for these patients; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Potential to be used with many therapies: Current AML treatment is highly variable, and many patients receive multiple classes of drugs during the course of their disease. We believe that OXi4503 has the potential to enhance the effect of many common AML therapies.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Despite the signs of efficacy that have been demonstrated in Study OX1222 and the above-noted potential benefits that OXi4503 offers to patients with AML and MDS, we have recently decided to halt enrollment of additional patients into this clinical trial while we continue to seek outside licensees or investors that are able to fund further development of OXi4503. 
 Our Strategy and Development Plan 
 We have been operating with significant capital constraints for well over a year, and for this time period we have been seeking to secure sufficient funding to continue our operations while we simultaneously seek to advance our two investigational drugs for the treatment of cancer. Subject to our ability to secure additional capital, we would seek to further develop CA4P as an immuno-oncology agent and OXi4503 as a treatment for AML/MDS. However, our inability to access capital may significantly impair our ability to develop these compounds, as it has to date. If we are able to advance CA4P as an immuno-oncology program, our aim will be to obtain our first clinical data of CA4P in combination with one or more currently approved immuno-oncology agents. If we are able to advance OXi4503 as a treatment for AML and/or MDS, our aim would be to obtain additional clinical data on patients with the disease. 
 We continue to discuss CA4P and OXi4503 collaboration opportunities with other biopharmaceutical companies, although to date have not secured any agreements with companies that are willing to purchase the products from us or license the development and commercialization rights. We intend to continue to seek a partner to acquire the marketing rights to our product candidates and to finance further clinical studies and will seek to complete a transaction if we are able to reach mutual agreement on terms. 
 In addition to entering into a transaction that would provide funding for the further development of our product candidates, other elements of our development strategy would currently include: 
 

 | Initiating a clinical trial of CA4P in combination with an immuno-oncology agent: Based on preclinical data generated to date and support of two well-known immuno-oncology clinical investigators, we have developed a protocol for a clinical trial that would be the first human clinical trial combining CA4P and an approved immuno-oncology agent. This trial is designed to make initial determinations of whether the combination results in improved patient outcomes, including safety, overall survival, progression free survival, objective response rate, tumor size and other parameters.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Continuing to evaluate OXi4503 in a clinical trial: We have completed six ascending dose cohorts of OXi4503 in combination with cytarabine in Study OX1222 in patients with relapsed/refractory AML and/or MDS. In the highest dose cohort, the sixth cohort of the study, we observed potential safety signals which triggered stopping rules for the study and resulted in a partial clinical hold from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration until we and the FDA assess additional safety data, particularly at the fifth dose cohort level. In the fifth dose cohort of OX1222, we have observed the best potential signs of efficacy to date in the trial and believe treatment of additional patients would provide additional evidence regarding the efficacy of OXi4503 in these indications.

Investigator Sponsored Study in Neuroendocrine Tumors 
 Approximately 14,000 patients in the U.S. are diagnosed with neuroendocrine tumors, or NETs, each year. Since patients with NETs can have prolonged survival rates of over 5 years, it is estimated that the overall prevalence is much higher, approximating 100,000 patients in the U.S. These tumors can produce increased amounts of vasoactive substances including hormones, many of which are biologically active and can result in debilitating symptoms including flushing, diarrhea, weight loss and, less frequently, bronchoconstriction and heart failure. It is our belief, based on the available preclinical data, that by reducing blood flow to these tumors using CA4P, we may be able to reduce the production of tumor-derived substances, including the biologically active hormones.

 We have completed a phase 2 monotherapy clinical trial of CA4P in 18 patients with gastrointestinal or pancreatic NETs and elevated biomarkers. One patient (6%) experienced significant symptomatic improvement as measured by ECOG Status and had a partial response per investigator-assessed RECIST criteria, and an additional 7 patients (39%) had stable disease. In addition, a majority of patients (53%) experienced an improvement in patient-reported quality of life. A statistically significant mean change in biomarkers from baseline, the primary endpoint of the study, was not achieved due to the small sample size along with a high intra- and inter-patient variability observed in the biomarkers. A total of 7 patients were enrolled in a follow-up trial, of which 5 patients (71%) had stable disease, including one that continued for 14 months. The partial response and stable disease analyses, as well as other measures from the trial, suggest that CA4P monotherapy has activity in this indication. Based on the evidence of efficacy observed in this trial, plus an understanding of the benefits of vascular-targeted combination therapy, a lead investigator in this trial has sponsored a 17-patient study in NETs using CA4P in combination with everolimus (AFINITOR®, marketed by Novartis), an anti-angiogenic agent which is already approved and commonly used in this indication. We expect preliminary results from this clinical study to be available in April 2019. 
 CA4P has been granted orphan drug designation for the treatment of neuroendocrine tumors in both the U.S. and the European Union. 
 Glioblastoma Multiforme 
 We are interested in exploring recurrent glioblastoma multiforme, or GBM, as an additional indication for CA4P because: 
 

 | we have preclinical data that demonstrate a positive treatment effect in GBM tumor models,
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | GBM tumors are highly vascular and thus we believe will be quite susceptible to CA4Ps mechanism of action,
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | there are currently no adequate therapies for most GBM patients, and accordingly the indication has a high unmet medical need,
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | bevacizumab is approved for patients with progressive disease in this indication following prior therapy and combination studies of CA4P and bevacizumab in other cancers has shown meaningful benefits, and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | rapid enrollment would be expected in clinical trials for this indication.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 CA4P has been granted orphan drug designation for the treatment of glioma in the United States. If funds become available for us to initiate and complete a clinical trial in GBM, we expect that we would pursue a trial. However, due to our lack of capital we currently do not plan to initiate a GBM or any other clinical trial until sufficient capital is available. 
 Vascular Disrupting Agents: Background 
 According to Cancer Research UK, a non-profit cancer research organization in the United Kingdom, nearly 90% of all cancers are dependent upon a continually evolving vascular supply for their growth and survival. Vascular-targeted therapies, such as CA4P and OXi4503, are designed to interfere with a tumors vascular supply. 
 As illustrated in the table below, there are differences between our vascular targeted therapies and anti-angiogenic drugs which act via a different mechanism to produce potentially complementary biological and anti-vascular effects. 
 
 
 | Anti-Angiogenic Drugs | CA4P | OXi4503 
Molecule Characteristics | Bevacizumab, ranibizumab are monoclonal antibodies (MABs) | Small molecule reversible inhibitor of tubulin polymerization | Small molecule reversible inhibitor of tubulin polymerization 
 | Sorafenib, sunitinib, pegaptanib, pazopanib, cediranib, axitinib, etc. are small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) | | Also forms cytotoxic metabolite (orthoquinone) via oxidation 
Target | Tumor rim | Tumor core | Tumor core Metabolite targets malignant cells of myeloid lineage 
Mechanism | MABs bind to VEGF, thereby rendering it inactive TKIs inhibit the VEGF receptor, thereby inhibiting its activation | Rapid and selective binding to tubulin, which destabilizes microtubules, changes the shape of endothelial cells and disrupts the cell junctional protein VE-cadherin | Similar to CA4P OXi4503 also produces an orthoquinone metabolite that has an anti-proliferative effect on leukemic cells 

 
4 


  
 | Anti-Angiogenic Drugs | CA4P | OXi4503 
Biological Effect | Continuously inhibit pro-angiogenic growth factor signaling (e.g., VEGF) to prevent formation and growth of new blood vessels throughout the tumor rim | Occludes pre-existing abnormal tumor blood vessels that feed tumors | Similar to CA4P OXi4503 also temporarily mobilizes hematopoietic and leukemic cells from the bone marrow 
Rapidity of Effect | Weeks | Hours | Hours 
Target tissue | All angiogenesis | Selective for abnormal vasculature characteristically seen in tumor blood vessels | Similar to CA4P OXi4503 also makes leukemic cells mobilized from the bone marrow vulnerable to the effects of its orthoquinone metabolite 
Plasma Half-life | MABs remain in circulation for days or weeks TKI half-lives vary, average range is 4-12 hours | Approximately 4 hours | Approximately 2 hours OXi4503 metabolite half-life is approximately 20 hours 
Side Effects | Chronic hypertension with long-term use; Acute-impairment in wound healing; Hemorrhage, hemoptysis, gastrointestinal perforation, proteinuria, nephrotic syndrome, thromboembolic events, etc. | Transient blood pressure increases; Tumor pain, nausea, hematological adverse events; Overlapping with anti-angiogenics: no cumulative toxicities observed | Transient acute blood pressure increases; Tumor pain, nausea, vomiting, headache, fatigue; Effects on hematopoiesis and white blood cell counts; In AML  similar to solid tumors with more pronounced effects on coagulation and hematopoiesis

 We believe our drug candidates act on tumor blood vessels via two complementary mechanisms, tubulin depolymerization and disengagement of the junctional protein VE-cadherin, which cause a change in the shape of tumor vascular endothelial cells, tumor vessel occlusion, and the subsequent blockage of blood-flow to the tumor, which deprives the tumor of oxygen and nutrients essential for survival. 
 In vitro studies have demonstrated that our drug candidates act in a reversible fashion on tubulin inside newly-formed and growing endothelial cells, such as the vascular endothelial cells comprising tumor vasculature. By binding to the tubulin, our candidates are able to alter the structural framework that normally maintains the cells flat shape. When this occurs, the shape of the cells changes from flat to round, resulting in physical blockage of the blood vessels. The resulting shutdown in blood-flow then deprives tumor cells of the oxygen and nutrients necessary for maintenance and growth and also prevents tumor cells from being able to excrete toxic metabolic waste products. The consequence of the tumor blood vessel blockage is extensive necrosis (cell death) within the tumor. 
 Preclinical research, published in the November 2005 issue of the Journal of Clinical Investigation, showed that our drug candidates also disrupt the molecular engagement of VE-cadherin, a junctional protein important for endothelial cell survival and function. The authors of the research article conclude that this effect only occurs in endothelial cells which lack contact with smooth muscle cells, a known feature of abnormal vasculature associated with tumors and other disease processes. The disengagement of VE-cadherin leads to endothelial cell detachment, which in turn, can cause permanent physical blockage of vessels. 
 Clinical study results and additional preclinical studies indicate that our investigational drugs exert their anti-vascular effects rapidly, within hours of administration, and the half-life of the active form of our drugs in humans is approximately two-four hours. In part because the half-life is relatively short, the effects on tubulin are reversible. However, the pharmacodynamic effect lasts for weeks, so our agents are typically administered no more frequently than once per week. The side-effects are typically transient in nature, limited to the few hours following administration when the active form is in the body in significant concentrations. 
 Side-effects associated with our investigational drugs are generally transient and manageable. The most frequent side-effects include acute blood pressure increases, infusion-related side effects such as nausea, vomiting, headache and fatigue, and tumor pain, which is consistent with the drugs mechanism-of-action. The acute blood pressure increases are often manageable by controlling underlying hypertension or treating with short-acting anti-hypertensives prior to infusion. The incidence of serious cardiovascular side-effects such as angina and myocardial ischemia observed across all studies to date (including early studies in which hypertension management and prevention was not employed) was less than 3%, a frequency comparable to that reported with approved anti-angiogenic agents such as bevacizumab, sunitinib and sorafenib.

 Collaborative Research and Development Arrangements 
 We have entered into a technology license from Arizona State University, or ASU, for rights to combretastatins, which includes CA4P and OXi4503. The ASU license is an exclusive, world-wide, royalty-bearing license for the commercial development, use and sale of products or services covered by certain patent rights to particular combretastatins. Combretastatins were originally isolated from the bark of the South African Bush Willow tree by researchers from Arizona State University but are now created by synthetic means and have tubulin-dependent anti-vascular and anti-proliferative properties. Under the ASU license, we have the right to grant sublicenses. ASU is entitled to single-digit royalty payments under the license agreement during the term of the patents licensed from ASU. We bear the costs of preparing, filing, prosecuting and maintaining all patent applications under the ASU license. Under the license agreement, we have agreed to diligently proceed with the development, manufacture and sale of products using the licensed technology. ASU has the first responsibility of enforcing patents under the license agreement. License payments made to ASU to date have amounted to $2,700,000, with no further license payments due on the drug candidates we are developing. The agreement remains in force until the expiration of the last to expire patent subject to the ASU license. Either party may terminate the ASU license agreement upon material default or bankruptcy of the other party. In addition, we may terminate the agreement if we determine that filing for regulatory approval is not warranted or economically feasible or upon two months written notice. 
 We also have an exclusive, world-wide, royalty-bearing license from Bristol-Myers Squibb, or BMS, for commercial development, use and sale of products or services covered by certain patent rights to particular combretastatins, including among others, CA4P. Under the BMS license, we have the right to grant sublicenses, and BMS is entitled to low single-digit royalty payments for all commercial sales plus any remuneration we receive for sale of CA4P under named patient or compassionate use programs. All licensing fees and milestone payments under the BMS license, in the aggregate amount of $1,080,000, have been paid. We bear the costs of preparing, filing, prosecuting and maintaining all patent applications under the BMS license and have a right, but not a duty, of enforcing patents covered by the license. Either party may terminate the BMS license upon material default of the other party. The term of the BMS license ends upon the expiration of the licensed patents. The latest United States patent licensed under the BMS license is scheduled to expire in December 2021, excluding a patent term extension available under the Hatch-Waxman Act. 
 Company Background 
 We were originally incorporated in 1988 in New York as OXiGENE, Inc. and reincorporated in Delaware in 1992. In 2016, we changed our name to Mateon Therapeutics, Inc. Our principal corporate office is in the United States at 701 Gateway Boulevard, Suite 210, South San Francisco, California 94080 (telephone: 650-635-7000). Our Internet address is www.mateon.com. Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports, are available to you free of charge through the Investors & News section of our web site as soon as reasonably practicable after such materials have been electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission. Information contained on, or that can be accessed through, our web site is not and shall not be deemed to be a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.REGULATORY MATTERS 
 Government Regulation and Product Approval 
 Government authorities in the United States and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing. Our drug candidates must be approved by the FDA through the New Drug Application, or NDA, process before they may be legally marketed in the United States. 
U.S. Drug Development Process 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDAs refusal to review or approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusal of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 

 | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies according to Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) or other applicable regulations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug Application, or IND, which must be first approved by the FDA before human clinical trials may begin;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to Good Clinical Practices (GCP) to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
6 


 
 | submission to the FDA of an NDA;
--+---------------------------------


 | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drugs identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | satisfactory completion of FDA inspections of clinical sites and GLP toxicology studies; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | FDA review and approval of the NDA.
--+------------------------------------

 The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. 
 Once a pharmaceutical candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, to the FDA as part of the IND. The sponsor will also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated, if the first phase lends itself to an efficacy evaluation. Preclinical testing continues even after the IND is submitted. The IND becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Clinical holds also may be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance.
All clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP regulations. These regulations include the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent. Further, an institutional review board, or IRB, must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at any institution. An IRB considers, among other things, whether the risks to individuals participating in the trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the information regarding the trial and the consent form that must be provided to each trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. 
 Each new clinical protocol must be submitted to the IND for FDA review, and to the IRBs for approval. Protocols detail, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and efficacy in Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials. 
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined: 
 

 | Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase 2: Involves clinical trials in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to evaluate preliminary efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase 3: Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population. These studies are intended to establish the overall risk-benefit ratio of the product and provide, if appropriate, an adequate basis for product labeling.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA. IND Safety Reports must be submitted to the FDA, IRBs and the investigators for (a) any suspected adverse reaction that is both serious and unexpected; (b) any findings from epidemiological studies, pooled analysis of multiple trials, or clinical trials (other than those already reported in (a)); (c) any findings from animal or in vitro testing, whether or not conducted by the sponsor, that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug, such as reports of mutagenicity, teratogenicity, or carcinogenicity or reports of significant organ toxicity at or near the expected human exposure; and (d) any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. Phase 1, phase 2, and phase 3 testing may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRBs requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.

 U.S. Review and Approval Processes 
 The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling, and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of user fees; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances, which may include orphan drug status and the first NDA application for a company. 
 In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, an NDA or supplement to an NDA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. 
 The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA also may refer the NDA to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. The approval process is lengthy and difficult and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA at its discretion or the FDA may require additional clinical or other data and information. Even if such additional data and information are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy its criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive, and the FDA may interpret data differently than we or others may interpret the same data. The FDA may issue a complete response letter, which may require additional clinical or other data or impose other conditions that must be met in order to obtain approval of the NDA. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant to assure and preserve the products identity, strength, quality and purity. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will generally inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will also generally inspect selected clinical sites that participated in the clinical studies and may inspect the testing facilities that performed the GLP toxicology studies cited in the NDA. 
 NDAs receive either standard or priority review. A drug representing a significant improvement in treatment, prevention or diagnosis of disease may receive priority review. In addition, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. Priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the approval process. 
 If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be limited to specific diseases or patient subpopulations and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. In addition, approval by the FDA may include a requirement for phase 4 testing, which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a drugs safety and effectiveness, and the FDA may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products which have been commercialized. 
 Orphan Drug Designation 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. 
 If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in very limited circumstances. 
 In the European Union and Japan, orphan drug exclusivity regulations provide for 10 years of market exclusivity. 
 CA4P has been awarded orphan drug status by the FDA for the treatment of anaplastic, medullary, Stage IV papillary and Stage IV follicular thyroid cancers, ovarian cancer, neuroendocrine tumors and glioma. OXi4503 has been awarded orphan drug status by the FDA for the treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia. 
 CA4P has also been awarded orphan drug status by the European Commission in the European Union for the treatment of anaplastic thyroid cancer, ovarian cancer and neuroendocrine tumors. OXi4503 has been awarded orphan drug status by the European Commission in the European Union for the treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia.

 Expedited Review and Approval 
 The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track, priority review, accelerated approval and breakthrough therapy, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for reviewing drugs, and/or provide for approval on the basis of surrogate endpoints. Even if a drug qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may subsequently decide the drug no longer meets the conditions for qualification or the FDA may not shorten the review or approval time period. Generally, drugs that may be eligible for these programs are those for serious or life-threatening conditions, those with the potential to address unmet medical needs, and those that offer meaningful benefits over existing treatments. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. Although Fast Track and priority review do not affect the standards for approval, the FDA will attempt to facilitate early and frequent meetings with a sponsor of a Fast Track designated drug and expedite review of the application for a drug designated for priority review. Drugs that receive an accelerated approval may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform post-marketing clinical trials. 
 OXi4503 has been awarded Fast Track designation for the treatment of AML. 
 Foreign Regulation 
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we are subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and if any of our product candidates are approved we will be subject to additional regulations regarding commercial sales and distribution. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval to test a product candidate in the United States, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence testing any product candidate in those countries. Likewise, whether or not we obtain FDA approval to market a product, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence marketing of any product candidate in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country. 
 Under European Union regulatory systems, a company may submit marketing authorization applications, or MAAs, either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure, which is compulsory for medicines produced by biotechnology or those medicines intended to treat AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders or diabetes and optional for those medicines which are highly innovative, provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states. The decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions. Under this procedure, the holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the remaining member states. Within 90 days of receiving the applications and assessments report, each member state must decide whether to recognize approval. If a member state does not recognize the marketing authorization, the disputed points are eventually referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states. 
 As in the United States, the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, may grant orphan drug status for specific indications if the request is made before an MAA is submitted. The EMA considers an orphan medicinal product to be one that affects less than five of every 10,000 people in the European Union. A company whose application for orphan drug designation in the European Union is approved is eligible to receive, among other benefits, regulatory assistance in preparing the marketing application, protocol assistance and reduced application fees. Orphan drugs in the European Union receive up to ten years of market exclusivity for the approved indication. 
 Reimbursement 
 Sales of any of our product candidates, if approved, will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of the products will be covered by third-party payors, including government health programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for health care products and services. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption or application of price controls and cost-containment measures could limit our revenue. If third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective they may not pay for our products even if we receive approval, or their level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis. 
 The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or the MMA, imposes requirements for the distribution and pricing of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D (the Medicare prescription drug benefit), Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs not covered under Medicare Part B. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs. Each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. Federal regulations require Part D prescription drug formularies to include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, although not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class.

 In general, government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA or other Medicare regulations may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors. 
 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the Affordable Care Act or ACA,) mandated prescription drug coverage as one of ten essential health benefits that most health plans must offer, requiring coverage of at least one drug in every category and class. The ACA increased in the number of individuals covered by insurance and as a result commercial insurers and government programs have increased their emphasis on cost controls to reduce overall spending. A number of federal government leaders have expressed their intentions to repeal and replace the ACA. If full or partial repeal is enacted, many if not all of the provisions of the ACA may no longer apply to prescription drugs. As a result, we expect that there will continue to be uncertainty regarding drug product pricing, reimbursement and other factors impacting the revenue we may receive if our product candidates are ultimately approved, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and tend to be significantly lower. 
 PATENTS AND PROPRIETARY RIGHTS 
 We actively seek to protect the proprietary technology that we consider important to our business, including chemical species, compositions and forms, their methods of use and processes for their manufacture, as well as modified forms of naturally-expressed receptors, in the United States and other jurisdictions internationally that we consider key pharmaceutical markets. We also rely upon trade secrets and contracts to protect our proprietary information. 
 As of March 15, 2019, we were the exclusive licensee, sole assignee or co-assignee of fifteen granted U.S. patents, one pending U.S. patent application, and granted patents and/or pending applications in several other major markets, including the European Union, Canada and Japan. Our policy is to file U.S. and foreign patent applications to protect technology, inventions and improvements to inventions that are commercially important to the development of our business. There can be no assurance that any of these patent applications will result in the grant of a patent either in the United States or elsewhere, or that any patents granted will be valid and enforceable, or will provide a competitive advantage or will afford protection against competitors with similar technologies. We also intend to rely upon trade secret rights to protect other technologies that may be used to discover and validate targets and that may be used to identify and develop novel drugs. We seek protection, in part, through confidentiality and proprietary information agreements. 
 We consider the following U.S. patents and applications owned by or exclusively licensed to us to be particularly important to the protection of our most advanced product candidates.

 In addition to these patents, for some of our product candidates, we have patents and/or applications that cover a particular form or composition, use for a particular indication, use as part of combination therapy or method of preparation or use, as well as other pending patent applications. These issued patents, including any patents that issue from pending applications, could provide additional or a longer period of protection. We also have patent applications pending that seek equivalent or substantially comparable protection for our product candidates in jurisdictions internationally that we consider key pharmaceutical markets. 
 The patent expiration dates referenced above do not reflect any potential patent term extension that we may receive under the federal Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, known as the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act generally permits a patent extension term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. Patent extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half of the time between the effective date of an investigational new drug application, or IND, and the submission date of a new drug application, or NDA, plus the time between the submission date and approval date of an NDA. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension, and the extension must be applied for prior to expiration of the patent. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves applications for patent term extension. 
 As previously noted, the FDA and European Union have granted CA4P and OXi4503 orphan drug status for certain indications. We are also pursuing, and may continue to in the future to pursue, orphan drug status for other product candidates and indications. Our ability to obtain and maintain the exclusivity for our products and product candidates by virtue of their orphan drug status is an important part of our intellectual property strategy. 
  COMPETITION 
 The industry in which we are engaged is characterized by rapidly evolving technology and intense competition. Our competitors include, among others, major pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, nearly all of which have financial, technical and marketing resources significantly greater than ours. In addition, many of the small companies in our industry have also formed collaborative relationships with large, established companies to support research, development and commercialization of products that may be competitive with ours. Academic institutions, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations are also conducting research activities and patenting new technologies in our line of business and any of these entities may commercialize products that may be competitive with ours. 
 We expect that, if any of our products gain regulatory approval for sale, they will compete primarily on the basis of product efficacy, safety, patient convenience, reliability, price and patent protection. Our competitive position will also depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified scientific and other personnel, develop effective proprietary products and implement joint ventures or other alliances with large pharmaceutical companies in order to jointly market and manufacture our products. 
 EMPLOYEES 
 We had only two full-time employees as of December 31, 2018. We rely on external consultants or outsource nearly all of our research, development, preclinical testing and clinical trial activity, although we maintain managerial and quality control over our clinical trials. We also rely on external consultants for various administrative tasks that are required for a public company. We expect to continue to rely on external service providers and to maintain a small number of executives and other employees.
