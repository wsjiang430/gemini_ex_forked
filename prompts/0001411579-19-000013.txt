     General Development of Business
     AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (“Holdings”), through its direct and indirect subsidiaries, including American Multi Cinema, Inc. and its subsidiaries, (collectively with Holdings, unless the context otherwise requires, the “Company” or “AMC”), is principally involved in the theatrical exhibition business and owns, operates or has interests in theatres primarily located in the United States and Europe. AMC is an indirect subsidiary of Dalian Wanda Group Co., Ltd. (“Wanda”), a Chinese private conglomerate. 
     As of December 31, 2018, Wanda owned approximately 50.01% of Holdings’ outstanding common stock and 75.01% of the combined voting power of Holdings’ outstanding common stock and has the power to control Holdings’ affairs and policies, including with respect to the election of directors (and, through the election of directors, the appointment of management), entering into of mergers, sales of substantially all of our assets and other extraordinary transactions.

     Recent Developments
     NCM: In March 2018, we recorded an impairment charge of $16.0 million, to reduce the carrying value of our held-for-sale interests in National CineMedia, LLC (“NCM”) common units and National CineMedia, Inc. (“NCM, Inc.”) common shares to fair value based on the publicly quoted per share price as of March 31, 2018 of $5.19. 
     On June 18, 2018, the Company entered into two Unit Purchase Agreements (the “Agreements”) with each of Regal Cinemas, Inc. (“Regal”) and Cinemark USA, Inc. (“Cinemark”) pursuant to which Regal and Cinemark each separately agreed to purchase 10,738,740 common units of NCM at a sales price of $7.30 per unit and aggregate consideration of approximately $156.8 million (the “Sales”). The Sales closed on July 5, 2018. Following the closing of the Sales, the Company no longer owned any shares of common units of NMC or shares of NCM, Inc. NCM consented to the Sales and waived its rights under the memorandum of understanding that provided the Company would not reduce its combined ownership of NCM and NCM, Inc. below 4.5%. We recorded a gain on sale of $28.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2018.
     Screenvision Merger: On May 30, 2018, SV Holdco, LLC (“Screenvision”) entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger which resulted in a change of control in Screenvision on July 2, 2018.

Fifth Amendment to Credit Agreement: On August 14, 2018, we entered into the Fifth Amendment to Credit Agreement with Citicorp North America, Inc, as administrative agent and the other lenders party thereto, amending the Credit Agreement dated as of April 30, 2013. The Fifth Amendment made changes to certain covenants and related definitions. These amendments to the Senior Secured Credit Agreement were executed in order to facilitate an internal reorganization due to recent tax changes and to make modifications which clarified certain ambiguities in the Senior Secured Credit Agreement.

Narrative Description of Business
     We are the world’s largest theatrical exhibition company and an industry leader in innovation and operational excellence. Over the course of our nearly 100 year history, we have pioneered many of the theatrical exhibition industry’s most important innovations. We introduced Multiplex theatres in the 1960s and the North American stadium-seated Megaplex theatre format in the 1990s. Most recently, we revolutionized movie-going with the deployment of our theatre renovations featuring plush, powered recliner seating. Our growth has been driven by a combination of organic growth through reinvestment in our existing assets and through the acquisition of some of the most respected companies in the theatrical exhibition industry.
     The combination of AMC, Odeon, Carmike Cinemas, Inc. (“Carmike”) and Nordic Cinema Group Holdings AB (“Nordic”) makes us the largest theatre operator in the world with 1,006 theatres and 11,091 screens in 15 countries as of December 31, 2018. We are the #1 theatre operator in the United States; the #1 theatre operator in the United Kingdom-Ireland, Italy, Spain, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania; the #2 theatre operator in Portugal; and the #4 theatre operator in Germany. We have operations in four of the world’s ten largest economies, including four of the five largest European economies (the United Kingdom, Spain, Italy and Germany). Additionally, the combined company is the largest global procurer in theatrical exhibition of film, food and beverage items, lighting and theatre supplies.
    
As of December 31, 2018, we owned, operated or held interests in 637 theatres with a total of 8,114 screens in the United States and 369 theatres and 2,977 screens in European markets. With operations in 44 states and the District of Columbia, approximately 52% of the U.S. population lives within 10 miles of one of our theatres. We have a diversified footprint with complementary global geographic and guest demographic profiles, which we believe gives our circuit a unique profile and offers strategic and operational advantages. We operate productive theaters in the top markets in the United States and have the #1 market share in the top two markets: New York and Los Angeles. Our top five markets, in each of which we hold the #1 or #2 share position, are New York (44% share), Los Angeles (28%), Chicago (43%), San Francisco (25%) and Washington, D.C. (33%). Strategically, these markets and our theatres in them are diverse, operationally complex and, in many cases, the scarcity of new theatre opportunities creates a significant competitive advantage for established locations against newcomers or alternative entertainment options.
     Our theatrical exhibition revenues are generated primarily from box office admissions and theatre food and beverage sales. We offer consumers a broad range of entertainment alternatives including traditional film programming, independent and foreign films, performing arts, music and sports. We also offer food and beverage alternatives beyond traditional concession items, including made-to-order meals, customized coffee, healthy snacks, beer, wine, premium cocktails and dine-in theatre options. The balance of our revenues is generated from ancillary sources, including on‑screen advertising, fees earned from our AMC Stubs® customer loyalty program, rental of theatre auditoriums, income from gift card and exchange ticket sales, and on‑line ticketing fees.
     Approximately 359 million consumers have attended AMC, Odeon and Nordic theatre circuits, combined for the year ended December 31, 2018.

As a result of our ongoing focus to improve the quality of the movie-going experience, AMC theatres continue to maintain top-box customer satisfaction scores of nearly 60% and industry leading theatre productivity metrics. According to publicly available information for our most comparable peers in the U.S. market, for the year ended December 31, 2018, our U.S. markets were #1 or #2 in revenues per patron ($15.69), food and beverage per patron ($5.17), and average ticket price ($9.55). We believe that it is the quality of our theatre locations and our customer‑focused innovation that continue to drive improved productivity per location (which we measure as increases in admissions revenues per screen relative to the industry and/or food and beverage revenues per patron).
     To ensure that we are an imaginative and bold innovator today and in the years ahead, we have established the following key priorities.
    
· | Through our marketing programs we plan to strengthen the bonds with our current guests and create new connections with potential guests, to drive more attendance and increase market share. Our focus is to capture guests’ attention before they even leave their homes by paying close attention to our brands, our loyalty program and our communication with movie-goers via the internet, either directly or through social media;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We plan to continue investing in technical innovation that will allow us to enhance the consumer experience through premium formats such as IMAX®, Dolby Cinema™, 3D and other premium format offerings. Additionally, in recognizing the varied tastes of our guests we will continue to explore offerings of alternative content such as live concerts, sporting events, Broadway shows, opera and other non‑traditional programming to provide incremental revenue;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We expect to continue deployment of our proven theatre innovations while simultaneously developing new concepts and initiatives that will elevate the movie-going experience at our theatres;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We are committed to deploying successful new technologies that will allow us to evolve even as consumers look to other ways to watch movies;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We plan for our growth to be driven through our guest‑focused strategy and will continue to explore growth through profitable acquisitions. We believe that acquisitions offer us additional opportunities to introduce our proven guest focused strategies to new movie-goers and will generate meaningful benefits to guests, associates, studio partners and our shareholders;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Studios, film makers and other institutions of the movie industry, whether in Hollywood or abroad, are valued partners with whom we must have cooperative and productive relationships; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We will continue to motivate our associates by generating pride in their employment at AMC. Because so much of our guest satisfaction is determined by the service delivery of our theatre teams, taking good care of our associates should translate in turn to their taking good care of our guests.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      We plan to continue investing in our theatres and upgrading the consumer experience to take greater advantage of incremental revenue-generating opportunities, primarily through an array of improved and differentiated customer experiences in (1) more comfort and convenience; (2) food and beverage; (3) engagement and loyalty; (4) sight and sound; and (5) targeted programming. The following table provides detail with respect to the geographic location of our theatrical exhibition circuit as of December 31, 2018:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Our historic growth also has been driven by a combination of organic growth and acquisition strategies, in addition to strategic alliances and partnerships that highlight our ability to capture innovation and value beyond the traditional exhibition space. For example:
        
· | In December 2013, NCM spun-off its Fathom Events (“Fathom”) business to a newly formed limited liability company AC JV, LLC (“AC JV”). AC JV focuses exclusively on alternative content programming, including live and pre-recorded concerts, sporting events and other non-film entertainment.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We hold an interest in Digital Cinema Implementation Partners, LLC (“DCIP”), a joint venture charged with implementing digital cinema in our theatres, which has allowed us to substantially complete our planned digital deployments.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We own an interest in Digital Cinema Distribution Coalition, LLC (“DCDC”), a joint venture with certain other exhibitors and film distributors. DCDC was formed to develop a satellite distribution network for feature films and other digital cinema content. As of December 31, 2018, all 637 of our U.S. theatre locations are equipped to receive content via the DCDC network. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | In 2017 and 2018, we made investments in Dreamscape Immersive, Inc. (“Dreamscape”) and Central Services Studios, Inc. (“Central Services Studios”) as a part of our virtual reality technologies strategy.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We have long-term agreements for screen advertising services with NCM and Screenvision. We believe that the reach, scope, and digital delivery capability of their network provides an effective platform for national, regional, and local advertisers to reach an engaged audience and we receive theatre access fees for participation in their network.

      Our Strategy
     We are committed to maintaining a leadership position in the exhibition industry by focusing on forward thinking initiatives for the benefit of our guests. Improving the guest experience remains at our core and is now supported by three strategic elements: (1) Enhance, (2) Engage and (3) Expand. Consistent with our history and culture of innovation, we believe our vision and relentless focus on these three elements, which apply strategic and marketing components to traditional theatrical exhibition, will drive our future success.
1) | Enhance
---+--------

      We plan to continue investing in our theatres and enhancing the consumer experience to take greater advantage of incremental revenue-generating opportunities, primarily through comfort and convenience innovations, imaginative food and beverage initiatives, and exciting PLF offerings. 
     Comfort and Convenience Innovations - Recliner seating is the key feature of our theatre renovations. We believe that maximizing comfort and convenience for our customers will be increasingly necessary to maintain and improve our relevance. These renovations, in conjunction with capital contributions from our landlords, involve stripping theatres to their basic structure in order to replace finishes throughout, upgrade the sight and sound experience, installing modernized points of sale and, most importantly, replacing traditional theatre seats with plush, electric recliners that allow customers to deploy a leg rest and fully recline at the push of a button. The quality improvement in the customer experience drives a 30% to 50% increase in attendance, on average, at these locations in their first-year post renovation. Our customers have responded favorably to the significant personal space gains from ample row depths, ability to recline or stretch their legs, extra-wide pillowed chaise and oversized armrests. The reseated theatres attract more midweek audiences than normal theatres and tend to draw more adults who pay higher ticket prices than teens or young children. Upon reopening a remodeled theatre, we typically increase the ticket price to reflect that enhanced consumer experience. Additionally, remodeled theatres tend to draw more adults who pay higher ticket prices than teens or young children, as well as more customers who upgrade their tickets to premium formats.
     We plan to continue investing in our theatres and upgrading the consumer experience to take greater advantage of incremental revenue-generating opportunities, primarily through an array of improved and differentiated customer experiences. These experiences include greater engagement and loyalty through world class marketing, a keen focus on the quality of on-screen presentation and programming content, more and faster deployment of comfort and convenience and food and beverage initiatives, all while developing and utilizing new technologies across these platforms for the benefit of our consumers.
     We also plan to open new-build theatres, explore profitable acquisitions, and expand through disciplined spot-acquisitions of single theatre locations. We believe new-build construction, spot-acquisitions, and other acquisitive activity offer us additional opportunities to introduce our proven guest focused strategies to new movie-goers and will generate meaningful benefits to guests, associates, studio partners and our shareholders.
    
As of December 31, 2018, we now feature recliner seating in approximately 345 theatres, including Dine-in-Theatres, totaling approximately 3,279 screens and representing 29.5% of total screens. By the end of 2019, we expect AMC theatres to operate 3,875 screens with recliner seating. Based on feedback from our guests, we believe there is universal appeal for the ample space, comfort and convenience of our powered recliners, and that appeal will translate 

 
  9

 
into additional attendance in new markets both domestically and in Europe. As such, deploying powered recliners will be an integral strategy in the former Carmike and Odeon circuits going forward as we are targeting approximately 43% of our total screens to be comprised of screens with recliner seating by the end of 2021.
     Rebalancing of the new supply-and-demand relationship created by recliner seating presents us two further opportunities to improve customer convenience and maximize operating results: open-source internet ticketing and reserved seating.
     Open-source internet ticketing makes AMC’s entire universe of seats (over 1.2 million as of December 31, 2018), for all our show times, as available as possible, on as many websites and mobile applications as possible. Our tickets are currently on sale over the internet, either directly or through mobile apps, at our own website and our mobile app and Fandango®, Movietickets.com®, and Atom Tickets. We believe increased online access is important because it captures customers’ purchase intent more immediately and directly than if we wait for their arrival at the theatre box office to make a purchase. Carefully monitoring internet pre-sales also lets us adjust capacity in real time, moving movies that are poised to over perform to larger capacity auditoriums or more additional auditoriums, thereby maximizing yield. During calendar 2018, our internet and mobile ticketing app services sold approximately 67 million tickets for AMC. 
     Reserved seating at some of AMC’s locations, allows our customers to choose a specific seat in advance of the movie. We believe that knowing there is a specifically chosen seat waiting for a show that promises to be a sellout is comforting to our customers and compels ticket purchases. 
     We believe the comfort and personal space gains from recliner seating, coupled with the immediacy of demand captured from open-source internet ticketing and the appeal of reserved seating make a powerful economic combination for us.
 Imaginative Food and Beverage Initiatives - Our deployment initiatives also apply to food and beverage enhancements. We have expanded our menu of enhanced food and beverage products to include meals, healthy snacks, premium beers, wine and mixed drinks and other gourmet products. We plan to invest across a spectrum of enhanced food and beverage formats, ranging from simple, less capital‑intensive food and beverage design improvements to the development of new dine‑in theatre options. We launched the AMC Feature Fare menu in 2017 to over 300 AMC brand locations with an additional 66 planned in 2019. This was the largest menu overall in AMC history. 
    
Our MacGuffins Bar and Lounges (“MacGuffins”) give us an opportunity to engage our over-21 customers. As of December 31, 2018, we offer alcohol in approximately 339 AMC theatres in the U.S. markets. We expect to increase that number to approximately 367 by the end of 2019. We believe there is ample opportunity to introduce premium beers, wines and liquors throughout the former Carmike and Odeon circuits, and we would like to install our alcohol service in as many theatres globally as we can. We will continue to work with state and local officials in the United States, and the necessary officials in Europe to expand the number of theatres with this appealing amenity. Due to our success in operating MacGuffins, we believe we can leverage our substantial experience when it comes to permitting, installing and commissioning these improvements.
    
In our reserved seat auditoriums, our innovative services allow for advance online ordering of concession items with an advance ticket order that, in certain theatres, is then delivered to the guest’s seat at a specified time of the guest’s choosing. We currently operate 52 theatres with the pre-order service. We are currently evaluating system compatibility and mobile application functionality to determine timing for deployment in Europe. 
    
The number of guests at domestic AMC theatres who are choosing to purchase a beverage or food item has increased from 64% of our attendance in 2011 to more than 71% in 2018. 
     Exciting Premium Large Format Offerings - PLF auditoriums generate our highest customer satisfaction scores, and we believe the investment in premium formats increases the value of the movie-going experience for our guests, ultimately leading to additional ticket revenue. To that end we are committed to investing in and expanding our offerings of the best sight and sound experiences through a combination of our partnerships with IMAX® and Dolby Cinema™ and the future development of our own proprietary PLF offering.
     IMAX®—IMAX® is one of the world’s leading entertainment technology companies, specializing in motion picture technologies and presentations. 

 
  10

 

     As of December 31, 2018, legacy AMC was the largest IMAX® exhibitor in the U.S., with 216 (3D enabled) IMAX® screens and a 51% market share. Each one of our IMAX® local installations is protected by geographic exclusivity, and as of December 31, 2018, our IMAX® screen count was 99% greater than our closest competitor. We also operate 25 IMAX® screens in Europe. We also will continue to expand our IMAX® relationship into former Carmike, Odeon, and Nordic theatres as we integrate all three of the circuits, further strengthening our position as the largest IMAX® exhibitor in the U.S. and growth as an IMAX® distributor in the United Kingdom and Europe.
     Dolby Cinema™ at AMC— Dolby Cinema™ at AMC offers a premium cinema offering for movie-goers that combined state‑of‑the‑art image and sound technologies with inspired theatre design and comfort. Dolby Cinema™ at AMC includes Dolby Vision™ laser projection and object‑oriented Dolby Atmos® audio technology, as well as AMC’s plush power reclining seats with seat transducers that vibrate with the action on screen.
    
In August 2016, we announced the acceleration of our Dolby Cinema™ at AMC deployment and as of December 31, 2018, we operated 127 Dolby Cinema™ at AMC auditoriums. The legacy AMC circuit expects to have 140 Dolby Cinema™ at AMC auditoriums operational by the end of 2019. We expect to expand deployment of our innovative Dolby Cinema™ at AMC auditoriums into former Carmike, Odeon, and Nordic locations as we integrate all circuits.
     Prime at AMC—We continue to add our private label PLF experience to many of our locations, with superior sight and sound technology and enhanced seating as contrasted with our traditional auditoriums. This proprietary PLF auditorium is branded Prime at AMC and offers an enhanced theatrical experience for movie-goers beyond our current core theatres, at a lower price premium than IMAX® or Dolby Cinema™ at AMC. Therefore, it may be especially relevant in smaller or more price sensitive markets. As of December 31, 2018, we operated 18 Prime at AMC screens.
    
2) | Engage
---+-------

      Marketing - AMC is engaging movie-goers marketing activities to strengthen the bonds with our current guests and create new connections with potential customers that drive both growth and loyalty. AMC Stubs® is a customer loyalty program which allows members to earn rewards, receive discounts and participate in exclusive members‑only offerings and services. It features both a traditional paid tier called AMC Stubs Premiere™ for a $15 annual membership fee and a non-paid tier called AMC Stubs Insider™. Both programs reward loyal guests for their patronage of AMC theatres. Rewards earned are redeemable on future purchases at AMC locations.
     On June 20, 2018, we announced the launch of AMC Stubs® A-List, a new tier of our AMC Stubs® loyalty program. This program offers guests admission to movies at AMC up to three times per week including multiple movies per day and repeat visits to already seen movies from $19.95 to $23.95 per month depending upon geographic market. AMC Stubs® A-List also includes premium offerings including IMAX®, Dolby Cinema™ at AMC, RealD, Prime and BigD. AMC Stubs® A-List members can book tickets on-line in advance and select specific seats at AMC Theatres with reserved seating.
     As of December 31, 2018, we had more than 17,300,000 member households enrolled in AMC Stubs® A-List, AMC Stubs Premiere™ and AMC Stubs Insider™ programs, combined. Our AMC Stubs® members represented approximately 35.4% of AMC U.S. markets attendance during the year ended December 31, 2018. We expect the number of member households to continue to increase over the next 24 to 36 months. We believe movie-goers want to be recognized and rewarded for attending our theatres and as a result, our new AMC Stubs® program is designed to strengthen guest loyalty, attract new guests and drive additional return visits. Our much larger database of identified movie-goers also provides us with additional insight into our customers’ movie preferences, and this enables us to have both a larger and a more targeted marketing effort to support our Hollywood studio partners. We intend to creatively mine this rapidly growing consumer database to increase sales and otherwise boost loyalty to AMC.
     Odeon currently has loyalty programs in all the major territories in which it operates. Odeon movie-goers can earn points for spending money at the theatre, and those points can be redeemed for tickets and concession items at a later date. Odeon currently has more than three million active members in these various loyalty programs. We are currently evaluating the Odeon loyalty programs to determine how best to reward our European movie-goers and heighten guest loyalty to drive additional attendance to Odeon theatres.

 Our marketing efforts are not limited to our loyalty program as we continue to improve our customer connections through our website and mobile app. We believe our competitive advantage of a robust and easy‑to‑use online and mobile presence combined with an effective loyalty program that provides better market intelligence to anticipate customer’s future behavior should allow us to capture incremental share of both entertainment dollars and time. 
     Additionally, to align guest expectations and cost structures across the broader U.S. platform comprised of legacy AMC and former Carmike theatres, on March 1, 2017 we announced a differentiated multi-brand strategy.  
    
During 2017, all Carmike theatres were re-branded to be part of the AMC theatres. Every AMC location now operates under one of the following AMC brands: 
    
· | AMC Theatres – AMC Amazing. Approximately 360 theatres, located primarily in larger, more urban markets, offering the AMC amazing experience through amenities such as recliner seating, MacGuffins bars, and PLF auditoriums like IMAX® at AMC, Dolby Cinema™ at AMC, and AMC’s proprietary PLF, “Prime at AMC.”
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | AMC Classic Theatres – America’s Hometown Theatres. Approximately 230 theatres, located primarily in smaller mid-sized and suburban markets, offering fun, friendly, amenities and menu items guests can depend on for a great movie-going experience with value in mind. Some AMC Classic theatres may include MacGuffins bars and Prime at AMC PLF auditoriums.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | AMC Dine-In Theatres – Movies with a Menu. Approximately 29 locations, equipped with full kitchens and MacGuffins full bars, will offer great experiences including full-service dining as well as delivery-to-seat of AMC’s menu and beverage offerings. Guests can enjoy a variety of fresh, hand-crafted menu items that rival anything they’d find at their local restaurant, as well as an exciting array of drinks and desserts.

      Inclusive Programming - Our core business is the exhibition of wide-release theatrical Hollywood movies, which distributors promote with significant mass market advertising. We complement this offering of broadly popular movies with more specialized content, seeking to ensure we have entertainment appealing to all audience segments.  For example, during the year ended December 31, 2018, AMC theatres exhibited 358 non-English language films which generated approximately $43.0 million of box office revenue.
     We believe we are a vital partner for Hollywood studios and for independent distributors because we generate more box office revenue per screen and provide stronger in theatre and online promotional exposure for their movies. To that end, we are committed to working with our studio partners to further innovation, exchange ideas and discover mutually beneficial ways to expand movie-going. 
    
3) | Expand
---+-------

      We intend to grow through the deployment of our strategic growth initiatives and will continue exploration of acquisitions. Our acquisition strategy combines discipline and purpose with a strong investment thesis for each transaction that we believe will drive value in the long term. 
     Disciplined new-build theatres and acquisitions expand the platform, whether domestically or internationally, upon which to further deploy our proven strategic initiatives while further diversifying AMC’s consumer base, leading to greater appeal for more films. 
     The additional scale achieved through new build theatres and acquisitions also serves to benefit AMC through global procurement savings and increased overhead efficiencies. We believe that expansion offers us additional opportunities to introduce our proven guest focused strategies to new movie-goers and will generate meaningful benefits to guests, associates, studio partners and our shareholders.
     We believe significant financial opportunities exist in our current portfolio of theatres both in the United States and in Europe, and we have a substantial pipeline of investments to exploit that offer incremental attendance-generating and revenue-generating prospects. By expanding through new-build development and acquisitions and deploying building-by-building solutions from a proprietary menu of proven, customer-endorsed comfort and convenience,

enhanced food and beverage, and premium sight and sound concepts, we believe we have the formula for continuing growth and success.
     Our Competitive Strengths
    
We believe we have the following competitive strengths:
    
Leading Market Share in Important, Affluent and Diverse Markets— Across the three biggest metropolitan markets in the United States—New York, Los Angeles and Chicago, representing 20% of the country’s total box office—we hold a 36% combined market share. As of December 31, 2018, we have theatres located in 24 of the top 25 U.S. markets, holding the #1 or #2 position in 21 of those 25 markets based on box office revenue. On any given weekend, nearly one-half of the top ten theatres for the #1 opening movie title in the United States are AMC theatres, according to data provided by Comscore. We are also the #1 theatre operator in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Italy, Norway, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, and Spain; the #2 operator in Portugal; and the #4 operator in Germany. We believe our strong presence in these top markets makes our theatres highly visible and therefore strategically more important to content providers, who rely on the large audiences and marketing momentum provided by major markets to drive opinion‑making and deliver a movie’s overall box office results.
     We have a diversified footprint with complementary global geographic and guest demographic profiles. There are inherent complexities in effectively and efficiently serving them. In some of our more densely populated major metropolitan markets, there is also a scarcity of attractive retail real estate opportunities. Taken together, these factors solidify our market share position. Further, our history and strong presence in these markets have created a greater opportunity to introduce our enhanced customer experience concepts and exhibit a broad array of programming and premium formats, all of which we believe drive higher levels of attendance and higher revenues at our theatres.
     Our domestic acquisitions further diversified our footprint with theatres located in complementary suburban and rural markets as well as in geographic areas of the United States like the southeast. Guests from different demographic and geographic profiles have different tastes in movies, and we believe by broadening our geographic base, we can help mitigate the impact of film genre volatility on our box office revenues.
     Well Located, Highly Productive Theatres—Our theatres are generally located in the top retail centers across the United States. We believe this provides for long-term visibility and higher productivity and is a key element in the success of our Enhanced Food and Beverage and More Comfort and Convenience initiatives. Our location strategy, combined with our strong major market presence, enable us to deliver industry-leading theatre-level productivity. During the year ended December 31, 2018, six of the ten highest grossing theatres in the United States were AMC theatres, according to data provided by Comscore. During the same period AMC’s U.S. markets average total revenues per theatre was approximately $6.3 million. This per unit productivity is important not only to content providers, but also to developers and landlords, for whom per location and per square foot sales numbers are critical measures. The net effect is a close relationship with the commercial real estate community, which often gives us first‑look and preferred tenant status on emerging opportunities.
     AMC Classic theatres are located primarily in smaller, suburban and rural markets, which affects total revenues per theatre. However, in general, theatres located in smaller suburban and rural markets tend to have less competition and a lower cost structure, and we believe when combined with our innovative strategic initiatives that productivity will improve.
     Many Odeon theatres share similar characteristics as AMC theatres in that they tend to be located in the top retail centers in major metropolitan markets with higher visibility. We believe that deploying our proven strategic initiatives in these markets will help drive attendance and greatly improve productivity. 
     The Nordic theatres are in larger and mid-sized cities and towns in affluent Northern Europe as well as in the Baltic region. The theatres are well maintained including some with AMC-like amenities already evident. With a modern, up-to-date circuit and very high market share, the Nordic theatres will require some investment but not nearly the amount expected for the Odeon theatres. Nordic has an ample pipeline of new-build and renovation opportunities already identified, and with some investment in our enhanced food and beverage and premium sight and sound initiatives, we believe there are ample growth opportunities.

 Selectively Participating in a Consolidating Industry—Throughout the last two decades, AMC has been an active participant in our industry’s consolidation. We intend to selectively explore acquisitions in the United States and internationally where the characteristics of the location, overall market and facilities further enhance the quality of our theatre portfolio. 
     Additionally, our focus on improving the customer experience and our strong relationships with landlords and developers have provided opportunities to expand our footprint in existing markets by acquiring competitors’ existing theatres at the end of their lease term at little or no cost. We believe that our More Comfort and Convenience and Enhanced Food and Beverage concepts have high appeal to landlords wanting to increase traffic and sales in their retail centers. These “spot acquisitions” have given us the ability to bolster our presence in existing markets at relatively low cost and more quickly (weeks, months) as compared to new builds (months, years).
     Substantial Operating Cash Flow—For the years ended December 31, 2018, December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, AMC’s net cash provided by operating activities totaled $523.2 million, $537.4 million, and $431.7 million, respectively. We believe that our strategic initiatives, highly productive theatre circuit and continued focus on cost control will enable us to generate sufficient cash flow provided by operating activities to execute our strategy, to grow our revenues, maintain our facilities, service our indebtedness, continue our stock repurchase plan and pay dividends to our stockholders.
     Experienced and Dynamic Team—Our senior management team, led by Adam Aron, President and Chief Executive Officer, has the expertise that we believe will be required to transform movie-going from a commodity to a differentiated entertainment experience. Our senior management team has experience operating both domestic and international theatres. A dynamic and balanced team of executives combines long-tenured leaders in operations, real estate and finance who contributed to building AMC’s hard-earned reputation for operations excellence with creative entertainment and restaurant industry executives in marketing, programming and food and beverage who bring to AMC business acumen and experience that support innovation in theatrical exhibition.
     With a technology platform in our Theatre Support Center that provides for real-time monitoring of AMC screens across the country and a workplace conducive to collaboration and teamwork, our management team has the organization well aligned with our strategy.
     Furthermore, we believe that our people, the nearly 40,200 AMC associates, constitute an essential strength of AMC. They strive to make movie-going experiences at AMC theatres always a treat. We create events and want our customers to always feel special at an AMC theatre. 
     Key Strategic Shareholder—Our key strategic shareholder, the Dalian Wanda Group Co. (“Wanda”), is one of the largest, privately-held conglomerates in China. Wanda is our single largest shareholder with a 50.01% ownership stake as of December 31, 2018. In addition to its core business as a prominent developer and owner of commercial real estate, Wanda also owns related businesses in entertainment, hospitality and retail. Wanda is the largest theatre exhibition operator in China through its controlling ownership interest in Wanda Cinema Line. The combined ownership and scale of AMC and Wanda Cinema Line has enabled us to enhance relationships and obtain better terms from important food and beverage, lighting and theatre supply vendors, and to expand our strategic partnerships with IMAX® and Dolby®. When our scale and Wanda’s growth are taken into account, we believe AMC is the most efficient and effective partner a content owner has. Wanda is controlled by its chairman, Mr. Jianlin Wang.
     Film Content
     Box office admissions are our largest source of revenue. We predominantly license “first-run” films from distributors owned by major film production companies and from independent distributors on a film-by-film and theatre-by-theatre basis. Film exhibition costs are accrued based on the applicable admissions revenues and estimates of the final settlement pursuant to our film licenses. These licenses typically state that rental fees are based on aggregate terms established prior to the opening of the picture. In certain circumstances and less frequently, our rental fees are based on a mutually agreed settlement upon the conclusion of the picture. In some European territories, rental fees are established on a weekly basis for the coming week’s percentage forecast. Some European licenses use a per capita agreement instead, paying a flat amount per ticket, where the sum is agreed in long-term agreements in advance of the film showing. Under an aggregate terms formula, we usually pay the distributor a specified percentage of box office gross or 

 
  14

 
pay based on a scale of percentages tied to different amounts of box office gross, or in Europe, we pay based on the number of weeks since release. The settlement process allows for negotiation based upon how a film actually performs. 
     During the 2018 calendar year, films licensed from our seven largest distributors based on revenues accounted for approximately 90% of our U.S. admissions revenues. In Europe, approximately 80% of our box office revenue came from films attributed to our six largest distributors. Our revenues attributable to individual distributors may vary significantly from year to year depending upon the commercial success of each distributor’s films in any given year.
    
Our revenues are dependent upon the timing and popularity of film releases by distributors. The most marketable films are usually released during the summer and the calendar year-end holiday seasons. Therefore, our business is highly seasonal, with higher attendance and revenues generally occurring during the summer months and holiday seasons. Our results of operations may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year.
     Food and beverage
     Food and beverage sales are our second largest source of revenue after box office admissions. Food and beverage items traditionally include popcorn, soft drinks, candy and hot dogs. Different varieties of food and beverage items are offered at our theatres based on preferences in the particular geographic region. Our traditional food and beverage strategy emphasizes prominent and appealing food and beverage offerings designed for rapid service and efficiency, including a customer friendly self-serve experience. We design our theatres to have more food and beverage capacity to make it easier to serve larger numbers of customers. Strategic placement of large food and beverage operations within theatres increases their visibility, aids in reducing the length of lines, allows flexibility to introduce new concepts and improves traffic flow around the food and beverage stands.
     To address recent consumer trends, we have expanded our menu of enhanced food and beverage products to include made-to-order drinks and meals, customized coffee, healthy snacks, premium beers, wine and mixed drinks and other gourmet products. We plan to continue investment across a spectrum of enhanced food and beverage formats, ranging from simple, less capital-intensive food and beverage design improvements to the development of new dine-in theatre options. The costs of these conversions in some cases are partially covered by investments from the theatre landlord. We currently operate 29 Dine-In Theatres that deliver chef-inspired menus with seat-side or delivery service to luxury recliners with tables. Our recent Dine-In Theatre concepts are designed to capitalize on the latest food service trend, the fast casual eating experience.
     Employees
     As of December 31, 2018, we employed 4,408 full-time and 35,754 part-time employees. We consider our employee relations to be good.
     Theatrical Exhibition Industry and Competition
     U.S. Markets
     Movie-going is embedded in the American social fabric. For over 100 years people young and old, of all races and socio-economic levels, have enjoyed the entertainment that motion pictures offer.
     In the United States, the movie exhibition business is large, stable and mature. While in any given calendar quarter the quantity and quality of movies can drive volatile results, box office revenues have generally advanced from 2009 to 2018. The industry’s best year ever, in terms of revenues, was 2018, with box office revenues of approximately $11.9 billion, an increase of approximately 6.9% from 2017 with 1.3 billion admissions in the U.S. and Canada. 
     The movie exhibition business has survived the booms and busts of economic cycles and has adapted to myriad changes in technology and customer behavior. There is great value for the entertainment dollar in movie-going, and no replacement has been invented for the escape and fun that a night at the movies represents.
     After decades of economic models driven by quantity (number of theatres, screens and seats), we believe it is the quality of the movie-going experience that will define future success. Whether through enhanced food and beverage options (Food and Beverage Kiosks, Marketplaces, Coke Freestyle®, MacGuffins or Dine-in Theatres), more comfort and convenience (recliner seating, open-source internet ticketing, reserved seating), engagement and loyalty (AMC 

 
  15

 
Stubs®, open-source internet ticketing, mobile apps, social media) or sight and sound (digital projectors, 3D, Dolby Cinema™ at AMC, other PLF screens or IMAX®), it is the ease of use and the amenities that these innovations bring to customers that we believe will drive sustained profitability in the years ahead. 
     The following table represents information about the U.S./Canada exhibition industry obtained from the National Association of Theatre Owners (“NATO”) and Box Office Mojo:
    
 | Box Office | | | | Average | | | 
 | Revenues | | Attendance | | Ticket | | Number of | Indoor 
Calendar Year | (in millions) | | (in millions) | | Price | | Theatres | Screens
2018 | $ | 11,858 | | 1,301 | | $ | 9.11 | 5,482 | 40,313
2017 | | 11,091 | | 1,236 | | | 8.97 | 5,398 | 39,651
2016 | | 11,372 | | 1,314 | | | 8.65 | 5,472 | 40,009
2015 | | 11,135 | | 1,321 | | | 8.43 | 5,484 | 39,411
2014 | | 10,353 | | 1,267 | | | 8.17 | 5,463 | 39,356
2013 | | 10,921 | | 1,343 | | | 8.13 | 5,326 | 39,368
2012 | | 10,837 | | 1,361 | | | 7.96 | 5,317 | 39,056
2011 | | 10,174 | | 1,283 | | | 7.93 | 5,331 | 38,974
2010 | | 10,566 | | 1,339 | | | 7.89 | 5,399 | 38,902
2009 | | 10,596 | | 1,413 | | | 7.50 | 5,561 | 38,605

     
Based on information obtained from Comscore, we believe that the four largest exhibitors, in terms of U.S./Canada box office revenue (Regal Entertainment Group, AMC, Cinemark Holdings, Inc. and Cineplex Inc.) generated approximately 64% of the box office revenues in 2018. This statistic is up from 35% in 2000 and is evidence that the theatrical exhibition business in the U.S. / Canada has been consolidating.
    
International Markets
     Movie-going is a popular leisure activity with high penetration across Odeon’s and Nordic’s key geographies. Theatre appeal has proven resilient to competition for consumers’ leisure spending and to recessionary periods and we believe we will continue to benefit from increased spending across international markets. The European market lags the U.S. market across a number of factors, including annual spend per customer, number of IMAX® screens and screens per capita that cause us to believe that the deployment of our customer initiatives will be successful in these markets. On the other hand, our European markets are more densely populated and operate with fewer screens per one million of population, making the screens we acquired more valuable.
    
Additionally, international markets have become increasingly important. The percentage of total box office revenues attributable to International markets increased from 69% in 2012 to 73% in 2017. U.S. films generate the majority of the box office in Europe, but movie-goers in specific geographies welcome locally produced films with local actors and familiar story lines which can mitigate film genre attendance fluctuations. Going forward, we believe we will see positive growth in theatre attendance as we deploy our proven guest centered innovations like recliner seating, enhanced food and beverage offerings and premium large format experiences. 
     Our theatres are subject to varying degrees of competition in the geographic areas in which they operate. Competition is often intense with respect to attracting patrons, licensing motion pictures and finding new theatre sites. Where real estate is readily available, it is easier to open a theatre near one of our theatres, which may adversely affect operations at our theatre. However, in certain of our densely populated major metropolitan markets, we believe a scarcity of attractive retail real estate opportunities enhances the strategic value of our existing theatres. We also believe the complexity inherent in operating in these major metropolitan markets is a deterrent to other less sophisticated competitors, protecting our market share position.
     The theatrical exhibition industry faces competition from other forms of out-of-home entertainment, such as concerts, amusement parks and sporting events, and from other distribution channels for filmed entertainment, such as cable television, pay-per-view, video streaming services, and home video systems, as well as from all other forms of entertainment.
    
 
  16

 

 Movie-going is a compelling consumer out-of-home entertainment experience. Movie theatres currently garner a relatively small share of overall consumer entertainment time and spend, leaving significant room for further expansion and growth in the United States and internationally. In addition, our industry benefits from available capacity to satisfy additional consumer demand without capital investment.
     Regulatory Environment
     The distribution of motion pictures is, in large part, regulated by federal and state antitrust laws and has been the subject of numerous antitrust cases. The consent decrees, resulting from one of those cases to which we were not a party, have a material impact on the industry and us. Those consent decrees bind certain major motion picture distributors and require the motion pictures of such distributors to be offered and licensed to exhibitors, including us, on a film-by-film and theatre-by-theatre basis. Consequently, we cannot assure ourselves of a supply of motion pictures by entering into long-term arrangements with major distributors, but must compete for our licenses on a film-by-film and theatre-by-theatre basis.
     Our theatres in the United States must comply with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act, or ADA. Compliance with the ADA requires that public accommodations, including websites and mobile apps for such accommodations, “reasonably accommodate” individuals with disabilities and that new construction or alterations made to “commercial facilities” conform to accessibility guidelines unless “structurally impracticable” for new construction or technically infeasible for alterations. Non-compliance with the ADA could result in the imposition of injunctive relief, fines, and awards of damages to private litigants or additional capital expenditures to remedy such noncompliance. As an employer covered by the ADA, we must make reasonable accommodations to the limitations of employees and qualified applicants with disabilities, provided that such reasonable accommodations do not pose an undue hardship on the operation of our business. In addition, many of our employees are covered by various government employment regulations, including minimum wage, overtime and working conditions regulations. In Europe, all territories have similar national regulations relating to disabilities.
     Our operations also are subject to federal, state and local laws regulating such matters as construction, renovation and operation of theatres as well as wages and working conditions, citizenship, health and sanitation requirements and licensing. We believe our theatres are in material compliance with such requirements.
     We own and operate theatres and other properties that operate in the United States, United Kingdom, Spain, Italy, Germany, Portugal, Ireland, Sweden, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, and Denmark, which are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations. Certain of these laws and regulations, including those relating to environmental protection, may impose joint and several liability on certain statutory classes of persons for the costs of investigation or remediation of contamination, regardless of fault or the legality of original disposal. We believe our theatres are in material compliance with such requirements.
     Other Acquisitions, Dispositions, Financings and Developments
     Other Acquisitions 
     During the year ended December 31, 2018, we entered into a Stock Issuance and Restrictions Agreement with RealD Holdings Inc. (“RealD”). The new agreement replaces a similar agreement with RealD for the lease of RealD 3D systems where rental payments continue to be variable and based on paid admissions and extends the term of the agreement to December 31, 2024. The investments are recorded at cost following the measurement alternative as there is no established market for the securities and we do not have significant influence over these entities.
     In September 2017, we acquired $5.0 million in Dreamscape and $5.0 million in Central Services Studios, Inc. as part of our virtual reality technologies strategy. During January 2018, we invested an additional $5.0 million in Dreamscape and $5.0 million in Central Services Studios. We do not have significant influence over these entities and will follow the cost method of accounting.
     Other Dispositions
    
On June 18, 2018, we entered into two Unit Purchase Agreements (the “Agreements”) with each of Regal and Cinemark pursuant to which Regal and Cinemark each separately agreed to purchase 10,738,740 common units of NCM 

 
  17

 
at a sales price of $7.30 per unit and aggregate consideration of approximately $156.8 million (the “Sales”). The Sales closed on July 5, 2018. Following the closing of the Sales, we no longer owned any shares of common stock in NCM, Inc. or common units in NCM. NCM consented to the Sales and waived its rights under the memorandum of understanding that provided AMC would not reduce its combined ownership of NCM and NCM, Inc. below 4.5%. We recorded a $28.9 million gain on the sale of its NCM investment during the year ended December 31, 2018.
     On August 4, 2017, AMC and Regal Entertainment Group consummated a transaction for the sale of all the issued and outstanding ownership interests in Open Road Releasing, LLC (“Open Road”) for total proceeds of $28.8 million of which we received $14.0 million in net proceeds after transaction expenses for our 50% investment and for collection of amounts due from Open Road and recognized a gain on sale of $17.2 million.
     In the second quarter of 2017 and in the fourth quarter of 2016, in connection with the Carmike acquisition, we divested 17 theatres as required by the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice. See Part I – Recent Developments for further information.
     Debt Financing of Acquisitions
     On March 17, 2017, we completed an offering of $475.0 million aggregate principal amount of our Senior Subordinated Notes due 2027 (the “Notes due 2027”). We capitalized deferred financing costs of approximately $19.8 million, related to the issuance of the Notes due 2027. The Notes due 2027 mature on May 15, 2027. We will pay interest on the Notes due 2027 at 6.125% per annum, semi-annually in arrears on May 15th and November 15th, commencing on November 15, 2017. We used the net proceeds from the Notes due 2027 private offering, together with a portion of the net proceeds from the Sterling Notes due 2024 (see below) to pay a portion of the consideration for the acquisition of Nordic plus related transaction fees and expenses.
     On March 17, 2017, we completed an offering of £250.0 million additional aggregate principal amount of our Sterling Notes due 2024 and an offering of £250.0 million additional aggregate principal amount of our Sterling Notes due 2024. We used the net proceeds to pay a portion of the consideration for the acquisition of Nordic plus related transaction fees and expenses.
     On December 21, 2016, in connection with the Carmike acquisition, we incurred $350.0 million of bridge loans (the “Bridge Loans”) under a Bridge Loan Agreement, dated as of December 21, 2016 (the “Bridge Loan Agreement”). We repaid the Bridge Loans on February 13, 2017, with a portion of the net proceeds from our additional public offering. 
     On November 8, 2016, in connection with the Carmike and Odeon acquisitions, we issued $595.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.875% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2026 and £250.0 million ($310.0 million) of our 6.375% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2024. On November 29, 2016, in connection with the Odeon acquisition, we borrowed $500.0 million of incremental term loans under our Credit Agreement, dated as of April 30, 2013 as amended.
     See the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of Item 7 of Part II hereof for further information and Note 8 – Corporate Borrowings and Capital and Financing Lease Obligations in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8, hereof for further information.
     Seasonality
     Our revenues are dependent upon the timing of motion picture releases by distributors. The most marketable motion pictures are usually released during the summer and the year-end holiday seasons. Therefore, our business is highly seasonal, with higher attendance and revenues generally occurring during the summer months and holiday seasons. Our results of operations may vary significantly from quarter to quarter.     Available Information
