ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

HEI Consolidated
HEI and subsidiaries and lines of business.  HEI is a holding company with its subsidiaries principally engaged in electric utility, banking, and renewable/sustainable infrastructure investment businesses operating in the State of Hawaii. HEI was incorporated in 1981 under the laws of the State of Hawaii. HEI’s predecessor, Hawaiian Electric, was incorporated under the laws of the Kingdom of Hawaii (now the State of Hawaii) on October 13, 1891. As a result of a 1983 corporate reorganization, Hawaiian Electric became an HEI subsidiary and common shareholders of Hawaiian Electric became common shareholders of HEI. As a holding company with no significant operations of its own, HEI’s sources of funds are dividends or other distributions from its operating subsidiaries, borrowings, and sales of equity. The rights of HEI and its creditors and shareholders to participate in any distribution of the assets of any of HEI’s subsidiaries are subject to the prior claims of the creditors and preferred shareholders of such subsidiary, except to the extent that claims of HEI in its capacity as a creditor are recognized as primary. The abilities of certain of HEI’s subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to HEI are subject to contractual and regulatory restrictions (see Note 13 of the Consolidated Financial Statements). HEI is headquartered in Honolulu, Hawaii and has three reportable segments—Electric utility, Bank, and Other.
Electric Utility. Hawaiian Electric and its operating utility subsidiaries, Hawaii Electric Light Company, Inc. (Hawaii Electric Light) and Maui Electric Company, Limited (Maui Electric), are regulated electric public utilities that provide essential electric service to approximately 95% of Hawaii’s population through the operation of five separate grids that serve communities on the islands of Oahu, Hawaii, and Maui, Lanai and Molokai. Hawaiian Electric’s mission is to provide innovative energy leadership for Hawaii, to meet the needs and expectations of customers and communities, and to empower them with affordable, reliable and clean energy. The goal is to create a modern, flexible and dynamic electric grid that enables an optimal mix of distributed energy resources (such as private rooftop solar and battery storage), demand response, and grid-scale resources to achieve the statutory goal of 100% renewable energy by 2045. See also “Electric utility” section below. 
Bank. HEI acquired American Savings Bank, F.S.B. (ASB) in 1988. ASB is one of the largest financial institutions in the State of Hawaii (based on total assets), with assets totaling approximately $7.0 billion as of December 31, 2018. ASB provides a wide array of banking and other financial services to consumers and businesses. See also “Bank” section below.
Other. The “Other” segment comprises HEI’s corporate-level operating, general and administrative expenses and the results of Pacific Current, LLC (Pacific Current). Pacific Current was formed in September 2017 to focus on investing in non-regulated renewable energy and sustainable infrastructure in the State of Hawaii to help reach the state’s sustainability goals. See also “Electric utility - Hawaii Electric Light firm capacity PPAs” section below and Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on Pacific Current activities. The “Other” segment also includes ASB Hawaii, Inc. (ASB Hawaii) (a holding company, formerly known as American Savings Holdings, Inc.), which owns ASB, and The Old Oahu Tug Service, Inc. (TOOTS), which administers certain employee and retiree-related benefit programs and monitors matters related to its predecessor’s former maritime freight transportation operations.
Termination of proposed Merger. For information concerning the termination of HEI’s Merger Agreement with NextEra Energy, Inc., see Note 16 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Additional information.  For additional information about HEI, see HEI’s MD&A, HEI’s “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” and HEI’s Consolidated Financial Statements.
The Company’s website address is www.hei.com, where annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to those reports (last 10 years) are made available free of charge in the Investor Relations section as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC (and available at the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov). The information on the Company’s website is not incorporated by reference in this annual report on Form 10-K unless, and except to the extent, specifically incorporated herein by reference. HEI and Hawaiian Electric intend to continue to use HEI’s website as a means of disclosing additional information. Accordingly, investors should routinely monitor such portions of HEI’s website, in addition to following HEI’s, Hawaiian Electric’s and ASB’s press releases, SEC filings and public conference calls and webcasts. Investors may also wish to refer to the PUC website at dms.puc.hawaii.gov/dms in order to review documents filed with and issued by the PUC. No information at the PUC website is incorporated herein by reference.
Regulation.  HEI and Hawaiian Electric are each holding companies within the meaning of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 and implementing regulations, which requires holding companies and their subsidiaries to grant the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) access to books and records relating to FERC’s jurisdictional rates. FERC 
1

granted HEI and Hawaiian Electric a waiver from its record retention, accounting and reporting requirements, effective May 2006.
HEI is subject to an agreement entered into with the PUC (the PUC Agreement) which, among other things, requires PUC approval of any change in control of HEI. The PUC Agreement also requires HEI to provide the PUC with periodic financial information and other reports concerning intercompany transactions and other matters. It also prohibits the electric utilities from loaning funds to HEI or its nonutility subsidiaries and from redeeming common stock of the electric utility subsidiaries without PUC approval. Further, the PUC could limit the ability of the electric utility subsidiaries to pay dividends on their common stock. See also Note 13 of the Consolidated Financial Statements and “Electric utility—Regulation” below.
HEI and ASB Hawaii are subject to Federal Reserve Board (FRB) regulation, supervision and reporting requirements as savings and loan holding companies. As a result of the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, supervision and regulation of HEI and ASB Hawaii, as thrift holding companies, moved to the FRB, and supervision and regulation of ASB, as a federally chartered savings bank, moved to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) in July 2011. In the event the OCC has reasonable cause to believe that any activity of HEI or ASB Hawaii constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of ASB, the OCC is authorized to impose certain restrictions on HEI, ASB Hawaii and/or any of their subsidiaries. Possible restrictions include precluding or limiting: (i) the payment of dividends by ASB; (ii) transactions between ASB, HEI or ASB Hawaii, and their subsidiaries or affiliates; and (iii) any activities of ASB that might expose ASB to the liabilities of HEI and/or ASB Hawaii and their other affiliates. See also Note 13 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (Gramm Act) permitted banks, insurance companies and investment firms to compete directly against each other, thereby allowing “one-stop shopping” for an array of financial services. Although the Gramm Act further restricted the creation of so-called “unitary savings and loan holding companies” (i.e., companies such as HEI whose subsidiaries include one or more savings associations and one or more nonfinancial subsidiaries), the unitary savings and loan holding company relationship among HEI, ASB Hawaii and ASB is “grandfathered” under the Gramm Act so that HEI and its subsidiaries will be able to continue to engage in their current activities so long as ASB maintains its qualified thrift lender (QTL) status test discussed under “Bank—Regulation—Qualified thrift lender test.” ASB met the QTL test at all times during 2018; however, the failure of ASB to satisfy the QTL test in the future could result in a need for HEI to divest ASB. Under the Gramm Act, any proposed sale of ASB would have to satisfy applicable statutory and regulatory requirements and potential acquirers of ASB would most likely be limited to companies that are already qualified as, or capable of qualifying as, either a traditional savings and loan association holding company or a bank holding company, or as one of the authorized financial holding companies permitted under the Gramm Act. 
HEI is also affected by provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act relating to corporate governance and executive compensation, including provisions requiring shareholder “say on pay” and “say on pay frequency” votes, mandating additional disclosures concerning executive compensation and compensation consultants and advisors and further restricting proxy voting by brokers in the absence of instructions. See “Bank—Legislation and regulation” in HEI’s MD&A for a discussion of effects of the Dodd-Frank Act on HEI and ASB.
Environmental regulation.  HEI and its subsidiaries are subject to federal and state statutes and governmental regulations pertaining to water quality, air quality and other environmental factors. See the “Environmental regulation” discussions in the “Electric utility” and “Bank” sections below.
Employees.  The Company had full-time employees as follows:
December 31 | 2018 | 2017 | 2016 | 2015 | 2014 
HEI | 46 | 41 | 41 | 39 | 44 
Hawaiian Electric and its subsidiaries | 2,704 | 2,724 | 2,662 | 2,727 | 2,759
ASB | 1,148 | 1,115 | 1,093 | 1,152 | 1,162
 | 3,898 | 3,880 | 3,796 | 3,918 | 3,965

The employees of HEI and its direct and indirect subsidiaries, other than the electric utilities, are not covered by any collective bargaining agreement. The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 1260 represents roughly half of the Utilities’ workforce covered by a collective bargaining agreement that expires on October 31, 2021.
Properties.  HEI leases office space from nonaffiliated lessors in downtown Honolulu under leases that expire in December 2022. See “Electric Utility” and “Bank” sections for a description of properties they own and lease.
Hamakua Energy, LLC owns a total of approximately 93 acres located on the Hamakua coast on the island of Hawaii. Its power plant is situated on approximately 59 acres and the remaining 34 acres includes surrounding parcels of which 30 acres are located on the ocean front.

Electric utility
Hawaiian Electric and subsidiaries and service areas.  Hawaiian Electric, Hawaii Electric Light and Maui Electric (Utilities) are regulated operating electric public utilities engaged in the production, purchase, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity on the islands of Oahu; Hawaii; and Maui, Lanai and Molokai, respectively. In 2018, the electric utilities’ revenues and net income amounted to approximately 89% and 71% respectively, of HEI’s consolidated revenues and net income, compared to approximately 88% and 73% in 2017 and approximately 88% and 57% (impacted by a merger termination fee and other impacts at HEI corporate) in 2016, respectively.
The islands of Oahu, Hawaii, Maui, Lanai and Molokai have a combined population estimated at 1.4 million, or approximately 95% of the total population of the State of Hawaii, and comprise a service area of 5,815 square miles. The principal communities served include Honolulu (on Oahu), Hilo and Kona (on Hawaii) and Wailuku and Kahului (on Maui). The service areas also include numerous suburban communities, resorts, U.S. Armed Forces installations and agricultural operations. The state has granted Hawaiian Electric, Hawaii Electric Light and Maui Electric nonexclusive franchises, which authorize the Utilities to construct, operate and maintain facilities over and under public streets and sidewalks. Each of these franchises will continue in effect for an indefinite period of time until forfeited, altered, amended or repealed.

Regulatory mechanisms. Each of the three utilities’ rates is reset on a triennial cycle. The regulatory framework includes a number of mechanisms designed to provide utility financial stability during the transition toward the state’s 100% renewable energy goals. For example, under the sales decoupling mechanism, the utilities are allowed to recover from customers, target test year revenues, independent of the level of kilowatt-hour (kWh) sales, which have declined as privately-owned distributed energy resources have been added to the grid and energy efficiency measures have been put into place. A summary of these regulatory mechanisms is as follows:

Mechanism | Description 
Sales decoupling | Provides predictable revenue stream by fixing net revenues at the level approved in last rate case (revenues not linked to kWh sales) 
Revenue adjustment mechanism (RAM) | Annually adjusts revenue to recover general inflation of operations and maintenance expenses and baseline plant additions between rate cases 
Major Projects Interim Recovery adjustment mechanism (MPIR) | Reduces regulatory lag and permits recovery through the revenue balancing account (RBA) of costs (net of benefits) for major capital projects including, but not restricted to, projects to advance renewable energy 
Energy cost and purchased power recovery/adjustment clauses | Allows for timely recovery of fuel and purchased power costs to reduce earnings volatility. Symmetrical fossil fuel cost risk sharing (98% customer/2% utility) mechanism established for Hawaiian Electric (Oahu) and utility upside/downside capped at $2.5 million (beginning in 2019)
Pension and post-employment benefit trackers | Allow tracking of pension and post-employment benefit costs and contributions above or below the cost included in rates in a separate regulatory asset/liability account 
Renewable energy infrastructure program | Permits recovery of renewable energy infrastructure projects through a surcharge 

Seasonality.  kWh sales of the Utilities follow a seasonal pattern, but they do not experience extreme seasonal variations due to extreme weather variations experienced by some electric utilities on the U.S. mainland. kWh sales in Hawaii tend to increase in the warmer, more humid months as a result of increased demand for air conditioning, and with cloudy and rainy weather due to lower production by privately owned customer generated PV systems.
Significant customers.  The Utilities derived approximately 11% of their operating revenues in 2018, 2017 and 2016 from the sale of electricity to various federal government agencies. Hawaiian Electric continues to work with various federal agencies to implement measures that will help them achieve their energy reduction and renewable energy objectives.

Hawaii Electric Light also has a firm capacity PPA with PGV for 34.6 MW. However, since May 2018, PGV has been offline due to lava flow on Hawaii Island; therefore, PGV’s capability has not been incorporated into the utility’s firm contract power capability as of December 31, 2018.

Generating reliability and reserve margin.  Hawaiian Electric serves the island of Oahu and Hawaii Electric Light serves the island of Hawaii. Maui Electric has three separate electrical systems—one each on the islands of Maui, Molokai and Lanai. Hawaiian Electric, Hawaii Electric Light and Maui Electric have isolated electrical systems that are not currently interconnected to each other or to any other electrical grid and, thus, each maintains a higher level of reserve generation and cost structure than is typically carried by interconnected mainland U.S. utilities, which are able to share reserve capacity. These higher levels of reserve margins are required to meet peak electric demands, to provide for scheduled maintenance of generating units (including the units operated by IPPs relied upon for firm capacity) and to allow for the forced outage of the largest generating unit in the system.
Nonutility generation.  The Utilities have supported state and federal energy policies which encourage the development of renewable energy sources that reduce the use of fuel oil as well as the development of qualifying facilities. The Utilities’ renewable energy sources and potential sources range from wind, solar, photovoltaic, geothermal, wave and hydroelectric power to energy produced by the municipal waste and other biofuels.
The rate schedules of the electric utilities contain ECACs (replaced with the ECRCs for Hawaiian Electric and Hawaii Electric Light in 2019) and PPACs that allow them to recover costs of fuel and purchase power expenses. 
In addition to the firm capacity PPAs described below, the electric utilities also purchase energy on an as-available basis directly from nonutility generators and through its Feed-In Tariff programs. The electric utilities also receive renewable energy from customers under its Net Energy Metering and Customer Grid Supply programs.
The PUC has allowed rate recovery for the firm capacity and purchased energy costs for the electric utilities’ approved firm capacity and as-available energy PPAs.
Hawaiian Electric firm capacity PPAs.  Hawaiian Electric currently has three major PPAs that provide a total of 456.5 MW of firm capacity, representing 26% of Hawaiian Electric’s total net generating and firm purchased capacity on the Island of Oahu as of December 31, 2018.

In March 1988, Hawaiian Electric entered into a PPA with AES Hawaii, Inc. (AES Hawaii), a Hawaii-based, indirect subsidiary of The AES Corporation. The agreement with AES Hawaii, as amended (through Amendment No. 2), provides that, for a period of 30 years beginning September 1992, Hawaiian Electric will purchase 180 megawatts (MW) of firm capacity. The AES Hawaii coal-fired cogeneration plant utilizes a “clean coal” technology and is designed to sell sufficient steam to be a “Qualifying Facility” (QF) under the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA). See “Commitments and contingencies–Power purchase agreements–AES Hawaii, Inc.” in Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for an update regarding this PPA. 
Under a 1988 PPA, as amended, Hawaiian Electric is committed to purchase 208 MW of firm capacity from Kalaeloa Partners, L.P. (Kalaeloa). The Kalaeloa facility, which is a QF, is a combined-cycle operation, consisting of two oil-fired combustion turbines burning low sulfur fuel oil (LSFO) and a steam turbine that utilizes waste heat from the combustion turbines. Hawaiian Electric and Kalaeloa are currently in negotiations to address the PPA term that ended on May 23, 2016. The PPA automatically extends on a month-to-month basis as long as the parties are still negotiating in good faith, but would end 60 days after either party notifies the other in writing that negotiations have terminated. Hawaiian Electric and Kalaeloa have agreed that neither party will terminate the PPA prior to October 31, 2019. This agreement contemplates continued negotiations between the parties and accounts for time needed for PUC approval of a negotiated resolution.
Hawaiian Electric also entered into a PPA in March 1986 and a firm capacity amendment in April 1991 with the City and County of Honolulu with respect to a refuse-fired plant (HPOWER). Under the PPA, as amended and restated, Hawaiian Electric is committed to purchase 68.5 MW of firm capacity annually through April 2033.
Hawaii Electric Light firm capacity PPAs.  Hawaii Electric Light has two major PPAs that provide a total of 94.6 MW of firm capacity, representing 34% of Hawaii Electric Light’s total net generating and firm purchased capacity on the Island of Hawaii as of December 31, 2018. 
Hawaii Electric Light has a 35-year PPA, as amended, with Puna Geothermal Venture (PGV) for 34.6 MW of firm capacity from its geothermal steam facility, which will expire on December 31, 2027. Since May 2018, PGV facility has been offline due to lava flow on Hawaii Island. PGV is committed to restoring their facility to commercial operation and is currently in discussion with Hawaii Electric Light to rebuild the Pohoiki substation and transmission lines affected by the lava flow.
In October 1997, Hawaii Electric Light entered into an agreement with Encogen, which was succeeded by Hamakua Energy Partners, L. P. (HEP). The agreement requires Hawaii Electric Light to purchase up to 60 MW (net) of firm capacity for a period of 30 years, expiring on December 31, 2030. The dual-train combined-cycle (DTCC) facility, which primarily burns naphtha (a mixture of liquid hydrocarbons), consists of two oil-fired combustion turbines and a steam turbine that utilizes waste heat from the combustion turbines. In November 2017, Hamakua Energy, LLC, an indirect subsidiary of HEI, purchased the plant from HEP. 
In May 2012, Hawaii Electric Light signed a PPA with Hu Honua Bioenergy, LLC (Hu Honua) for 21.5 MW of renewable, dispatchable firm capacity fueled by locally grown biomass on the island of Hawaii. This PPA was approved by the PUC in December 2013. See “Commitments and contingencies–Power purchase agreements–Hu Honua Bioenergy, LLC” in Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for an update regarding this PPA. 
Maui Electric firm capacity PPAs.  Maui Electric has no firm capacity PPAs. 
Fuel oil usage and supply.  The rate schedules of the Utilities include ECACs (replaced with ECRCs for Hawaiian Electric and Hawaii Electric Light in 2019) under which electric rates (and consequently the revenues of the electric utility subsidiaries generally) are adjusted for changes in the weighted-average price paid for fuel oil and certain components of purchased power, and the relative amounts of company-generated power and purchased power. See discussion of rates and issues relating to the ECAC below under “Rates,” and “Electric utility—Material estimates and critical accounting policies–Revenues” in HEI’s MD&A.
Hawaiian Electric’s steam generating units consume low sulfur fuel oil (LSFO) and Hawaiian Electric’s combustion turbine peaking units consume diesel, including Hawaiian Electric’s Campbell Industrial Park generating facility which recently converted from B99 grade biodiesel to diesel.
Hawaii Electric Light’s and Maui Electric’s steam generating units burn industrial fuel oil (IFO) and Hawaii Electric Light’s and Maui Electric’s Maui combustion turbine generating units burn diesel. Hawaii Electric Light’s and Maui Electric’s Maui, Molokai, and Lanai diesel engine generating units burn ultra-low-sulfur diesel. 
See the fuel oil commitments information set forth in the “Fuel contracts” section in Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The following table sets forth the average cost of fuel oil used by Hawaiian Electric, Hawaii Electric Light and Maui Electric to generate electricity in 2018, 2017 and 2016:

 | Hawaiian Electric | Hawaii Electric Light | | Maui Electric | Consolidated
 | $/Barrel | ¢/MBtu | | $/Barrel | ¢/MBtu | $/Barrel | | ¢/MBtu | $/Barrel | ¢/MBtu
2018 | 86.11 | | 1,371.8 | | 89.81 | | 1,489.5 | | 93.60 | | 1,573.6 | 87.90 | 1,420.2
2017 | 67.96 | | 1,087.1 | | 68.02 | | 1,125.2 | | 72.29 | | 1,214.6 | 68.78 | 1,114.3
2016 | 51.30 | | 815.2 | | 53.27 | | 876.9 | | 62.21 | | 1,048.6 | 53.49 | 862.3 

The average per-unit cost of fuel oil consumed to generate electricity for Hawaiian Electric, Hawaii Electric Light and Maui Electric reflects a different volume mix of fuel types and grades as follows:

 | Hawaiian Electric | Hawaii Electric Light | | Maui Electric
 | % LSFO | | % Biodiesel/Diesel | | % IFO | % Diesel | % IFO | % Diesel
2018 | 96 | | 4 | | 39 | 61 | 23 | 77 
2017 | 95 | | 5 | | 43 | 57 | 23 | 77 
2016 | 97 | | 3 | | 49 | 51 | 19 | 81 

The prices that Hawaiian Electric, Hawaii Electric Light and Maui Electric pay for purchased energy from certain older nonutility generators are generally linked to the price of oil. The AES Hawaii energy prices vary primarily with an inflation index. The energy prices for Kalaeloa, which purchases LSFO from Par Hawaii Refining, LLC (PAR), vary primarily with the price of Asian crude oil. A portion of PGV energy prices are based on the electric utilities’ respective short-run avoided energy cost rates (which vary with their composite fuel costs), subject to minimum floor rates specified in their approved PPA. Hamakua Energy energy prices vary primarily with the cost of naphtha.
The Utilities estimate that 66% of the net energy they generate will come from fossil fuel oil in 2019 compared to 68% in 2018. Hawaiian Electric generally maintains an average system fuel inventory level equivalent to 47 days of forward consumption. Hawaii Electric Light and Maui Electric generally maintain an average system fuel inventory level equivalent to approximately one month’s supply of both IFO and diesel. The PPAs with AES Hawaii and Hamakua Energy require that they maintain certain minimum fuel inventory levels.
Since the Hawaii Clean Energy initiative was launched in 2008, liquid fuel consumption has continued to steadily decline. The liquid fuel consumption in 2018 was about 2.1 million barrels less than that consumed in 2008.
Rates.  Hawaiian Electric, Hawaii Electric Light and Maui Electric are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the PUC with respect to rates, issuance of securities, accounting and certain other matters. See “Regulation” below.
General rate increases require the prior approval of the PUC after public and contested case hearings. Rates for Hawaiian Electric and its subsidiaries include ECACs (replaced with the ECRCs for Hawaiian Electric and Hawaii Electric Light in 2019), and PPACs. Under current law and practices, specific and separate PUC approval is not required for each rate change pursuant to automatic rate adjustment clauses previously approved by the PUC. PURPA requires the PUC to periodically review the adjustment clauses related to energy cost of electric and gas utilities in the state, and such clauses, as well as the rates charged by the utilities generally, are subject to change. PUC approval is also required for all surcharges and adjustments before they are reflected in rates.
See “Electric utility–Most recent rate proceedings,” and “Electric utility–Material estimates and critical accounting policies–Revenues” in HEI’s MD&A and “Interim increases” and “Utility projects” under “Commitments and contingencies” in Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Competition.  See “Electric utility–Competition” in HEI’s MD&A.
Regulation.  The PUC regulates the rates, issuance of securities, accounting and certain other aspects of the operations of Hawaiian Electric and its electric utility subsidiaries. See the previous discussion under “Rates” and the discussions under “Electric utility–Results of operations–Most recent rate proceedings.” 
On September 15, 2014, the State of Hawaii and the U.S. Department of Energy executed a MOU recognizing that Hawaii is embarking on the next phase of its clean energy future. The MOU provides the framework for a comprehensive, sustained effort to better realize its vast renewable energy potential and allow Hawaii to push forward in three main areas: the power sector, transportation and energy efficiency. This next phase is focused on stimulating deployment of clean energy infrastructure as a catalyst for economic growth, energy system innovation and test bed investments.
7

Energy efficiency. The PUC issued an order on January 3, 2012 approving a framework for Energy Efficiency Portfolio Standards (EEPS) that set 2008 as the initial base year for evaluation and linearly allocated the 2030 goal to interim incremental reduction goals of 1,375 GWH by 2015 and 975 GWH by each of the years 2020, 2025 and 2030. Pursuant to the PUC’s EEPS framework, the PUC has contracted with a public benefits fee administrator to operate and manage energy efficiency programs, and any incentive and/or penalty mechanisms related to the achievement of the goals are at the discretion of the PUC. 
The Division of Consumer Advocacy’s 2018 Compliance Resolution Fund Report states that Hawaii continues to progress towards its 2020 Renewable Portfolio Standards and EEPS goals. The EEPS has contributed to lower kWh sales; however, the implementation of sales decoupling has delinked sales and revenues. See “Regulatory mechanisms” above. 
Electrification of Transportation. In June 2018, the PUC initiated a proceeding to review the Utilities’ Electrification of Transportation (EoT) Strategic Roadmap, which provided an economic analysis for light duty electric vehicles on the island of Oahu, Maui and Hawaii. In December 2018, the Utilities filed proposed tariffs for: (1) a commercial electric bus charging facility service pilot program; and (2) the assumed ownership and operation of certain fast charging stations on the island of Maui.
Renewable Portfolio Standards. In 2015, Hawaii’s RPS law was amended to require electric utilities to meet an RPS of 15%, 30%, 40%, 70% and 100% by December 31, 2015, 2020, 2030, 2040 and 2045, respectively. Energy savings resulting from energy efficiency programs do not count toward the RPS since 2014 (only electrical generation using renewable energy as a source counts).
Affiliate transactions. Certain transactions between HEI’s electric public utility subsidiaries (Hawaiian Electric, Hawaii Electric Light and Maui Electric) and HEI and affiliated interests (as defined by statute) are subject to regulation by the PUC. 
In December 1996, the PUC issued an order in a docket to review the relationship between HEI and Hawaiian Electric and the effects of that relationship on the operations of Hawaiian Electric. The order required Hawaiian Electric to continue to provide the PUC with periodic status reports on its compliance with the PUC Agreement (pursuant to which HEI became the holding company of Hawaiian Electric). Hawaiian Electric files such status reports annually. In the order, the PUC also required the Utilities to present a comprehensive analysis of the impact that the holding company structure and investments in nonutility subsidiaries have on a case-by-case basis on the cost of capital to each utility in future rate cases and remove any such effects from the cost of capital. The Utilities have made presentations in their subsequent rate cases to support their positions that there was no evidence that would modify the PUC’s finding that Hawaiian Electric’s access to capital did not suffer as a result of HEI’s involvement in nonutility activities and that HEI’s diversification did not permanently raise or lower the cost of capital incorporated into the rates paid by Hawaiian Electric’s utility customers.
In December 2018, the PUC established a set of requirements governing transactions and sharing of information between the Utilities and its affiliates (Affiliate Transaction Requirements, ATRs), which was subsequently modified and clarified in January 2019 following the Utilities’ motion for reconsideration. The PUC stated the intent of the ATRs is to establish safeguards to avoid potential market power benefits, cross-subsidization between regulated and unregulated activities. The requirements include rules on interactions with affiliates, information handling, business development, political activities, promotional activities, sales of products and services, and employee sharing restrictions. The ATRs include implementing an internal code of conduct, a compliance plan including policies and procedures to comply with the requirements, and having an audit conducted every three years that examines the compliance with the requirements. Penalties for non-compliance depend on the severity of the violation, and can range from daily fines to divestiture of the Utilities by the holding company.
Other regulations. The Utilities are not subject to regulation by the FERC under the Federal Power Act, except under Sections 210 through 212 (added by Title II of PURPA and amended by the Energy Policy Act of 1992), which permit the FERC to order electric utilities to interconnect with qualifying cogenerators and small power producers, and to wheel power to other electric utilities. Title I of PURPA, which relates to retail regulatory policies for electric utilities, and Title VII of the Energy Policy Act of 1992, which addresses transmission access, also apply to the Utilities. The Utilities are also required to file various operational reports with the FERC.
Because they are located in the State of Hawaii, Hawaiian Electric and its subsidiaries are exempt by statute from limitations set forth in the Powerplant and Industrial Fuel Use Act of 1978 on the use of petroleum as a primary energy source.
See also “HEI–Regulation” above.
Environmental regulation.  Hawaiian Electric, Hawaii Electric Light and Maui Electric, like other utilities, are subject to periodic inspections by federal, state and, in some cases, local environmental regulatory agencies, including agencies responsible for the regulation of water quality, air quality, hazardous and other waste and hazardous materials. These 
8

inspections may result in the identification of items needing corrective or other action. Except as otherwise disclosed in this report (see “Risk Factors” in Item 1A and Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, which are incorporated herein by reference), the Company believes that each subsidiary has appropriately responded to environmental conditions requiring action and that, as a result of such actions, such environmental conditions will not have a material adverse effect on the Company or Hawaiian Electric.
Water quality controls.  The generating stations, substations and other utility facilities operate under federal and state water quality regulations and permits, including, but not limited to, the Clean Water Act National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (governing point source discharges, including wastewater and storm water discharges) and the Safe Drinking Water Act Underground Injection Control (regulating disposal of wastewater into the subsurface). On February 1, 2018, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that under certain circumstances, discharges from underground injection control wells may require National Pollution Discharge Elimination System permits. This case is currently pending before the U.S. Supreme Court.
Oil pollution controls.  The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA) establishes programs that govern actual or threatened oil releases and imposes strict liability on responsible parties for clean-up costs and damages to natural resources and property. The federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations under OPA require certain facilities that use or store oil to prepare and implement Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasures (SPCC) Plans in order to prevent releases of oil to navigable waters of the U.S. Certain facilities are also required to prepare and implement Facility Response Plans (FRPs) to ensure prompt and proper response to releases of oil. The utility facilities that are subject to SPCC Plan and FRP requirements have prepared and implemented SPCC Plans and FRPs.
Air quality controls.  The Clean Air Act (CAA) establishes permitting programs to reduce air pollution. The CAA amendments of 1990, established the federal Title V Operating Permit Program (in Hawaii known as the Covered Source Permit program) to ensure compliance with all applicable federal and state air pollution control requirements. The 1977 CAA Amendments established the New Source Review (NSR) permitting program, which affect new or modified generating units by requiring a permit to construct under the CAA and the controls necessary to meet the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). 
Title V operating permits have been issued for all of the Utilities’ affected generating units.
Hazardous waste and toxic substances controls.  The operations of the electric utility are subject to EPA regulations that implement provisions of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA, also known as Superfund), the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA), and the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA).
RCRA underground storage tank (UST) regulations require all facilities that use USTs for storing petroleum products to comply with established leak detection, spill prevention, standards for tank design and retrofits, financial assurance, operator training, and tank decommissioning and closure requirements. All of the Utilities’ USTs currently meet the applicable requirements.
The Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act under SARA Title III requires the Utilities to report potentially hazardous chemicals present in their facilities in order to provide the public with information so that emergency procedures can be established to protect the public in the event of hazardous chemical releases. Since January 1, 1998, the steam electric industry category has been subject to Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) reporting requirements.
The TSCA regulations specify procedures for the handling and disposal of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), a compound found in some transformer and capacitor dielectric fluids. The TSCA regulations also apply to responses to releases of PCBs to the environment. The Utilities have instituted procedures to monitor compliance with these regulations and have implemented a program to identify and replace PCB transformers and capacitors in their systems. In April 2010, the EPA issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rule Making announcing its intent to reassess PCB regulations. The EPA has ceased activity on the PCB reassessment.
Hawaii’s Environmental Response Law (ERL), as amended, governs releases of hazardous substances, including oil, to the environment in areas within the state’s jurisdiction. Responsible parties under the ERL are jointly, severally, and strictly liable for a release of a hazardous substance. Responsible parties include owners or operators of a facility where a hazardous substance is located and any person who at the time of disposal of the hazardous substance owned or operated any facility at which such hazardous substance was disposed.
The Utilities periodically discover leaking oil-containing equipment such as USTs, piping, and transformers. Each subsidiary reports releases from such equipment when and as required by applicable law and addresses the releases in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements.

2 | There are an additional 56,358 barrels of diesel oil storage capacity off-site at Aloha Petroleum, Ltd. (Aloha Petroleum)-owned terminalling facilities.

Other properties.  The Utilities own overhead transmission and distribution lines, underground cables, pole (some jointly) and metal high voltage towers. Electric lines are located over or under public and nonpublic properties. 
Hawaiian Electric owns a total of 132 acres of land on which substations, transformer vaults, distribution baseyards and the Kalaeloa cogeneration facility are located. Hawaiian Electric also owns buildings and approximately 11.6 acres of land located in Honolulu which house its operating and engineering departments. It also leases an office building and certain office spaces in Honolulu, and a warehousing center in Kapolei. 
Hawaii Electric Light owns 6 acres of land in Kona, which is used for a baseyard, and one acre of land in Hilo, which houses its accounting, customer services and administrative offices. Hawaii Electric Light also leases 3.7 acres of land for its baseyard in Hilo under a lease expiring in 2030. In addition, Hawaii Electric Light owns a total of approximately 100 acres of land, and leases a total of approximately 8.5 acres of land, on which hydro facilities, substations and switching stations, microwave facilities and transmission lines are located. The deeds to the sites located in Hilo contain certain restrictions, but the restrictions do not materially interfere with the use of the sites for public utility purposes.
Maui Electric’s administrative offices, as well as its engineering and distribution departments, are situated on 9.1 acres of Maui Electric-owned land in Kahului. Maui Electric also owns approximately 18 acres of land which house some of its substations, leases approximately 3,600 square feet of land for its telecommunication and microwave facilities, leases approximately 6,000 square feet of land at Kahului Harbor for pipeline purposes, and leases 17,958 square feet of land at Puunene for the Puunene Substation.

See “Hawaiian Electric and subsidiaries and service areas” above for a discussion of the nonexclusive franchises of Hawaiian Electric and subsidiaries. 
See “Generation statistics” above and “Limited insurance” in HEI’s MD&A for a further discussion of some of the electric utility properties.
Bank
General.  ASB is one of the largest financial institutions headquartered in the State of Hawaii with assets of $7.0 billion and deposits of $6.2 billion, as of December 31, 2018. ASB is a full-service community bank serving both consumer and commercial customers and operates 49 branches on the islands of Oahu (34), Maui (6), Hawaii (5), Kauai (3), and Molokai (1). ASB was acquired by HEI in 1988, and prior to its acquisition, ASB was granted a federal savings bank charter in January 1987. Prior to that time, ASB had operated since 1925 as the Hawaii division of American Savings & Loan Association of Salt Lake City, Utah.
11

In 2018, ASB’s revenues and net income amounted to approximately 11% and 41% of HEI’s consolidated revenues and net income, respectively, compared to approximately 12% and 41% in 2017 and approximately 12% and 23% in 2016 (impacted by the merger termination fee).
At the time of HEI’s acquisition of ASB, HEI agreed with the Office of Thrift Supervision, Department of Treasury’s (OTS) predecessor regulatory agency that ASB’s regulatory capital would be maintained at a level of at least 6% of ASB’s total liabilities, or at such greater amount as may be required from time to time by regulation. Under the agreement, HEI’s obligation to contribute additional capital to ensure that ASB would have the capital level required by the OTS was limited to a maximum aggregate amount of approximately $65.1 million. As of December 31, 2018, as a result of certain HEI contributions of capital to ASB over the years, HEI’s maximum obligation under the agreement to contribute additional capital has been reduced to approximately $28.3 million. ASB is subject to OCC regulations on dividends and other distributions and ASB must receive a letter from the FRB communicating the OCC’s and FRB’s non-objection to the payment of any dividend ASB proposes to declare and pay to ASB Hawaii and HEI.
The following table sets forth selected data for ASB (average balances calculated using the average daily balances):

Years ended December 31 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016 | 
Equity to assets ratio | | | | | | 
Average equity divided by average total assets | 8.86 | % | 9.10 | % | 9.34 | %

Net income divided by average equity | 13.51 | | 11.20 | | 9.90 | 

Lending activities. See Note 4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the composition of ASB’s loan portfolio.
Origination, purchase and sale of loans.  Generally, residential and commercial real estate loans originated by ASB are collateralized by real estate located in Hawaii. For additional information, including information concerning the geographic distribution of ASB’s mortgage-backed securities portfolio and the geographic concentration of credit risk, see Note 14 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The demand for loans is primarily dependent on the Hawaii real estate market, business conditions, interest rates and loan refinancing activity.
Residential mortgage lending.  ASB originates fixed rate and adjustable rate loans secured by single family residential property, including investor-owned properties, with maturities of up to 30 years. ASB’s general policy is to require private mortgage insurance when the loan-to-value ratio of the property exceeds 80% of the lower of the appraised value or purchase price at origination. For non-owner-occupied residential properties, the loan-to-value ratio may not exceed 80% of the lower of the appraised value or purchase price at origination.
Construction and development lending.  ASB provides fixed rate loans for the construction of one-to-four unit residential and commercial properties. Construction loan projects are typically short term in nature. Construction and development financing generally involves a higher degree of credit risk than long-term financing on improved, occupied real estate. Accordingly, construction and development loans are generally priced higher than loans collateralized by completed structures. ASB’s underwriting, monitoring and disbursement practices with respect to construction and development financing are designed to ensure sufficient funds are available to complete construction projects. See “Bank—Loan portfolio risk elements” in HEI’s MD&A and “Multifamily residential and commercial real estate lending” below.
Multifamily residential and commercial real estate lending.  ASB provides permanent financing and construction and development financing collateralized by multifamily residential properties (including apartment buildings) and collateralized by commercial and industrial properties (including office buildings, shopping centers and warehouses) for its own portfolio as well as for participation with other lenders. Commercial real estate lending typically involves long lead times to originate and fund. As a result, production results can vary significantly from period to period.
Consumer lending.  ASB offers a variety of secured and unsecured consumer loans. Loans collateralized by deposits are limited to 90% of the available account balance. ASB offers home equity lines of credit, clean energy loans, secured and unsecured VISA cards (through a third party issuer), checking account overdraft protection and other general purpose consumer loans.
Commercial lending.  ASB provides both secured and unsecured commercial loans to business entities. This lending activity is designed to diversify ASB’s asset structure, shorten maturities, improve rate sensitivity of the loan portfolio and attract commercial checking deposits. ASB offers commercial loans with terms up to ten years.
12

Loan origination fee and servicing income.  In addition to interest earned on residential mortgage loans, ASB receives income from servicing loans, for late payments and from other related services. Servicing fees are received on loans originated and subsequently sold by ASB where ASB acts as collection agent on behalf of third-party purchasers.
ASB charges the borrower at loan settlement a loan origination fee. See “Loans” in Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Deposits and sources of funds. Deposits continue to be the largest source of funds for ASB for use in lending, meeting liquidity requirements and making investments, and are affected by market interest rates, competition and management’s responses to these factors. Deposit retention and growth will remain challenging in the current environment due to competition for deposits and the low level of short-term interest rates. ASB borrows on a short-term basis to compensate for seasonal or other reductions in deposit flows. ASB may borrow on a longer-term basis to support expanded lending or investment activities. Advances from the FHLB of Des Moines and securities sold under agreements to repurchase continue to be additional sources of funds, but they are a higher cost source than deposits.
Competition.  The banking industry in Hawaii is highly competitive. At December 31, 2018, there were 8 financial institutions insured by the FDIC headquartered in the State of Hawaii. While ASB is one of the largest financial institutions in Hawaii, based on total assets, ASB faces vigorous competition for deposits and loans from two larger banking institutions based in Hawaii and from smaller institutions that heavily promote their services in niche areas, such as providing financial services to small and medium-sized businesses, as well as national financial services organizations. Competition for loans and deposits comes primarily from other savings institutions, commercial banks, credit unions, securities brokerage firms, money market and mutual funds and other investment alternatives. ASB faces additional competition in seeking deposit funds from various types of corporate and government borrowers, including insurance companies. Competition for origination of mortgage loans comes primarily from mortgage banking and brokerage firms, commercial banks, other savings institutions, insurance companies and real estate investment trusts. See also “Bank—Executive overview and strategy” in HEI’s MD&A.
To remain competitive and continue building core franchise value, ASB continues to develop and introduce new products and services to meet the needs of its consumer and commercial customers. Additionally, the banking industry is constantly changing and ASB is making the investment in its people and technology necessary to adapt and remain competitive. 
The primary factors in ASB’s competition for mortgage and other loans are the competitive interest rates and loan origination fees it charges, the wide variety of loan programs it offers and the quality and efficiency of the services it provides to borrowers and the business community. ASB believes that it is able to compete for such loans primarily through the competitive interest rates and loan fees it charges, the type of mortgage loan programs it offers and the efficiency and quality of the services it provides to individual borrowers and the business community.
The primary factors in competing for deposits are interest rates, the quality and range of services offered, marketing, convenience of locations, hours of operation, other non-branch channels such as online and mobile banking and perceptions of the institution’s financial soundness and safety. To meet competition, ASB offers a variety of savings and checking accounts at competitive rates, convenient business hours, convenient branch locations with interbranch deposit and withdrawal privileges at each branch, convenient automated teller machines and an upgrade of the ASB’s electronic banking platform. ASB also conducts advertising and promotional campaigns.
ASB has been diversifying its loan portfolio from single-family home mortgages to higher-spread, shorter-duration consumer, commercial and commercial real estate loans. The origination of consumer, commercial and commercial real estate loans involves risks and other considerations different from those associated with originating residential real estate loans. For example, the sources and level of competition may be different and credit risk is generally higher than for residential mortgage loans. These different risk factors are considered in the underwriting and pricing standards and in the allowance for loan losses established by ASB for its consumer, commercial and commercial real estate loans. 
Regulation.  ASB, a federally chartered saving bank, is subject to examination and comprehensive regulation by the Department of Treasury, OCC and the FDIC, and is subject to reserve requirements established by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Regulation by these agencies focuses in large measure on the adequacy of ASB’s capital and the results of periodic “safety and soundness” examinations conducted by the OCC. In addition, ASB’s holding companies are subject to the regulatory supervision of the FRB. See “HEI Consolidated–Regulation” above.
Capital requirements.  The OCC, ASB’s principal regulator, administers two sets of capital standards — minimum regulatory capital requirements and prompt corrective action requirements. The FDIC also has prompt corrective action capital requirements. As of December 31, 2018, ASB was in compliance with OCC minimum regulatory capital requirements and was “well-capitalized” within the meaning of OCC prompt corrective action regulations and FDIC capital regulations, as follows:

• | ASB met applicable minimum regulatory capital requirements (noted in parentheses) as of December 31, 2018 with a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 8.7% (4.0%), a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 12.8% (4.5%), a Tier 1 capital ratio of 12.8% (6.0%) and a total capital ratio of 13.9% (8.0%).


• | ASB met the capital requirements to be generally considered “well-capitalized” (noted in parentheses) as of December 31, 2018 with a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 8.7% (5.0%), a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 12.8% (6.5%), a Tier 1 capital ratio of 12.8% (8.0%) and a total capital ratio of 13.9% (10.0%).

The purpose of the prompt corrective action capital requirements is to establish thresholds for varying degrees of oversight and intervention by regulators. Declines in levels of capital, depending on their severity, will result in increasingly stringent mandatory and discretionary regulatory consequences. Capital levels may decline for any number of reasons, including reductions that would result if there were losses from operations, deterioration in collateral values or the inability to dispose of real estate owned (typically acquired by foreclosure). The regulators have substantial discretion in the corrective actions they might direct and could include restrictions on dividends and other distributions that ASB may make to HEI (through ASB Hawaii) and the requirement that ASB develop and implement a plan to restore its capital. Under an agreement with regulators entered into by HEI when it acquired ASB, HEI currently could be required to contribute to ASB up to an additional $28.3 million of capital, if necessary, to maintain ASB’s capital position.
In order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers, a financial institution must hold a buffer of common equity tier 1 capital above its minimum capital requirements in an amount greater than 2.5% of total risk-weighted assets (capital conservation buffer) which is phased-in through 2019. As of December 31, 2018, ASB met the applicable capital requirements, including the fully phased-in capital conservation buffer.
See “Bank-Legislation and regulation” in HEI’s MD&A for the final capital rules under the Basel III regulatory capital framework.
Examinations.  ASB is subject to periodic “safety and soundness” examinations and other examinations by the OCC. In conducting its examinations, the OCC utilizes the Uniform Financial Institutions Rating System adopted by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, which system utilizes the “CAMELS” criteria for rating financial institutions. The six components in the rating system are: Capital adequacy, Asset quality, Management, Earnings, Liquidity and Sensitivity to market risk. The OCC examines and rates each CAMELS component. An overall CAMELS rating is also given, after taking into account all of the component ratings. A financial institution may be subject to formal regulatory or administrative direction or supervision such as a “memorandum of understanding” or a “cease and desist” order following an examination if its CAMELS rating is not satisfactory. An institution is prohibited from disclosing the OCC’s report of its safety and soundness examination or the component and overall CAMELS rating to any person or organization not officially connected with the institution as an officer, director, employee, attorney or auditor, except as provided by regulation. The OCC also regularly examines ASB’s information technology practices and its performance under Community Reinvestment Act measurement criteria.
The Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended, addresses the safety and soundness of the deposit insurance system, supervision of depository institutions and improvement of accounting standards. Pursuant to this Act, federal banking agencies have promulgated regulations that affect the operations of ASB and its holding companies (e.g., standards for safety and soundness, real estate lending, accounting and reporting, transactions with affiliates and loans to insiders). FDIC regulations restrict the ability of financial institutions that fail to meet relevant capital measures to engage in certain activities, such as offering interest rates on deposits that are significantly higher than the rates offered by competing institutions. As of December 31, 2018, ASB was “well-capitalized” and thus not subject to these restrictions.
Deposit insurance coverage.  The Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended, and regulations promulgated by the FDIC, govern insurance coverage of deposit accounts. In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act permanently raised the current standard maximum deposit insurance amount to $250,000. Generally, the amount of all deposits held by a depositor in the same capacity (even if held in separate accounts) is aggregated for purposes of applying the insurance limit.
See “Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation assessment” in Note 4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of FDIC deposit insurance assessment rates. Financing Corporation will continue to impose an assessment on average total assets minus average tangible equity to service the interest on Financing Corporation bond obligations. As of December 31, 2018, ASB’s annual Financing Corporation assessment was 0.31 cents per $100 of average total assets minus average tangible equity.
Recent legislation and issuances.  See “Bank–Legislation and regulation” in HEI’s MD&A.
Affiliate transactions.  Significant restrictions apply to certain transactions between ASB and its affiliates, including HEI and its direct and indirect subsidiaries. For example, ASB is prohibited from making any loan or other extension of credit to an 
14

entity affiliated with ASB unless the affiliate is engaged exclusively in activities which the FRB has determined to be permissible for bank holding companies. There are also various other restrictions which apply to certain transactions between ASB and certain executive officers, directors and insiders of ASB. ASB is also barred from making a purchase of or any investment in securities issued by an affiliate, other than with respect to shares of a subsidiary of ASB.
Financial derivatives and interest rate risk.  ASB is subject to OCC rules relating to derivatives activities, such as interest rate swaps, interest rate lock commitments and forward commitments. See “Derivative financial instruments” in Note 4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of interest rate lock commitments and forward commitments used by ASB. Currently ASB does not use interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk (IRR), but may do so in the future. Generally speaking, the OCC rules permit financial institutions to engage in transactions involving financial derivatives to the extent these transactions are otherwise authorized under applicable law and are safe and sound. The rules require ASB to have certain internal procedures for handling financial derivative transactions, including involvement of the ASB Board of Directors.
With the transfer of the regulatory jurisdiction from the OTS to the OCC, ASB has adopted terminology and IRR assessment, measurement and management practices consistent with OCC guidelines. Management believes ASB’s IRR processes are aligned with the Interagency Advisory on Interest Rate Risk Management and appropriate with earnings and capital levels, balance sheet complexity, business model and risk tolerance.
Liquidity.  OCC regulations require ASB to maintain sufficient liquidity to ensure safe and sound operations. ASB’s principal sources of liquidity are customer deposits, borrowings, the maturity and repayment of portfolio loans and securities and the sale of loans into secondary market channels. ASB’s principal sources of borrowings are advances from the FHLB of Des Moines and securities sold under agreements to repurchase from broker/dealers. ASB is approved by the FHLB of Des Moines to borrow an amount of up to 35% of assets to the extent it provides qualifying collateral and holds sufficient FHLB of Des Moines stock. As of December 31, 2018, ASB’s unused FHLB of Des Moines borrowing capacity was approximately $2.0 billion. ASB utilizes growth in deposits, advances from the FHLB of Des Moines and securities sold under agreements to repurchase to fund maturing and withdrawable deposits, repay maturing borrowings, fund existing and future loans and make investments. As of December 31, 2018, ASB had loan commitments, undisbursed loan funds and unused lines and letters of credit of $1.9 billion. Management believes ASB’s current sources of funds will enable it to meet these obligations while maintaining liquidity at satisfactory levels.
Supervision. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (the FDICIA) establishes a statutory framework that is triggered by the capital level of a financial institution and subjects it to progressively more stringent restrictions and supervision as capital levels decline. The OCC rules implement the system of prompt corrective action. In particular, the rules define the relevant capital measures for the categories of “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized.” As of December 31, 2018, ASB was “well-capitalized.”
Interest rates.  FDIC regulations restrict the ability of financial institutions that are undercapitalized to offer interest rates on deposits that are significantly higher than the rates offered by competing institutions. As of December 31, 2018, ASB was “well capitalized” and thus not subject to these interest rate restrictions.
Qualified thrift lender test. ASB is a “qualified thrift lender” (QTL) under its federal thrift charter and, in order to maintain this status, ASB is required to maintain at least 65% of its assets in “qualified thrift investments,” measured on a monthly average basis in 9 out of the previous 12 months, which include housing-related loans (including mortgage-backed securities) as well as certain small business loans, education loans, loans made through credit card accounts and a basket (not exceeding 20% of total assets) of other consumer loans and other assets. Institutions that fail to maintain QTL status are subject to various penalties, including limitations on their activities. In ASB’s case, the activities of HEI, ASB Hawaii and HEI’s other subsidiaries would also be subject to restrictions if ASB failed to maintain its QTL status, and a failure or inability to comply with those restrictions could effectively result in the required divestiture of ASB. As of December 31, 2018, and at all times during 2018, ASB was a qualified thrift lender.
Federal Home Loan Bank System.  ASB is a member of the FHLB System, which consists of 11 regional FHLBs, and ASB’s regional bank is the FHLB of Des Moines. The FHLB System provides a central credit facility for member institutions. Historically, the FHLBs have served as the central liquidity facilities for savings associations and sources of long-term funds for financing housing. At such time as an advance is made to ASB or renewed, it must be collateralized by collateral from one of the following categories: (1) fully disbursed, whole first mortgages on improved residential property, or securities representing a whole interest in such mortgages; (2) securities issued, insured or guaranteed by the U.S. Government or any agency thereof; (3) FHLB deposits; and (4) other real estate-related collateral that has a readily ascertainable value and with respect to which a security interest can be perfected. The aggregate amount of outstanding advances collateralized by such other real estate-related collateral may not exceed 300% of ASB’s capital.
15

 ASB’s required holding in the stock of the FHLB is both membership and activity-based. Membership is based on a percentage of total assets (0.12%) while the portion related to activity is based on a percentage of outstanding activity, mainly advances (4%). As of December 31, 2018, ASB was required and owned capital stock in the FHLB of Des Moines in the amount of $10 million.
Community Reinvestment.  The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) requires financial institutions to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low- and moderate-income areas, consistent with safe and sound lending practices. The OCC will consider ASB’s CRA record in evaluating an application for a new deposit facility, including the establishment of a branch, the relocation of a branch or office, or the acquisition of an interest in another bank. ASB currently holds an “outstanding” CRA rating.
Other laws.  ASB is subject to federal and state consumer protection laws which affect deposit and lending activities, such as the Truth in Lending Act (TILA), the Truth in Savings Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA), the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act and several federal and state financial privacy acts intended to protect consumers’ personal information and prevent identity theft, such as the Gramm Act and the Fair and Accurate Transactions Act. ASB is also subject to federal laws regulating certain of its lending practices, such as the Flood Disaster Protection Act, and laws requiring reports to regulators of certain customer transactions, such as the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act and the International Money Laundering Abatement and Anti-Terrorist Financing Act. ASB’s relationship with Cetera Investment Services LLC and Cetera Investment Advisers LLC is also governed by regulations adopted by the FRB under the Gramm Act, which regulate “networking” relationships under which a financial institution refers customers to a broker-dealer for securities services and employees of the financial institution are permitted to receive a nominal fee for the referrals. These laws may provide for substantial penalties in the event of noncompliance.
Proposed legislation.  See the discussion of proposed legislation in “Bank–Legislation and regulation” in HEI’s MD&A.
Environmental regulation.  ASB may be subject to the provisions of Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), Hawaii Environmental Response Law (ERL) and regulations promulgated thereunder, which impose liability for environmental cleanup costs on certain categories of responsible parties. CERCLA and ERL exempt persons whose ownership in a facility is held primarily to protect a security interest, provided that they do not participate in the management of the facility.
Additional information.  For additional information about ASB, see the sections under “Bank” in HEI’s MD&A, HEI’s “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” and HEI’s Consolidated Financial Statements, including Note 4 thereto.
Properties.  ASB owns or leases several office buildings in downtown Honolulu, owns land and an operations center in the Mililani Technology Park on the island of Oahu and owns land on which a number of its branches are located.
The following table sets forth the number of bank branches owned and leased by ASB by island:

 | Number of branches
December 31, 2018 | Owned | Leased | | Total
Oahu | 8 | | 26 | | 34
Maui | 3 | | 3 | | 6 
Hawaii | 3 | | 2 | | 5 
Kauai | 2 | | 1 | | 3 
Molokai | — | | 1 | | 1 
 | 16 | | 33 | | 49


As of December 31, 2018, the net book value (NBV) of branches and office facilities was $190 million ($184 million NBV of the land and improvements for the branches and office facilities owned by ASB and $6 million represents the NBV of ASB’s leasehold improvements). The increase as of December 31, 2018 is primarily due to the construction costs of the new headquarters. As of December 31, 2017, the NBV of branches and office facilities of $75 million ($68 million NBV of the land and improvements for the branches and office facilities owned by ASB and $7 million represents the NBV of ASB’s leasehold improvements). The leases expire on various dates through December 2040, but many of the leases have extension provisions.
As of December 31, 2018, ASB owned 113 automated teller machines.
Construction of New Headquarters. In the first quarter of 2017, ASB began construction of its new headquarters in downtown Honolulu. The project will cost an estimated $115 million and ASB expects to move into the facility in the first half of 2019. The headquarters will have approximately 370,000 square feet of space on eleven floors and consolidate five separate 
16

offices into one building where approximately 600 employees will work. In January 2019, ASB signed an agreement with a real estate broker to list two office facilities for sale as a result of the consolidation of employees into the new headquarters.
