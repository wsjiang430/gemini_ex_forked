ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
 Farmers & Merchants Bancorp, Inc. (Company) is a bank holding company incorporated under the laws of Ohio in 1985 and elected to become a financial holding company under the Federal Reserve in 2014.  Our primary subsidiary, The Farmers & Merchants State Bank (Bank) is a community bank operating in Northwest Ohio and Northeast Indiana since 1897.  Our other subsidiary, Farmers & Merchants Risk Management (Captive) is a captive insurance company formed in December 2014 and located in Nevada. We report our financial condition and net income on a consolidated basis and we report only one segment.
 Our executive offices are located at 307 North Defiance Street, Archbold, Ohio 43502, and our telephone number is                  (419) 446-2501.
 For a discussion of the general development of the Company’s business throughout 2018, please see the portion of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations captioned “2018 in Review.”
 Nature of Activities
 The Farmers & Merchants State Bank engages in general commercial banking business. Its activities include commercial, agricultural and residential mortgage as well as consumer and credit card lending activities.  Because the Bank's offices are located in Northwest Ohio and Northeast Indiana, a substantial amount of the loan portfolio is comprised of loans made to customers in the farming industry for such things as farm land, farm equipment, livestock and operating loans for seed, fertilizer, and feed. Other types of lending activities include loans for home improvements and loans for such items as autos, trucks, recreational vehicles and motorcycles.  With the expansion into newer market areas, the most recent increases in loan activity have been in commercial real estate, providing operation lines of credit and machinery purchases. 
 The Bank also provides checking account services, as well as savings and time deposit services such as certificates of deposits. In addition, Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) or Interactive Teller Machines (ITMs) are provided at most branch locations along with other independent locations in the market area. The Bank has custodial services for Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) and Health Savings Accounts (HSAs).  The Bank provides on-line banking access for consumer and business customers. For consumers, this includes bill-pay, on-line statement opportunities and mobile banking. For business customers, it provides the option of electronic transaction origination such as wire and Automated Clearing House (ACH) file transmittal.  In addition, the Bank offers remote deposit capture or electronic deposit processing and merchant credit card services.  Upgrades to our digital products and services continue to occur in both retail and business lines. 
 The Bank has established underwriting policies and procedures which facilitate operating in a safe and sound manner in accordance with supervisory and regulatory guidance.  Within this sphere of safety and soundness, the Bank's practice has been to not promote innovative, unproven credit products which may not be in the best interest of the Bank or its customers.  The Bank does offer a hybrid mortgage loan.  Hybrid loans are loans that start out as a fixed rate mortgage but after a set number of years automatically adjust to an adjustable rate mortgage.  The Bank offers a three year fixed rate mortgage after which the interest rate will adjust annually.  The majority of the Bank's adjustable rate mortgages are of this type. In order to offer longer term fixed rate mortgages, the Bank does participate in the Freddie Mac, Farmer Mac and Small Business Lending programs. 
 3


The Bank also normally retains the servicing rights on these partially or 100% sold loans.  In order for the customer to participate in these programs, they must meet the requirements established by those agencies. In addition, the Bank does sell some of its longer term fixed rate agricultural mortgages into the secondary market with the aid of a broker.
 The Bank does not have a program to fund sub-prime loans.  Sub-prime loans are characterized as a lending program or strategy that targets borrowers who pose a significantly higher risk of default than traditional retail banking customers.
 All loan requests are reviewed as to credit worthiness and are subject to the Bank's underwriting guidelines as to secured versus unsecured credit. Secured loans are in turn subject to loan to value (LTV) requirements based on collateral types as set forth in the Bank's Loan Policy. In addition, credit scores of those seeking consumer credit are reviewed and if they do not meet the Bank's Loan Policy guidelines an additional officer approval is required.

 F&M Investment Services, the brokerage department of the Bank, opened for business in April 1999.  Securities are offered through Raymond James Financial Services, Inc.
 In December of 2014, the Company became a financial holding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 as amended, in order to provide the flexibility to take advantage of the expanded powers available to a financial holding company under the Act.  Our subsidiary bank is in turn regulated and examined by the Ohio Division of Financial Institutions and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The activities of our bank subsidiary are also subject to other federal and state laws and regulations. The Company also formed a Captive insurance company in December 2014. The Captive is located in Nevada and regulated by the State of Nevada Division of Insurance. 
 The Bank’s primary market includes communities located in the Ohio counties of Defiance, Fulton, Hancock, Henry, Lucas, Williams, Wood and in the Indiana counties of Adams, Allen, DeKalb, Jay and Steuben. The commercial banking business in this market is highly competitive, with approximately 45 other depository institutions currently doing business in the Bank’s primary market.  In our banking activities, we compete directly with other commercial banks, credit unions, farm credit services, and savings and loan institutions in each of our operating localities.  In a number of our locations, we compete against entities which are much larger than us, including Huntington National Bank, Fifth Third Bank, Wells Fargo Bank, NA, KeyBank NA and JPMorgan Chase Bank, NA.  Based on deposit data as of June 30, 2018 from the FDIC and using zip codes in our markets, the Bank ranked 4th with a 12.8% market share in markets served.  The primary factors in competing for loans and deposits are the rates charged as well as location and quality of the services provided.

At December 31, 2018, we had 288 full time equivalent employees.  The employees are not represented by a collective bargaining unit.  We provide our employees with a comprehensive benefit program, some of which is contributory.  We consider our employee relations to be good.
 Supervision and Regulation
 General
 The Company is a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Ohio.  The business in which the Company and its subsidiaries are engaged is subject to extensive supervision, regulation and examination by various bank regulatory authorities.  The supervision, regulation and examination to which the Company and its subsidiaries are subject to are intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the deposit insurance funds that insure the deposits of banks, rather than for the protection of shareholders.
 Several of the more significant regulatory provisions applicable to banks and bank holding companies to which the Company and its subsidiaries are subject to are discussed below along with certain regulatory matters concerning the Company and its subsidiaries.  To the extent that the following information describes statutory or regulatory provisions, it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statutory provisions.  Any change in applicable law or regulation may have a material effect on the business and prospects of the Company and its subsidiaries.
 Regulatory Agencies
 The Company is a financial holding company and is subject to inspection, examination and supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve Board”) pursuant to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. As a financial holding company, the Company is still subject to all the bank holding company regulations.
 The Bank is an Ohio chartered commercial bank.  It is subject to regulation and examination by both the Ohio Division of Financial Institutions (ODFI) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). 
 The Captive is an insurance company incorporated in Nevada and regulated by the State of Nevada, Division of Insurance.
 Holding Company Activities
 As a financial holding company incorporated and doing business within the State of Ohio, the Company is subject to regulation and supervision under the Bank Holding Act of 1956, as amended (the "Act").  The Company is required to file with the Federal Reserve Board on quarterly basis information pursuant to the Act.  The Federal Reserve Board may conduct examinations or inspections of the Company and its subsidiaries.  
 On November 12, 1999, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (the "GLB Act") was enacted into law.  The GLB Act made sweeping changes with respect to the permissible financial services which various types of financial institutions may now provide.  The Glass-Steagall Act, which had generally prevented banks from affiliation with securities and insurance firms, was repealed.  Pursuant to the GLB Act, bank holding companies may elect to become a "financial holding company," provided that all of the depository institution subsidiaries of the bank holding company are “well capitalized” and “well managed” under applicable regulatory standards.  
 Under the GLB Act, a bank holding company that has elected to become a financial holding company may affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in other activities that are financial in nature.  Activities that are "financial in nature" include securities underwriting, dealing and market-making, sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies, insurance underwriting and agency, merchant banking, and activities that the Federal Reserve Board has determined to be closely related to banking.  Federal Reserve Board approval is not required for the Company to acquire a company, other than a bank holding company, bank or savings association, engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature, as determined by the Federal Reserve Board.  Prior Federal Reserve Board approval is required before the Company may acquire the beneficial ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares, or substantially all of the assets, of a bank holding company, bank or savings association.  If any subsidiary bank of the Company ceases to be "well capitalized" or "well managed" under applicable regulatory standards, the Federal Reserve Board may, among other actions, order the Company to divest the subsidiary bank.  Alternatively, the Company may elect to conform its activities to those permissible for a bank holding company that is not also a financial holding company.  If any subsidiary bank of the Company receives a rating under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 of less than satisfactory, the Company will be prohibited from engaging in new activities or acquiring companies other than bank holding companies, banks or savings associations.

Affiliate Transactions
 Various governmental requirements, including Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation W promulgated thereunder limit borrowings by holding companies and non-bank subsidiaries from affiliated insured depository institutions, and also limit various other transactions between holding companies and their non-bank subsidiaries, on the one hand, and their affiliated insured depository institutions on the other.  Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act also generally requires that an insured depository institution's loan to its non-bank affiliates be secured, and Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act generally requires that an insured depository institution's transactions with its non-bank affiliates be on arms-length terms.
Interstate Banking and Branching
 Under the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act ("Riegle-Neal"), subject to certain concentration limits and other requirements, adequately capitalized bank holding companies such as the Company are permitted to acquire banks and bank holding companies located in any state.  Any bank that is a subsidiary of a bank holding company is permitted to receive deposits, renew time deposits, close loans, service loans and receive loan payments as an agent for any other bank subsidiary of that bank holding company.  Banks are permitted to acquire branch offices outside their home states by merging with out-of-state banks, purchasing branches in other states and establishing de novo branch offices in other states.  The Company could from time to time use Riegle-Neal to acquire banks in additional states.  
Control Acquisitions
 The Change in Bank Control Act prohibits a person or group of persons from acquiring "control" of a bank holding company, unless the Federal Reserve Board has been notified and has not objected to the transaction.  Under the rebuttable presumption established by the Federal Reserve Board, the acquisition of 10% or more of a class of voting stock of a bank holding company with a class of securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act, such as the Company, would, under the circumstances set forth in the presumption, constitute acquisition of control of the bank holding company.  In addition, a company is required to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve Board under the Bank Holding Company Act before acquiring 25% (5% in the case of an acquirer that is a bank holding company) or more of any class of outstanding voting stock of a bank holding company, or otherwise obtaining control or a "controlling influence" over that bank holding company.
Liability for Banking Subsidiaries
 Under the current Federal Reserve Board policy, a bank holding company is expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and to maintain resources adequate to support each subsidiary bank.  This support may be required at times when the bank holding company may not have the resources to provide it.  In the event of a bank holding company's bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a U.S. federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank would be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment.  Any depository institution insured by the FDIC can be held liable for any loss incurred, or reasonably expected to be incurred, by the FDIC in connection with (1) the "default" of a commonly controlled FDIC-insured depository institution; or (2) any assistance provided by the FDIC to both a commonly controlled FDIC-insured depository institution "in danger of default."  The Bank is an FDIC-insured depository institution.  If a default occurred with respect to the Bank, any capital loans to the Bank from its parent holding company would be subordinate in right of payment to payment of the Bank's depositors and certain of its other obligations.
Regulatory Capital Requirements
 The Company is required by the various regulatory authorities to maintain certain capital levels.  Bank holding companies are required to maintain minimum levels of capital in accordance with Federal Reserve Board capital adequacy guidelines.  If capital falls below minimum guideline levels, a bank holding company, among other things, may be denied approval to acquire or establish additional banks or non‑bank businesses.  The required capital levels in addition to the Bank’s and Company's capital position at December 31, 2018 and 2017 are summarized in the table included in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements.  Beginning in 2018, the consolidated amounts and ratios for the Company are no longer required.
 Beginning in 2015, the Company and Bank were required to measure capital adequacy using Basel III accounting. Basel III is a comprehensive set of reform measures, developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, to strengthen the regulation, supervision and risk management of the banking sector. Implementation of the rules will be overseen by the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the OCC.  Reporting under the new rules began with the March 2015 quarterly regulatory filings.

FDICIA
 The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 ("FDICIA"), and the regulations promulgated under FDICIA, among other things, established five capital categories for insured depository institutions-well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized-and requires U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies to implement systems for "prompt corrective action" for insured depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements based on these categories.  Unless a bank is well capitalized, it is subject to restrictions on its ability to offer brokered deposits and on certain other aspects of its operations.  An undercapitalized bank must develop a capital restoration plan and its parent bank holding company must guarantee the bank's compliance with the plan up to the lesser of 5% of the bank’s assets at the time it became undercapitalized and the amount needed to comply with the plan.   As of December 31, 2018, the Bank was well capitalized pursuant to these prompt corrective action guidelines.
 Dividend Restrictions
 The ability of the Company to obtain funds for the payment of dividends and for other cash requirements will be largely dependent on the amount of dividends which may be declared by its banking subsidiary, which are limited to the Bank’s retained earnings during the current year and its prior two years. Various U.S. federal statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends the Company's banking subsidiary can pay to the Company without regulatory approval.  In 2009, The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Division of Banking Supervision and Regulation issued SR09-4 regarding the safe and sound payment of dividends by bank holding companies. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on applicable dividend restrictions. 
Deposit Insurance Assessments
 The deposits of the Bank are insured up to the regulatory limits set by the FDIC.   The FDIC maintains the Deposit Insurance fund (“DIF”) by assessing depository institutions an insurance premium (assessment).  The amount assessed to each institution is based on statutory factors that take into account the degree of risk the institution poses to the DIF.   The primary purposes of the DIF are to (1) insure the deposits and protect the depositors of insured depository institutions; and (2) resolve failed banks.   The DIF is primarily funded through quarterly assessments on insured depository institutions, but it also earns interest income on its securities.   Decreases in the DIF result from loss provisions associated with the resolution of failed banks and FDIC operating expenses.   
 The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (“Dodd-Frank Act”) revised the statutory authorities governing the FDIC’s management of the DIF.  A key requirement from the Dodd-Frank Act resulted in the FDIC’s adoption of new rules in February 2011 regarding Assessments, Dividends, Assessment Base, and Large Bank Pricing.   The new rules implemented the following changes:   (1) redefined the definition of an institution’s deposit insurance assessment base from one based on domestic deposits to one based on assets now defined as “average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity”; (2) changed the assessment rate adjustments to better account for risk based on an institution’s funding sources; (3) revised the deposit insurance assessment rate schedule in light of the new assessment base and assessment rate adjustments; (4) implemented Dodd-Frank Act dividend provisions; (5) revised the large insured depository institution assessment system to better differentiate for risk and to take into account losses the FDIC may incur from large institution failures; and (6) provided technical and other changes to the FDIC’s assessment rules.  Though deposit insurance assessments maintain a risk-based approach, the FDIC imposed a more extensive risk-based assessment system on large insured depository institutions with at least $10 billion in total assets since they are more complex in nature and could pose greater risk.  The rules became effective April 1, 2011 implementing the revised assessment rate schedule for the quarter beginning April 1, 2011.   The revised assessment rate schedule was used to calculate the June 30, 2011 assessments which were due September 30, 2011 and subsequent quarterly assessments thereafter.   
 Due to the changes to the assessment base and assessment rates, as well as the DIF restoration time frame, the impact on the Company’s future deposit insurance assessments has been and should continue to be favorable.   
 The Dodd-Frank Act permanently raised the standard maximum deposit insurance coverage amount to $250,000.
 The FDIC deposit insurance coverage limit applies per depositor, per insured depository institution for each account ownership category.

Depositor Preference Statute
 In the "liquidation or other resolution" of an institution by any receiver, U.S. federal legislation provides that deposits and certain claims for administrative expenses and employee compensation against the insured depository institution would be afforded a priority over general unsecured claims against that institution, including federal funds and letters of credit.
Government Monetary Policy
 The earnings of the Company are affected primarily by general economic conditions and to a lesser extent by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies, particularly the Federal Reserve.  Its policies influence, to some degree, the volume of bank loans and deposits, and interest rates charged and paid thereon, and thus have an effect on the earnings of the Company's subsidiary Bank.  
Additional Regulation
 Provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act have resulted in additional rulemaking by the federal regulatory agencies and new rules yet to be issued. Implementing the new and expanded regulations involved extreme diligence to ensure compliance with the complexities of the rules, as well as extensive new disclosure and reporting requirements. 
 The Dodd-Frank Act created an independent regulatory body, the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (“Bureau”), with authority and responsibility to set rules and regulations for most consumer protection laws applicable to all banks – large and small - adds another regulator to scrutinize and police financial activities. Transfer to the Bureau of all consumer financial protection functions for designated laws by the other federal agencies was completed in July 2011.   The Bureau was given responsibility for mortgage reform and enforcement, as well as broad new powers over consumer financial activities, including consumer financial products and services and how they are provided.
 Significant mortgage rules mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act provisions were enacted in response to the breakdown in the mortgage lending markets and to provide for consumer protections. Final rules issued by the Bureau or jointly with other regulatory agencies implemented requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act regarding mortgage-related matters such as ability-to-repay, qualified mortgage standards, mortgage servicing, mortgage loan originator compensation, escrow requirements for higher-priced mortgage loans, and providing appraisals.  These new mortgage rules, effective in January 2014, addressed problems consumers faced in the three major steps in buying a home – shopping for a mortgage, closing on a mortgage, and paying off a mortgage.  
 Final rules and amendments to the integrated mortgage disclosure rules under the Real Estate Settlement Act (RESPA) and Truth in Lending Act (TILA) became effective in October 2015.  The TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure rule commonly referred to as TRID combined required disclosures into two single forms: 1) The Loan Estimate which is provided shortly after a mortgage loan application and 2) The Closing Disclosure which is provided prior to loan consummation.  In addition, a mandated appraisal notice under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the servicing application disclosure under RESPA were also combined into the new integrated disclosures.  Process and procedural adjustments were necessary to appropriately implement the new requirements. Implementation to achieve TRID compliance involved extensive collaboration with the Mortgage Loan Origination software vendor, as well as outreach and coordination efforts with real estate agents, attorneys, and closing agents to cultivate preparedness for the new integrated mortgage loan disclosure forms.  Amendments to the TRID rules effective in October 2017 with a mandatory compliance in October 2018 were intended to provide further clarity to certain provisions.  Due to the complexities of the TRID rules, remaining attentive to these matters will ensure practices and procedures remain compliant and not subject the Bank to unnecessary liability.   
 Final rules, mostly effective in October 2015, were issued by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB), the Farm Credit Administration, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to implement provisions of the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act of 2014 (HFIAA) and the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012 (the Biggert-Waters Act).   These provisions amended regulations which apply to loans secured by properties located in special flood hazard areas. 
 Processes and procedural changes along with the implementation of new forms and notifications resulted.  Fines and penalties for compliance with flood insurance requirements promote a continued focus on adherence to the new flood rules and existing requirements.
 The Department of Defense (DOD) new rules amending its regulation that implements the Military Lending Act (MLA) became effective in October 2016.  The MLA enacted as part of the John Warner National Defense Act of 2007, significantly expanded 
 8


the scope of the Act to cover all consumer credit except residential mortgages and purchase money loans.  Compliance requirements for credit cards became effective in October 2017. Coverage applies to consumer credit defined as “credit offered or extended for personal, family, or household purpose and that is subject to a finance charge or payable by written agreement in more than four installments.”  A covered borrower is a consumer who at the time of becoming obligated on a consumer credit transaction or establishing an account for consumer credit, is a covered member or dependent (including a spouse) of a covered member.   A covered member is a member of the armed forces serving on active duty or active guard or reserve duty. 
 Providing a loan to a MLA-covered borrower that exceeds the 36% Military Annual Percentage Rate is prohibited.  Any covered loans made without providing proper disclosures or in violation of the MLA is void.  Creditors who knowingly or willfully violate the rules could be subject to a fine, imprisonment up to one year or both.   Implementation of these new rules involved understanding the impact on the covered consumer credit products offered, collaboration with Loan Origination System vendors for assistance with calculations and required disclosures, and an efficient and effective process for identifying covered borrowers.  
 Under the TILA Ability to Repay requirements, the Bank meets the criteria to qualify as a small creditor based on the number of first-lien mortgage loans transactions and due to its asset size; however it is not a creditor that operates predominantly in rural or underserved areas as it did not extend more than 50% of its total first-lien covered transactions in rural or underserved areas in calendar year 2018.   The Bank focuses on Qualified Mortgage (QM) status for mortgage loans originated as they provide certain presumptions of compliance under the Ability to Repay rules adopted under the Dodd-Frank Act.   In satisfying QM requirements, any mortgage lender regardless of their size can make loans which are entitled to the QM presumption of compliance.   
 Revised Regulation C rules which implement the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) published by the Bureau become effective on January 1, 2018 for reportable loan applications.  The Dodd-Frank Act provisions added new data points for HMDA and authorized the Bureau to require additional information.  The types of transactions reportable have expanded to include most consumer purpose transactions that are dwelling-secured loans or open-end lines of credit. Reportable data points were significantly expanded to 52 fields which included applicant or borrower age, credit score, automated underwriting system information, property value, application channel, points and fees, borrower-paid origination charges, discount points, lender credits, loan term, prepayment penalty, interest rate, loan originator identifier, as well as other data fields.   Ethnicity categories were expanded to include certain subcategories along with a means to capture information on how an applicant’s or borrower’s ethnicity, race, and sex were collected by the institution.  For 2018, a thorough review and validation of data fields to be reported for each application was conducted throughout the year.  Year-end submission of 2018 data to be reported will be completed using the web-based tool developed by the Bureau.      
 Enactment of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (EGRRCPA) on May 24, 2018, resulted in a regulatory reform law deemed to be relief from certain burdensome provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act.  The EGRRCPA included provisions with various effective dates, including some that were effective immediately.  Matters impacted included access to mortgage credit; access to credit; protections for veterans, consumers, and homeowners; rules for holding companies; capital access; and protections for student borrowers.  Though effective immediately, conforming regulations were required for certain provisions such as Reciprocal Deposits, Examination Cycles, and High Volatility Commercial Real Estate (HVCRE).  The Protecting Tenants in Foreclosure Act was restored and permanently extended as of June 23, 2018.  An interim final rule was jointly issued by the OCC, FRB, and FDIC allowing an extended examination cycle for qualifying insured depository institutions with less than $3 billion in total assets.  Effective September 21, 2018, consumers could freeze their credit information and place one-year fraud alerts for free.  Additionally, parents can freeze the credit information of their children under age 16 for free.  In many instances, regulators still need to issue proposals, provide guidance, and publish final rules.  Provisions, including but not limited to the following, still require regulations to become effective; Residential Mortgage Loans; Mortgage Appraisals; HMDA; Escrow Relief; TRID Revisions; Highly Capitalized Banks; Identity Fraud; and Improving Access to Capital. Though beneficial, there are new requirements mixed in with deregulation.  Thus, compliance changes must be monitored and effectively implemented.
 Unfair or deceptive acts or practices (UDAP) standards originally developed years ago by the Federal Trade Commission focused on unacceptable practices that may not specifically be addressed elsewhere in banking or consumer finance law.  Banking regulatory agencies have increasingly used this authority over the last few years to address acts or practices that are deemed harmful, deceptive, or misleading to consumers.  The authority of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to issue credit practice rules under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act for financial institutions was repealed as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act.  Guidance issued collectively by the FDIC, FRB, the Bureau, NCUA, and OCC in August 2014 clearly indicated certain consumer credit practices were not permissible and remained subject to Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, as well as Sections 1031 and 1036 of the Dodd-Frank Act.  The interagency guidance further noted that the Agencies will continue to have supervisory authority and enforcement authority for unfair or deceptive acts or practices, which could include those 
 9


practices previously addressed in the former credit practices rules.  Remaining attentive to the UDAP standards, in relation to the offering and marketing of Bank products and services is extremely important.
 The Bank is also subject to federal regulation relating to such matters as required reserves, limitation as to the nature and amount of its loans and investments, regulatory approval of any merger or consolidation, issuance or retirement of their own securities, limitations upon the payment of dividends and other aspects of banking operations.  In addition, the activities and operations of the Bank are subject to a number of additional detailed, complex and sometimes overlapping laws and regulations. These include state usury and consumer credit laws, state laws relating to fiduciaries, the federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B, the federal Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E, the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act and Regulation V, the federal Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) and Regulation X, the federal Truth in Lending Act and Regulation Z, the federal Truth in Savings Act and Regulation DD, the Bank Secrecy Act, the federal Community Reinvestment Act, anti-discrimination laws and legislation, and antitrust laws.
 Future Legislation
 Changes to the laws and regulations, both at the federal and state levels, can affect the operating environment of the Company and its subsidiaries in substantial and unpredictable ways.  The Company cannot accurately predict whether those changes in laws and regulations will occur, and, if those changes occur, the ultimate effect they would have upon the financial condition or results of operations of the Company or its subsidiaries.  Various provisions and regulations authorized or required by the Dodd-Frank Act have not yet been proposed or implemented by federal regulators.  Uncertainty also exists with respect to the Dodd-Frank Act regulations authorized or required that have not yet been proposed or finalized.Available Information
