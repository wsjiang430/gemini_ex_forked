ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
General
 
Camber Energy, Inc., a Nevada corporation, is based in Houston, Texas. We are currently primarily engaged in the acquisition, development and sale of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids from various known productive geological formations, including from the Hunton formation in Lincoln, Logan, Payne and Okfuskee Counties, in central Oklahoma; the Cline shale and upper Wolfberry shale in Glasscock County, Texas; and Hutchinson County, Texas, in connection with our Panhandle acquisition which closed in March 2018 (described below). Incorporated in Nevada in December 2003 under the name Panorama Investments Corp., the Company changed its name to Lucas Energy, Inc., effective June 9, 2006, and effective January 4, 2017, the Company changed its name to Camber Energy, Inc. After the divestiture of our Oklahoma and South Texas properties during fiscal 2018 and 2019, as discussed in further detail below, we initiated discussions with several potential acquisition and merger candidates to diversify our operations. In May 2019, we entered into a non-binding letter of intent (“LOI”) to acquire Lineal Star Holdings, LLC. (“Lineal”), a specialty construction and oil and gas services enterprise providing services to the energy industry. Whether or not the Lineal transaction closes, the Company intends to pursue additional acquisitions in the energy services industry sector to diversify operations.
 
The Lineal transaction, which is an all-stock transaction, is subject to customary closing conditions, confirmation of final transaction documents and transaction terms, including confirmation of the structuring of the transaction to be on a tax free basis, and other conditions, including, but not limited to final documents with our Series C Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock (“Series C Preferred Stock”) holder amending the Series C Preferred Stock to alter the conversion rights thereof, and obtaining the requisite NYSE American approval of the transaction terms and agreements, which conditions may not be satisfied in a timely manner, if at all. The transaction contemplates the issuance of a new series of convertible preferred stock which will be convertible into 67-70% of our fully diluted common stock after stockholder approval, as required under the applicable NYSE American rules and requirements. Upon receipt of shareholder approval, it is contemplated that the shareholders of Lineal will have voting control of the Company.
 
On December 30, 2015, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (as amended from time to time, the “Asset Purchase Agreement”) to acquire, from twenty-three different entities and individuals (the “Sellers”), working interests in producing properties and undeveloped acreage (the “Acquisition”), which acquisition transaction was completed on August 25, 2016. The assets acquired include varied interests in two largely contiguous acreage blocks in the liquids-rich Mid-Continent region. In connection with the closing of the acquisition, we assumed approximately $30.6 million of commercial bank debt, issued 520,387 shares of common stock to certain of the Sellers, issued 552,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock to one of the Sellers and its affiliate, and paid $4,975,000 in cash to certain of the Sellers. The effective date of the Acquisition was April 1, 2016.
 
On July 12, 2018, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (as amended, the “Sale Agreement”), as seller, with N&B Energy, LLC (“N&B Energy”) as purchaser, which entity is affiliated with Richard N. Azar II, the Company’s former Chief Executive Officer and former director, and Donnie B. Seay, the Company’s former director. Pursuant to the Sale Agreement, which closed September 26, 2018, effective August 1, 2018, the Company sold to N&B Energy a substantial portion of its assets, including all of the assets acquired pursuant to the Acquisition and certain other assets, other than the production payment and overriding royalty interests discussed below (the “Disposed Assets”). In consideration for the Disposed Assets, N&B Energy agreed to pay the Company $100 in cash, to assume the Company’s liabilities and contractual obligations in connection with the Disposed Assets (including lease and bonus payments), to assume all of the Company’s obligations and debt owed under its outstanding loan agreement with International Bank of Commerce (“IBC Bank”), which had a then outstanding principal balance of approximately $36.9 million. See also a more detailed description of this transaction under “Recent Events” - “N&B Energy Asset Disposition Agreement” and “Assumption Agreement”, below.

Our website address is http://www.camber.energy. Our fiscal year ends on the last day of March of each year. The information on, or that may be accessed through, our website is not incorporated by reference into this report and should not be considered a part of this report. We refer to the twelve-month periods ended March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2018 as our 2019 Fiscal Year and 2018 Fiscal Year, respectively.
 
As of March 31, 2019, the Company had leasehold interests (working interests) covering approximately 221 / 3,500 (net / gross) acres, producing from the Cline and Wolfberry formations. The remaining Texas acreage consists of leasehold covering approximately 555 / 638 (net / gross) acres and wellbores located in the Panhandle in Hutchinson County, Texas, which was acquired by the Company in March 2018.
 
As of March 31, 2019, Camber was producing an average of approximately 40.8 net barrels of oil equivalent per day (“Boepd”) from over 36 active well bores. The ratio between the gross and net production varies due to varied working interests and net revenue interests in each well. Our production sales totaled 113,685 Boe, net to our interest, for the year ended March 31, 2019. At March 31, 2019, Camber’s total estimated proved producing reserves were 155,376 Boe of which 120,590 Bbls were crude oil and NGL reserves, and 208,710 Mcf were natural gas reserves.
 
The Hutchinson County, Texas acquisition in March 2018 included interests in 48 gross non-producing well bores, 5 saltwater disposal wells, and the required infrastructure and equipment necessary to support future hydrocarbon production as well as approximately 555 net leasehold acres in Hutchinson County, Texas. Camber holds an interest in 25 producing wells in Glascock County and 11 in Hutchinson County.
 
At March 31, 2019, Camber’s total estimated proved reserves were 203,406 Boe, of which 124,520 Bbls were crude oil reserves, 44,100 Bbls were natural gas liquids and 208,710 Mcf were natural gas reserves. Approximately 76% of the Boe was proved producing.
 
As of March 31, 2019, Camber had no employees, but utilized independent contractors on an as-needed basis.
 
Material Events
 
October 2017 Purchase Agreement
 
On October 5, 2017, the Company and an accredited institutional investor with whom the Company had previously entered into equity and debt purchase agreements in 2016 (the “Investor”) entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (as amended to date, the “October 2017 Purchase Agreement”).
 
On October 5, 2017, in connection with the entry into the October 2017 Purchase Agreement, the Investor purchased 212 shares of Series C Preferred Stock for $2 million, and thereafter the Investor purchased 106 shares of Series C Preferred Stock for $1 million on November 21, 2017; 105 shares of Series C Preferred Stock for $1 million on December 27, 2017; 105 shares of Series C Preferred Stock for $1 million on January 31, 2018; 105 shares of Series C Preferred Stock for $1 million on February 22, 2018; 105 shares of Series C Preferred Stock for $1 million on March 9, 2018; 105 shares of Series C Preferred Stock for $1 million on April 10, 2018; and 105 shares of Series C Preferred Stock for $1 million on May 22, 2018, each under the October 2017 Purchase Agreement.
 
On March 2, 2018, the Company and the Investor entered into an amendment to the October 2017 Purchase Agreement (the “Amendment”), pursuant to which the Investor (a) waived any and all Trigger Events (as defined in the certificate of designation of the Series C Preferred Stock (the “Designation”)) that had occurred prior to March 2, 2018, (b) agreed that all calculations provided for in the Designation would be made as if no such Trigger Event had occurred, and (c) waived any right to receive any additional shares of common stock based upon any such Trigger Event, with respect to all shares of Series C Preferred Stock, other than any which have already been converted.
 
The Investor also agreed, pursuant to the Amendment, that the conversion rate of conversion premiums pursuant to the Designation would remain 95% of the average of the lowest 5 individual daily volume weighted average prices during the applicable Measuring Period (as defined in the Designation), not to exceed 100% of the lowest sales prices on the last day of the Measuring Period, less $0.05 per share of common stock, unless a triggering event has occurred, and that such $0.05 per share discount would not be adjusted in connection with the Company’s previously reported 1-for-25 reverse stock split affected on March 5, 2018. Notwithstanding the above, in no event will the value of the common stock pursuant to the foregoing be below the par value per share of the common stock ($0.001).

October 2018 Stock Purchase Agreement
 
On October 29, 2018, the Company and the Investor entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “October 2018 Purchase Agreement”), whereby the Investor purchased 369 shares of Series C Preferred Stock for $3.5 million.   The Series C Preferred Stock sold pursuant to the October 2018 Purchase Agreement have substantially similar terms as those sold pursuant to the October 2017 Purchase Agreement.
November 2018 Stock Purchase Agreement
 
On November 23, 2018 and effective November 23, 2018, the Company and the Investor entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “November 2018 Purchase Agreement”). The Series C Preferred Stock sold pursuant to the November 2018 Purchase Agreement have substantially similar terms as those sold pursuant to the October 2017 Purchase Agreement.
 
Under the terms of the November 2018 Purchase Agreement, the Investor agreed to purchase up to 2,941 shares of Series C Preferred Stock (the “Maximum Shares”) from the Company for an aggregate of $28 million, including agreeing to purchase 106 shares of Series C Preferred Stock within two business days of the satisfaction of the Closing Conditions (defined below), in consideration for $1 million (the “Initial Closing”), and additional shares of Series C Preferred Stock, in such amount(s) requested by the Company, from time to time, up to the remaining amount of Series C Preferred Stock available to be sold under the November 2018 Purchase Agreement, until the Maximum Shares are sold, subject in each case to the Closing Conditions.
 
Closing conditions required to be met in order to require the Investor to purchase the Series C Preferred Stock shares described above at each of the closings include, among other things, that (a) the Company’s common stock is required to be listed for and currently trading on the NYSE American market or a higher trading market; (b) except for the Initial Closing, the Company is required to be in compliance with all requirements to maintain such listing and there cannot be any notice of any suspension or delisting with respect to the trading of the shares of common stock on such trading market; (c) the Company is required to have duly authorized shares of common stock reserved for issuance to Investor in an amount equal to three times the number of shares sufficient to immediately issue all shares of common stock potentially issuable upon conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock sold to Investor (collectively, the “Conversion Shares”) and any other agreements with Investor; (d) except with regard to the Initial Closing, (i) an aggregate dollar trading volume of at least $10 million must have traded on NYSE American during regular trading hours, from the trading day after the immediately prior closing until the trading day immediately before the relevant closing, but expressly excluding all volume traded on any days that the Investor is prevented or delayed from reselling shares of common stock (“Excluded Days”), for each $1 million of Series C Preferred Stock shares which are sold at any closing after the Initial Closing; and (ii) the Company’s common stock is required to have a volume weighted average price on the NYSE American for the prior trading day of at least $0.10 per share of common stock (the “Floor Price”), (e) except with regard to the Initial Closing, the additional listing of all of the Conversion Shares must be approved by the NYSE American; and (f) except with regard to the Initial Closing, the Company must have provided written notice to the Investor of its intent to move forward with the applicable closing at least 10 days prior to the applicable closing date, provided that if any such conditions are not met on the date initially set for such closing, each closing will occur as soon thereafter as they are met, if ever (collectively, the “Closing Conditions”). The closing of the sales of Series C Preferred Stock as described above are subject to closing conditions which may not be met timely, if at all, and as such, we may not ever sell any shares of Series C Preferred Stock under the November 2018 Purchase Agreement. In the event a Trigger Event (as defined in the Designation (defined below) occurs, the Investor can terminate its obligation to acquire any additional shares of Series C Preferred Stock under the November 2018 Agreement, and the Company may terminate the Company’s right to sell shares of Series C Preferred Stock at any time.

On December 3, 2018, the Company entered into a First Amendment to Stock Purchase Agreement with the Investor (the “First Amendment”), pursuant to which the parties agreed to (a) amend the Initial Closing to be for a total of $2.5 million and 263 shares of Series C Preferred Stock, and (b) change the terms of the November 2018 Purchase Agreement to require that, notwithstanding the other closing conditions set forth in the November 2018 Purchase Agreement, for each sale of $800,000 of Series C Preferred Stock, in additional closings after the Initial Closing, that an aggregate dollar trading volume of at least $10 million must have traded on NYSE American during regular trading hours, from the trading day after the immediately prior closing until the trading day immediately before the relevant closing, but expressly excluding all volume traded on any days that the Investor is prevented or delayed from reselling shares of common stock.
 
On December 4, 2018, upon the satisfaction of the applicable closing conditions, the Investor acquired 263 shares of Series C Preferred Stock for a total of $2.5 million.
 
Consulting Agreements
 
On November 15, 2018, the Company entered into a consulting agreement with Regal Consulting, an investor relations firm, pursuant to which the firm agreed to provide the Company investor relations and consulting services, for a period of six months, in consideration for $28,000 and 8,000 restricted shares of the Company’s common stock, per month. In January 2019, the Company issued 16,000 shares of restricted common stock to Regal Consulting for the months of November and December 2018, which shares were issued during the year ended March 31, 2019.  On February 13, 2019, and effective on January 31, 2019, the Company entered into a First Amendment to the Consulting Agreement previously entered into with Regal Consulting.

A total of 150,000 of the Regal Shares have been issued as of the date of this filing for shares due for services between January and March 2019, and 300,000 shares remain to be issued pursuant to the terms of the agreement. As of March 31, 2019, the 104,000 shares had not been issued and a total of $41,800 had been accrued in common stock payable as of March 31, 2019. The shares were issued in May 2019. 
 
On February 13, 2019, the Company entered into a letter agreement with SylvaCap Media (“SylvaCap”), pursuant to which SylvaCap agreed to act as the Company’s non-exclusive digital marketing service provider.

Finally, pursuant to the Assumption Agreement, IBC Bank released and forever discharged the Company and CE Operating and each of their current and former officers, directors, and stockholders, from all covenants, agreements, obligations, claims and demands of any kind, whether in law or at equity, which IBC Bank then had, arising out of or related to the amounts which the Company owed to IBC Bank under the promissory note evidencing amounts owed to IBC Bank (the “Note”), Loan Agreement with IBC Bank or mortgages and/or under such documents or agreements, and further agreed to release the lien which IBC Bank then held on certain of the Company’s properties located in west Texas.
 
N&B Energy Sale Agreement Closing
 
On September 26, 2018, the transactions contemplated by the Sale Agreement closed and N&B Energy assumed all of the IBC Obligations (pursuant to the Assumption Agreement described above) and paid the Company $100 in cash, and the Company transferred ownership of the Disposed Assets to N&B Energy.
 
Notwithstanding the sale of the Disposed Assets, the Company retained its assets in Glasscock County and Hutchinson Counties, Texas and also retained a 12.5% production payment (effective until a total of $2.5 million has been received – of which none has been received as of the filing date); a 3% overriding royalty interest in its existing Okfuskee County, Oklahoma asset; and retained an overriding royalty interest on certain other undeveloped leasehold interests, pursuant to an Assignment of Production Payment and Assignment of Overriding Royalty Interests.
 
The effective date of the Sale Agreement is August 1, 2018. The Disposed Assets were assigned “as is” with all faults.
 
1-for 25 Reverse Stock Splits of Outstanding Common Stock
 
On March 1, 2018, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to the Company’s Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of Nevada to effect a 1-for-25 reverse stock split of all outstanding common stock shares of the Company (the “Amendment”). The reverse stock split was effective on March 5, 2018. The effect of the reverse stock split was to combine each 25 shares of outstanding common stock into one new share, with no change in authorized shares or par value per share, and to reduce the number of common stock shares outstanding from approximately 103.5 million shares to approximately 4.1 million shares (prior to rounding). Proportional adjustments were made to the conversion and exercise prices of the Company’s outstanding convertible preferred stock, warrants and stock options, and to the number of shares issued and issuable under the Company’s stock incentive plans. The reverse stock split did not affect any stockholder’s ownership percentage of the Company’s common stock, except to the limited extent that the reverse stock split resulted in any stockholder owning a fractional share. Fractional shares of common stock were rounded up to the nearest whole share based on each holder’s aggregate ownership of the Company. The effect of the reverse stock split has been retroactively reflected throughout this report.

On December 20, 2018, the Company filed a Certificate of Change with the Secretary of State of Nevada to effect a 1-for-25 reverse stock split of the Company’s (a) authorized shares of common stock (from 500,000,000 shares to 20,000,000 shares); and (b) issued and outstanding shares of common stock. The reverse stock split was effective on December 24, 2018. The effect of the reverse stock split was to combine each 25 shares of outstanding common stock into one new share, with a proportionate 1-for-25 reduction in the Company’s authorized shares of common stock, but no change in the par value per share of the common stock. Proportional adjustments were made to the conversion and exercise prices of the Company’s outstanding convertible preferred stock (subject to the terms thereof), warrants and stock options, and to the number of shares issued and issuable under the Company’s stock incentive plans. Fractional shares of common stock were rounded up to the nearest whole share based on each holder’s aggregate ownership of the Company. All issued and outstanding shares of common stock, conversion terms of preferred stock (subject to the terms thereof), options and warrants to purchase common stock and per share amounts contained in the financial statements, have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the reverse split for all periods presented.
 
Increase in Authorized Shares of Common Stock
 
Effective on April 10, 2019, we filed, with the Secretary of State of Nevada, a Certificate of Amendment to the Company’s Articles of Incorporation to increase the number of the Company’s authorized shares of common stock, $0.001 per value per share, from 20,000,000 shares to 250,000,000 shares.
Series B Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock Conversion
 
On May 15, 2019, the Company entered into an Agreed Conversion Agreement (the “Conversion Agreement”) with the then holder of all 44,000 shares of the Company’s then outstanding Series B Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Series B Preferred Stock”). Pursuant to the Conversion Agreement, all of the Series B Preferred Stock was agreed to be converted into 503 shares of the Company’s common stock pursuant to the stated terms of such Series B Preferred Stock, in consideration for $25,000 in cash. The holder also provided us a release in connection with certain of his rights under the Series B Preferred Stock (including any and all accrued and unpaid dividends) and certain other matters.
 
As a result of the Conversion Agreement, the Company has no shares of Series B Preferred Stock issued or outstanding, and an aggregate of $1,100,000 of the liquidation preference of the Series B Preferred Stock was terminated and released.
 
Industry Segments
 
Camber Energy’s operations are all crude oil and natural gas exploration and production related.
 
Operations and Oil and Gas Properties
 
We have operated and invested in areas that are known to be productive, with a reasonably established production history, in order to decrease geological and exploratory risk. With the closing of the Acquisition in October 2016, the Company acquired over 13,000 net acres in producing fields located primarily in the Mid-Continent region of Oklahoma including Payne, Lincoln and Logan Counties, along with a small amount of interest in production located in Glasscock County, Texas. The Mid-Continent assets produce from a liquids-rich, gas reservoir known as the Hunton formation. These properties include interests in four different fields, of which one was operated by Camber and the other three are non-operated.
 
Our Glasscock County, Texas properties produced oil and gas primarily from the Wolfberry, Cline and Fusselman formations and are all non-operated.
 
In January 2018, the Company acquired approximately 3,000 leasehold acres in Okfuskee County, Oklahoma which includes eight currently producing wells and three salt water disposal wells (as described above).
 
In March 2018, the Company acquired an interest in 48 gross non-producing well bores, five salt water disposal wells and approximately 555 net leasehold acres in Hutchinson County, Texas (as described above).

On September 26, 2018, the transactions contemplated by the Sale Agreement (described above) closed and N&B Energy assumed all of the IBC Obligations (pursuant to the Assumption Agreement described above) and paid the Company $100 in cash, and the Company transferred ownership of the Disposed Assets (defined above, constituting a substantial portion of its assets) to N&B Energy. Notwithstanding the sale of the Disposed Assets, which included approximately 18,000 net acres, the Company retained its assets in Glasscock County and Hutchinson Counties, Texas, and also retained a 12.5% production payment (effective until a total of $2.5 million has been received – of which none has been received as of the filing date); a 3% overriding royalty interest in its existing Okfuskee County, Oklahoma asset; and retained an overriding royalty interest on certain other undeveloped leasehold interests.
 
The Company intends to pursue additional acquisition opportunities in the energy services sector whether the Lineal transaction (discussed above) closes or not, as the primary focus of its growth strategy.

Marketing
 
As of the date of this filing, we operate exclusively in the onshore United States oil and natural gas industry. Our crude oil and natural gas production sales are to gatherers and marketers with national reputations. Our sales are made on a month-to-month basis, and title transfer occurs when the oil is loaded onto the purchaser’s truck. Crude oil prices realized from production sales are indexed to published posted refinery prices, and to published crude indexes with adjustments on a contract basis.
 
We generally sell a significant portion of our oil and gas production to a relatively small number of customers. For the year ended March 31, 2019, our consolidated revenues were from the sale of oil, gas and natural gas liquids under marketing contracts primarily with Superior Pipeline Company, Scissortail Energy, LLC and Apache Corporation. We are not dependent upon any one purchaser and have alternative purchasers available at competitive market prices if there is disruption in services or other events that cause us to search for other ways to sell our production.
 
During the year ended March 31, 2019, three customers accounted for 84% of our total revenues and during the year ended March 31, 2018, two customers accounted for 72% of our total revenues. We do not believe the loss of any customer will have a material effect on the Company because alternative customers are readily available.
 
Competition
 
We are in direct competition for properties with numerous oil and natural gas companies and partnerships exploring various areas of Texas, Oklahoma and elsewhere. Many competitors are large, well-known oil and natural gas and/or energy companies, although no single entity dominates the industry. Many of our competitors possess greater financial and personnel resources, enabling them to identify and acquire more economically desirable energy producing properties and drilling prospects than us. Additionally, there is competition from other fuel choices to supply the energy needs of consumers and industry.
Regulation
 
Our operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal, state and local levels. These regulations include requiring permits for the drilling of wells; maintaining hazard prevention, health and safety plans; submitting notification and receiving permits related to the presence, use and release of certain materials incidental to oil and natural gas operations; and regulating the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the use, transportation, storage and disposal of fluids and materials used in connection with drilling and production activities, surface plugging and abandonment of wells and the transporting of production. Our operations are also subject to various conservation matters, including the number of wells which may be drilled in a unit and the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties. In this regard, some states allow the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration, while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases, which may make it more difficult to develop oil and gas properties. In addition, state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells, generally limiting the venting or flaring of natural gas, and impose certain requirements regarding the ratable purchase of production. The effect of these regulations is to possibly limit the amounts of oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill.
 
7

 

In the United States, legislation affecting the oil and natural gas industry has been pervasive and is under constant review for amendment or expansion. Pursuant to such legislation, numerous federal, state and local departments and agencies issue recommended new and extensive rules and regulations binding on the oil and natural gas industry, some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply. These laws and regulations have a significant impact on oil and natural gas drilling, natural gas processing plants and production activities, increasing the cost of doing business and, consequently, affect profitability. Insomuch as new legislation affecting the oil and natural gas industry is common-place and existing laws and regulations are frequently amended or reinterpreted, we may be unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with these laws and regulations. We consider the cost of environmental protection a necessary and manageable part of our business. We have historically been able to plan for and comply with new environmental initiatives without materially altering our operating strategies.
 
Insurance Matters
 
We maintain insurance coverage which we believe is reasonable per the standards of the oil and natural gas industry. It is common for companies in these industries to not insure fully against all risks associated with their operations either because such insurance is unavailable or because premium costs are considered prohibitive. A material loss not fully covered by insurance could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We maintain insurance at industry customary levels to limit our financial exposure in the event of a substantial environmental claim resulting from sudden, unanticipated and accidental discharges of certain prohibited substances into the environment. Such insurance might not cover the complete amount of such a claim and would not cover fines or penalties for a violation of an environmental law.
Other Matters
 
Environmental. Our exploration, development, and production of oil and natural gas, including our operation of saltwater injection and disposal wells, are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. Such laws and regulations can increase the costs of planning, designing, installing and operating oil, natural gas, and disposal wells. Our domestic activities are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations, including but not limited to, the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA”), the Clean Water Act (“CWA”), the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”), the Clean Air Act (“CAA”), and the Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”), as well as state regulations promulgated under comparable state statutes. We are also subject to regulations governing the handling, transportation, storage, and disposal of naturally occurring radioactive materials that are found in our oil and gas operations. Civil and criminal fines and penalties may be imposed for non-compliance with these environmental laws and regulations. Additionally, these laws and regulations require the acquisition of permits or other governmental authorizations before undertaking certain activities, limit or prohibit other activities because of protected areas or species, and impose substantial liabilities for cleanup of pollution.
 
Under the OPA, a release of oil into water or other areas designated by the statute could result in us being held responsible for the costs of remediating such a release, certain OPA specified damages, and natural resource damages. The extent of that liability could be extensive, as set forth in the statute, depending on the nature of the release. A release of oil in harmful quantities or other materials into water or other specified areas could also result in us being held responsible under the CWA for the costs of remediation, and civil and criminal fines and penalties.
 
CERCLA and comparable state statutes, also known as “Superfund” laws, can impose joint and several and retroactive liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons for the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. In practice, cleanup costs are usually allocated among various responsible parties. Potentially liable parties include site owners or operators, past owners or operators under certain conditions, and entities that arrange for the disposal or treatment of, or transport hazardous substances found at the site. Although CERCLA, as amended, currently exempts petroleum, including but not limited to, crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, from the definition of hazardous substance, our operations may involve the use or handling of other materials that may be classified as hazardous substances under CERCLA. Furthermore, the exemption may not be preserved in future amendments of the act, if any.

RCRA and comparable state and local requirements impose standards for the management, including treatment, storage, and disposal, of both hazardous and non-hazardous solid wastes. We generate hazardous and non-hazardous solid waste in connection with our routine operations. From time to time, proposals have been made that would reclassify certain oil and natural gas wastes, including wastes generated during drilling and production operations, as “hazardous wastes” under RCRA, which would make such solid wastes subject to much more stringent handling, transportation, storage, disposal, and clean-up requirements. This development could have a significant impact on our operating costs. While state laws vary on this issue, state initiatives to further regulate oil and natural gas wastes could have a similar impact. Because oil and natural gas exploration and production, and possibly other activities, have been conducted at some of our properties by previous owners and operators, materials from these operations remain on some of the properties and in some instances, require remediation. In addition, in certain instances, we have agreed to indemnify sellers of producing properties from which we have acquired reserves against certain liabilities for environmental claims associated with such properties. While we do not believe that costs to be incurred by us for compliance and remediating previously or currently owned or operated properties will be material, there can be no guarantee that such costs will not result in material expenditures.
 
Additionally, in the course of our routine oil and natural gas operations, surface spills and leaks, including casing leaks, of oil or other materials occur, and we incur costs for waste handling and environmental compliance. Moreover, we are able to control directly the operations of only those wells for which we act as the operator. Management believes that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations.
 
In response to liabilities associated with these activities, accruals are established when reasonable estimates are possible. Such accruals would primarily include estimated costs associated with remediation. We have used discounting to present value in determining our accrued liabilities for environmental remediation or well closure, but no material claims for possible recovery from third party insurers or other parties related to environmental costs have been recognized in our financial statements. We adjust the accruals when new remediation responsibilities are discovered and probable costs become estimable, or when current remediation estimates must be adjusted to reflect new information.
 
We do not anticipate being required in the near future to expend amounts that are material in relation to our total capital expenditures program by reason of environmental laws and regulations, but inasmuch as such laws and regulations are frequently changed, we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance. More stringent laws and regulations protecting the environment may be adopted in the future and we may incur material expenses in connection with environmental laws and regulations in the future.
 
Occupational Health and Safety. We are also subject to laws and regulations concerning occupational safety and health. Due to the continued changes in these laws and regulations, and the judicial construction of many of them, we are unable to predict with any reasonable degree of certainty our future costs of complying with these laws and regulations. We consider the cost of safety and health compliance a necessary and manageable part of our business. We have been able to plan for and comply with new initiatives without materially altering our operating strategies.
 
Hydraulic Fracturing. Vast quantities of natural gas, natural gas liquids and oil deposits exist in deep shale and other unconventional formations. It is customary in our industry to recover these resources through the use of hydraulic fracturing, combined with horizontal drilling. Hydraulic fracturing is the process of creating or expanding cracks, or fractures, in deep underground formations using water, sand and other additives pumped under high pressure into the formation. As with the rest of the industry, we use hydraulic fracturing as a means to increase the productivity of almost every well that we drill and complete. These formations are generally geologically separated and isolated from fresh ground water supplies by thousands of feet of impermeable rock layers. We follow applicable legal requirements for groundwater protection in our operations that are subject to supervision by state and federal regulators (including the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) on federal acreage). Furthermore, our well construction practices require the installation of multiple layers of protective steel casing surrounded by cement that are specifically designed and installed to protect freshwater aquifers by preventing the migration of fracturing fluids into aquifers.

Injection rates and pressures are required to be monitored in real time at the surface during our hydraulic fracturing operations. Pressure is required to be monitored on both the injection string and the immediate annulus to the injection string. Hydraulic fracturing operations are required to be shut down if an abrupt change occurs to the injection pressure or annular pressure. These aspects of hydraulic fracturing operations are designed to prevent a pathway for the fracturing fluid to contact any aquifers during the hydraulic fracturing operations.
 
Hydraulic fracture stimulation requires the use of water. We use fresh water or recycled produced water in our fracturing treatments in accordance with applicable water management plans and laws. Several proposals have previously been presented to the U.S. Congress that, if implemented, would either prohibit or restrict the practice of hydraulic fracturing or subject the process to regulation under the Safe Drinking Water Act. Several states have previously considered, or are currently considering, legislation to regulate hydraulic fracturing practices that could impose more stringent permitting, transparency, and well construction requirements on hydraulic-fracturing operations or otherwise seek to ban fracturing activities altogether. Hydraulic fracturing of wells and subsurface water disposal are also under public and governmental scrutiny due to potential environmental and physical impacts, including possible contamination of groundwater and drinking water and possible links to earthquakes. In addition, some municipalities have significantly limited or prohibited drilling activities and/or hydraulic fracturing, or are considering doing so.
 
Restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could make it prohibitive to conduct our operations, and also reduce the amount of oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas that we are ultimately able to produce in commercial quantities from our properties.
 
The Endangered Species Act. The Endangered Species Act (“ESA”) restricts activities that may affect areas that contain endangered or threatened species or their habitats. While some of our assets and lease acreage may be located in areas that are designated as habitats for endangered or threatened species, we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the ESA. However, the designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species in areas where we intend to conduct construction activity could materially limit or delay our plans.
Global Warming and Climate Change. Various state governments and regional organizations are considering enacting new legislation and promulgating new regulations governing or restricting the emission of greenhouse gases from stationary sources such as our equipment and operations. Legislative and regulatory proposals for restricting greenhouse gas emissions or otherwise addressing climate change could require us to incur additional operating costs and could adversely affect demand for the natural gas and oil that we sell. The potential increase in our operating costs could include new or increased costs to obtain permits, operate and maintain our equipment and facilities, install new emission controls on our equipment and facilities, acquire allowances to authorize our greenhouse gas emissions, pay taxes related to our greenhouse gas emissions and administer and manage a greenhouse gas emissions program.
Taxation. Our operations, as is the case in the petroleum industry generally, are significantly affected by federal tax laws. Federal, as well as state, tax laws have many provisions applicable to corporations which could affect our future tax liabilities.
Commitments and Contingencies. We are liable for future restoration and abandonment costs associated with our oil and gas properties. These costs include future site restoration, post closure and other environmental exit costs. The costs of future restoration and well abandonment have not been determined in detail. State regulations require operators to post bonds that assure that well sites will be properly plugged and abandoned. We currently operate only in Texas, which requires a security bond based on the number of wells we operate. Management views this as a necessary requirement for operations and does not believe that these costs will have a material adverse effect on our financial position as a result of this requirement.

Condensate. Liquid hydrocarbons associated with the production of a primarily natural gas reserve.
 
Conventional resources. Natural gas or oil that is produced by a well drilled into a geologic formation in which the reservoir and fluid characteristics permit the natural gas or oil to readily flow to the wellbore.
 
Developed acreage. The number of acres that are allocated or assignable to productive wells.
 
Development well. A well drilled into a proved oil or natural gas reservoir to the depth of a stratigraphic horizon known to be productive.
 
Estimated ultimate recovery or EUR. Estimated ultimate recovery is the sum of reserves remaining as of a given date and cumulative production as of that date.

Farmin or farmout. An agreement under which the owner of a working interest in an oil or natural gas lease assigns the working interest or a portion of the working interest to another party who desires to drill on the leased acreage. Generally, the assignee is required to drill one or more wells in order to earn its interest in the acreage. The assignor usually retains a royalty or reversionary interest in the lease. The interest received by an assignee is a “farmin” while the interest transferred by the assignor is a “farmout.”
 
FERC. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

Horizontal drilling or well. A drilling operation in which a portion of the well is drilled horizontally within a productive or potentially productive formation. This operation typically yields a horizontal well that has the ability to produce higher volumes than a vertical well drilled in the same formation. A horizontal well is designed to replace multiple vertical wells, resulting in lower capital expenditures for draining like acreage and limiting surface disruption.
 
Liquids. Liquids, or natural gas liquids, are marketable liquid products including ethane, propane, butane and pentane resulting from the further processing of liquefiable hydrocarbons separated from raw natural gas by a natural gas processing facility.

Producing well, production well or productive well. A well that is found to be capable of producing hydrocarbons in sufficient quantities such that proceeds from the sale of the well’s production exceed production-related expenses and taxes.
 
Properties. Natural gas and oil wells, production and related equipment and facilities and natural gas, oil or other mineral fee, leasehold and related interests.
 
Prospect. A specific geographic area which, based on supporting geological, geophysical or other data and also preliminary economic analysis using reasonably anticipated prices and costs, is considered to have potential for the discovery of commercial hydrocarbons.
 
Proved developed reserves. Proved reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells and facilities and by existing operating methods.
 
Proved reserves. Reserves of oil and natural gas that have been proved to a high degree of certainty by analysis of the producing history of a reservoir and/or by volumetric analysis of adequate geological and engineering data.

Royalty interest. An interest in an oil and natural gas lease that gives the owner of the interest the right to receive a portion of the production from the leased acreage (or of the proceeds of the sale thereof), but generally does not require the owner to pay any portion of the costs of drilling or operating the wells on the leased acreage. Royalties may be either landowner’s royalties, which are reserved by the owner of the leased acreage at the time the lease is granted, or overriding royalties, which are usually reserved by an owner of the leasehold in connection with a transfer to a subsequent owner.
 
2-D seismic. The method by which a cross-section of the earth’s subsurface is created through the interpretation of reflecting seismic data collected along a single source profile.
 
3-D seismic. The method by which a three-dimensional image of the earth’s subsurface is created through the interpretation of reflection seismic data collected over a surface grid. 3-D seismic surveys allow for a more detailed understanding of the subsurface than do 2-D seismic surveys and contribute significantly to field appraisal, exploitation and production.
 
Trend. A region of oil and/or natural gas production, the geographic limits of which have not been fully defined, having geological characteristics that have been ascertained through supporting geological, geophysical or other data to contain the potential for oil and/or natural gas reserves in a particular formation or series of formations.
 
Unconventional resource play. A set of known or postulated oil and or natural gas resources or reserves warranting further exploration which are extracted from (a) low-permeability sandstone and shale formations and (b) coalbed methane. These plays require the application of advanced technology to extract the oil and natural gas resources.
 
Undeveloped acreage. Lease acreage on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of oil and natural gas, regardless of whether such acreage contains proved reserves. Undeveloped acreage is usually considered to be all acreage that is not allocated or assignable to productive wells.
 
13

Vertical well. A hole drilled vertically into the earth from which oil, natural gas or water flows are pumped.
 
Volumetric reserve analysis. A technique used to estimate the amount of recoverable oil and natural gas. It involves calculating the volume of reservoir rock and adjusting that volume for the rock porosity, hydrocarbon saturation, formation volume factor and recovery factor.
 
Wellbore. The hole made by a well.
 
WTI or West Texas Intermediate. A grade of crude oil used as a benchmark in oil pricing. This grade is described as light because of its relatively low density, and sweet because of its low sulfur content.
 
Working interest. The operating interest that gives the owner the right to drill, produce and conduct operating activities on the property and receive a share of production.
