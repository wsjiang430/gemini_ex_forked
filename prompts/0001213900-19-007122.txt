Water is our most valuable resource, and the mission of OriginClear is to improve the quality of water and help return it to its original and clear condition.
 
OriginClear Group™
 
Outsourcing is a fast-growing reality in water treatment. Tougher regulations, water scarcities and general outsourcing trends are driving industrial and agricultural water treatment users to delegate their water problem to service providers. As Global Water Intelligence pointed out in their report on October 30, 2015, “Water is often perceived as a secondary importance, with end-users increasingly wanting to focus solely on their own core business. This is driving a move away from internal water personnel towards external service experts to take control of water aspects.” External service experts are typically small–privately owned and locally operated. Consolidating these companies could lead to enormous economies of scale through sharing of best practices, technologies, and customers.
 
Decentralization is an even greater trend in water, similar to what has been seen in energy decentralization through solar and wind off-grid generation.
 
​ Water is becoming increasingly more scarce. ​McKinsey’s Transforming ​Water Economies ​forecasts that ​ “without ​action, global ​water demand ​could outstrip ​supply by up to ​40 percent by ​2030.” ​Furthermore, existing water infrastructure in the United States is aging and water loss is increasing.
 
According to ​Lux Research, ​updating our ​national water ​infrastructure ​will require an ​investment of $​270 billion ​– money ​that will be ​hard to pull ​together for ​projects that ​could take ​decades to ​complete. ​In the meantime, centralized water systems are forcing water users to treat their own ​water with ​small, modular ​water treatment ​systems.

2018 Group Development Milestones
 
On May 17, 2018, the Company entered into a licensing agreement with Water Technologies International, Inc. (OTC: WTII), which commercializes the innovative SIMPOD portable waste water treatment plant, and has developed a line of atmospheric water generators. The licensing agreement gave Water Technologies access to OriginClear’s patented electrochemical treatment process, Electro Water Separation with Advanced Oxidation™ (EWS:AOx™), and support to enter the oil and gas and other markets. The Technical Assistance Program fee, another part of OriginClear’s licensing agreement, was paid to OCLN in WTII preferred shares. The license also calls for standard royalty payments to OriginClear.
 
On June 22, 2018, OriginClear signed an exclusive worldwide licensing agreement with Daniel “Dan” Early for his proprietary technology for prefabricated water transport and treatment systems. On July 19, 2018, the Company launched its Modular Water Treatment Division around Mr. Early’s technology and perspective customers. The Company has funded the development of this division with internal cash flow. 


Progressive Water Treatment Inc.
 
On October 1, 2015, the Company completed its acquisition of 100 percent of Dallas-based Progressive Water Treatment Inc. (“PWT”), a fast-growing designer, builder and service provider for a wide range of industrial water treatment applications.


With the PWT and future potential acquisitions, the creation of the Modular Water Systems division, and integrating its proprietary technology, OriginClear aims to offer a complementary, end-to-end offering to serve growing corporate demand for outsourced water treatment. OriginClear acquired PWT through the exchange of all issued and outstanding shares of PWT for 10,000 shares of the OriginClear’s newly designated Series B Preferred Stock.
 
PWT’s Business
 
Since 1995, PWT has been designing and manufacturing a complete line of water treatment systems for municipal, industrial and pure water applications. PWT designs and manufactures a complete line of water treatment systems for municipal, industrial and pure water applications. Its uniqueness is its ability to gain an in-depth understanding of customer’s needs and then to design and build an integrated water treatment system using multiple technologies to provide a complete, not partial solution. PWT has a lengthy history of solid sales and profits.
 
To solve customer needs, PWT utilizes a wide range of technologies, including chemical injection, media filters, membrane, ion exchange and SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) technology in turnkey systems. The company also offers a broad range of services including maintenance contracts, retrofits and replacement assistance. In addition, PWT rents equipment in contracts of varying duration. Customers are primarily served in the United States and Canada, with the company’s reach extending worldwide from Siberia to Argentina to the Middle East.
 
PWT is also a certified manufacturer of products using OriginClear’s proprietary Electro Water Separation™ and Advanced Oxidation (AOx™) technologies, building these on behalf of OriginClear licensees.
 
PWT Developments 
 
On March 30,, 2018, the Company announced that PWT had completed the construction and shipment of a 30 gallon per minute (gpm) drinking water treatment system in Baranquilla, Colombia for the religious mission of a US-based Church. In addition to this Colombia shipment, PWT has built and supplied a total of five drinking water treatment systems to local contractors for installation at Church missions in Peru, Argentina, San Salvador and the Philippines. The systems have all been similar and typically consist of chlorine feed, softener, carbon filters, ultraviolet disinfection and sub-micron filtration. These components are designed to remove hardness and organics from the local aquifer and are based on a Church specification naming PWT as the only approved manufacturer.
 
On August 16, 2018, OriginClear management, and water industry partners, carried out strategic planning at OriginClear’s First Water Conference, which was held at the company’s Los Angeles headquarters.

In the first quarter of 2019, the Company grew the manufacturer’s representative network of its operating units, Progressive Water Treatment (“PWT”) (www.progressivewater.com) and Modular Water Systems (“MWS”) (www.modularwater.com).


Modular Water Systems
 
On July 19, 2018, the Company announced the launch of its Modular Water Treatment Division, offering a unique product line of prefabricated water transport and treatment systems. Daniel “Dan” Early P.E. (Professional Engineer) heads the new division and along with the intellectual property which the Company licensed exclusively worldwide for three years, brought a following of prospective customers. On July 25, 2018, MWS received its first order, for a brewery wastewater treatment plant.
 
With PWT and other companies as fabricators and assemblers, MWS designs, manufactures and delivers prefabricated water transport (pump stations) and wastewater treatment plant (“WWTP”) products to customers and end-users that have to clean their own wastewater. It uses Structurally Reinforced Thermoplastic (“SRTP”) materials to focus on patented developing water and wastewater collection, conveyance, and treatment systems that have high performance and sustainability. Typical customers may include schools, small communities, institutional facilities, real estate developments, factories, and industrial parks. Dan Early has pioneered the use of heavy reinforced plastic materials to create modular “water-systems-in-a-box”. Not only is reinforced thermoplastic faster and cheaper to build, but it can have three times the lifespan, or more, compared with concrete-and-steel construction. His inventions have led to the patented Wastewater System & Method which OriginClear has licensed exclusively for the world.
 
Dan Early has been designing and building prepackaged pump stations and municipal wastewater treatment systems for over five years, with a career background of more than two decades of water engineering experience.
 
MWS designs, manufactures and implements advanced prepackaged wastewater treatment, pump stations and custom systems with primary focus on decentralized opportunities away from the very competitive large municipal wastewater treatment plants. These decentralized opportunities include: rural communities, housing developments, industrial sites, schools and many more.
 
MWS’s uniqueness is its use of SRTP as the tank or enclosure for its pump stations and wastewater treatment systems. SRTP is an emerging material technology presently not utilized in the engineered solution market relative to water and wastewater systems. SRTP represents a material that is corrosion resistant, durable, robust, and cost effective; it overcomes the extreme limitations associated with reinforced concrete (extremely heavy and hard to transport), painted or stainless steel (highly corrodible, expensive, and with a very limited continuous service life), and fiberglass (extremely brittle, hard to detail, and expensive). The SRTP technology is not only proven to perform, it has been commercialized.

OriginClear intends for PWT to make use of the SRTP tank and enclosure technology for products that integrate its core EWS/AOx™ technology.
 
Expansion of the PWT and MWS Business-Lines
 
Beginning with its first installation, PWT built MWS components. The two units are now in the process of integrating their operations fully, so they can benefit synergistically from each other’s technology and market opportunities building greater sales and profits. In addition, by integrating MWS’s engineering and manufacturing into the PWT facility, significant efficiencies and savings can occur.
 
Subject to obtaining needed funding, we will seek to develop the combined PWT/MWS business with, among other things, additional staffing particularly sales managers, engineers and project managers. In addition, we plan to expand the PWT facility with more engineering/project management space and another assembly building for MWS with fabrication tooling.


As reported on February 5, 2019, and expected to substantially complete in April 2019, OriginClear has expanded its manufacturer’s representative network to serve both PWT and MWS for customer lead generation.
 
On March 5, 2019, the Company reported that Dallas-based Aspen Water Inc., (www.aspenwater.com) (“AWI”), a global leader in rapid-deployment water treatment systems, presented OriginClear products under its own brand at trade shows in Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Baghdad.
 
The first unit which AWI private-labeled was the EVERUS™ Military & Disaster Relief Wastewater Treatment System, designed by MWS to treat both black and grey water at field installations, scaling from 3,000 to 150,000 gallons per day. https://www.originclear.com/hubfs/pdf/mws-ewrs-flyer.pdf.
 
The second product AWI private-labeled was a design for a 100,000 gallon per day desalination system, which AWI developed in collaboration with PWT for a large potential governmental contract in the region. It is now being offered more widely to solve pressing desalination problems in a compact and efficient footprint.
 
PRODUCTS, TECHNOLOGY AND SERVICES
 
Overview: PWT
 
PWT’s uniqueness lies in is its experience and expertise in building water treatment systems that are a complete solution for its customers using components and process technology from other equipment suppliers. This is a real benefit to its customers who too frequently are given partial solutions from other vendors who are trying to sell their own products. An example is a customer who only receives a pump and a filter cartridge, when they also need an ultrafiltration membrane system.

Overview: MWS
 
MWS has two functional product lines:
 

1. | Pump stations for conveying water from one location to another and
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Prepackaged wastewater treatment systems to treat grey water or blackwater.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Both product lines utilize SRTP pipe to replace the custom designed and custom constructed concrete and steel systems used worldwide. The SRTP pipe is usually seen next to highways before it is buried for drainage.
 
SRTP includes both a profile wall design for self-standing (modulus) strength, and steel reinforced high-density polyethylene plastic. The use of SRTP allows: standardization of design, off-site manufacturing, up to a 100-year service life, faster on-site installation, corrosion resistance, reduced weight and lower costs. As a result, MWS’s pump stations and prepackaged waste water treatment processing (WWTP) systems cost less to manufacture and install, and have up to 3x or more the service life of conventional materials of construction.
 
EveraMOD
 
The EveraMOD Prepackaged Pump Station product line is designed for public and private sectors. Those sectors include: towns, counties, cities, townships, state agencies, federal agencies, private individuals, commercial entities, industrial facilities, agriculture facilities to pump wastewater or clean water for purposes such as wastewater transfer, water conveyance, and irrigation.

In the simplest description a pump station consists of a wet well (SRTP pipe) buried vertically in the ground to collect the water pumped or drained from another source; a water pump in the wet well conveys the water to another location; level sensors control the pumps and valves.
 
The capacity of the EveraMOD pump station is determined by the capacity of the pumps in the wet well of the station, but typically process up to 1,500 gallons per minute. The wet well (SRTP pipe) can range up to 11 feet diameter and up to 50 feet long. The wet well depth is set to allow drainage into the well. MWS’s pump stations are typically customized per the customer’s requirements and will be completely assembled and tested in PWT’s facility.
 
EveraMOD includes a control box for power and controls. It is a standalone system. After factory testing, the pump station can then be loaded on a flatbed truck, transported to the site, dropped in a previously-prepared hole and water & power connected and buried.
 

Figure 1: The EveraMOD Prepackaged Pump Station
 
The capital and installation cost is typically 30% lower than standard concrete pump stations. However, the much more significant benefit is to the 100-year life and the resulting dramatic life cycle cost reduction.
 
Everus and EveraSKID
 
MWS’s prepackaged Everus™ and Everaskid™ Waste Water Treatment Systems are designed for any applications where the removal of organic material is required, such as: municipal wastewater, agriculture, food & beverage, potable water, irrigation and many industrial applications. The key to success is decentralization. Any location that is remote from an existing large municipal water treatment is an opportunity.

Everus Wastewater Treatment Systems are fabricated from structurally reinforced thermoplastic (SRTP) pipe as the horizontal vessel that houses the water treatment processes. Everus products are buried installations.
 

Figure 2: The Installation Process.
 
EveraSKID Wastewater Treatment Systems are fabricated using ISO shipping containers with heavy plastic inner liners as the horizontal vessel that houses the water treatment processes.
 
EveraSKIDs are above-ground installations. The choice is based on customer preference.
 

Figure 3: EveraSKID Wastewater Treatment Systems
 
Both the Everus and EveraSKID systems have capacities from 1,000 GPD up to 250,000 GPD. They are factory built & tested and designed for drop-in-place installations. They can be used in residential developments, small rural towns, institutions like schools, industrial parks, industries, animal farms, craft breweries, wineries, and many more.
 
Both Everus and EveraSKID utilize internal processes/technologies as required to meet the customer’s needs, such as:
 

● | Membrane Bioreactors (MBR)
--+---------------------------

 
7

 


● | Moving Bed Bioreactors (MBBR)
--+------------------------------


● | Cloth filter Effluent Polishing
--+--------------------------------


● | Anaerobic Bioreactors & Biogas production
--+------------------------------------------


● | Metal and Ion precipitation & coagulation
--+------------------------------------------


● | FOG coalescing & removal
--+-------------------------


● | Aerobic Digestion
--+------------------


● | Sludge Thickening & Dewatering
--+-------------------------------

 
The Everus and EveraSKID system can be supplied with the EveraCon Accessory Building, a separate building to house ancillary equipment such as: blowers, chemical injection pumps or sterilizers. It can also be used to house motor starters, power supplies and controls. It also is factory assembled and tested so it ready to drop in place as the customer site. A major benefit to the customer is the single point of purchase for EveraMod, Everus and EverCon. The Everabox is typically constructed from an ISO container with exterior stucco, interior insulation and even a gabled roof if desired.
 
Patents
 
On June 25, 2018, Daniel Early granted the Company a worldwide, exclusive non-transferable license to intellectual property consisting of five issued US patents, and design software, CAD, marketing, design and specification documents (“Early IP”). We may contract with distribution channels (equipment distributors, oil service companies, water treatment companies, system integrators and engineering companies) of our choice to act on our behalf for the purpose of selling and integrating the Early IP.
 
The Early IP consists of combined protection on the materials and configurations of complete packaged water treatment systems, built into containers.

With the rising need for local, point-of-use or point-of-discharge water treatment solutions, the Modular Water Systems licensed IP family is the core to a portable, integrated, transportable, plug-and-play system that, unlike other packaged solutions, can be manufactured in series, have a longer life and are more respectful of the environment.
 
The common feature of this IP family is the use of a construction material (Structurally Reinforced ThermoPlastics, SRTP), for the containers that is:
 

● | more durable: a 75 to 100-year life cycle as opposed to a few decades for metal, or 40 to 50 years maximum for concrete.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | easier to manufacture: vessels manufacturing process can be automated.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


● | recyclable and can be made out of biomaterials
--+-----------------------------------------------

 
In addition, patents US 8,372,274 and US 8,871,089 (1 and 3) relate to the use of vessels or containers made out of this material combined with a configuration of functional modules, or process, for general water treatment.
 
Other subsequent patents, while keeping the original claims and therefore making them stronger, focus on more targeted applications. These patents outline a given combination of modules engineered inside the vessel to address a specific water treatment challenge.

OriginClear intends to bring certain functions, such as roto-molding, in-house.
 
CUSTOMERS AND MARKETS
 

● | “There is growing evidence that we may already have arrived at “peak water” globally – with the concept becoming an inevitability given the rate of extraction of certain water systems. By 2030, according to Water 2030, demand will overshoot water supply by 40%, and close to half of the world’s population will be living in water-stressed areas. Water looks set to be a scarcer commodity than oil.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | “We believe that the global dynamics of water supply and demand mean that the water sector offers numerous growth opportunities for those with exposure to the value chain. By 2020, we estimate that the water industry could be worth well over US$1tn…” (Blue Revolution – global water primer, Bank of America/Merrill Lynch, 4 April 2014)”
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | “The size of the US domestic water and wastewater industry today is typically estimated at about $130 billion per year. (The Water Industry: A Closer Look at the Numbers, American Water Works Association, May 2011.)
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Current water and wastewater treatment infrastructure faces a crisis. The prohibitive cost of repairing buried and ageing infrastructure and the need to decrease energy use and waste in the water industry offers an opportunity for a complete design rethink. New technologies, often utilizing membranes, can decentralize water and wastewater infrastructure while improving water reuse by treating to a high standard at a small scale close to the source of generation. Additionally, new automated analytics offer solutions for these more complex decentralized solutions. (Lux Research: The Future of Decentralized Water, June 28, 2016). PWT has designed and fabricated water treatment systems for over twenty years. Major markets include:
 

● | Potable Water for Small Communities
--+------------------------------------


● | Recirculated and Makeup Boiler and Cooling Tower Water
--+-------------------------------------------------------


● | Produced Water & Frac Flowback Water
--+-------------------------------------

● | Environmental Water Treatment for Reuse
--+----------------------------------------

 
MWS focuses on municipal water conveyance and municipal waste water treatment, describing the water and wastewater treatment market as a pyramid with the major cities at the top, medium size cities stacked below them depending upon size and then the smaller towns, counties, cities, townships, state agencies, federal agencies, private individuals, commercial entities, industrial facilities, agriculture facilities at the base of the pyramid.
 
We believe there are more opportunities at the base of the pyramid, perhaps in the range of five figures in the USA alone. The base of the pyramid is the decentralized market opportunity now being pursued. Focusing on the base of the pyramid also avoids the very competitive, low-profit and slow-growing market in the big city municipalities.
 
The market for MWS-engineered products and infrastructure solutions related to water and wastewater is extremely large and represents a multi-billion dollar per year industry in the United States alone; this market significantly grows when Canada and Mexico are considered as part of an integrated North American industry segment. As civil infrastructure ages and fails and as the costs for new and replacement infrastructure increase year over year, we believe engineers and end-users will search for new ways and methods of deploying water and wastewater systems that are less expensive (CAPEX) to deliver and much less expensive to own and operate (OPEX) with the mission intent of substantially increasing the replacement intervals (Life Cycle) currently experienced by conventional materials of construction and conventional product delivery models. 
 
SALES AND MARKETING
 
PWT’s sales strategy differs from MWS’s efforts. PWT sales are very dependent upon relationships with past end-use customers and certain manufacturers’ representatives who have relationships with their regional end use customers. On the other hand, MWS’s sales strategy is based on developing relationships with consulting engineers and general contractors as opposed to end-use customers.
 
As MWS sales strategies develop, PWT believes it will gain recognition with various consulting engineers and general contractors. PWT and MWS are currently developing a stronger national representatives network to take advantage of the relationship the sales representatives have gained with engineers, contractors and end use customers.
 
Both PWT and MWS have substantial experience in the water & wastewater market and as well as: conventional technologies and their limitations, new technologies, the size and demand of the market and how products are specified and implemented. They also have a strong customer focus throughout the organization to discover and diagnose the customer needs, design and deliver comprehensive solutions.
 
We believe the keys to capitalizing on the market are visibility, relationships, market understanding, and direct access to the opportunities. Strong marketing programs are also essential, and include: websites with solutions & credibility, sales support tools like literature & webinars and trade show presence.
 
Water industry projects move slowly. Most product lines for each of PWT and MWS are considered “pipeline” products, and have a gestational period of 6 months to 3 years. We believe the best strategy to increase the pipeline of opportunities is to have more sales reps with relationships with engineers, contractors and end users.
 
In Q1 of 2019, the Company carried out an aggressive program of developing a national network of trained sales representatives which it intends to complete in April, 2019.

Competition
 
PWT shares the market with a large number of suppliers which also provide system integration using multiple technologies. These include California’s PureAqua, Florida’s Harn RO, and Illinois’ Membrane Specialists. We believe PWT’s market share differs from those competitors in areas such as regional focus, customer loyalty, market focus, limited sales representation and other. For instance, 80%+ of PureAqua’s business in the Middle East, Harn RO focuses on drinking water systems for medium to large cities in the SE, Membrane Specialist focuses on tubular membranes and many more examples.
 
The company is not aware of any direct competitors to MWS that are building complete water, wastewater treatment systems, and pump stations utilizing SRTP type materials. There are several manufacturers which build metal prepackaged systems; however these companies do not offer the range of treatment processes available through MWS. The major indirect competition continues to be custom designed and on-site constructed concrete & steel systems. Some fiberglass is used but is very difficult to detail, is brittle and again, has a limited life compared to SRTP systems.
 
While manufacturers of SRTP pipe could be competitors, none of MWS’s suppliers, other than Contech, for a short period of time, has or intends to sell comparable systems to MWS’s. Their focus is simply to sell miles of pipe.
 
In early April 2019, an SRTP manufacturer approached MWS with the intention of referring product inquiries for the systems MWS builds from its pipe material. The company intends to continue such synergies.
 
Growth Opportunities
 
National Sales Rep Network
 
In the first quarter of 2019, the Company worked to help PWT and MWS identify seasoned sales representatives across the country through recommendations from those with deep industry knowledge. Those particular representatives were contacted and meetings set to discuss the mutual opportunity. On February 5, 2019, the Company reported on initial positive results.
 
By the end of April 2019, we believe that twelve additional organizations will have signed agreements, building on the eight that PWT and MWS had in place at the beginning of 2019, for an aggregate total of seventy sales representatives. Training has already begun and new potential projects are already being presented to PWT and MWS. The challenge will be to respond to all of these new projects.
 
Additional sales managers, engineers and project managers will be needed for both PWT and MWS with additional production facilities necessary for PWT. The process of hiring additional personnel and obtaining additional facilities is underway.
 
Domestic versus International
 
The market opportunity for each of PWT and MWS is not limited to the United States. The US compared to the rest of the world, only represents 5% of the world’s population. In addition, a great deal of that population resides in undeveloped regions or regions with poor treatment systems. Implementing MWS’s and PWT’s decentralized technology throughout the world with joint ventures is a planned strategy that is expected to have a significant effect on revenue growth.
Standardization 
 
MWS, in particular is developing standardized designs and commoditized product engineering (by eliminating the custom consulting engineering work, you drive down overall project costs), the goal being to design a single product once and use said design as a blueprint for future products. Continue driving the standardization and completion of each product’s engineer technical package---use computer design algorithms and standard design approaches so that engineering costs may potentially decrease to less than 1% for each unit sold, with a long-term goal of less than 0.1%.
 
12

 

Sharing Technology & Projects
 
PWT’s systems remove suspended solids, oils, metals, and dissolved chemicals & salts. MWS’s focus is on the removal of organic contaminants. It is not uncommon for a waste stream of water to be contaminated with both inorganics and organics, for example, many current animal farms with large amounts of waste effluent that currently is pumped to lagoons that are no longer meeting environmental standards. In the alternative, the water can be treated in-line with MWS products to remove the organics, then PWT’s systems used to remove dissolved inorganics to create water suitable for irrigation or drinking water for the animals. In addition, OriginClear’s own proprietary technologies have been shown to successfully treat problems such as animal farm effluents.
 
By combining these technologies, including OriginClear’s proprietary technology as it matures, the offering to their customers becomes stronger and more effective. And both companies benefit from a new opportunity.
 
More Specific Opportunities for PWT
 
We are interested in exploring the following opportunities, but we have no timeline for their implementation:



● | Build and promote a fleet of rental treatment systems mounted on trailers or containers. It is very common for a rental to be purchased outright. As a result, PWT’s rental fleet must be continuously replenished.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Develop a standard digital product line through 3-D CAD programs and market it as virtual inventory, with components on hand and engineering already done.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Expand production capabilities with new equipment that would lower the labor cost of production. For instance, acquire tooling that would minimize the hand tool labor.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Develop more services business such as membrane cleaning or resin regeneration.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
More Specific Opportunities for MWS
 
MWS has developed a grey/black water treatment system for forward operating basis called Expeditionary Wastewater Recycling Systems (EWRS): Patent pending, US Army Human Health Command approved, fully automated, certified wastewater recycling solution which can be sold to all DOD divisions, FEMA and NGOs. The intended MSRP is approximately $350,000. This product is currently also private labeled by channel partner, Aspen Water Inc.
 
Another new product still being incubated is building manholes utilizing SRTP versus the current precast concrete approach.
 
ORGANIZATION
 
MWS operates as a business unit of PWT. MWS currently functions as a virtual decentralized corporate entity. It has physical locations in Los Angeles, CA, McKinney, TX, and New Castle, VA. The McKinney, TX location is where MWS shares manufacturing facilities with its organizational parent, PWT.
 
OriginClear supports both MWS and PWT with various administrative, accounting and marketing functions from the company’s headquarters in Los Angeles, CA.

FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT
 
Manufacturing
 
PWT currently leases its facility. The facility is located at 2535 E. University Drive, McKinney, Texas 75069. There are five buildings totaling 12,400 square feet on the 1.7 acres of land. There is additional expansion space for several more assembly buildings when and if needed.
 
PWT’s in-house engineers and designers utilize modern 3-D CAD programs to design all of the systems sold by PWT. They also design, program and build all of the control systems and the Internet-connected Process Logic Control (PLC) video screen interfaces.
 
PWT in-house craftsmen complete the metal and plastic machining, welding and assembly of PWT’s and MWS’s systems.
 
MWS engineering resources are provided both internally and externally. Daniel Early leads the engineering program and relies on support from pre-sales engineer, Robb Litos, and PWT to assist with Manufacturing Engineering. MWS subcontracts engineering support to PWT, which employs its own established and experienced engineering team. MWS also subcontracts 2D and 3D engineering design work to outside vendors to assist in the development of standardized drawings and proposals.
 
MWS’s specialized manufacturing is outsourced at present. PWT in McKinney, TX provides substantial critical manufacturing support to MWS; this support takes the form of various sub assembly fabrication (membrane modules, equipment skids, MWS equipment buildings, etc). PWT is the sole source provider for MWS’s integrated control panels. In addition to PWT, heavy plastic and or custom plastic manufacturing is provided by a fabricctor in Roanoke, Virginia and another in Ontario, Canada. Additional sub-contract manufacturing is available through fabricators in Hopkins, MO, Corsicana, TX, and Vernon Hills, IL.
 
The Company plans to transition the plastic fabrication of MWS’s pump stations and wastewater treatment systems to PWT from subcontractors. There is no timeline for this, as it will require an additional 2,400 to 3,000 square foot building for assembly, engineers and project managers.
 
The components such as pumps, membranes and instruments will be acquired either through PWT’s or MWS’s normal vendors. The large diameter SRTP pipe will be acquired from the fabricator located about 40 miles south of Dallas.
 
The building blocks of all systems are metal reinforced or structural profile wall reinforced thermoplastics pipe (SRTP) available from one of over a half dozen pipe suppliers. Being pipes they are manufactured to be sold into high volume applications and are very economical for MWS’s high value applications. MWS purchases these plastic cylinders up to 11’ in diameter and are utilized as the vessel or housing part of the water treatment systems.
 
Plans are in place to purchase more efficient fabrication and assembly equipment to expedite the fabrication time and improve the quality. Some of that equipment includes: CNC waterjet, large diameter core drills, fusion welders and roto molders.

Technology Licensing Division
 
For its first eight years of operations, OriginClear focused uniquely on development and commercialization of its breakthrough Electro Water Separation™ technology. In 2015, the technology went into commercial phase, and the Company launched it as OriginClear Technologies, operating in parallel to the Group. The mission of OriginClear Technologies is to develop Electro Water Separation™ and achieve its full recognition as an international industry standard in treating our increasingly complex wastewater treatment challenges. For this purpose, OriginClear Technologies relies on an ongoing strong R&D and engineering activity for the development of its technology, while actively building its network of partners, licensees and joint venture partners for commercial development. A key element of this strategy is OriginClear (HK), OriginClear’s wholly-owned subsidiary in Hong Kong that manages Asia-Pacific market development, with a special focus on China sales and manufacturing. While OriginClear Technologies focuses on developing and monetizing the Company’s internally-developed Intellectual Property, best practices and trade secrets, it is expected to do the same for technologies which may come in the future with the Group’s acquisition of profitable water treatment companies. 
The Technology
 
OriginClear is the proprietary developer of EWS, the high-speed, primarily chemical-free technology to clean up large quantities of water. It removes oils, suspended solids, certain dissolved solids, and pathogens, in a continuous and energy-efficient process. The Company originally developed this technology to solve the challenge of removing microalgae from a highly dilute state. The EWS technology remains the most efficient non-chemical, continuous mechanism for the concentration of live algae cells from water.
 
The electro-chemical process was then extended, first to cleaning up oil and gas waste water and most recently, to industrial, agricultural and urban effluents. These water treatment applications are entirely electrochemical in nature and do not rely on algae for its cleaning capabilities, which is a separate application of the technology. EWS is designed to be an early step in removal of oils, solids and pathogens; reducing the work that more expensive, downstream processes such as Ultra Filtration or Reverse Osmosis must do, therefore enabling more cost-efficient and high-volume water cleanup overall.
 
In March of 2016, OriginClear announced that it had successfully developed and proved Advanced Oxidation for its breakthrough water cleanup system, EWS. University laboratory tests have shown that EWS with Advanced Oxidation (EWS:AOx™) can now extract dissolved contaminants, which are otherwise difficult to remove without chemicals such as chlorine. Overall, the system has shown a dramatic reduction in Total Organic Compounds which includes all forms of organic contamination, solids, miscible or dissolved, to meet new stringent global discharge requirements. Even prior to this innovation, EWS, combined with an iSep ultrafiltration membrane, demonstrated up to a 99.9% removal of dispersed oil, 99.5% removal of suspended solids as well as successful treatment of chemical oxygen demand (COD), including specific contaminants such as ammonia, phosphorus and hydrogen sulfide. These results were presented at the International Water Conference in 2015. In 2016, OriginClear filed for a patent to protect the new AOx process and system configuration.
 
Today, we are capable of pairing the two technologies as EWS:AOx™, or separately, as the application requires. OriginClear believes that its technology is valuable to the industry because it has the potential to greatly extend the life of membranes and filters by effectively treating very dirty, oily water, while reducing chemical use significantly.

OriginClear also believes that its Advanced Oxidation technology will help neutralize harmful micro-contaminants, such as industrial solvents, which is difficult or impossible to achieve with other technologies.
 
Overall, the system has shown a dramatic reduction in Total Organic Compounds which includes all forms of organic contamination, solids, miscible or dissolved, to meet new stringent global discharge requirements.
 
Recent Developments
 
We have been engaged in our business operations since June 2007, and to date, we have been primarily involved in research and development activities, with licensing to OEMs, and sales of pilot and demonstration equipment beginning in June of 2010. Commercial sales by both OriginClear and its licensees and joint ventures began in 2014.
 
Our technology integrates easily with other industry processes. We have begun to embed our technology into larger systems through licensing and joint ventures.
 
In the first Quarter of 2019, working with select licensees, we began to develop direct offerings of our two main applications for the technology to date: oil and gas and manure effluent treatment. This was additional to the direct offerings by OriginClear (Hong Kong), primarily for ammonia removal. Going forward, we intend to develop our direct offerings line to maximize penetration of the technology into markets.
 
In 2018, OriginClear accomplished the following milestones in the Technology division:
 
On March 2, 2018, the Company announced that its licensee in Spain, Depuporc S.L., had signed a commercial contract to supply complete mobile treatment systems to pig farm operators. The units are designed for a daily capacity of 120m3, or 31,700 gallons per day.
 
On March 22, 2018, the Company announced that the company had delivered and commissioned its first commercial system in China. OriginClear’s system effectively removes levels of ammonia which are both high and variable, from a continuous flow of wastewater generated by a chrome-plating process. The unit delivered is an Advanced Oxidation (AOx) system model AO30, with maximum processing capacity of 30 m3 (or 8,100 gallons) per day.
 
On June 12, 2018, the Company announced that it had entered into a licensing agreement with Water Technologies International, Inc. of Port St. Lucie, FL. The licensing agreement gave Water Technologies access to OriginClear’s patented electrochemical treatment process, Electro Water Separation with Advanced Oxidation™ (EWS:AOx™), and support to enter the oil and gas and other markets. The Technical Assistance Program fee, another part of OriginClear’s licensing agreement, was paid to OCLN in WTII preferred shares. The license also calls for standard royalty payments to OriginClear.
 
WaterChain, Inc.
 
WaterChain, Inc. was incorporated in December, 2017 and is today a research and development project of the company. 
 
Looking Ahead
 
In 2019, OriginClear hopes to achieve the following:
 

● | Continued growth of PWT’s revenues and gross profits, including subcontracting revenues from the new unit, MWS.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | MWS’s continued rollout of a significant pipeline of water projects, including those which were brought by Dan Early as well as those generated by current prospecting efforts including the new expanded Manufacturer’s Rep network.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | One or more acquisitions of a profitable water treatment service provider.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
16

 


● | OriginClear Technologies:
--+--------------------------


o | Development with our best partners of direct offerings in key areas of oil and gas and manure effluent cleanup.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | A major initiative in Latin America with a currently proposed Joint Venture.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------



There cannot be any assurance what we will be able to achieve any of the above-referenced objectives for reasons including, but not limited to, our limited capital resources.
 
Our Strategy
 
We currently operate three synergistic lines of business:
 

1. | The OriginClear Group, which acquires businesses.
---+--------------------------------------------------
2. | OriginClear Technologies, our licensing arm. 
3. | The WaterChain incubation. 

The OriginClear Group
 
The OriginClear Group’s strategy is to grow incrementally by focusing on the water treatment services market, acquiring the hands-on service suppliers in this market. It intends to develop a network of these wholly-owned water treatment companies to meet the needs of end users from all industries with a full range of treatment technologies. Due to increased regulation, water treatment recycling challenges and a need to focus on their own core business, many water users today are outsourcing their water treatment needs to outside experts. In addition, we have identified a major trend in decentralization of water treatment, which we believe will cause small water service companies to grow. There will be significant synergies within the Group as technology, manufacturing expertise, market knowledge, projects and opportunities are shared. The target acquisitions must be accretive in nature with solid sales growth and profitability. The acquired companies must have a solid management team to accelerate their previous growth with excellent customer service. Initially, the acquisition focus is in the U.S. but will be expanded internationally in a few years.
 
OriginClear Technologies
 
We are licensors of our technology. We grant non-exclusive licenses to OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers), and participate in joint ventures, contributing our technology and our commitment to each joint venture’s business focus. We have also begun to grant Master Licenses, beginning with our wholly-owned subsidiary in Hong Kong.
 
Technology Applications
 

1. | Algae Harvesting
---+-----------------

 
Algae is one of nature′s most efficient and versatile photosynthetic factories. It has a short growing cycle and does not require arable land or fresh water, which makes it very attractive as an energy feedstock, or as a healthy and natural feed or fertilizer. But a major barrier to commercialization is the difficulty in extracting small amounts of algae biomass from very large quantities of water at a reasonable cost and without using more energy than can be created. And the quantities of water required can be very large indeed: algae-to-water ratio can be as high as 1-to-1000. Conventional water separation technologies such as centrifuges and membranes may work on a limited basis, but can be too expensive for large-scale use. Additionally, centrifuges are typically a batch process. 
 
Algae harvesting is OriginClear’s historical activity, which also laid the technology groundwork for the company’s subsequent applications development. It started with Single Step Extraction™ (SSE). Today, SSE is the first stage in EWS and it powers our sanitation and growth optimizing applications.
 
17

 

Algae for Soil Enrichment
 
In 2015, OriginClear began developing the use of algae for soil enrichment with partner AlgEternal Technologies, a vertically-integrated producer of non-fuel high value products from microalgae.
 
On April 26, 2018 the Company finalized a formal licensing agreement with AlgEternal, capping five years of continuous operation of OriginClear’s first-generation Smart Algae Harvester™ at AlgEternal’s LaGrange, Texas headquarters. Following exhaustive testing, AlgEternal first selected OriginClear’s EWS technology in 2013. In 2015, AlgEternal found that by using OriginClear’s technology to harvest pure algae, conventional fertilizer costs could be reduced by up to 40 percent.
 
In February 2018, a Texas A&M team studied the effectiveness of Agtivate™ in rice production, showing that yields could be increased by 500 to 900 lbs per acre, while reducing standard nitrogen up to 75%, when using Agtivate. These test results demonstrated that OriginClear’s line of Smart Algae Harvesters is highly efficient, effectively controls bacteria in the algal paste product to facilitate a long shelf life, and, uniquely, ensures the algae cells are alive after harvesting.
 
In 2016, the FREEWATERBOX® developed by OriginClear joint venture Ennesys completed a field pilot in Dubai. It is based on the use of micro-algae for the removal or biotransformation of pollutants, including nutrients and xenobiotics from wastewater and CO2 from waste air, while producing a soil conditioner for the enhancement and protection of agricultural crops. Ennesys is still working to achieve a commercial rollout based on this pilot.
 

2. | The Oil and Gas Industry
---+-------------------------

 
The oil and gas industry is one of the most water-intensive industries in the world. It is both a large consumer of fresh water and producer of contaminated water, which is also a potential asset for drought-affected regions. Water is produced and used in large quantities in oil and gas operations. In the United States, an average of 7 barrels of contaminated water is generated for each 1 barrel of oil produced. Greentech Media reports that energy companies pay between $3 to $12 to dispose of each barrel of produced water. We believe OriginClear’s Electro Water Separation™ technology is ideally suited to help clean up the large quantities of water used in oil and gas operations. A 2009 report on modern shale gas by the Groundwater Protection Council, “Modern Shale Gas Development in the United States: A Primer,” stated that “the amount of water needed to drill and fracture a horizontal shale gas well generally ranges from about 2 million to 4 million gallons, depending on the basin and formation characteristics.” While fracking technology promises to unleash an abundant supply of inexpensive natural gas to power the modern world, water is quickly becoming a serious limiting factor. Additionally, the water returns as “frack flowback” laced with petroleum and contaminants that require rapid and efficient removal for disposal and recycling.
 
Oil and Gas Water Cleanup Solutions
 
The Company has completed successful trials in the Niobrara gas fields of Colorado, the Permian light crude oil fields of West Texas and the Monterey heavy crude oil fields in California. The Bakersfield testing demonstrated that produced water from heavy oil in California’s Monterey Shale Formation could technically and economically be reprocessed for Cyclic Steam Stimulation in oil wells and agricultural irrigation water. EWS removes up to 99.9% of all free and emulsified oil, and 99.5% of suspended solids from oil & gas wastewater, while also removing certain dissolved contaminants that will co-precipitate, and continuously disinfecting bacteria. In the oil and gas application, OriginClear’s core EWS technology is typically supplemented with ‘heavies’ removal on the front end, intelligent controls, and a final polishing system, for a complete solution.
 
Through its licensees and joint venture partners, OriginClear is making EWS available, either as a stand-alone solution or integrated with up- and downstream treatment modules, to customers such as: E&P operators, service companies, disposal well operators and water treatment companies.
 

3. | Industrial and agricultural Waste Water
---+----------------------------------------

 
Perhaps the largest of all opportunities for EWS is in cleaning up industrial, agricultural and urban effluents. EWS is an electrically-based technology that can target any application in waste water treatment, with a focus on the “clarity” stage of removing oils, suspended solids and bacteria. EWS technology has been shown to effectively clean organics such as petroleum, achieving up to 99.9% reduction in free oil and a 99.5% reduction in suspended solids, and reduction of up to 99% of bacteria and other invaders, for clean and sanitized effluents. Another EWS prototype has been demonstrated in China for landfill leachate treatment. EWS alone achieved a 75% reduction in leachate’s Chemical Oxygen Demand, a marker of contamination level that includes suspended solids and dissolved contamination as well, and 70% reduction in Ammonia. 
 
18

 

The Advanced Oxidation complement to EWS known as EWS:AOx™, announced in March of 2016, shows promise to neutralize micro-contaminants such as ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, and dioxane, an industrial solvent which has been found extensively in aquifers in Southern California and elsewhere. We also believe that EWS:AOx can be valuable in neutralizing many other anthropogenic organic compounds (AOCs), including endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). Further testing, with the assistance of a regional water district, is underway at our headquarters in the Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator (LACI).
 
Competitors
 
The Algae Industry
 
Companies in the new algae fuels industry tend to organize themselves as integrated producers and to keep their intellectual property to themselves. Our strategy, on the other hand, is to share our technology widely through licensing and private labeling. With respect to our algae harvesting and sanitizing applications, we are aware that Alfa Laval, Algix, Aurora Algae, Cavitation Technologies, Evodos, New Oil Resources, Open Algae LLC, Perlemax, Valicor, Smartflow Technologies, Westfalia and World Water Works, among others, offer competing technologies. OriginClear believes there is synergy between its process and many of these competing technologies, where EWS can do the “heavy lifting” as the first, high-speed concentration stage, with other processes offering further concentration. 
The Oil and Gas Industry
 
Market and Trends
 
The oil and gas industry is a major source of waste water. In the US, it generates about seven barrels of produced water for each barrel of oil. More recently the flowback water from fracking operations is a short term, but intensive, source of waste water as well. Historically the solution to the treatment of produced and frack flowback water has primarily been to dispose it in permitted injection wells. Many technologies have existed for the “filtering” of these waters prior to injection, but with limited ability to remove contaminants. More recently, because of the cost of water management, environmental concerns and regulatory requirements, these “filtering” technologies are being reviewed and new technologies are being developed; the goal being to reduce water management costs and to dramatically reduce the volume of disposal. Not only can the oil and gas industry look forward to reduced water management costs, but environmental impacts will have been reduced; a win-win for all concerned. Accordingly, the industry is increasingly recycling its produced and frack flowback waters for use in water flooding, cyclic steam stimulation, enhanced oil recovery, new hydraulic fracturing operations, irrigation and even drinking water. Recycling is becoming the economic choice as technologies have advanced and the cost of water treatment has decreased; while at the same time, the cost of disposal has risen (according to Shale Play Water Management magazine, costing between $1.75 and $26.75 per barrel of water). In addition, intense lobbying by environmental groups in front-line regions like California and New York is driving treatment and reuse as a way to make fracking and drilling in general more acceptable, especially in the midst of California’s historic drought. Markets-and-markets reports that the global produced water treatment market size is estimated to exceed $8 billion by 2019. The major factors responsible driving the growth of this market include the energy sector growth in Africa and the Middle East, along with increasing strictness of environmental policies. According to Bluefield Research, wastewater treatment spending for hydraulic fracturing is expected to grow almost three-fold, from $138 million in 2014 to $357 million in 2020 in the U.S. Bluefield cites water supplies increasingly at risk, tighter regulations emerging in key states, and costs of disposal on the rise as factors contributing to the substantial rise in water treatment and reuse, which is expected to account for 27 percent of total produced and flowback water by 2020, about double current levels.
Competing Technologies
 
These “filtering” technologies range from simple decanting to distillation. They are typically implemented as a multi-stage process to attain water quality standards for the planned reuse. EWS can act as a pre-treatment stage for any of these multi-stage processes. While EWS can remove the emulsified and free oil, suspended solids and bacteria from the water stream, these subsequent stages can remove the heavy metals, scaling chemicals, salts and other natural and introduced chemicals. EWS can reduce fouling of these filters and membranes, making subsequent or downstream processes complementary to EWS and creating a strategic opportunity to collaborate. Direct competitors using some form of electro-coagulation technologies include: Halliburton, Watertectonics, Bosque, Ecolotron, Quantum-ionics, Kaselco, Baker Hughes, RecylClean, Axine Water and Ecosphere. Other companies also compete with EWS, but use other technologies that can involve chemical coagulants, batch operation or a high level of consumables. These include: Aqua-Tech, Aqua-Pure, CTI, Purifics, HydroZonics, Myclex, Osmonics, Filterboxx, MECO, Layne, 212 Resources, Veolia, Fountain Quail, Pall and Altela.

The Waste Water Treatment Industry
 
Waste water is a growing problem as industry, agriculture and communities expand, droughts force the need for reclamation, and aquifers and reservoirs become polluted. Meanwhile, previously lightly-regulated regions of the world are enforcing much stricter environmental regulations. Overall, water security is one of the greatest challenges of our time. According to analysts at McKinsey & Company (Charting our Water Future, November 2009 report), the world will see a 40 percent gap between water supply and demand by 2030. Industrial uses account for a startling amount of water consumed around the world. According to the United Nations (The World Business Council for Sustainable Development, March 2006 report) industry consumes nearly 60 percent of available water in high-income countries. Curbing fresh water consumption at the industrial level has the potential to significantly improve water security worldwide. In general, we believe that OriginClear has one or more advantages over some of the potential competitors, in that our process does not primarily use chemicals, is highly scalable on a continuous flow process, and may be significantly lower in energy consumption. We believe our technology may, in some cases, complement these companies’ offerings, however there is no guarantee that our technology will produce more efficiently or cost-effectively than these other technologies. To our knowledge, there is no company or technology available on the market providing a similar level of synergistic integration of the three processes that we implement under a single configuration: Electro Coagulation, Electro Flotation (these two being combined in our process as EWS) and Advanced Oxidation (AOx). 
 
Taken separately, these processes are marketed as follows:
 
Electro Coagulation, though being a relatively new technology, has been known and available in the market for approximately 30 years. Companies like Watertectonics, Kaselco, Powel Water or H2O Technologies offer engineered electrocoagulation systems to the market. There are also a number of one-off electrocoagulation systems in operation worldwide. Electro Flotation is an emerging technology that is mostly seen in scientific publications, as an alternative to more conventional Dissolved Air Flotation (DAF) systems. DAF systems are available worldwide from numerous suppliers including but not limited to, Veolia Water, Ecologix, RWL Water, SAWater, WPL International, World Water Works, etc. and almost exclusively rely on massive injection of chemical coagulants for their efficiency. EWS has been designed with versatility in mind. It is equally efficient when used with sacrificial anodes, slowly releasing the anode’s metal ions that will provide the coagulation effect, or with Dynamically Stable Anodes (DSA) that will have a catalytic role on water matrix preparation with or without chemical coagulants. In both cases, the patented reactors design marks a significant evolution in the industry, featuring an enhanced mixing function, a better mass transfer and an easier maintenance and replacement when using sacrificial anodes.
 
Advanced Oxidation, not unlike Electro Coagulation, has been known to scientists for approximately 40 years. However, the few Advanced Oxidation technologies being commercially in use mostly rely on catalyst injection and/or on a combination of catalysts and UV irradiation for their process. They are not as streamlined as EWS:AOx, which is solely an electrochemical process, and these processes require extensive preparation of the water matrix to be efficient. MIOX, Blue Earth Labs are marketing similar systems for niche applications, without offering the additional suspended solids removal functions featured by EWS. Other identified competitors are Lenntech, SSWM, Esco International, and Spartan Water Treatment. Here again, OriginClear’s reactors’ specific design is a major evolution. Contact area, mass transfer, high turbulence caused by shear stress all help in enhancing oxidation reactions and, furthermore, the two variations of the tubular reactor design respectively have a major role in direct oxidation, mostly targeting “Hard COD”, contaminants that are known for being difficult to degrade, and, additionally, indirect oxidation, widely used for less difficult reactions.
 
In summary, while competitors exist for each of the three phases of our technology, we have not detected any that does all three in one synergistic system.

Government and Environmental Regulation
 
We are not aware of any existing or probable government regulations that would negatively impact on our operations. As a licensor and/or provider of water treatment equipment, we are not subject to government regulations for the removal of oils, solids and pathogens from water, other than normal safety standards and certifications (such as UL or CE) for goods that we manufacture for demonstrations and joint ventures, and our product lines. However, our prospective customers are subject to local, state and federal laws and regulations governing environmental quality and pollution control. To date, our compliance with government regulations has had no material effect on our operations, capital, earnings, or competitive position, and the cost of such compliance has not been material. We are unable to assess or predict at this time what effect additional regulations or legislation could have on our activities. 
Intellectual Property
 
OriginClear’s Intellectual Property (“IP”) portfolio has been in continuous development since 2008. Early patents focused on algae harvesting. Beginning in 2015, the company applied this knowledge to water treatment and began development of EWS.
 
In 2018, OriginClear reorganized its Intellectual Property portfolio to focus exclusively on its electrochemical water treatment solution, Electro Water Separation with Advanced Oxidation™.
 
As a result, we currently manage an international portfolio of our trade secrets, and four granted or pending patents, as well as five US patents we have licensed exclusively for the world, making a total of nine. Patents have been granted in Japan and China, and patents are pending in the US, Malaysia, China, and China (Hong Kong). A Patent Cooperation Treaty filing for internationalization is also under way for one of our latest developments, the “Advanced Oxidation Water Treatment Module”.
 
Further, the company is in the process of converting into a utility patent, a provisional application filed with the USPTO in August 2018, to protect the AOxPlus technology, titled “Electrochemical System and Method for Peroxide Production in Water Treatment”.
 
The company continues to further improve and expand its technology’s scope, efficiency and reliability. We plan to file new patents in the US and internationally as needed. In addition, we have chosen to protect certain intellectual property with trade secrets rather than patents.
 
In addition, we have begun joint development projects for specific field applications of EWS/AOx. We are discussing two such applications with licensees, respectively in India and in the United States.

Research and Development
 
During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we invested $290,542 and $197,119, respectively, on research and development of our technologies. Research and development costs include activities related to development and innovations in the core EWS technology, fabrication and scale-up of products based on this technology, development of firmware and process automation, development of new applications in industries such as aquaculture, technical support of customers, agents, joint venture partners and licensees, on-site consulting and training activities, and miscellaneous research.
 
In one outcome of this investment, OriginClear enhanced its Electro Water Separation technology by pairing it with Advanced Oxidation, for which we filed a patent in the 2nd Quarter of 2016.
 
OriginClear’s Advanced Oxidation is a patent-pending, chemical-free way to extract dissolved contaminants, such as bacteria, ammonia, pharmaceuticals and solvents. This complements the EWS technology, which effectively clarifies very dirty, oily water so that membranes and filters can do their job without clogging.
