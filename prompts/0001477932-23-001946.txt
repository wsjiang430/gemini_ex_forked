ITEM 1. BUSINESS

When used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the terms “Lightbridge”, the “Company”, “we”, “our”, and “us” refer to Lightbridge Corporation together with its wholly-owned subsidiaries Lightbridge International Holding LLC and Thorium Power Inc. Lightbridge’s principal executive offices are located at 11710 Plaza America Drive, Suite 2000, Reston, Virginia 20190 USA.

Overview

At Lightbridge we are developing the next generation of nuclear fuel to impact, in a meaningful way, the world’s climate and energy security problems. Our nuclear fuel could significantly improve the economics and safety of existing and new nuclear power plants, large and small, enhance proliferation resistance of spent nuclear fuel, and have a meaningful impact on addressing climate change and air pollution, all while benefiting national security. We project that the world’s energy and climate needs can only be met if nuclear power’s share of the energy-generating mix grows substantially in the coming decades. We believe Lightbridge will benefit from a growing nuclear power industry, and we are developing our nuclear fuel to help enable that growth to happen. 

We believe our metallic fuel will offer significant economic and safety benefits over traditional nuclear fuel, primarily because of the superior heat transfer properties and the resulting lower operating temperature of all-metal fuel. We also believe that uprating a reactor with Lightbridge Fuel™ will add incremental electricity at a lower levelized cost than any other means of generating baseload electric power, including any renewable, fossil, or hydroelectric energy source, or any traditional nuclear fuel.

Emerging nuclear technologies that many in the nuclear power industry believe have the potential to help drive growth in nuclear power include small modular reactors (SMRs), which are now in the development and licensing phases. We expect that Lightbridge Fuel™ can provide SMRs with all the same benefits our technology brings to large reactors, with such benefits being even more meaningful to the economic case for deployment of SMRs, including potential load following capability when included on a low-carbon electric grid with renewable energy sources. We expect Lightbridge Fuel™ to generate more power in SMRs than traditional nuclear fuels, which will help decarbonize sectors that are now powered by fossil fuels. We expect that our ongoing research and development (R&D) initiatives will lead to Lightbridge Fuel™ powering SMRs for multiple purposes. The first SMRs are expected to begin operations as early as 2029.

We have built a significant portfolio of patents reflecting years of R&D, and we anticipate testing our nuclear fuel through third party vendors and others, including the United States Department of Energy’s (DOE) national laboratories. Currently, we are performing the majority of our R&D activities with the DOE’s national laboratories. 

Our Nuclear Fuel

Since 2008, we have been engaged in the design and development of proprietary, innovative nuclear fuels to improve the cost competitiveness, safety, proliferation resistance and performance of nuclear power generation. In 2010, we announced the concept of all-metal fuel (i.e., non-oxide fuel) for use in currently operating and new-build reactors. We have reimagined nuclear fuel from scratch, using advanced science and engineering. Our focus on metallic fuel was inspired by listening to the voices of prospective customers, as nuclear utilities expressed interest in the improved economics and enhanced safety that we believe metallic fuel will provide. 

The fuel in a nuclear reactor generates energy in the form of heat. That heat is then converted through steam into electricity that is delivered to the transmission and distribution grid. We have designed our innovative, proprietary metallic fuels to be capable of significantly higher burnup and power density compared to conventional oxide nuclear fuels. Burnup is the total amount of electricity generated per unit mass of nuclear fuel consumed and is a function of the power density of a nuclear fuel and the amount of time the fuel operates in the reactor. Power density is the amount of heat power generated per unit volume of nuclear fuel. Conventional oxide fuel used in existing commercial reactors is nearing the limit of its design and licensed burnup and power density capability. As a result, further optimization is needed to (i) increase power output from the same core size to improve the economics, and (ii) enhance the safety of nuclear power generation where using conventional oxide fuel technologies is limited. A new fuel is needed to bring enhanced performance to reactors large and small. We are working to develop Lightbridge Fuel™ to meet that goal.

As the nuclear power industry prepares to meet the increasing global demand for electricity production, nuclear utilities are seeking longer operating cycles and higher reactor power outputs for current and future reactor fleets. We believe our proprietary nuclear fuel designs have the potential to improve the nuclear power industry’s economics by:


· | enabling increased reactor power output via a power uprate (potentially up to a 30% increase) or a longer operating cycle without changing the core size in new build pressurized water reactors (PWRs), including SMRs; or 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | providing an increase in power output of potentially up to 10% while simultaneously extending the operating cycle length from 18 to 24 months in existing PWRs, including in Westinghouse-type four-loop PWR plants, which are currently constrained to an 18-month operating cycle by oxide fuel enriched up to 5% in the isotope uranium-235, or increasing the power potentially up to 17% while retaining an 18-month operating cycle.


We believe our fuel designs will allow current and new build nuclear reactors to safely increase power production and reduce operations and maintenance costs on a per kilowatt-hour basis. New build nuclear reactors could also benefit from the reduced upfront capital investment per kilowatt of generating capacity in the case of implementing a power uprate. In addition to projected electricity production cost savings, we believe our technology may allow utilities or countries to deploy fewer new reactors to generate the same amount of electricity (in the case of a power uprate), resulting in significant capital cost savings. For utilities or countries that already have operating reactors, we expect that our nuclear fuel could be utilized to both increase the power output of those reactors as well as enable them to load follow with electric grid demands, which have become increasingly variable with large additions of intermittent renewable generation.

Nuclear Industry and Addressable Market

Overview of the Nuclear Power Industry

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, nuclear power provided approximately 4.6% of the world’s total energy from all sources in 2020, including approximately 10.5% of global electricity generation. According to the World Nuclear Association (WNA), as of January 2022 there were 438 operable nuclear power reactors worldwide, mostly light water reactors, with the most common types being PWRs, including Russian-designed water-cooled, water-moderated energetic reactors (VVERs), and boiling-water reactors (BWRs). Nuclear power provides a non-fossil fuel, low-carbon energy solution that can meet baseload electricity needs.

Of the world’s reactors currently in operation, PWRs account for approximately 70% of the net operating capacity, with BWRs being the second most prevalent and accounting for approximately 14%. Of the nuclear reactors currently under construction, approximately 70% are PWRs with a rated electric power output of 1,000 megawatts or greater.

Almost all the new build reactors currently under construction are either Generation III or Generation III+ type reactors. The primary difference from second-generation designs is that many Generation III or Generation III+ reactors incorporate passive or inherent safety features, which require no active controls or operational intervention to avoid accidents in the event of malfunction. Many of these passive systems rely on a combination of gravity, natural convection, and/or resistance to high temperatures.

We are developing our fuel technology for application in various types of water-cooled reactors, including existing or future light water reactors, which include water-cooled small modular reactors, as well as for Canada Deuterium Uranium (CANDU)-type pressurized heavy water reactors. The existing U.S. fleet of nuclear reactors represents a large market segment for which Lightbridge Fuel™ could provide significant economic and safety benefits through a power uprate up to 10%, along with an anticipated operating cycle extension from 18 to 24 months, or a power uprate of 17%, as described below, without extending the cycle length. 

We believe that Lightbridge Fuel’s™ most significant economic benefit may be its ability to provide a 30% power uprate. However, the existing large reactors cannot realize that benefit because their systems are not designed to handle that much of an increase in power. The most additional power existing large PWRs could take from Lightbridge Fuel™ is estimated at approximately 17%. Only newly designed large reactors may benefit from the full 30% greater power available from Lightbridge Fuel™. While we believe that only a limited number of new, large reactors will be built, we expect that much larger numbers of SMRs that can utilize our fuel will be deployed in the future.

Target Market for Lightbridge Fuel™

Our target market segments include water-cooled commercial power reactors, such as PWRs, BWRs, VVERs, CANDUs heavy water reactors, water-cooled SMRs, as well as water-cooled research reactors.

Nuclear Power as Clean and Low Carbon Emissions Energy Source

Nuclear power provides clean, reliable baseload electricity. According to the WNA, nuclear reactors produce no greenhouse gas emissions during operation, and over the course of their lifecycles, nuclear power plants produce about the same amount of CO2 equivalent emissions per unit of electricity as wind. The WNA further notes that almost all proposed pathways to achieving significant decarbonization suggest an increased role for nuclear power, including those published by the International Energy Agency, Massachusetts Institute of Technology Energy Initiative, U.S. Energy Information Administration, and World Energy Council.

We believe that deep cuts to CO2 emissions are only possible with electrification of most of the transportation and industrial sectors globally and powering them, and the current electricity needs of the world, with non-emitting or low-emitting power or no-carbon liquid fuels. We believe this can be done only with a large increase in nuclear power, several times the amount that is generated globally today. We believe that our nuclear fuel technology will be an essential element of reaching this goal, for electricity generation and potentially to produce hydrogen for zero-carbon liquid fuels.

Influence of the Accident at Fukushima, Japan and New International Nuclear Build

The accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in Japan following the strong earthquake and destructive tsunami that occurred on March 11, 2011, increased public concerns related to nuclear power, resulting in a slowdown in, or in some cases, a complete halt to, new construction of nuclear power plants as well as the early shut down of existing power plants in certain countries. As a result, some countries that were considering launching new domestic nuclear power programs before the Fukushima accident have delayed or cancelled preparatory activities they were planning to undertake as part of such programs. The Fukushima accident appears to have shrunk the projected size of the global nuclear power market in 2025-2030 as reflected in the most recent reference case projections published by the WNA. At the same time, the event has brought a greater emphasis on safety to the forefront that may be beneficial to us because our metallic fuel provides improved safety and fuel performance during normal operation and design-basis accidents.
Growing Importance of Energy Security

We believe that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has made clear the need for countries to wean off dependency on fossil fuels from countries that can threaten their national security. Oil and natural gas prices have increased significantly since Russia commenced its invasion in early 2022 and many countries have imposed sanctions upon Russia in response. European countries are responding by rethinking their plans for nuclear energy by either keeping existing nuclear power plants running or moving ahead with plans for new plants or both. The United Kingdom is deploying new nuclear power plants. Belgium has decided to reverse its decision to close all of its nuclear plants in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. It has become clear that a stable domestic energy supply ensures energy security and provides the strongest protection against energy price volatility. Increasingly, policymakers view nuclear energy as critical to a secure energy future.
Anticipated Safety Benefits of Lightbridge Fuel™

The expected safety benefits of Lightbridge Fuel™ are as follows:


· | operates at lower operating temperatures than current conventional nuclear fuel, contributing to lower stored thermal energy in the fuel rods; it is therefore not expected to generate explosive hydrogen gas under design-basis accidents when there is a loss of coolant in the reactor;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | enhances structural integrity of the nuclear fuel rods; and 
· | has lighter and stiffer fuel assembly, which may contribute to improved seismic performance; 


Due to the significantly lower fuel operating temperature and higher thermal conductivity, our metallic nuclear fuel rods are expected to provide major improvements to safety margins during certain off-normal events. The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) licensing processes require engineering analysis of a large break loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA), as well as other scenarios. The LOCA scenario assumes failure of a large water pipe in the reactor coolant system. Under LOCA conditions, the fuel and cladding temperatures rise due to reduced cooling capacity. Preliminary analytical modeling shows that under a design-basis LOCA scenario, unlike conventional uranium dioxide fuel, the cladding of the Lightbridge-designed metallic fuel rods would stay at least 200 degrees below the 850-900 degrees Celsius temperature at which steam begins to react with the zirconium cladding to generate hydrogen gas. Build-up of hydrogen gas in a nuclear power plant can lead to a hydrogen explosion, which contributed to the damage at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. Lightbridge Fuel™ is designed to mitigate hydrogen gas generation in design-basis LOCA situations. This is a major safety benefit.

Lightbridge Spent Fuel - Proliferation Resistance

The April 2018 issue of Nuclear Engineering and Design, a technical journal affiliated with the European Nuclear Society, included a peer-reviewed article stating that after analyzing Lightbridge’s fuel, the authors concluded that any plutonium extracted from Lightbridge’s spent fuel would not be useable for weapon purposes. We anticipate the following proliferation resistance advantages for our metallic fuel:

· | one-half of the amount of plutonium produced and remaining in the spent fuel as compared to conventional uranium dioxide fuels; and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | lower Plutonium-239 fraction compared to uranium dioxide fuel; therefore, our spent fuel would be unsuitable as a source for weapon purposes.


Our fuel potentially could be used to dispose of plutonium from reprocessed used reactor fuel, utilizing the plutonium to generate electricity. Our fuel potentially also could be used to dispose of plutonium from nuclear weapons.

Development of Lightbridge Fuel™

Recent Developments

HALEU Consortium Membership

To support establishment of domestic high-assay low-enriched uranium (“HALEU”) infrastructure, the DOE announced on December 7, 2022 the creation of a HALEU Consortium. According to the DOE, the purposes of the HALEU Consortium include: (i) Provide the Secretary of Energy HALEU demand estimates for domestic commercial use, (ii) Purchase HALEU made available to members for commercial use under the Program, (iii) Carry out demonstration projects using HALEU under the Program, and (iv) Identify actionable opportunities to improve the reliability of the HALEU supply chain. On December 15, 2022, the Company submitted a formal request to the DOE to join the HALEU Consortium to mitigate HALEU supply risk. On January 12, 2023, the Company received written confirmation from the DOE of Lightbridge’s membership in the HALEU Consortium.
Idaho National Laboratory Agreements

In the second half of 2022 Lightbridge entered into agreements with Idaho National Laboratory (INL), in collaboration with the DOE, to support the development of Lightbridge Fuel™. The framework agreements use an innovative structure and consist of an “umbrella” Strategic Partnership Project Agreement (SPP) and an “umbrella” Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA), each with Battelle Energy Alliance, LLC (BEA), the DOE’s operating contractor for INL, with an initial duration of seven years. 

We anticipate that the initial phase of work under the two agreements that has been released will culminate in irradiation testing in the Advanced Test Reactor (ATR) of our fuel material samples, known as fuel material coupons, using enriched uranium supplied by the DOE. The initial phase of work aims to generate irradiation performance data for Lightbridge’s delta-phase uranium-zirconium alloy relating to various thermophysical properties. The data will support fuel performance modeling and regulatory licensing efforts for commercial deployment of Lightbridge Fuel™.

We anticipate that subsequent phases of work under the two umbrella agreements that have not yet been released may include post-irradiation examination of the irradiated fuel material coupons, loop irradiation testing in the ATR, and post-irradiation examination of one or more uranium-zirconium fuel rodlets, as well as transient experiments in the Transient Reactor Test Facility (TREAT) at INL.

MIT Study - Lightbridge Fuel™

In June 2022, the DOE selected Lightbridge Fuel™ to participate in a study led by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to investigate the performance and economics of accident tolerant fuels for light water cooled SMRs. Amongst other objectives, one of the objectives of this project is to simulate the fuel and safety performance of Lightbridge Fuel™ in an SMR designed by NuScale Power and provide a scoping analysis of longer-term advanced fuel forms to improve the safety and economics of SMRs. The DOE’s Nuclear Energy University Program awarded $800,000 to MIT with the goal of bringing collaborative teams together to solve complex problems to advance nuclear technology and understanding. The duration of this work is expected to be approximately 3 years. The amount of financial benefit to Lightbridge from this DOE grant to MIT cannot be quantified.

Second DOE Award from the Gateway for Accelerated Innovation in Nuclear 

The DOE awarded us a second voucher from the Gateway for Accelerated Innovation in Nuclear (GAIN) program to support development of Lightbridge Fuel™ in collaboration with Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL). The scope of the project was to demonstrate Lightbridge’s nuclear fuel casting process using depleted uranium, a key step in the manufacture of Lightbridge Fuel™. On July 14, 2021, the Company executed a CRADA with the Battelle Memorial Institute, Pacific Northwest Division, the operating contractor of the PNNL, in collaboration with the DOE. The project commenced in the third quarter of 2021. In December 2022, PNNL signed a one-month contract extension with the Company to complete the final report related to this PNNL GAIN voucher, which extended the period of performance to January 31, 2023. The work under this contract was completed in 2022, and a final report was issued by PNNL on January 31, 2023. The total project value was $0.7 million, with three-quarters of this amount provided by the DOE for the scope performed by PNNL. 

Under this GAIN Voucher, we worked with PNNL to develop a casting process utilizing its existing equipment. As part of the scope, several castings were performed and the cast ingots analyzed. In an iterative process, the casting methodology was modified based on the characterization results as part of process demonstration to achieve acceptable results with PNNL’s existing equipment. The results of this work will help to inform a final process suitable to produce fuel material coupons for our upcoming irradiation tests.

Future Steps Toward Our Fuel Development and Timeline For The Commercialization of Our Nuclear Fuel Assemblies

We anticipate fuel development milestones for Lightbridge Fuel™ over the next 2-3 years will consist of the following:


· | kick off SPP/CRADA work at INL leading to irradiation testing in the ATR of our fuel material coupons using enriched uranium supplied by INL.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | conduct a feasibility study for the use of our nuclear fuel in CANDU heavy water reactors. 
· | conduct a front-end engineering and design (FEED) study for a Lightbridge pilot-scale fuel fabrication facility. 
· | demonstrate extrusion with our uranium-zirconium fuel alloy and produce fuel material coupons for irradiation testing. 


The long-term milestones towards development and commercialization of nuclear fuel assemblies include, among other things, irradiating nuclear material samples and prototype fuel rods with enriched uranium in test reactors, conducting post-irradiation examination of irradiated material samples and/or prototype fuel rods, performing thermal-hydraulic experiments, performing seismic and other out-of-reactor experiments, performing advanced computer modeling and simulations to support fuel qualification, designing a lead test assembly (LTA), entering into a lead test rod/assembly agreement(s) with a host reactor(s), demonstrating the production of lead test rods and/or lead test assemblies at a pilot-scale fuel fabrication facility and demonstrating the operation of lead test rods and/or lead test assemblies in commercial reactors. 

There are inherent uncertainties in the cost and outcomes of the many steps needed for successful deployment of our fuel in commercial nuclear reactors, which makes it difficult to accurately predict the timing of the commercialization of our nuclear fuel technology. However, based on our best estimate and assuming adequate R&D funding levels, we expect to begin demonstration of lead test rods (LTRs) and/or possibly LTAs with our metallic fuel in commercial reactors in the 2030s and begin receiving purchase orders for initial fuel reload batches from utilities 15-20 years from now, with deployment of our nuclear fuel in the first reload batch in a commercial reactor taking place approximately two years thereafter. We are exploring ways of shortening this timeframe that may include securing access to expanded irradiation test loop capacity in existing or new research reactor facilities. 

Certain Challenges and Uncertainties

1. U.S. government funding support

Presently, our ability to fund our fuel development program at a level necessary to adhere to our projected fuel development timelines is severely limited due to funding constraints. This is in addition to our corporate overhead and other fixed costs, such as in-house project management and project control personnel. As a result, we believe seeking and securing significant U.S. government funding to support our fuel development program is essential for us to be successful in our fuel development and commercialization efforts. We expect significant government funding opportunities to go toward SMRs in the coming years, which may help accelerate our projected fuel development timelines by up to a few years for SMR applications.

2. Availability of suitable test loops in the ATR

After the Halden research reactor was shut down in 2018, we embarked on a global search for an alternative for loop irradiation testing of our metallic fuel rods. Ultimately, we chose the ATR at INL and applied to the DOE for and won two GAIN Vouchers. Our initial understanding was that we would have access to a government funded PWR water test loop in the ATR to generate sufficient data to support our LTA testing and potentially eliminate the need for LTR testing in a large commercial reactor. 

However, availability of irradiation test loops for fuel in the ATR has become limited and highly competitive, limiting how much nuclear fuel can be inserted into the reactor as well as its duration in the reactor. 

If new test loops are not added to the ATR, loop irradiation testing in the ATR may not provide sufficient data to justify regulatory approval for LTA testing in a large commercial PWR in a commercially feasible timeframe. This would likely necessitate an extra fuel development step of LTR testing in a large commercial PWR in addition to the ATR loop testing before LTA testing could commence. As a result, our fuel development timelines are 15-20 years before we expect to secure our first orders for fuel batch reloads in large commercial PWRs, unless we can access significantly increased test loop capacity. Consequently, the projected fuel development costs make it unfeasible for Lightbridge to fund this fuel development effort on its own. 

3. Partnerships with fuel vendors and nuclear utilities

The ability to design and fabricate the LTAs and engagement with a nuclear utility that is willing to accept our LTAs, is required to demonstrate our nuclear fuel in a commercial reactor. In the U.S., the nuclear fuel fabricator and the nuclear utility will be primarily responsible for securing the necessary regulatory licensing approvals for the LTA operation. We plan to also build relationships with SMR reactor and fuel vendors, as well as existing and/or potential SMR utility customers.

4. Supply chain infrastructure for HALEU

Establishment of required supply chain infrastructure to support high-assay low-enriched uranium metallic fuel is a necessary step in the commercialization of our nuclear fuel. Existing commercial nuclear infrastructure, including conversion facilities, enrichment facilities, de-conversion facilities, fabrication facilities, fuel storage facilities, fuel handling procedures, fuel operation at reactor sites, used fuel storage facilities and shipping containers, were designed and are in most cases currently licensed to handle uranium in oxide form with enrichment up to 5% in the isotope uranium-235. Our fuel designs for light water reactors are expected to use uranium metal with uranium enrichment levels up to 19.75% and would therefore require certain modifications to existing commercial nuclear infrastructure to enable commercial nuclear facilities to receive and handle our fuels. Those nuclear facilities will need to complete a regulatory licensing process and obtain regulatory approvals in order to be able to process, handle, or ship uranium metal with enrichment levels up to 19.75% and operate commercial reactors and spent fuel storage facilities using our metallic fuel. 

5. Need for experimental data on our metallic fuel

There is a lack of publicly available experimental data on our metallic fuel. We will need to conduct various irradiation experiments to confirm fuel performance under normal and off-normal reactor conditions. Loop irradiation in a test reactor environment prototypic of commercial reactor operating conditions and other experiments on unirradiated and irradiated metallic fuel samples will be essential to demonstrate the performance and advantages of our metallic fuel. We are planning loop irradiation testing of our metallic fuel samples in the ATR at INL as part of this effort.

6. Need for development of new analytical models to support our metallic fuel

Existing analytical models may be inadequate to fully analyze our metallic fuel. New analytical models, capable of accurately predicting the behavior of our metallic fuel during normal operation and off-normal events, may be required. Experimental data measured from our planned irradiation demonstrations will help to identify areas where new analytical models, or modifications to existing ones, may be required.


10


7. Need to develop and demonstrate a qualified fabrication process for our metallic fuel rods

Demonstration of a qualified fabrication process both for semi-scale irradiation fuel rod samples and subsequently for full-length (12-14 feet) metallic fuel rods for large PWR LTAs and shorter length for SMRs (~6 feet) is required. Past operating experience in icebreaker reactors with differently shaped fuel rods with a similar metallic fuel composition involved fabrication of metallic fuel rods up to 3 feet in length. Fabrication of full-length (approximately 12 to 14 feet) PWR metallic fuel rods for large PWRs has yet to be fully demonstrated. In 2021, we demonstrated the co-extrusion of full-length rods using surrogate materials (i.e., rods which replaced the uranium component with a suitable physical analogue). Coextrusion is the primary forming operation in the manufacturing of our fuel and this demonstration was an important milestone on the path to developing and qualifying the full manufacturing process for actual fuel rods with enriched uranium. We plan to commence a FEED study for a Lightbridge pilot-scale fuel fabrication facility in 2023.

Please see Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of certain risks that may delay or impair such developments including without limitation the availability of financing and the many risks inherent in developing a new type of nuclear fuel.
Future Potential Collaborations and Other Opportunities

In the ordinary course of business, we engage in periodic reviews of opportunities to invest in or acquire companies or units within companies to leverage operational synergies and establish new streams of revenue. We will be opportunistic in this regard and may also partner or contract with entities that could be synergistic to our fuel business or present an attractive stable business and/or growth opportunity in the nuclear space. 
Competition

Currently, competition with respect to the design of commercially viable nuclear fuel products is limited to conventional uranium dioxide fuels, which are reaching the limits in terms of their capability to provide increased power output or longer fuel cycles. We believe that the industry needs fuel products that can provide these additional benefits. While we believe conventional uranium dioxide fuel may be capable of achieving power up-rates of up to 10% in existing PWRs or extending the fuel cycle length from 18 to 24 months, doing so would require uranium-235 enrichment levels above 5% (as is also the case with our metallic fuel), higher reload batch sizes, or a combination thereof. The alternative route of increasing reload batch sizes while keeping uranium enrichment levels below 5% for power uprates up to 10% using conventional uranium dioxide fuel would raise the cost and reduce the efficiency of each fuel reload, resulting in a significant fuel cycle cost penalty to the nuclear utility. The cost penalty could have a dramatic adverse impact on the economics of existing plants whose original capital cost has already been fully depreciated, which includes most U.S. nuclear power plants.

In addition to conventional uranium dioxide fuel, potential competition to our metallic fuel technology can come from so-called Accident Tolerant Fuels (ATF). We regard ATF as part of a series of relatively small changes to conventional uranium dioxide fuel over time. ATF uses uranium dioxide with added substances and/or changes to the cladding tube. After the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in March 2011, the U.S. Congress directed the DOE to investigate every aspect of nuclear plant operation including the existing uranium dioxide fuel pellets contained in zirconium-based alloy tubes (cladding). According to the February 2019 Nuclear Energy Institute technical report on ATF titled “Safety and Economic Benefits of Accident Tolerant Fuel”, advanced fuel design concepts (such as ATF) were accelerated by combining recent operating experience with worldwide research and development. Over the past several years, the ATF program has received significant DOE funding support and initial interest from utility customers seeking ATF demonstration programs in their operating reactors. For example, in January 2022, Southern Nuclear agreed to load four lead test assemblies with a chromia and alumina doped ATF design. Similar ATF concepts are being tested by GE Nuclear, and others.

When the DOE originally launched the ATF program, the program was focused solely on achieving enhanced safety benefits, such as extra “coping time” during severe accidents. Over the past year, many ATF vendors concluded that the unexpectedly small accident tolerance benefits their ATF fuel concepts offered (such as several extra hours of coping time during severe accidents rather than their original goal of approximately 72 hours) were not enough of an incentive for nuclear utilities to adopt ATF designs, which would cost more and have reduced the efficiency relative to conventional uranium dioxide fuels. As a result, ATF vendors have begun exploring opportunities for extending the operating cycle length from 18 to 24 months in existing PWRs by going to higher enrichments (i.e., from approximately 5% to 7-8% enrichments) with ATF designs. If they are successful in extending the cycle length to 24 months in a cost-effective way, this could give sufficient economic incentive for nuclear utilities to switch to the ATF designs in the coming years. This recent shift in positioning by many ATF vendors represents a competitive threat to Lightbridge for use in existing large PWRs, as ATF vendors are now trying to encroach into a critical element of Lightbridge’s value proposition, i.e., the ability of Lightbridge Fuel™ to extend the cycle length from 18 to 24 months in existing large PWRs. While it is not certain that the ATF vendors will be successful in this approach, if ATF could provide for two-year cycles, it could severely weaken or undermine our economic value proposition in existing large PWRs. That said, we believe Lightbridge Fuel™ remains the only advanced light-water reactor fuel in development that can provide power uprates, cycle length extensions, improved safety, and load following in a single product as desired by the utilities.


11


Nuclear power faces competition from other sources of electricity as well, including natural gas, which at times in recent years has been the cheapest option for power generation in the U.S. and has resulted in some utilities abandoning nuclear initiatives. Other sources of electricity, such as renewables like wind and solar, may also be viewed as safer than nuclear power, although we believe that generating nuclear energy with Lightbridge Fuel™ is the safest way to produce baseload electricity. To the extent demand for electricity generated by nuclear power decreases, the potential market for our nuclear fuel technology will decline.

Raw Materials

We do not plan to utilize any raw materials directly in the conduct of our operations (except for potential purchases of certain raw materials in small quantities for testing and demonstration efforts). Fuel fabricators, which will ultimately fabricate fuel products incorporating our nuclear fuel technology, will acquire the zirconium and uranium, and additional raw materials that are required for the production of nuclear fuel assemblies that go into the reactor core. Uranium and zirconium are available from various suppliers at market prices. However, the availability of uranium metal enriched to 19.75% in the isotope uranium- 235 is currently limited to small quantities sufficient only for research and testing purposes. Deployment of our fuel in light water reactors will necessitate increasing enrichment level from 5% up to 19.75% at enrichment facilities, as well as deployment of de-conversion/metallization capability at a commercial scale, and the design and licensing of a shipping container capable of accommodating fuel assemblies with uranium metal enriched up to 19.75%. We expect that utilities will contract with nuclear fuel fabricators to order nuclear fuel assemblies, and then ship the completed nuclear fuel assemblies to the reactor sites.
Government Support/Approvals Needed, Relationships with Critical Development Partners/Vendors and Other Government Regulation

Due to our long fuel development timelines to commercialization and the significant amount of R&D funding required to bring our next generation nuclear fuel technology to market, substantial U.S. government funding and political support will be essential to the success of our nuclear fuel development program. Without significant U.S. government funding and cost sharing contributions toward our fuel development activities, it will be unfeasible for the Company to fund all of its future fuel development efforts on its own.

The Biden administration’s energy policy includes proposals for advanced nuclear as part of “critical clean energy technologies.” We understand that the administration is prioritizing advanced nuclear technologies, including advanced fuels and SMRs, as part of its nuclear energy policy. President Biden has brought the U.S. back into the Paris Agreement on climate change, with the goal that the U.S. electricity sector be carbon neutral by 2035, just 12 years from now. We believe Lightbridge Fuel’s™ coupling with SMRs can enhance the already strong case for SMRs and attract more private and government investment.

In addition to U.S. government funding, political support for our project is similarly important. The sales and marketing of our services and technology internationally may be subject to U.S. export control regulations, including 10 C.F.R. Part 810 and 10 C.F.R. Part 110, and the export control laws of other countries. Governmental authorizations may be required before we can export our services or technology or collaborate with foreign entities. NRC regulations at 10 C.F.R. Part 110 govern the export and import of nuclear equipment and material. Part 810 generally governs the exports of technology for development, production, or use (see 10 C.F.R. §810.3 for definitions of these terms) of reactors, equipment and material subject to Part 110. If authorizations are required and not granted, our international business could be materially affected. Furthermore, the export authorization process is often time consuming and any delays could impact our fuel development and commercialization timelines. Violation of export control regulations could subject us to fines and other penalties, such as losing the ability to export for a period of years, which would limit our revenue growth opportunities and significantly hinder our attempts to expand our business internationally.

The testing, fabrication and use of nuclear fuels by our future partners, licensees and nuclear power generators will be heavily regulated. The test facilities and other locations where our fuel designs may be tested before commercial use require governmental approvals from the host country’s nuclear regulatory authority. The responsibility for obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals will lie with our research and development contractors that conduct such tests and experiments. Nuclear fuel fabricators, which will ultimately fabricate fuel using our technology under commercial licenses from us, are similarly regulated. Utilities that operate nuclear power plants that may utilize the fuel produced by these fuel fabricators require specific licenses relating to possession and use of nuclear materials as well as numerous other governmental approvals for the ownership and operation of nuclear power plants.

Our Intellectual Property

Our intellectual property rights include multiple U.S. and international patents and patent applications, trade secrets, trademark rights, and contractual agreements. Our patent applications are directed to our proprietary nuclear fuel technology and we seek additional patent protection for our fuel designs, development, and related alternatives by filing patent applications in the U.S. and other countries as appropriate.

We ensure that we own intellectual property created for us by employees, independent contractors, consultants, companies, and any other third party by signing agreements with them that assign any intellectual property rights to us. 

We have established business procedures designed to maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary information, including the use of confidentiality agreements with employees, independent contractors, consultants and entities with which we conduct business.

In addition to our patent portfolio, we also own trademarks to the Lightbridge corporate name and the Lightbridge logo.

Human Capital Management

As of December 31, 2022, we had five full-time employees and utilized a network of independent contractors, outside agencies and technical facilities with specific skills to assist with various business functions including, but not limited to, corporate, financial, personnel, research and development, and communications. This allows us to draw upon resources that are specifically tailored to our internal and client needs. The Company’s headquarters is in Reston, Virginia. 
Our Culture

Our mission is to help the world combat climate change and meet energy goals. We are passionate about understanding the needs of our society, and we work hard to develop our next generation nuclear fuel. We also believe that supporting our team with a wonderful work environment supports and empowers us to accomplish our goals. The Company’s human resource professional is a resource available for employees regarding the development of their careers and training. We also have physical and mental health programs that are available to our employees. We believe that our relationship with our employees and contractors is satisfactory.
Diversity and Inclusion

To truly help the world combat climate change, we need to work with a diversity of partners as well as have a diverse workforce. We also must operate with a high degree of awareness of evolving social conditions and social justice and create policy accordingly. We acknowledge that these measures evolve over time and we are committed to improving our policies as awareness of social inequities or injustice arise. We believe an equitable and inclusive environment with diverse teams produces more creative solutions and results in better outcomes for our employees and stakeholders. We strive to attract, retain and promote diverse talent at all levels of the organization.
