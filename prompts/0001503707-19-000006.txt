Item 1. Business
References to “we,” “us” or “our” refer to NorthStar Healthcare Income, Inc. and its subsidiaries, in all cases acting through its external advisor, unless context specifically requires otherwise.
Overview
We were formed to acquire, originate and asset manage a diversified portfolio of equity, debt and securities investments in healthcare real estate, directly or through joint ventures, with a focus on the mid-acuity senior housing sector, which we define as assisted living, memory care, skilled nursing and independent living facilities and continuing care retirement communities. We also invest in other healthcare property types, including medical office buildings, hospitals, rehabilitation facilities and ancillary healthcare services businesses. Our investments are predominantly in the United States, but we also selectively make international investments. 
We were formed in October 2010 as a Maryland corporation and commenced operations in February 2013. We elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Internal Revenue Code, commencing with the taxable year ended December 31, 2013. We conduct our operations so as to continue to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
We completed our initial public offering, or our Initial Offering, on February 2, 2015 by raising gross proceeds of $1.1 billion, including 108.6 million shares issued in our initial primary offering, or our Initial Primary Offering, and 2.0 million shares issued pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan, or our DRP. In addition, we completed our follow-on offering, or our Follow-On Offering, on January 19, 2016 by raising gross proceeds of $700.0 million, including 64.9 million shares issued in our follow-on primary offering, or our Follow-on Primary Offering, and 4.2 million shares issued pursuant to our DRP. We refer to our Initial Primary Offering and our Follow-on Primary Offering collectively as our Primary Offering and our Initial Offering and Follow-On Offering collectively as our Offering. In December 2015, we registered an additional 30.0 million shares to be offered pursuant to our DRP and continue to offer such shares, although we suspended payment of monthly distributions to stockholders on February 1, 2019. From inception through March 21, 2019, we raised total gross proceeds of $2.0 billion, including $232.6 million in DRP proceeds. 
We are externally managed and have no employees. We are sponsored by Colony Capital, Inc. (NYSE: CLNY), or Colony Capital or our Sponsor, which was formed as a result of the mergers of NorthStar Asset Management Group Inc., or NSAM, our prior sponsor, with Colony Capital, Inc., or Colony, and NorthStar Realty Finance Corp., or NorthStar Realty, in January 2017. Effective June 25, 2018, the Sponsor changed its name from Colony NorthStar, Inc. to Colony Capital, Inc. and its ticker symbol from “CLNS” to “CLNY.” Following the mergers, our Sponsor became an internally-managed equity REIT, with a diversified real estate and investment management platform. 
Colony Capital manages capital on behalf of its stockholders, as well as institutional and retail investors in private funds, non-traded and traded REITs and registered investment companies, which we refer to collectively as the Managed Companies. As of December 31, 2018, our Sponsor had $43.0 billion of assets under management, including Colony Capital’s balance sheet investments and third-party managed investments. Our advisor, CNI NSHC Advisors, LLC, or our Advisor, is a subsidiary of Colony Capital and manages our day-to-day operations pursuant to an advisory agreement.
Our Strategy
Our primary objective is to invest and manage our portfolio to maximize shareholder value by generating attractive risk-adjusted returns, while maintaining stable cash flow for distributions. The key elements of our strategy include:

• | Grow the Operating Income Generated by Our Portfolio. Through active portfolio management, we will continue to review and implement operating strategies and initiatives in order to enhance the performance of our existing investment portfolio. 


• | Pursue Strategic Capital Expenditures and Development Opportunities. We will continue to invest capital into our operating portfolio in order to maintain market position as well as functional and operating standards. In addition, we will continue to execute on and identify strategic development opportunities for our existing investments that may involve replacing, converting or renovating facilities in our portfolio which, in turn, would allow us to provide an optimal mix of services and enhance the overall value of our assets. 


• | Consider Selective Dispositions and Opportunities for Asset Repositioning. We will consider selective dispositions of assets in connection with strategic repositioning of assets or otherwise where we believe the disposition will achieve a desired return or opportunities exist to enhance overall returns. As the healthcare industry evolves, we will continue to 

5

assess the need for strategic asset repositioning, including evaluating assets, operators and markets to position our portfolio for optimal performance.

• | Maintain a Diversified Portfolio. We believe that mid-acuity senior housing facilities provide an opportunity to generate risk-adjusted returns and benefit from positive future demographic trends. In addition, we believe that maintaining a balanced portfolio of assets diversified by investment type, geographic location, asset type, revenue source and operating model may mitigate the risk that any single factor or event could materially harm our business. Portfolio diversification also enhances the reliability of our cash flows by reducing our exposure to single-state regulatory or reimbursement changes, regional climate events and local economic downturns. 


• | Financing Strategy. We use asset-level financing as part of our investment strategy to leverage our investments while managing refinancing and interest rate risk. We typically finance our investments with medium to long-term, non-recourse mortgage loans, though our borrowing levels and terms vary depending upon the nature of the assets and the related financing. In addition, we have a revolving line of credit to provide additional short-term liquidity as needed. Refer to “Liquidity and Capital Resources” in Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for additional information. 

Our Investments
We have invested in independent living facilities, or ILF, assisted living facilities, or ALF, memory care facilities, or MCF, continuing care retirement communities, or CCRC, which we collectively refer to as senior housing facilities, skilled nursing facilities, or SNF, medical office buildings, or MOB, and hospitals.
Our primary investment segments are as follows:

• | Direct Investments - Net Lease - Healthcare properties operated under net leases with a tenant operator.


• | Direct Investments - Operating - Healthcare properties operated pursuant to management agreements with healthcare operators.


• | Unconsolidated Investments - Healthcare joint ventures, including properties operated under net leases or pursuant to management agreements with healthcare operators, in which we own a minority interest.


• | Debt and Securities Investments - Mortgage loans or mezzanine loans to owners of healthcare real estate and commercial mortgage backed securities, or CMBS, backed primarily by loans secured by healthcare properties. As of December 31, 2018, we had one mezzanine loan. 

For financial information regarding our reportable segments, refer to Note 14, “Segment Reporting” in our accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

_______________________________________

(1) | Classification based on predominant services provided, but may include other services.

Our investments include the following types of healthcare facilities as of December 31, 2018:

• | Senior Housing. We define senior housing to include ILFs, ALFs, MCFs and CCRCs, as described in further detail below. Revenues generated by senior housing facilities typically come from private pay sources, including private insurance, and to a much lesser extent government reimbursement programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. 


◦ | Assisted living facilities. ALFs provide services that include minimal assistance for activities in daily living and permit residents to maintain some of their privacy and independence as they do not require constant supervision and assistance. Services bundled within one regular monthly fee usually include three meals per day in a central dining room, daily housekeeping, laundry, medical reminders and 24-hour availability of assistance with the activities of daily living, such as eating, dressing and bathing. Professional nursing and healthcare services are usually available at the facility on call or at regularly scheduled times. ALFs typically are comprised of one and two bedroom suites equipped with private bathrooms and efficiency kitchens. 


◦ | Independent living facilities. ILFs are age-restricted multi-family properties with central dining facilities that provide services that include security, housekeeping, nutrition and limited laundry services. ILFs are designed specifically for independent seniors who are able to live on their own, but desire the security and conveniences of community living. ILFs typically offer several services covered under a regular monthly fee. 


◦ | Memory care facilities. MCFs offer specialized options for seniors with Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia. Purpose built, free-standing memory care facilities offer an attractive alternative for private-pay residents affected by memory loss in comparison to other accommodations that typically have been provided within a secured unit of an ALF or SNF. These facilities offer dedicated care and specialized programming for various conditions relating to memory loss in a secured environment that is typically smaller in scale and more residential in nature than traditional assisted living facilities. Residents require a higher level of care and more assistance with activities of daily living than in assisted living facilities. Therefore, these facilities have staff available 24 hours a day to respond to the unique needs of their residents. 


◦ | Continuing care retirement community. CCRCs provide, as a continuum of care, the services described for ILFs, ALFs and SNFs in an integrated campus. CCRCs can be structured to offer services covered under a regular monthly rental fee or under a one-time upfront entrance fee, which is partially refundable in certain circumstances. Residents under entrance fee agreements may also pay a monthly service fee, which entitles them to the use of certain amenities and services, however, the monthly fees are generally less than fees at a comparable rental community. The refundable portion of a resident's entrance fee is generally refundable within a certain period following contract termination or upon the resale of the unit, or in some agreements, upon the resale of a comparable unit or after the resident vacates the unit. Some entrance fee agreements entitle the resident to a refund of the original entrance fee paid plus a percentage of the appreciation of the unit upon resale. 


• | Skilled Nursing Facilities. SNFs provide services that include daily nursing, therapeutic rehabilitation, social services, housekeeping, nutrition and administrative services for individuals requiring certain assistance for activities in daily 

8

living. A typical SNF includes mostly one and two bed units, each equipped with a private or shared bathroom and community dining facilities. Revenues generated from SNFs typically come from government reimbursement programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, as well as private pay sources, including private insurance. 

• | Medical Office Buildings. MOBs are typically either single-tenant properties associated with a specialty group or multi-tenant properties leased to several unrelated medical practices. Tenants include physicians, dentists, psychologists, therapists and other healthcare providers, who require space devoted to patient examination and treatment, diagnostic imaging, outpatient surgery and other outpatient services. MOBs are similar to commercial office buildings, although they require greater plumbing, electrical and mechanical systems to accommodate physicians’ requirements such as sinks in every room, brighter lights and specialized medical equipment. 


• | Hospitals. Services provided by operators and tenants in hospitals are paid for by private sources, third-party payers (e.g., insurance and Health Maintenance Organizations), or through the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Our hospital properties typically will include acute care, long-term acute care, specialty and rehabilitation hospitals and generally are leased to single tenants or operators under triple-net lease structures. 

Direct Investments - Operating
For our operating properties, we enter in management agreements that generally provide for the payment of a fee to a manager, typically 4-5% of gross revenues with the potential for certain incentive compensation, and have direct exposure to the revenues and operating expenses of a property. As a result, our operating properties allow us to participate in the risks and rewards of the operations of healthcare facilities. Revenue derived from ILFs within our direct operating investments is classified as rental income on our consolidated statements of operations. Revenue derived from ALFs, MCFs and CCRCs within our direct operating investments is classified as resident fee income on our consolidated statements of operations. 
The weighted average resident occupancy of our operating properties was 81.6% as of December 31, 2018.
Direct Investments - Net Lease
For our net lease properties, we enter into net leases that generally provide for fixed rental payments, subject to periodic increases based on certain percentages or the consumer price index, and obligate the tenant to pay all property-related expenses, including maintenance, utilities, repairs, taxes, insurance and capital expenditures. Revenue derived from our net lease properties is classified as rental income on our consolidated statements of operations. 
Our net lease properties are leased to four operators, with a remaining weighted average lease term of 7.9 years as of December 31, 2018.
Operators and Tenants
The following table presents the operators and tenants of our direct investments as of December 31, 2018 (dollars in thousands):
 | | | | | Year Ended December 31, 2018

_______________________________________

(1) | Represents rooms for ALF and ILF and beds for MCF and SNF, based on predominant type.


(2) | Solstice Senior Living, LLC is a joint venture of which affiliates of Integral Senior Living own 80%.


(3) | Effective February 2018, properties under the management of Bonaventure were transitioned to Avamere Health Services.


(4) | As a result of the tenant failing to remit rental payments, we accelerated the amortization of capitalized lease inducements. Properties and unit counts exclude one property held for sale. 


(5) | Consists primarily of interest income earned on corporate-level cash accounts.

We have been in the process of transitioning several of our portfolios to new operators or managers. In certain instances, we transitioned portfolios as part of our overall business plan, or as a result of a decision that a seller does not want to continue 
9

managing the portfolio following the acquisition. For example, in November 2017, we began the transition of operations of the Winterfell portfolio from the former manager, an affiliate of Holiday Retirement, to a new manager, Solstice. Solstice is a joint venture between affiliates of Integral Senior Living, or ISL, a leading management company of senior independent living, assisted living and memory care properties founded in 2000, which owns 80%, and us, who owns 20%. We have also transitioned operations of the newly acquired Rochester, Avamere and Oak Cottage portfolios, which were planned in connection with the acquisitions.
In other instances, the transition was the result of the failure of an operator to meet certain of its lease obligations, such as the Kansas City portfolio, for which we entered into a new management agreement with a third party manager, ISL, in June 2017, and the Peregrine portfolio, for which we entered into a new lease with an affiliate of Senior Lifestyle Corporation, or SLC, and transitioned two of the four properties to SLC in the third quarter of 2016.
While several of our portfolios have completed the process of transitioning operators and managers, the ongoing impact of the completed transitions and new transitions continued through 2018.
Watermark Retirement Communities and Solstice, together with their affiliates, manage substantially all of our operating properties. As a result, we are dependent upon their personnel, expertise, technical resources and information systems, proprietary information, good faith and judgment to manage our properties efficiently and effectively. Through our 20.0% ownership of Solstice, we are entitled to certain rights and minority protections. 
Unconsolidated Investments
As of December 31, 2018, our unconsolidated investments included the following:

• | Griffin-American. We own a 14.3% interest in a $3.3 billion portfolio, based on cost, of SNFs, ALFs, MOBs and hospitals across the United States and care homes in the United Kingdom. Our Sponsor and other minority partners own the remaining 85.7% of this portfolio. 


• | Trilogy. We own a 23.2% interest in a $1.5 billion portfolio, based on cost, of predominantly SNFs located in the Midwest and operated pursuant to management agreements with Trilogy Health Services, as well as ancillary services businesses, including a therapy business and a pharmacy business. The joint venture continues to be active in the development of new facilities as part of its business plan and has grown, in both property count and net operating income, year-over-year. Griffin-American Healthcare REIT III, Inc., or GAHR3, Griffin-American Healthcare REIT IV, Inc., or GAHR4, and management of Trilogy own the remaining 76.8% of this portfolio. 


• | Espresso. We own a 36.7% interest in a $0.9 billion portfolio, based on cost, of predominantly SNFs, located in various regions across the United States, and organized in six sub-portfolios and currently leased to nine different operators under net leases. Three of the sub-portfolios within the Espresso joint venture have executed operator transitions plans. An affiliate of Formation Capital, or Formation, acts as the general partner and manager of this investment. We also have a mezzanine loan relating to this portfolio. Refer to “—Real Estate Debt and Securities Investments Overview” below. 


• | Eclipse. We own a 5.6% interest in a $1.0 billion portfolio, based on cost, of SNFs and ALFs leased to, or managed by, a variety of different operators across the United States. Our Sponsor and other minority partners and Formation own 86.4% and 8.0% of this portfolio, respectively. 


• | Solstice. We own a 20.0% interest in an operator platform joint venture established to manage the operations of the Winterfell portfolio. An affiliate of Integral Senior Living, LLC, a leading management company of ILF, ALF and MCF founded in 2000, owns the remaining 80.0%. 


• | Envoy. We own an 11.4% interest in a $0.1 billion portfolio, based on cost, of SNFs located in the Mid-Atlantic region and operated by a single operator. Formation acts as the general partner and manager of this investment. All remaining properties within the Envoy portfolio have been reclassified as held for sale as of December 31, 2018. In March 2019, the Envoy joint venture completed the sale of the 11 properties, for a sales price of $118.0 million. 

Real Estate Debt and Securities Investments Overview
As of December 31, 2018, our investments in real estate debt secured by healthcare facilities consisted of one mezzanine loan, which matures on January 30, 2021. Our mezzanine loan relates to the Espresso portfolio, in which we also have an equity investment. Refer to “—Unconsolidated Investments” above.

The following table presents a summary of our debt investment as of December 31, 2018 (dollars in thousands):

Investment Type: | Count | PrincipalAmount | | CarryingValue(2) | Fixed Rate | | UnleveragedCurrentYield
Espresso Mezzanine loan(1) | 1 | $ | 75,000 | | $ | 58,600 | | 10.0 | % | 10.3 | %

_______________________________________

(1) | Property types underlying the mezzanine loan predominately include SNFs, which are located primarily in the Midwest, Northeast and Southeast regions of the United States.


(2) | As a result of impairments and other non-cash reserves recorded by the joint venture, the carrying value of our Espresso unconsolidated investment was reduced to zero as of December 31, 2018. We have recorded the excess equity in losses related to our unconsolidated investment as a reduction to the carrying value of our mezzanine loan, which was originated to a subsidiary of the Espresso joint venture. 

As of December 31, 2018, our debt investment was not performing in accordance with the contractual terms of its governing documents.  The Espresso mezzanine loan is secured by a joint venture that has several sub-portfolios, three of which have experienced tenant lease defaults and operator transitions.  The underlying tenant defaults resulted in defaults under the senior loans with respect to the applicable sub-portfolios, which in turn resulted in defaults under our mezzanine loan as of December 31, 2018.  We are actively monitoring the actions of the senior lenders of each sub-portfolio and assessing our rights and remedies.  We are also actively monitoring the operator transitions and continue to assess the collectability of principal and interest. As of March 21, 2019, contractual debt service on the Espresso mezzanine loan has been paid in accordance with contractual terms. 
Portfolio Management 
Our Advisor and its affiliates, directly or together with third party sub-advisors, maintain a comprehensive portfolio management process that generally includes oversight by an asset management team, regular management meetings and an exhaustive quarterly credit and operating results review process. These processes are designed to enable management to evaluate and proactively identify asset-specific credit issues and trends on a portfolio-wide, sub-portfolio or by asset type basis. Nevertheless, we cannot be certain that our Advisor’s review, or any third parties acting on our or our Advisor’s behalf, will identify all issues within our portfolio due to, among other things, adverse economic conditions or events adversely affecting specific assets; therefore, potential future losses may also stem from issues that are not identified during these portfolio reviews or the asset and portfolio management process. 
Formation provides asset management services to us in connection with the Eclipse, Espresso and Envoy joint ventures. Our Advisor, under the direction of its investment committee, supervises Formation and retains ultimate oversight and responsibility for the management of our portfolio.
Our Advisor, together with Formation (referred to herein as our Advisor’s asset management team), are experienced and use many methods to actively manage our asset base to enhance or preserve our income, value and capital and mitigate risk. Our Advisor’s asset management team seeks to identify strategic development opportunities for our existing and future investments that may involve replacing, converting or renovating facilities in our portfolio which, in turn, would allow us to provide optimal mix of services and enhance the overall value of our assets. To manage risk, our Advisor’s asset management team engages in frequent review and dialogue with operators/managers/borrowers/third party advisors and periodic inspections of our owned properties and collateral. In addition, our Advisor’s asset management team considers the impact of regulatory changes on the performance of our portfolio. During the quarterly credit and operating results review, or more frequently as necessary, investments are put on highly-monitored status, as appropriate, based upon several factors, including missed or late contractual payments, significant declines in performance and other data which may indicate a potential issue in our ability to recover our invested capital from an investment. Each situation depends on many factors, including the number of properties, the type of property, macro and local market conditions impacting supply/demand, cash flow and the financial condition of our operators/managers/borrowers.
We will continue to monitor the performance of, and actively manage, all of our investments. However, there can be no assurance that our investments will continue to perform in accordance with the contractual terms of the governing documents or underwriting and we may, in the future, record impairment, as appropriate, if required.
Independent Directors’ Review of Our Policies
As required by our charter, our independent directors have reviewed our policies, including but not limited to our policies regarding investments, leverage, conflicts of interest and investment allocation and determined that they are in the best interests of our stockholders. Our key policies that provide the basis for such determination are summarized herein.
11

Regulation
We are subject, in certain circumstances, to supervision and regulation by state and federal governmental authorities and are subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing various requirements and restrictions, which, among other things: 

• | regulate our public disclosures, reporting obligations and capital raising activity;


• | require compliance with applicable REIT rules;


• | regulate healthcare operators, including those in the senior housing sector that may be our operators, with respect to licensure, certification for participation in government programs and relationships with patients, physicians, tenants and other referral sources;


• | establish loan servicing standards;


• | regulate credit granting activities;


• | require disclosures to customers;


• | govern secured transactions;


• | set collection, taking title to collateral, repossession and claims-handling procedures and other trade practices;


• | regulate land use and zoning;


• | regulate the foreign ownership or management of real property or mortgages;


• | regulate the ability of foreign persons or corporations to remove profits earned from activities within the country to the person’s or corporation’s country of origin;


• | regulate tax treatment and accounting standards; and


• | regulate use of derivative instruments and our ability to hedge our risks related to fluctuations in interest rates and exchange rates.

In the judgment of management, while we do incur significant expense complying with the various regulations to which we are subject, existing statutes and regulations have not had a material adverse effect on our business. However, it is not possible to forecast the nature of future legislation, regulations, judicial decisions, orders or interpretations, nor their impact upon our future business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.
For additional information regarding regulations applicable to us, refer to below and Item 1A. “Risk Factors.”
Tax Regulation
We elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code, commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2013. If we maintain our qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we will generally not be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income that we distribute as dividends to our stockholders. If we fail to maintain our qualification as a REIT in any taxable year after electing REIT status, we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates and will generally not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for four years following the year in which our qualification is denied. Such an event could materially and adversely affect our net income. However, we believe that we are organized and operate in a manner that enables us to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes and we intend to continue to operate so as to remain qualified as a REIT for federal income tax purposes thereafter. In addition, we operate certain healthcare properties through structures permitted under the REIT Investment Diversification and Empowerment Act of 2007, or RIDEA, which permit the Company, through taxable REIT subsidiaries, or TRSs, to have direct exposure to resident fee income and incur related operating expenses.

The Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015
On December 18, 2015, President Obama signed into law the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, an omnibus spending bill, with a provision referred to as the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015, or the PATH Act. On June 7, 2016, the Internal Revenue Service, or the IRS, issued temporary Treasury Regulations under the PATH Act, finalized in part in Treasury Regulations issued on January 17, 2017. The PATH Act and the accompanying Treasury Regulations changed certain of the rules affecting REIT qualification and taxation of REITs and REIT stockholders described under the heading “U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations” in our prospectus included in our Registration Statement on Form S‑3 filed December 7, 2015. These changes are briefly summarized as follows: 

• | For taxable years beginning after 2017, the percentage of a REIT’s total assets that may be represented by securities of one or more TRSs is reduced from 25% to 20%.


• | For distributions in taxable years beginning after 2014, the preferential dividend rules no longer apply to us as a “publicly offered REIT,” as defined in Internal Revenue Code Section 562(c)(2).


• | For taxable years beginning after 2015, debt instruments issued by publicly offered REITs are treated as real estate assets for purposes of the 75% asset test, but interest on debt of a publicly offered REIT will not be qualifying income under the 75% gross income test unless the debt is secured by real property. Under a new asset test, not more than 25% of the value of a REIT’s assets may consist of debt instruments that are issued by publicly offered REITs and would not otherwise be treated as qualifying real estate assets. 


• | For taxable years beginning after 2015, to the extent rent attributable to personal property is treated as rents from real property (because rent attributable to the personal property for the taxable year does not exceed 15% of the total rent for the taxable year for such real and personal property), the personal property will be treated as a real estate asset for purposes of the 75% asset test. Similarly, a debt obligation secured by a mortgage on both real and personal property will be treated as a real estate asset for purposes of the 75% asset test, and interest thereon will be treated as interest on an obligation secured by real property, if the fair market value of the personal property does not exceed 15% of the fair market value of all property securing the debt. 


• | For taxable years beginning after 2015, a 100% excise tax will apply to “redetermined services income,” i.e., non-arm’s-length income of a REIT’s TRS attributable to services provided to, or on behalf of, the REIT (other than services provided to REIT tenants, which are potentially taxed as redetermined rents).


• | For taxable years beginning after 2014, the period during which dispositions of properties with net built-in gains acquired from C corporations in carry-over basis transactions will trigger the built-in gains tax was reduced from ten years to five years.


• | REITs are subject to a 100% tax on net income from “prohibited transactions,” i.e., sales of dealer property (other than “foreclosure property”). These rules also contain safe harbors under which certain sales of real estate assets will not be treated as prohibited transactions. One of the requirements for the current safe harbors is that (I) the REIT does not make more than seven sales of property (subject to specified exceptions) during the taxable year at issue, or (II) the aggregate adjusted bases (as determined for purposes of computing earnings and profits) of property (other than excepted property) sold during the taxable year does not exceed 10% of the aggregate bases in the REIT’s assets as of the beginning of the taxable year, or (III) the fair market value of property (other than excepted property) sold during the taxable year does not exceed 10% of the fair market value of the REIT’s total assets as of the beginning of the taxable year. If a REIT relies on clause (II) or (III), substantially all of the marketing and certain development expenditures with respect to the properties sold must be made through an independent contractor. For taxable years beginning after December 18, 2015, clauses (II) and (III) were liberalized to permit the REIT to sell properties with an aggregate adjusted basis (or fair market value) of up to 20% of the aggregate bases in (or fair market value of) the REIT’s assets as long as the 10% standard is satisfied on average over the three-year period comprised of the taxable year at issue and the two immediately preceding taxable years. In addition, for taxable years beginning after 2015, for REITs that rely on clauses (II) or (III), a TRS may make the marketing and development expenditures that previously had to be made by independent contractors. 


• | A number of changes applicable to REITs were made to the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act of 1980, or FIRPTA, rules for taxing non-U.S. persons on gains from sales of U.S. real property interests, or USRPIs:


• | For dispositions and distributions on or after December 18, 2015, the stock ownership thresholds for exemption from FIRPTA taxation on sale of stock of a publicly traded REIT and for recharacterizing capital gain dividends as ordinary dividends were increased from not more than 5% to not more than 10%.


• | Effective December 18, 2015, new rules simplified the determination of whether we are a “domestically controlled qualified investment entity.”

13


• | For dispositions and distributions after December 18, 2015, “qualified foreign pension funds” as defined in new Internal Revenue Code Section 897(l)(2) and entities that are wholly owned by a qualified foreign pension fund are exempted from FIRPTA and FIRPTA withholding. New FIRPTA rules also apply to “qualified shareholders” as defined in Internal Revenue Code Section 897(k)(3). 


• | For sales of USRPIs occurring after February 16, 2016, the FIRPTA withholding rate for sales of USRPIs and certain distributions generally increased from 10% to 15%.

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
On December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law H.R. 1, informally titled the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the TCJA. The TCJA made major changes to the Internal Revenue Code including several provisions of the Internal Revenue Code that may affect the taxation of REITs and their securityholders described under the heading “U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations” in our prospectus included in our Registration Statement on Form S-3 filed December 7, 2015. The individual and collective impact of these changes on REITs and their securityholders remains uncertain in some respects, and may not become evident for some period. The most significant of these provisions are briefly summarized as follows:

• | With respect to individuals, the TCJA made significant changes to individual tax rates and deductions:


• | The TCJA created seven income tax brackets for individuals ranging from 10% to 37% that generally apply at higher thresholds than current law. For example, the highest 37% rate applies to joint return filer incomes above $600,000, instead of the highest 39.6% rate that applied to incomes above $470,700 under pre-TCJA law.


• | The maximum 20% rate that applies to long-term capital gains and qualified dividend income is unchanged, as is the 3.8% Medicare tax on net investment income remained unchanged.


• | The TCJA eliminated personal exemptions, but nearly doubled the standard deduction for most individuals (for example, the standard deduction for joint return filers rose from $12,700 in 2017 to $24,000 in 2018).


• | The TCJA eliminated many itemized deductions, limited individual deductions for state and local income, property and sales taxes (other than those paid in a trade or business) to $10,000 collectively for joint return filers (with a special provision to prevent 2017 deductions for prepayment of 2018 taxes), and limited the amount of new acquisition indebtedness on principal or second residences for which mortgage interest deductions are available to $750,000. Interest deductions for new home equity debt were eliminated.


• | Charitable deductions were generally preserved. The phaseout of itemized deductions based on income was eliminated.


• | The TCJA did not eliminate the individual alternative minimum tax, but it raised the exemption and exemption phaseout threshold for application of the tax.


• | These individual income tax changes were generally effective beginning in 2018, but without further legislation, they will sunset after 2025.


• | Under the TCJA, individuals, trusts, and estates generally may deduct 20% of “qualified business income” (generally, domestic trade or business income other than certain investment items) of certain pass-through entities. In addition, “qualified REIT dividends” (i.e., REIT dividends other than capital gain dividends and portions of REIT dividends designated as qualified dividend income, which in each case are already eligible for capital gain tax rates) and certain other income items are eligible for the deduction by the taxpayer. The overall deduction is limited to 20% of the sum of the taxpayer’s taxable income (less net capital gain) and certain cooperative dividends, subject to further limitations based on taxable income. In addition, for taxpayers with income above a certain threshold (e.g., $315,000 for joint return filers), the deduction for each trade or business is generally limited to no more than the greater of (i) 50% of the taxpayer’s proportionate share of total wages from the pass-through entity, or (ii) 25% of the taxpayer’s proportionate share of such total wages plus 2.5% of the unadjusted basis of acquired tangible depreciable property that is used to produce qualified business income and satisfies certain other requirements. The deduction for qualified REIT dividends is not subject to these wage and property basis limits. Consequently, the deduction equates to a maximum 29.6% tax rate on ordinary REIT dividends. As with the other individual income tax changes, the deduction provisions were effective beginning in 2018. Without further legislation, the deduction would sunset after 2025.


• | Net operating loss, or NOL, provisions were modified by the TCJA. The TCJA limits the NOL deduction to 80% of taxable income (before the deduction). It also generally eliminates NOL carrybacks for individuals and non-REIT corporations (NOL carrybacks did not apply to REITs under prior law), but allows indefinite NOL carryforwards. The new NOL rules apply to losses arising in taxable years beginning in 2018.

14


• | The TCJA reduced the 35% maximum corporate income tax rate to a maximum 21% corporate rate, and reduced the dividends-received deduction for certain corporate subsidiaries. The reduction of the corporate tax rate to 21% also results in the reduction of the maximum rate of withholding with respect to our distributions to non-U.S. stockholders that are treated as attributable to gains from the sale or exchange of USRPIs from 35% to 21%. The TCJA also permanently eliminated the corporate alternative minimum tax. These provisions were effective beginning in 2018.


• | The TCJA limits a taxpayer’s net interest expense deduction to 30% of the sum of adjusted taxable income, business interest, and certain other amounts. Adjusted taxable income does not include items of income or expense not allocable to a trade or business, business interest or expense, the new deduction for qualified business income, NOLs, and for years prior to 2022, deductions for depreciation, amortization, or depletion. For partnerships, the interest deduction limit is applied at the partnership level, subject to certain adjustments to the partners for unused deduction limitation at the partnership level. The TCJA allows a real property trade or business to elect out of this interest limit so long as it uses a 40-year recovery period for nonresidential real property, a 30-year recovery period for residential rental property, and a 20-year recovery period for related improvements described below. For this purpose, a real property trade or business is any real property development, redevelopment, construction, reconstruction, acquisition, conversion, rental, operating, management, leasing, or brokerage trade or business. We believe this definition encompasses our business and thus will allow us the option of electing out of the limits on interest deductibility should we determine it is prudent to do so. Nonetheless, if a domestic TRS borrows funds either from us or a third party, it may be unable to deduct all or a portion of the interest paid, resulting in a higher corporate-level tax liability. Disallowed interest expense is carried forward indefinitely (subject to special rules for partnerships). The interest deduction limit applied beginning in 2018. 


• | For taxpayers that do not use the TCJA’s real property trade or business exception to the business interest deduction limits, the TCJA maintains the current 39-year and 27.5-year straight line recovery periods for nonresidential real property and residential rental property, respectively, and provides that tenant improvements for such taxpayers are subject to a general 15-year recovery period. Also, the TCJA temporarily allows 100% expensing of certain new or used tangible property through 2022, phasing out at 20% for each following year (with an election available for 50% expensing of such property if placed in service during the first taxable year ending after September 27, 2017). The changes apply, generally, to property acquired after September 27, 2017 and placed in service after September 27, 2017.


• | The TCJA continues the deferral of gain from the like kind exchange of real property, but provides that foreign real property is no longer “like kind” to domestic real property. Furthermore, the TCJA eliminated like-kind exchanges for most personal property. These changes were effective generally for exchanges completed after December 31, 2017, with a transition rule allowing such exchanges where one part of the exchange was completed prior to December 31, 2017.


• | The TCJA moves the United States from a worldwide to a modified territorial tax system, with provisions included to prevent corporate base erosion. These provisions could affect the taxation of foreign subsidiaries and/or properties.


• | The TCJA made other significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code. These changes include provisions limiting the ability to offset dividend and interest income with partnership or S corporation net active business losses. These provisions were effective beginning in 2018, but without further legislation, will sunset after 2025.

U.S. Healthcare Regulation
Overview
Assisted living, independent living, memory care, hospitals, skilled nursing facilities and other healthcare providers that operate healthcare properties in our portfolio are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws, regulations and industry standards governing their operations. Failure to comply with any of these, and other, laws could result in loss of licensure, loss of certification or accreditation, denial of reimbursement, imposition of civil and/or criminal penalties and fines, suspension or exclusion from federal and state healthcare programs, or closure of the facility. Although the properties within our portfolio may be subject to varying levels of governmental scrutiny, we expect that the healthcare industry, in general, will continue to face increased regulation and pressure in the areas of fraud and abuse and privacy and security, among others. We also expect that efforts by third-party payors, such as the federal Medicare program, state Medicaid programs and private insurers, to impose greater and more stringent cost controls upon operators will intensify and continue. Changes in laws, regulations, reimbursement, and enforcement activity can all have a significant effect on the operations and financial condition of our tenants, operators and managers, which in turn may adversely impact us, as set forth below and under Item 1A. “Risk Factors.” 
Fraud and Abuse Enforcement
Healthcare providers are subject to federal and state laws and regulations that govern their operations and, in some cases, arrangements with referral sources. These laws include those that require providers to furnish only medically necessary services and submit to third-party payors valid and accurate statements for each service, Medicare and Medicaid laws and regulations, privacy and security laws, as well as kickback laws, self-referral laws and false claims acts. In particular, enforcement of the 
15

federal False Claims Act has resulted in increased enforcement activity for healthcare providers and can involve significant monetary damages and awards to private plaintiffs who successfully bring “whistleblower” lawsuits. Sanctions for violations of these laws, regulations and other applicable guidance may include, but are not limited to, loss of licensure, loss of certification or accreditation, denial of reimbursement, imposition of civil and/or criminal penalties and fines, suspension or exclusion from federal and state healthcare programs or closure of the facility, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the operations and financial condition of our tenants, operators and managers, which, in turn may adversely impact us.
Healthcare Reform
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, or ACA, impacted the healthcare marketplace by decreasing the number of uninsured individuals in the United States through the establishment of health insurance exchanges to facilitate the purchase of health insurance, expanded Medicaid eligibility, subsidized insurance premiums and included requirements and incentives for businesses to provide healthcare benefits. The ACA remains subject to legislative, administrative, and judicial scrutiny. In 2017, Congress enacted legislation eliminating the tax penalty for individuals who do not purchase insurance after it unsuccessfully sought to replace substantial parts of the ACA with different mechanisms for facilitating insurance coverage in the commercial and Medicaid markets. Additionally, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, discontinued payment of cost-sharing reduction subsidies to insurance providers. In 2018, the average annual premium for employer-based family coverage rose 5 percent and 3 percent for single coverage. Further, CMS has begun approving waivers permitting states to alter state Medicaid programs by, among other things, requiring individuals to meet certain requirements, like work requirements, in order to maintain eligibility for Medicaid (although some of these waivers have subsequently been challenged in court). These and other actions may impact the insurance markets and reduce the number of individuals purchasing insurance or qualifying for Medicaid and may negatively impact the operations and financial condition of our tenants, operators and managers, which in turn may adversely impact us. Congress may revisit ACA or Medicaid reform legislation in 2019. If the ACA is repealed or further substantially modified, or if implementation of certain aspects of the ACA are suspended, slowed, or subject to reduced funding, such actions could negatively impact the operations and financial condition of our tenants and operators, which in turn may adversely impact us.
On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court in Texas ruled the ACA unconstitutional in its entirety. This decision has been appealed, and will not take effect while that appeal is pending. Nonetheless, should this ruling be upheld upon appeal, it could dramatically change U.S. healthcare regulation in numerous ways and may potentially spur congressional action, making the ultimate consequences of the ruling difficult to predict. Should the ruling be upheld and implemented, the immediate effects would include reduced access to health coverage through: (1) reduced Medicaid eligibility, (2) the disestablishment of health insurance exchanges and accompanying subsidized premiums, and (3) no requirement for businesses to provide health insurance. Amendments, including certain waivers, to healthcare fraud and abuse laws made by the ACA would also be void, which could change the enforcement posture of federal regulators. Current healthcare reimbursement standards, including those discussed below, are predicated on changes made by the ACA and implementation of this ruling would create significant uncertainty regarding the legality of such standards and what standards are in effect absent the ACA. The effects of this ruling could adversely affect the operations and financial condition of our tenants and operators, which in turn may adversely impact us. 
Reimbursement Generally
Federal, state and private payor reimbursement methodologies applied to healthcare providers continue to evolve.  Federal and state healthcare financing authorities are continuing to implement new or modified reimbursement methodologies that shift risk to healthcare providers and generally reduce payments for services, which may negatively impact healthcare property operations. Additionally, Congress and the current presidential administration could substantially change the health insurance industry and payment systems. The impact of any such changes, if implemented, may result in an adverse effect on our tenants, managers and operators, which in turn may adversely impact us.
SNFs and hospitals typically receive most of their revenues from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, with the balance representing reimbursement payments from private payors, including private insurers and self-pay patients. Senior housing facilities (ALFs, ILFs and MCFs) typically receive most of their revenues from private pay sources and a small portion of their revenue from the Medicaid program. Providers that contract with government and private payors may be subject to periodic pre- and post-payment reviews and other audits. Payors are increasing their scrutiny of payments for items and services, and are increasingly decreasing or denying payments to providers. A review or audit of a property operator’s claims could result in recoupments, denials or delay of payments in the future, each of which could have a significant negative financial impact on such property. Additionally, there can be no guarantee that a third-party payor will continue to reimburse for services at current levels or continue to be available to residents of our facilities. Rates generated at facilities will vary by payor mix, market conditions and resident acuity. Rates paid by self-pay residents are set by the facilities and are determined by local market conditions and operating costs.
16

Medicare Reimbursement
Medicare is a significant payor source for our SNFs and hospitals. SNFs are reimbursed under the Medicare Skilled Nursing Facility Prospective Payment System, while hospitals are reimbursed by Medicare under prospective payment systems that vary based upon the type of hospital, geographic location and service furnished. Under these payment systems, providers typically receive fixed fees for defined services, which creates a risk that payments will not cover the costs of delivering care. In addition, CMS continues to focus on linking payment to performance relative to quality and other metrics and bundling payments for multiple items and services in a way that shifts more financial risk to providers. These changes, and a facility’s ability to conform to them, could reduce payments and patient volumes for some facilities, including our tenants and operators, which may in turn impact us. Furthermore, while CMS has previously tested some of these new payment principles through optional “models,” CMS could adopt rules making certain detrimental payment policies mandatory. The current presidential administration could propose additional changes to the amount and manner in which healthcare providers are paid, and these changes also could have a material adverse effect on payments and patient volumes for some facilities. Lastly, Congress is contemplating substantial reforms to the Medicare program as a whole that, if enacted, could negatively impact the operations and financial condition of our tenants and operators, which in turn may adversely impact us.
Skilled Nursing Conditions for Participation - On October 4, 2016, CMS published a final rule to make major changes to improve the care and safety of residents in long-term care facilities that participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The policies in this final rule were targeted at reducing unnecessary hospital readmissions and infections, improving the quality of care, and strengthening safety measures for residents in these facilities. The regulations were effective on November 28, 2016, but CMS has been implementing the regulations using a phased approach, with Phase 1 of the regulations implemented on November 28, 2016, Phase 2 of the regulations implemented on November 28, 2017 and Phase 3 of the regulations to be implemented on November 28, 2019. Failure of our tenants and operators to comply with the new regulations could have an adverse impact the operations and financial condition of our tenants and operators, which in turn may adversely impact us.
Skilled Nursing - In August 2018, CMS adopted a revised methodology used to compensate skilled nursing facilities for therapy services, which changes the core basis of reimbursement from duration of services provided to reimbursement based on anticipated patient needs; these changes will take effect on October 1, 2019. A tenant or operator of a SNF’s ability to conform to these changes could positively or negatively impact the facility’s revenue, which in turn may adversely impact us. 
Medicaid Reimbursement
Medicaid is also a significant payor source for our SNFs and hospitals. The federal and state governments share responsibility for financing Medicaid. Within certain federal guidelines, states have a fairly wide range of discretion to determine Medicaid eligibility and reimbursement methodology. CMS, in part as a result of the change in leadership in the executive branch, has embraced a more flexible approach to state amendments and waivers that allow states even more latitude to determine eligibility and reimbursement. Certain states are attempting to slow the rate of growth in Medicaid expenditures by freezing rates or restricting eligibility and benefits; some states have elected not to expand their Medicaid eligibility criteria pursuant to the ACA. Some states are transitioning their Medicaid programs to managed care models, which rely on networks of contracted providers to provide services at reduced negotiated rates to a higher volume of patients than they might see absent the contract. Such changes may reduce the volume of Medicaid patients at facilities that do not participate in the managed care plan’s network. Facilities that do participate may not receive a sufficient increase in patient volume to offset their lowered reimbursement rates. States and the federal government are also examining ways to further align Medicare reimbursement with quality metrics and other value-based payment models that might shift risk to or place additional compliance costs on facilities. Congress and the current presidential administration have sought to repeal and alter the ACA and substantially reform the Medicaid program. If successful, Congress may repeal the provisions of the ACA that encouraged states to expand Medicaid eligibility to more adults, including additional federal matching funds that enabled states to do so. Congress also might impose strict limits on the federal role in subsidizing the costs of state Medicaid programs. These actions, if enacted, could result in states reducing or eliminating eligibility for certain individuals and/or offsetting the cost by further reducing payments to providers of services. Congress is also considering enacting substantial reforms to Medicaid to grant states more autonomy and discretion to design Medicaid programs. These changes, if enacted, could also reduce or eliminate eligibility for certain individuals and/or allow states to further reduce payments to providers of services. In some states, our tenants and operators could experience delayed or reduced payment for services furnished to Medicaid enrollees, which in turn may adversely impact us. As noted above, ongoing litigation regarding the ACA and Medicaid waivers may also affect Medicaid coverage and reimbursement.
Licensure, CON, Certification and Accreditation
Hospitals, SNFs, senior housing facilities and other healthcare providers that operate healthcare properties in our portfolio may be subject to extensive state licensing and certificate of need, or CON, laws and regulations, which may restrict the ability of our 
17

tenants and operators to add new properties, expand an existing facility’s size or services, or transfer responsibility for operating a particular facility to a new tenant, operator or manager. The failure of our tenants and operators to obtain, maintain or comply with any required license, CON or other certification, accreditation or regulatory approval (which could be required as a condition of third-party payor reimbursement) could result in loss of licensure, loss of certification or accreditation, denial of reimbursement, imposition of civil and/or criminal penalties and fines, suspension or exclusion from federal and state healthcare programs or closure of the facility, any of which could have an adverse effect on the operations and financial condition of our tenants, operators and managers, which in turn may adversely impact us.
Health Information Privacy and Security
Healthcare providers, including those in our portfolio, are subject to numerous state and federal laws that protect the privacy and security of patient health information. The federal government, in particular, has significantly increased its enforcement of these laws. The failure of our tenants, operators and managers to maintain compliance with privacy and security laws could result in the imposition of penalties and fines, which in turn may adversely impact us.
Investment Company Act
We believe that we are not, and intend to conduct our operations so as not to become, regulated as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. We have relied, and intend to continue to rely, on current interpretations of the staff of the SEC in an effort to continue to qualify for an exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act. For more information on the exemptions that we use refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors—Maintenance of our Investment Company Act exemption imposes limits on our operations.”
Environmental Matters
A wide variety of federal, state and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations affect our properties. These complex federal and state statutes, and their enforcement, involve a myriad of regulations, many of which involve strict liability on the part of the potential offender. Some of these federal and state statutes may directly impact us. Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, an owner of real property, such as us, may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at, under or disposed of in connection with such property, as well as other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances (including government fines and damages for injuries to persons and adjacent property). The cost of any required remediation, removal, fines or personal or property damages and the owner’s liability therefore could exceed or impair the value of the property and/or the assets of the owner. In addition, the presence of such substances, or the failure to properly dispose of or remediate such substances, may adversely affect the owner’s ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral which, in turn, could reduce our revenues.
ADA
Our properties must comply with the ADA and any similar state or local laws to the extent that such properties are “public accommodations” as defined in those statutes. The ADA may require removal of barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable. To date, we have not received any notices of noncompliance with the ADA that have caused us to incur substantial capital expenditures to address ADA concerns. Should barriers to access by persons with disabilities be discovered at any of our properties, we may be directly or indirectly responsible for additional costs that may be required to make facilities ADA-compliant. Noncompliance with the ADA could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants. The obligation to make readily achievable accommodations pursuant to the ADA is an ongoing one and we continue to assess our properties and make modifications as appropriate in this respect.
Competition
Our healthcare investments will experience local and regional market competition for residents, operators and staff. Competition will be based on quality of care, reputation, physical appearance of properties, services offered, family preference, physicians, staff and price. Competition will come from independent operators as well as companies managing multiple properties, some of which may be larger and have greater resources than our operators. Some of these properties are operated for profit while others are owned by governmental agencies or tax-exempt, non-profit organizations. Competitive disadvantages at our healthcare investments may result in vacancies at facilities, reductions in net operating income and ultimately a reduction in shareholder value.
Seasonality
Our revenues, and our operators’ revenues, are dependent on occupancy. It is difficult to predict seasonal trends and the related potential impact of the cold and flu season, occurrence of epidemics or any other widespread illnesses on the occupancy of our 
18

facilities. A decrease in occupancy could affect the operating income of our operating properties as well as the ability of our net lease operators to make payments to us.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had no employees. Our Advisor or its affiliates provide management, acquisition, advisory, marketing, investor relations and certain administrative services for us.
Corporate Governance and Internet Address
We emphasize the importance of professional business conduct and ethics through our corporate governance initiatives. Our board of directors consists of a majority of independent directors. The audit committee of our board of directors is composed exclusively of independent directors. We have adopted corporate governance guidelines and a code of ethics, which delineate our standards for our officers and directors.
Our internet address is www.northstarhealthcarereit.com. The information on our website is not incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We make available, free of charge through a link on our website, our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to such reports, if any, as filed or furnished with the SEC, as soon as reasonably practicable after such filing or furnishing. Our site also contains our code of ethics, corporate governance guidelines and our audit committee charter. Within the time period required by the rules of the SEC, we will post on our website any amendment to our code of ethics or any waiver applicable to any of our directors, executive officers or senior financial officers.
