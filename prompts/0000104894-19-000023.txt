ITEM 1:  BUSINESS
Washington REIT Overview
Washington Real Estate Investment Trust (“Washington REIT”) is a self-administered equity real estate investment trust (“REIT”), successor to a trust organized in 1960. Our business consists of the ownership and operation of income-producing real property in the greater Washington metro region. We own a diversified portfolio of office buildings, multifamily buildings and retail centers.

Our current strategy is to generate returns and maximize shareholder value through proactive asset management and prudent capital allocation decisions. Consistent with this strategy, we invest in additional income-producing properties through acquisitions, development and redevelopment. We invest in properties where we believe we will be able to improve the operating results and increase the value of the property. We focus on properties inside the Washington metro region’s Beltway, near major transportation nodes and in areas with strong employment drivers and superior growth demographics. We will seek to continue to upgrade our portfolio as opportunities arise, funding development and acquisitions with a combination of cash, equity, debt and proceeds from property sales.
While we have historically focused most of our investments in the greater Washington metro region, in order to maximize acquisition opportunities we also may consider opportunities to replicate our strategy in other geographic markets which meet the criteria described above. 
All of our officers and employees live and work in or near the greater Washington metro region.
Our Regional Economy and Real Estate Markets
The Washington metro region experienced strong job growth during 2018 with approximately 60,700 net job additions, according to Delta Associates / Transwestern Commercial Services (“Delta”), a national full service real estate firm that provides market research and evaluation services for commercial property. This job growth is higher than the region's 20-year annual average of 43,300 new jobs, with growth in the private sector partially offset by net job losses of 5,400 within the Federal government. Current estimates by Delta indicate that the region's unemployment rate was 3.2% as of October 2018, a decrease from the prior year and lower than the national average of 3.5%. Delta expects the job growth in the Washington metro region to continue in 2019 due to strong consumer spending and higher corporate profits in the private sector, partially offset by public sector uncertainty. Certain market statistics and information from several third party providers for the Washington metro region are set forth below: 
Office 

 | 2018 | | 2017
Average asking rent per square foot | $ | 42.07 | | | $ | 42.14
Total vacancy rate at year end | 16.4 | % | | 17.0 | %
Net absorption (in millions of square feet) (1) | 2.0 | | | (0.1 | )
Office space under construction at year end (in millions of square feet) | 11.1 | | | 11.8 | 

Source: Jones Lang LaSalle ("JLL"), a commercial real estate services firm
(1) Net absorption is defined as the change in occupied, standing inventory from one year to the next.
According to JLL, the decrease in average asking rents in the Washington metro region was primarily due to new supply outpacing demand. The 2018 total vacancy rate is lower than the prior year, though above the national average of 14.9%. JLL projects downward pressure on occupancy and effective rents in 2019 due to the continuing addition of new space into the region.

According to RealPage Investment Analytics, the multifamily real estate market's low vacancy rate reflects the region's strong demand, though the large deliveries of new supply has kept rental rate growth below the national average. New apartment deliveries are projected to increase to approximately 17,500 units in 2019, which is expected to negatively impact occupancy and suppress rental rate growth, particularly for Class A properties. 
Retail 

 | 2018 | | 2017
Increase in rental rates at neighborhood centers | 5.6 | % | | 3.0 | %
Vacancy at neighborhood centers at year-end | 5.5 | % | | 5.6 | %
Net absorption (in millions of square feet) | 0.3 | | | (0.3 | )

Source: CoStar, a provider of real estate market research and analytics
The retail real estate market in the Washington metro region was steady in 2018, with higher rental rates, lower vacancy and positive absorption. CoStar projects strong demand for retail space in the region to continue in 2019 due to increasing average household income in the Washington metro region.
Our Portfolio
As of December 31, 2018, we owned a diversified portfolio of 48 properties, totaling approximately 6.1 million square feet of commercial space and 4,268 residential units, and land held for development. These 48 properties consist of 19 office properties, 13 multifamily properties and 16 retail centers. The percentage of total real estate rental revenue by segment for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, and the percent leased as of December 31, 2018, were as follows:

Percent Leased atDecember 31, 2018(1) | | % of Total Real Estate Rental Revenue 
 | 2018 | | 2017 | 2016
94% | Office | 53 | % | 52 | % | 53 | %
97% | Multifamily | 28 | % | 29 | % | 27 | %
93% | Retail | 19 | % | 19 | % | 20 | %
 | | 100 | % | 100 | % | 100 | %


(1) | Calculated as the percentage of physical net rentable area leased, except for multifamily, which is calculated as the percentage of units leased. The net rentable area leased for office and retail properties includes temporary lease agreements.

On a combined basis, our commercial portfolio (i.e., our office and retail properties) was 93%, 95% and 93% leased at December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Total real estate rental revenue for each of the three years ended December 31, 2018 was $336.9 million, $325.1 million and $313.3 million, respectively. During the three years ended December 31, 2018, we acquired two office properties and one multifamily property (including a parcel for development) and substantially completed major construction activities at one office and one retail redevelopment project. During that same period, we sold eight office properties, one multifamily property and interests in land held for development. See note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our operating results by segment.

Total | 295 | | 2,114,940 | | $ | 54,917 | | 100 | %

Approximately one quarter of the leases in the office segment (as measured by gross annual rents) are scheduled to expire over the next two years. Arlington Tower and Watergate 600 account for a significant portion of these office lease expirations. We were aware of these expirations at the time of acquisition and are engaged in ongoing efforts to address these expirations.
According to Delta, the professional/business services and government sectors constituted over 40% of payroll jobs in the Washington metro area at the end of 2018. Due to our geographic concentration in the Washington metro area, a significant number of our tenants have historically been concentrated in the professional/business services and government sectors, although the exact amount will vary from time to time. As a result of this concentration, we are susceptible to business trends (both positive and negative) that affect the outlook for these sectors. 
No single tenant accounted for more than 5% of real estate rental revenue in 2018, 2017 or 2016. All federal government tenants in the aggregate accounted for less than 1% of our real estate rental revenue in 2018.

Our ten largest tenants, in terms of real estate rental revenue for 2018, are as follows:

1. | World Bank 
2. | Booz Allen Hamilton, Inc. 
3. | Atlantic Media, Inc. 
4. | Capital One 
5. | Blank Rome LLP 
6. | Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Financing
7. | Epstein, Becker & Green, P.C. 
8. | FBR Capital Markets & Company 
9. | Hughes Hubbard & Reed LLP 
10. | Ankura Consulting Group, LLC 

We enter into arrangements from time to time by which various service providers conduct day-to-day property management and/or leasing activities at our properties. Bozzuto Management Company ("Bozzuto") has been conducting property management and leasing services at our multifamily properties since 2014. Bozzuto provides such services under individual property management agreements for each property, each of which is separately terminable by us or Bozzuto. Although they vary by property, on average, the fees charged by Bozzuto under each agreement are approximately 3% of revenues at each property. 
We expect to continue investing in additional income-producing properties through acquisitions, development and redevelopment. We invest in properties where we believe we will be able to improve the operating results and increase the value of the property. Our properties typically compete for tenants with other properties on the basis of location, quality and rental rates.
We make capital improvements to our properties on an ongoing basis for the purpose of maintaining and increasing their value and income. Major improvements and/or renovations to the properties during the three years ended December 31, 2018 are discussed in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, under the heading “Capital Improvements and Development Costs.”
Further description of the property groups is contained in Item 2, Properties, and Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements, Segment Information, and in Schedule III. Reference is also made to Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
On February 14, 2019, we had 149 employees including 70 persons engaged in property management functions and 79 persons engaged in corporate, financial, leasing, asset management and other functions.
REIT Tax Status
We believe that we qualify as a REIT under Sections 856-860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and intend to continue to qualify as such. To maintain our status as a REIT, we are among other things required to distribute 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined before the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains), to our shareholders on an annual basis. When selling a property, we generally have the option of (a) reinvesting the sales proceeds of property sold, in a way that allows us to defer recognition of some or all of the taxable gain realized on the sale, (b) distributing gains to the shareholders with no tax to us or (c) treating net long-term capital gains as having been distributed to our shareholders, paying the tax on the gain deemed distributed and allocating the tax paid as a credit to our shareholders.
Generally, and subject to our ongoing qualification as a REIT, no provisions for income taxes are necessary except for taxes on undistributed taxable income and taxes on the income generated by our taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRSs”). Our TRSs are subject to corporate U.S. federal, state and local income tax on their taxable income at regular statutory rates (see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further disclosure).
