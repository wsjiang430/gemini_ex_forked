ITEM 1.    BUSINESS 
Perrigo Company plc was incorporated under the laws of Ireland on June 28, 2013 and became the successor registrant of Perrigo Company, a Michigan corporation, on December 18, 2013 in connection with the acquisition of Elan Corporation, plc ("Elan"). Unless the context requires otherwise, the terms "Perrigo", the "Company", "we," "our," "us," and similar pronouns used herein refer to Perrigo Company plc, its subsidiaries, and all predecessors of Perrigo Company plc and its subsidiaries. 
WHO WE ARE
We are a leading provider of over-the-counter ("OTC") health and wellness solutions that are designed to enhance individual well-being. Our vision is to make lives better by bringing Quality, Affordable Self-Care Products that consumers trust everywhere they are sold. We are headquartered in Ireland and sell our products primarily in North America and Europe as well as in other markets around the world.
Our core competencies are geared to fully take advantage of the massive global trend towards self-care. We define self-care as not just treating disease or helping individuals feel better after taking a product, but also maintaining and enhancing their overall health and wellness. Consistent with our vision, we recently completed our three-year strategy to transform the Company into a consumer self-care leader by reconfiguring our portfolio through the divestiture of our Rx business in 2021 and acquiring Héra SAS (“HRA Pharma”) in 2022. Additionally, we removed significant uncertainty during 2021 through final settlement of the Irish Revenue Notice of Amended Assessment. Upon completion of our transformation, we have transitioned our strategy to ‘Optimizing’ our business and ‘Accelerating’ profitable growth. Several initiatives are anticipated to propel this strategy, including plans to achieve significant synergies from our acquisitions and implementation of our Supply Chain Reinvention Program. In addition, we continue to invest in other initiatives, including innovation, information systems and tools, and our people to drive future consistent and sustainable results in line with consumer-packaged goods peers. Further 2022 highlights can be found in Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis - Executive Overview. 
Strategy & Competitive Advantage
Our objective is to grow our business by responsibly bringing our self-care vision to life. We aim to accomplish this by leveraging our global infrastructure to deliver high quality products to our customers and consumers through our expansive product offerings, providing new innovative products and product line extensions to existing consumers and servicing new consumers through entering new adjacent products and categories, new geographies and new channels of distribution organically and inorganically. Critical to this strategy is investing in and continually improving all aspects of five pillars which we call the Perrigo Advantage: 
•High quality; 
•Superior customer service; 
•Leading innovation;
•Best cost; and 
•Empowered people.
We seek to achieve our objective while remaining true to our four core values, Integrity - we do what is right; Respect - we demonstrate the value we hold for one another; Responsibility - we hold ourselves accountable for our actions; and our newest core value, Curiosity - we strive to always learn and innovate. 
Among other things, we believe the following factors give us a competitive advantage and provide value to our customers and consumers:
•A diverse product portfolio, leadership in first-to-market product development, and product life cycle management;
•Experienced research and development ("R&D") department capable of developing high quality products and product formulations, differentiated product features and benefits, product reformulation, and differentiated store brand products relative to national brands;
•Deep understanding of consumer needs and customer strategies;
Perrigo Company plc - Item 1
Business Overview

•Expansive pan-European commercial infrastructure, brand-building capabilities, and an extensive and diverse product portfolio;
•Turn-key regulatory and promotional capabilities;
•Supply chain breadth, and utilizing economies of scale to manage supply chain complexity across multiple dosage forms, formulations, and stock-keeping units;
•Quality and cost effectiveness throughout the supply chain and operational systems across all products creating a sustainable, low-cost network across our 20 manufacturing plants and distribution networks;
•Industry leading e-commerce support; and
•Shared services and R&D centers of excellence to drive global process consistency, and to maintain focus on the Perrigo Advantage.
SEGMENTS
Our reporting and operating segments reflect the way our chief operating decision maker, who is our CEO, makes operating decisions, allocates resources and manages the growth and profitability of the Company. Our reporting and operating segments are: 
•Consumer Self-Care Americas ("CSCA") comprises our consumer self-care business in the U.S. and Canada. CSCA previously included our Latin American businesses until they were disposed on March 9, 2022. 
•Consumer Self-Care International ("CSCI") comprises our consumer self-care business outside of the U.S. and Canada, primarily in Europe and Australia.
We previously had an Rx segment which comprised our generic prescription pharmaceuticals business in the U.S., and other pharmaceuticals and diagnostic businesses in Israel, which have been divested. Following the divestiture, there were no substantial assets or operations left in this segment. The Rx segment was reported as Discontinued Operations in 2021, and is presented as such for all periods in this report (refer to Item 8. Note 4). Financial information related to our business segments can be found in Item 8. Note 20. 
CONSUMER SELF-CARE AMERICAS
The CSCA segment develops, manufactures and markets our leading self-care consumer products in the U.S. and Canada. We primarily provide our customers self-care products that are sold and marketed under the customer's own brands and/or exclusive brands ("store brands"). We additionally have a select lineup of branded self-care products. Customers include major global, national, and regional retail drug, supermarket, and mass merchandise chains, e-commerce stores, and major wholesalers.
Our store brand products are comparable in quality and effectiveness to national brands. Store brand products must meet the same stringent U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") requirements as national brands within the U.S. and the requirements of comparable regulatory bodies outside the U.S. In most instances, our product packaging is designed to invite and reinforce comparison to national brand products, while communicating store brand value to consumers. The cost of store brand products to retailers is significantly lower than that of comparable nationally advertised brand name products. The retailer, therefore, can price a store brand product below the competing national brand product and realize a greater percentage and dollar profit, while consumers benefit from receiving a high-quality product at a price below the comparable national brand product. Consumer awareness and knowledge of the quality, value and efficacy of our products are achieved from marketing efforts made by us, our retailers and wholesalers. 

Certain branded products are developed, manufactured and distributed within the CSCA segment. Our primary branded products sold under brand names include Burt's Bees®, Compeed®, Dr. Fresh®, Firefly®, Good Sense®, Mederma®, Nasonex®, Plackers®, Prevacid®24HR, REACH®, Rembrandt®, and Steripod®.
CONSUMER SELF-CARE INTERNATIONAL
The CSCI segment comprises our consumer self-care product categories outside the U.S. and Canada, including our branded products in Europe and Australia and our store brand products in the United Kingdom and parts of Europe and Asia. These products are developed, manufactured, marketed and distributed by us, leveraging our broad regulatory, sales and distribution infrastructure to drive market share, innovate new products and brands, in-license and expand product lines, and sell and distribute third-party brands. The CSCI segment products are sold 
Perrigo Company plc - Item 1
CSCI

primarily through an established pharmacy sales force to an extensive network of customers including pharmacies, wholesalers, drug and grocery store retailers, e-commerce stores, and para-pharmacies in more than 29 countries, predominantly in Europe. Products in the CSCI segment are marketed using broadcast and digital advertising as well as point-of-sale promotional spending to enhance brand equity. 
While we have hundreds of brands, we primarily concentrate our resources on 'Focus Brands' and sub-brands, such as Solpadeine®, Coldrex®, Physiomer®, NiQuitin®, ACO®, Compeed®, and ellaOne®. Many of these Focus Brands have leading positions in the markets in which they compete. Additional resources, including R&D investments, are allocated to these Focus Brands to strengthen their market position in high opportunity profit categories while leveraging the same R&D efforts under smaller local brands. The new product pipeline is supported by internal R&D, new product development, acquisitions and partnerships, both in terms of brand extensions and product improvements.

In April 2022, we completed the acquisition of HRA Pharma for €1.8 billion, or approximately $1.9 billion based on exchange rates at the time of closing (refer to Item 8. Note 3 for transaction details). HRA Pharma operating results are reported within both our CSCA and CSCI segments. As a result of the acquisition, the Company made the following updates to its global reporting product categories described above:
•The creation of a new "Women's Health" reporting category, comprised of the women's health portfolio of HRA Pharma, including ellaOne® and Hana®, in addition to legacy Perrigo women's health products, including feminine hygiene and contraceptive products;
•The creation of a new "Skin Care" reporting category, comprised of Compeed®, Mederma®, and all of the products in the legacy Perrigo "Skincare and Personal Hygiene" category except for legacy Perrigo women's health products; and 
•The "Other" category includes the Rare Diseases business acquired with HRA Pharma exclusive to the CSCI segment.

The updates were applied retroactively to impacted product categories. Such changes had no impact on the Company's historical consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
New Products 
During the year ended December 31, 2022, new product sales were $122.8 million. We consider a product to be new if it (i) was reformulated into an additional unique product, (ii) was a product line extension due to changes in characteristics such as strength, flavor, or color, (iii) had a change in product status from "prescription only" ("Rx") to OTC, (iv) was a new store brand or branded launch, (v) was provided in a new dosage form or (vi) was sold to a new geographic area with different regulatory authorities, in all cases, within 12 months prior to the end of the period for which net sales are being measured. Notable new product launches in the year ended December 31, 2022 included the over-the-counter use of Nasonex®24HR Allergy and Omeprazole Magnesium Delayed-Release Mini 
Perrigo Company plc - Item 1
CSCI

Capsules in CSCA, and the launch of the Plackers® brand and line extensions in the ACO® brand in CSCI. We also launched various CSCI line extensions in the XLS® weight management brand in the Healthy lifestyle category, and in VMS under the brands Arterin®, Davitamon® and Abtei®.
On July 11, 2022, HRA Pharma, a Perrigo company, announced that it submitted its application for an Rx-to-OTC switch for Opill®, a progestin-only daily birth control pill (also referred to as a mini pill or non-estrogen pill). If approved, this would be the first daily birth control pill available OTC without a prescription in the U.S. On October 26, 2022, Perrigo announced that it has received notification that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has postponed the joint meeting of the Nonprescription Drugs Advisory Committee and the Obstetrics, Reproductive and Urologic Drugs Advisory Committee, previously planned for November 18, 2022, to discuss the Company's application for Opill® once daily oral contraceptive for OTC use. The rescheduled date for the joint advisory committee meeting has not yet been determined. The FDA postponed the meeting in order to review additional information requested related to the Opill® Rx-to-OTC switch. In a notice received from the FDA, the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) date for Opill® has been extended by 90 days. The Company will continue to work collaboratively with the FDA to ensure a timely and thorough review.
Each of our product categories and 'Focus Brands' have a three to five-year innovation master plan. We rely on both internal R&D and strategic product development agreements with outside sources to develop new products.
SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS 

Sales to Walmart Inc. represented 12.5% and 14.0% of our consolidated net sales in 2022 and 2021, respectively. While we have other important customers, no other individual customer represents more than 10% of net sales. Our top ten customers accounted for 47% and 45% of our total consolidated net sales in 2022 and 2021, respectively. We believe we generally have good relationships with our customers. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors - Operational Risks for risks associated with customers.
COMPETITION
The markets for our self-care products are highly competitive and differ for each product line and geographic region. Local companies often hold leading positions in individual product lines in particular countries. The competitive landscape of the European consumer products market in the categories in which we compete is more fragmented than the North American market. Our primary competitors include manufacturers, such as Dr. Reddy's Labs, LNK International, Inc., PL Developments, Aurobindo and Sun Pharmaceuticals, and brand-name pharmaceutical and consumer product companies, such as Haleon (the consumer health business spun-off by GSK plc in 2022), Kenvue (the consumer health business unit of Johnson & Johnson), Procter & Gamble, Reckitt Benckiser, Abbott Nutrition, Bayer AG, Sanofi, Philips, Teva, Viatris, Stada, and Novartis. Each product category of our business has certain key competitors, such that a competitor generally does not compete across all product lines or across all geographic markets. However, some competitors do have larger sales volumes in certain of our categories. Competition is based on a variety of factors, including price, quality, assortment of products, customer service, marketing support and approvals for new products. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors - Operational Risks for additional information and risks associated with competition.
TRADEMARKS, PATENTS AND LICENSING AGREEMENTS
While we own certain trademarks and patents, neither our business as a whole, nor any of our segments, is materially dependent upon our ownership of any one trademark, or patent, or group of trademarks or patents. 
MATERIALS SOURCING
Affordable, high-quality raw materials and packaging components are essential to all of our business units. Raw materials and packaging components are generally available from multiple suppliers. Supplies of certain raw materials and packaging components, due to their technical specifications and product delivery systems, may be more limited, as they are available from one or only a few suppliers and may require extensive compatibility testing before we can use them. 
Historically, we have been able to react effectively, yet not always immediately, to situations that require alternate sourcing. Should such alternate sourcing be necessary, FDA requirements placed on products approved through the Abbreviated New Drug Application ("ANDA") or New Drug Application ("NDA") process could substantially lengthen the approval of an alternate source and adversely affect financial results. We believe we have good, cooperative working relationships with our suppliers and have historically been able to capitalize on economies of 
Perrigo Company plc - Item 1

scale in the purchase of materials and supplies due to our volume of purchases. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors - Operational Risks for risks associated with materials sourcing. Refer to Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis - Executive Overview for a detailed discussion of the impact of inflation and supply chain disruption, the war in Ukraine, and the COVID-19 pandemic on our material sourcing.
MANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTION
Our primary manufacturing facilities are in the U.S. We also have manufacturing facilities in the U.K., Belgium, France, Germany, Austria, China, and Australia, along with a joint venture in China. We supplement our production capabilities with the purchase of products from outside sources. While our business is not generally seasonal, the capacity of some facilities may be fully utilized at certain times for various reasons, such as consumer and customer demand, the seasonality of certain product categories (for example, cough/cold/flu and allergy products) and new product launches. We may utilize available capacity by performing contract manufacturing for other companies. We have logistics facilities in the U.S., numerous locations throughout Europe, and Australia. We use contract freight and common carriers to deliver our products. 
In 2022, we initiated a Supply Chain Reinvention Program to reduce structural costs, improve profitability and our service levels to our retail partners, and strengthen our resiliency by streamlining and simplifying our global supply chain. Through this initiative, we plan to reduce portfolio complexity, invest in advanced planning capabilities, diversify sourcing, and optimize our manufacturing assets and distribution models. 
Refer to Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis - Executive Overview for a detailed discussion of the impact of inflation and supply chain disruption, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the Supply Chain Reinvention Program on our manufacturing and distribution, and refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors - Operational Risks for risks associated with our manufacturing facilities. 
ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL, AND GOVERNANCE ("ESG") 
We are committed to doing business in a socially, environmentally and fiscally responsible manner and being transparent with our reporting. Our Board recognizes that responsibly managing our environmental impact, respecting global human rights, creating an authentic work environment where our people can thrive and creating high quality affordable products that makes consumer’s lives better are critical to the short and long-term success of the Company. 
Progress against our Corporate Social Responsibility and Sustainability commitments and programs are reported each year via the Annual Sustainability and ESG report. Over the last few years, we have adopted multiple sustainability and ESG frameworks to guide our efforts, including:
•Sustainability Accounting Standards Board ("SASB") – Household and Personal Products Sector
•The Carbon Disclosure Project ("CDP") and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures ("TFCD")
•The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals
To view our latest ESG report, visit www.Perrigo.com - Our Commitment to the Environment. References to our Sustainability & ESG Report and website are for informational purposes only and neither the sustainability report nor the other information on our website is incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Environmental 
Our facilities and operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations. We undergo periodic internal audits relating to environmental, health and safety requirements in order to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We have made, and continue to make, expenditures necessary to comply with applicable environmental laws; however, we do not believe that the costs for complying with such laws and regulations have been or will be material to our business. We do not have any material remediation liabilities outstanding.
Our environmental sustainability strategy is focused on three key pillars: climate and operations, plastics and packaging, and our supply chain. These focus areas were refreshed in 2021 to better align with global standards like SASB, CDP and the increasing number of customer sustainability programs. 
Climate change is included in Perrigo’s enterprise risk management process, while water risk is benchmarked against the World Resource Institute ("WRI") water stress index. While we believe that climate change could present 
Perrigo Company plc - Item 1

risks to our business, including increased operating costs due to additional regulatory requirements, physical risks to our facilities and disruptions to our supply chain, we do not believe these risks are material to our business in the near term. Additionally, about 3% of our water consumed came from high to extremely high-water stress regions as defined by the WRI.
Human Capital Resources
At Perrigo, we believe that the continuous personal and professional development of our people is an important component of our ability to attract, retain, and motivate top talent, which are all important aspects of our self-care strategy. Our global workforce consists of more than 8,900 full time and part time employees spread across 33 countries, of which approximately 20% were covered by collective agreements as of December 31, 2022. We continuously endeavor to provide a diverse, inclusive and safe work environment so our colleagues can bring their best to work every day. Each of us is responsible for upholding Perrigo’s four core values of Integrity, Respect, Responsibility and Curiosity and our Culture Framework. 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion ("DEI")
Consistent with our core values, we strive for our workforce to represent the diverse consumer base we wish to serve, enabling us to continue to deliver on our self-care promise. We believe that diverse representation, equitable practices, and inclusive behavior creates lasting benefits for Perrigo colleagues, our customers, consumers, and shareholders through enhanced individual well-being, retention, team performance, innovation, and leads to profitable growth. Our new 2023-2026 DEI strategy focuses on three key areas: 
•Educating our workforce and building inclusive mindsets; 
•Strengthening our talent management practices through a lens of equity and belonging; and
•Enabling leaders, embedding accountability and strengthening our DEI governance practices. 
Perrigo is committed to the well-being of the communities we serve and the individuals that make up our team of talented colleagues. Accordingly, we continue to take action to help address inequality based on multiple aspects of diversity and will be strengthening our focus on 'belonging' in 2023 and beyond. Our goal is to nurture a culture where people can experience belonging, enabling them to be at their best at Perrigo. 
Perrigo colleagues, including senior management, continually receive educational resources and information on how to best support themselves and others as allies in support of underrepresented groups and to learn how we can contribute to healing our society's divisions. Colleagues are encouraged to practice self-care and are provided support resources such as our global Employee Assistance Program that includes staff members who identify with various underrepresented communities and speak multiple languages.
Compensation, Benefits, Health, Safety, and Well-being
Perrigo’s commitment to self-care starts with our own team. We are proactive in our approach to safety, working to eliminate hazards before any harm is incurred. As a multi-national company, we are subject to a broad range of foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to occupational safety and health, and our safety program is designed to meet all compliance requirements. We continuously evaluate opportunities to raise safety and health standards, visiting sites to identify and manage environmental health and safety risks; to evaluate and enhance workplace safety.
Our Total Rewards philosophy is to continuously attract, engage and inspire talent by designing compensation, benefits and other programs that support the total well-being of our people. Our total rewards package delivers competitive pay, cash-based incentives, broad-based stock grants, retirement benefits, leading healthcare, paid time off, and on-site services, among other benefits. Additionally, we are proud to continue our “HEALTHYyou” well-being program that supports our colleagues and their families in maintaining and improving their health as they navigate their own self-care and well-being journeys. This program is highly valued by our colleagues and it continues to be recognized externally by receiving the Best and Brightest in Wellness™ Award since 2017.
Growth, Development, and Engagement
The growth and development of our colleagues are essential to our ability to meet future challenges and are key components to attracting and retaining our talent. The primary means of development of our colleagues is through meaningful and challenging work. We have a robust process for identifying talent and matching them with opportunities to advance their skills and capabilities. We continue to cultivate our diverse internal talent to progress through the organization and have healthy rates of retention. 
Perrigo Company plc - Item 1

We also recognize that our colleagues need access to broad-based development tools to meet the new challenges they face in their roles. We start this process with our new colleagues who are all given a structured orientation and onboarding for faster integration. We also empower colleagues to take control of their own development by providing access to our 'GROWyou' personal development curriculum. This curriculum is supplemented by offering colleagues 24/7 access to on-demand self-study content. Personal development and learning are guided by ongoing conversations and feedback as part of our performance management philosophy.
We continue to invest in our leadership capability at all levels in the organization so they can provide the right environment within our culture to engage, grow and develop our colleagues.
Human Rights 
Perrigo is committed to the fight against modern slavery, child labor, unsafe working conditions and any other form of Human Rights abuse. We maintain a robust set of ethical standards that apply to all of Perrigo globally, as well as any contractors, suppliers, and other third parties doing business on our behalf. We conduct regular risk assessments and audits of our supply chain to ensure compliance with our internal standards and those of our customers.
Community Engagement 
Improving the healthcare, education and access to basic needs within our local communities continue to be the primary focus for the Perrigo Company Charitable Foundation. We encourage all employees to volunteer in their local communities, which we believe has additional benefits on morale, mental health and goodwill as well as professional skills and network development. 
More details on these and other Perrigo Company initiatives are available on our website available at www.Perrigo.com - Building Healthier Communities.
GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND PRICING 
The manufacturing, processing, formulation, packaging, labeling, testing, storing, distributing, advertising, and selling of our products are subject to regulation by a variety of agencies in the localities in which our products are sold. In addition, we manufacture and market certain of our products in accordance with standards set by various organizations. We believe that our policies, operations, and products comply in all material respects with existing regulations to which we are subject. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors - Operational Risks for related risks.
United States Regulation
U.S. Food and Drug Administration
The FDA has jurisdiction over OTC drug products, Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients ("API"), medical devices and infant formula products. The FDA’s jurisdiction extends to the manufacturing, testing, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, and promotion of these products. We are committed to consistently providing our customers with high quality products that adhere to "current Good Manufacturing Practices" ("cGMP") regulations promulgated by the FDA. If the FDA or comparable regulatory authority becomes aware of new safety information about any of our products, these authorities may require further inspection, enhancement to manufacturing controls, labeling changes, additional testing method requirements, restrictions on indicated uses or marketing, post-approval studies or post-market surveillance. 
OTC
All of our drug products are manufactured, tested, packaged, stored, and distributed according to cGMP regulations. The FDA performs periodic audits to ensure that our facilities remain in compliance with all appropriate regulations. Specific regulations and laws that impact our business include, but are not limited to: 
•Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, as amended ("FFDCA") (the Hatch-Waxman amendments) - This act gives authority to the FDA to oversee the safety of food, drugs, medical devices, and cosmetics.
•Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act ("FDASIA") - The law established, among other things, new user fee statutes for generic drugs and biosimilars, FDA authority concerning drug shortages, and changes to enhance the FDA's inspection authority of the drug supply chain.
Perrigo Company plc - Item 1
Regulation

•FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 - This act created a pathway by which the FDA may, at the request of an applicant, designate a drug with “inadequate generic competition” as a Competitive Generic Therapy. 
Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients ("API")
Third parties develop and manufacture APIs for use in certain of our pharmaceutical products that are sold in the U.S. and other global markets. API manufacturers typically submit a drug master file to the regulatory authority that provides the proprietary information related to the manufacturing process. The FDA inspects the manufacturing facilities to assess cGMP compliance, and the facilities and procedures must be cGMP compliant before API may be exported to the U.S. 
Medical Devices
We are subject to the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 to the FFDCA and its subsequent amendments in the U.S. The regulations issued thereunder provide for regulation by the FDA of the design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices, including some of our products marketed under our oral care and OTC businesses. All of our current medical devices fall under Class I or Class II of the regulations. These devices are also subject to other general controls established by the FDA, such as registration, listing, labeling, and reporting obligations.
Infant Formula
The FDA’s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition is responsible for the regulation of infant formula. The Office of Nutrition, Labeling and Dietary Supplements ("ONLDS") has labeling responsibility for infant formula, while the Office of Food Additive Safety ("OFAS") has program responsibility for food ingredients and packaging. The ONLDS evaluates whether an infant formula manufacturer has met the requirements under the FFDCA and consults with the OFAS regarding the safety of ingredients in infant formula and of packaging materials for infant formula.
Before marketing a particular infant formula, the manufacturer must provide regulatory agencies assurance of the nutritional quality of that particular formulation consistent with the FDA’s labeling, nutrient content, and manufacturer quality control requirements. A manufacturer must notify the FDA at least 90 days before the marketing of any infant formula that differs fundamentally in processing or in composition from any previous formulation produced by the manufacturer. We actively monitor this process and make the appropriate adjustments to remain in compliance with current FDA rules regarding cGMP, quality control procedures, quality factors, notification requirements, and reports and records for the production of infant formulas.
In addition, the FFDCA requires infant formula manufacturers to test product composition during production and shelf-life; to keep records on production, testing, and distribution of each batch of infant formula; to use cGMP and quality control procedures; and to maintain records of all complaints and adverse events, some of which may reveal the possible existence of a health hazard. The FDA conducts yearly inspections of all facilities that manufacture infant formula, inspects new facilities during early production runs, and collects and analyzes samples of infant formula. Our infant formula manufacturing facilities have been inspected by the FDA with no corrective actions required from the most recent inspections.
Our infant and toddler beverages are subject to the Food Safety Modernization Act ("FSMA"), which protects the safety of U.S. foods by mandating comprehensive, prevention-based controls within the food industry. Under FSMA, the FDA has mandatory recall authority for all food products and greater authority to inspect food producers and is taking steps toward product tracing to enable more efficient product source identification in the event of a safety issue. 
U.S. Department of Agriculture 
The Organic Foods Production Act enacted under Title 21 of the 1990 Farm Bill established uniform national standards for the production and handling of foods labeled as "organic." Our infant formula manufacturing sites in Vermont and Ohio adhere to the standards of the U.S. Department of Agriculture ("USDA") National Organic Program for production, handling, and processing to maintain the integrity of organic products and are USDA-certified, enabling them to produce and label organic products for U.S. and Canadian markets.
Perrigo Company plc - Item 1
Regulation

U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") is the main regulatory body in the United States governing environmental regulation. Laws administered by the EPA, often in partnership with state agencies, include but are not limited to the Clean Air Act; the Clean Water Act; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act; and the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act. 
U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration 
The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration ("DEA") regulates certain drug products containing controlled substances, and List I chemicals, such as pseudoephedrine, pursuant to the federal Controlled Substances Act ("CSA") and the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery Treatment for Patients and Communities Act ("SUPPORT Act"). The CSA and DEA regulations impose registration, security, record keeping, suspicious order monitoring, reporting, storage, manufacturing, distribution, importation and other requirements upon legitimate handlers under the oversight of the DEA. The DEA categorizes controlled substances into Schedules I, II, III, IV, or V, with varying qualifications for listing in each schedule. We are subject to the requirements regarding List I chemicals. Our facilities that manufacture, distribute, import, or export any List 1 Chemicals must register annually with the DEA and are subject to inspection and enforcement action if found out of compliance. 
Federal Healthcare Programs and Drug Pricing Regulation
In the U.S., government healthcare programs such as Medicaid are important third-party payers for patients treated with our products. While these programs may cover OTC products under some circumstances, utilization of our products under these programs is limited. When covering our products, these programs regulate the amount pharmacies and other healthcare providers are paid for our products. We participate in the following programs, and are subject to associated price reporting, payment, and other compliance obligations: 
•Medicaid Drug Rebate Program (“MDRP”) - We are required to report pricing data to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) on a monthly and quarterly basis, and to pay rebates to state Medicaid programs on units of our drugs covered by such programs.
•340B Drug Pricing Program - We are required to charge certain healthcare providers, known as 340B “covered entities,” no more than the statutorily-defined 340B “ceiling price” for our covered outpatient drugs, and must report the 340B ceiling price to the government.
•Department of Veterans Affairs (“VA”) Federal Supply Schedule (“FSS”) - We anticipate participating in the FSS contracting program, which would require us to charge certain agencies (the VA, Department of Defense, Public Health Service and Coast Guard) no more than a statutory Federal Ceiling Price for certain drugs. FSS contracts include extensive disclosure and certification requirements and standard government terms and conditions with which we would have to comply. We would also expect to enter into an agreement to pay rebates on innovator drug prescriptions dispensed to TRICARE beneficiaries by TRICARE network retail pharmacies.
Refer to the risk factors under the heading “If we fail to comply with the reporting and payment obligations under the MDRP or other governmental purchasing and rebate programs, we could be subject to fines or penalties, which could be material" in Item 1A. Risk Factors - Operational Risks.
Medicare Part D “Coverage Gap” Rebates
If we market certain innovator products, we will have to provide rebates with respect to utilization by certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries while those patients are within the Part D benefit “coverage gap.” The rebate amount is calculated by CMS based on Part D plans “negotiated prices” paid to pharmacies.
Other Price Regulation and State Regulation
Perrigo Company plc - Item 1
Regulation

Drug pricing has come under increasing public scrutiny. Congress is considering various amendments to federal drug pricing laws and new forms of pricing regulation which would increase the financial and compliance burdens associated with our participation in the federal programs. Several states have enacted laws that, among other things, require manufacturers to report information concerning drug pricing or marketing practices or to provide advance notice of price actions or applications for regulatory approvals. These laws provide for penalties in case of errors or failure to comply. Refer to the risk factors under the headings "Limitations on reimbursement, continuing healthcare reforms, and changes to reimbursement methods in the U.S. and other counties may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations" and “If we fail to comply with the reporting and payment obligations under the MDRP or other governmental purchasing and rebate programs, we could be subject to fines or penalties, which could be material” in Item 1A. Risk Factors - Operational Risks.
Other U.S. Regulations and Organizations
We are subject to various other federal, state, non-governmental, and local agency rules and regulations. Compliance with the laws and regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of our current products and the discovery, development, and introduction of new products requires substantial effort, expense and capital investment. Other regulatory agencies, organizations, legislation, regulations and laws that may impact our business include, but are not limited to: 
•Physician Payment Sunshine Act and Similar State Laws - This act and similar state laws require certain pharmaceutical manufacturers to engage in extensive tracking of payments or transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, maintenance of a payment database and public reporting of the payment data.
•Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 ("FCPA") - This act and other similar anti-bribery laws prohibit companies and their intermediaries from providing money or anything of value to officials of foreign governments, foreign political parties or designated public international organizations with the intent to obtain or retain business or seek a business advantage.
•Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") - This agency oversees the advertising and other promotional practices of consumer products marketers. The FTC considers whether a product’s claims are substantiated, truthful and not misleading. The FTC also reviews mergers and acquisitions of companies exceeding specified thresholds and investigates certain business practices relevant to the healthcare industry. 
•International Organization for Standardization ("ISO") - The ISO Standards specify requirements for a Quality Management System that demonstrates the ability to consistently provide products that meet customer and applicable regulatory standards and includes processes to ensure continuous improvement. Our infant formula manufacturing sites are ISO 9001-2008 Certified for Quality Management Systems. ISO inspections are conducted at least annually.
•United States Pharmacopoeia Convention, Inc. ("USP") - The USP is a non-governmental, standard-setting organization. The FFDCA incorporates by reference the USP quality and testing standards and monographs as the standard that must be met for the listed drugs, unless compliance with those standards is specifically disclaimed on the product’s labeling. USP standards exist for most Rx and OTC pharmaceuticals and many nutritional supplements. The FDA typically requires USP compliance as part of cGMP compliance.
•Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ("HIPAA") - HIPAA is a set of regulations designed to protect personal information and data collected and stored in medical records. It established a national standard to be used in all doctors' offices, hospitals and other businesses where personal medical information is stored. In addition to protecting personal medical information, HIPAA also gives patients the right to view their medical records and request changes if the data is incorrect. We could be subject to criminal penalties if we knowingly obtain individually identifiable health information from a covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA or for aiding and abetting the violation of HIPAA.
•Consumer Product Safety Commission ("CPSC") - The CPSC has published regulations requiring child resistant packaging on certain products including pharmaceuticals and dietary supplements. The manufacturer of any product that is subject to any CPSC rule, ban, standard or regulation must certify that, based on a reasonable testing program, the product complies with CPSC requirements. 
Perrigo Company plc - Item 1
Regulation

•California Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act ("Prop 65") - Prop 65 is a right-to-know warnings law that allows the state attorney general and private enforcers to sue on behalf of the public claiming the products in question sold in California violate the law by exposing consumers to toxic chemicals in levels above those allowed by regulation without carrying warnings.
•California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA") - CCPA went into effective on January 1, 2020, which enhanced the data protection rights of residents in California. This law increases our responsibility and potential liability related to personal data of California residents that we process. On January 1, 2023 the California Privacy Rights Act went into effect and expands upon the CCPA and data privacy right protections.
•Other State Agencies - We are subject to regulation by numerous other state health departments, insurance departments, boards of pharmacy, state controlled substance agencies, state consumer health and safety regulations, and other comparable state agencies, each of which have license requirements and fees that vary by state.
Regulation Outside the U.S.
We develop and manufacture products and market third-party manufactured products in regions outside the U.S., primarily Europe, Canada, and Australia, each of which has its own regulatory environment. Other regulatory agencies, organizations and legislation that may impact our business include, but are not limited to: 
•Privacy Regulations - We are subject to numerous global laws and regulations designed to protect personal data, such as the European General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). The GDPR introduced more stringent data protection requirements in the European Union ("EU"), as well as substantial fines for breaches of the data protection rules. The GDPR increased our responsibility and potential liability in relation to personal data that we process, and we have put in place appropriate mechanisms to comply with the GDPR.
•Transparency Laws - In various jurisdictions in which we operate, we are subject to the laws and regulations aimed at increasing transparency of financial relationships between healthcare professionals and pharmaceutical/medical device manufacturers. These acts require certain pharmaceutical manufacturers to engage in extensive tracking of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals.
•Anti-Bribery Laws - Various jurisdictions in which we operate have laws and regulations, including the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 and the Irish Criminal Justice (Corruption Offenses) Act 2018, aimed at preventing and penalizing corrupt and anticompetitive behavior. 
•Rules and Regulations Infant Formula - Outside of the U.S., country-specific regulations define the requirements that we must comply with regarding the manufacturing, testing, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, and promotion of infant formula. We are subject to ongoing periodic inspection through these complex regulations, including by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency ("CFIA").
European Union 
On July 14, 2021, the European Commission adopted a set of proposals to ensure polices are aligned with the goal of reducing net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030 – the EU Green Deal. There is a growing focus on environmental impact of self-care products, their ingredients, components, packaging, manufacturing, and disposal. This focus could lead to new requirements and restrictions in the coming years across all product categories described below. 
OTC 
In the EU, as well as many other locations around the world, the manufacture and sale of medicinal products are regulated in a manner substantially similar to that of the U.S. requirements, which generally prohibit the handling, manufacture, marketing, and importation of any medicinal product unless it is properly registered in accordance with applicable law. However, obtaining regulatory approval across various EU member states can present complex challenges. The registration file relating to any particular product must contain data related to product efficacy and

Regulation

safety, including results of clinical testing and/or references to medical publications, as well as detailed information regarding production methods and quality control. Health ministries are authorized to cancel the registration of a product if it is found to be harmful or ineffective or if it is manufactured or marketed other than in accordance with registration conditions.
The legislation governing the European pharmaceutical industry is subject to an ongoing consultation and extensive review. Updates to the existing pharmaceutical law are anticipated to be implemented in 2023. These updates could bring opportunity in terms of increased flexibility in some areas but also risk as certain aspects of the law are made more restrictive.
The European Commission passed legislation requiring new product packaging ‘safety features’ to prevent falsification of medicinal products primarily within the prescription medicines sector. Manufacturers based out of Greece, Belgium and Italy have an extended timeline until February 9, 2025 to implement the serialization guidelines as they already feature similar requirements on their current drug packages.
Data exclusivity provisions exist in many countries, although the application is not uniform. In general, these exclusivity provisions prevent the approval and/or submission of generic drug applications to the health authorities for a fixed period of time following the first approval of the brand-name product in that country. As these exclusivity provisions operate independently of patent exclusivity, they may prevent the submission of generic drug applications for some products even after the patent protection has expired.
The advertising of pharmaceuticals in the EU is governed by national regulations and guidelines. Within certain member states this is overseen by a self-certification process whereas in others national governance bodies approve material prior to release.
The EU Commission has published guidelines on Good Distribution Practice of Medicinal Products for Human Use in 2013. The present guidelines are based on Articles 84 and 85b(3) of medicinal products for human use directive. 
Medical Devices
The EU has enacted into law numerous directives and adopted many harmonizing standards pertaining to a wide range of industrial products, including medical devices. Medical devices that comply with the requirements of applicable directives are entitled to bear the CE marking of conformity, which indicates that the device conforms to the applicable requirements of the directives and, accordingly, can be commercially distributed throughout Europe. The method of assessing conformity varies depending on the class of the product, but normally involves a combination of self-assessment by the manufacturer and a third-party assessment by a Notified Body, an organization accredited by a member state under the EU's Medical Device Regulation ("MDR"). Assessment by a Notified Body includes an audit of the manufacturer’s quality system and may also include specific testing of the product. This assessment is a prerequisite for a manufacturer to commercially distribute the product throughout the EU. All medical devices will need to be approved under the MDR with transition periods until 2027-28, and the possibility to sell off existing medical device products until end of shelf-life. 
Dietary Supplements
Dietary supplements are subject to several regulations that inform the selection of ingredient levels and how products can be described on packaging and in advertising. These regulations include: Food Supplements Directive 2002/46/EC, Food Information to Consumers Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011, Permitted Vitamins and Minerals Regulation (EC) 1170/2009, Food Additives Regulation (EC) 1333/2008, Nutritional & Health Claims Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, the Foods Intended for Particular Nutritional Uses Directive 2009/39/EC, Regulation (EU) 609/2013, and Regulation EC 1924/2006.
Cosmetics
Cosmetic products in the EU market must comply with Regulation EC No. 1223/2009. This regulation requires manufacturers to prepare a product safety report prior to placing a cosmetic product in the market. In addition, for each cosmetic product placed in the market, a “responsible person” must be designated to oversee compliance with the regulation’s reporting requirements. Commission Regulation EU No. 655/2013 establishes the common criteria and justification for claims to be used in the packaging and advertising of cosmetics products. 
Perrigo Company plc - Item 1
Regulation

Biocides
Biocides in the EU market must comply with Regulation EU No. 528/2012 ("EU BPR") overseen by the European Chemicals Agency. Contrary to medicines, biocides are not exempted from chemical legislation such as the Regulation on Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals No. 1907/2006 and the Regulation on Classification, Labelling and Packaging Regulation of substances and mixtures EC No. 1272/2008. 
General Product Safety Directive
The General Product Safety Directive (2001/95/EC) complements sector-specific legislation such as rules that apply to electrical and electronic goods, chemicals, and other specific product groups. Together, the General Product Safety Directive and sector specific legislation ensure the safety and traceability of products in the market (other than pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and food which are regulated under separate legislation). If our products fail to meet the General Product Safety Directive, we may incur fines.
Additional Global Regulations and Considerations 
We must comply with a variety of U.S. laws related to doing business outside of the U.S., including but not limited to, Office of Foreign Asset Controls; United Nations and EU sanctions; the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012; rules relating to the use of certain “conflict minerals” under Section 1502 of the Dodd- Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act; and regulations enforced by the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol. Changes in laws, regulations, and practices affecting the pharmaceutical industry and the healthcare system, including imports, exports, manufacturing, quality, cost, pricing, reimbursement, approval, inspection, and delivery of healthcare, may affect our business and operations. International sanctions and boycotts of our products could also impact our sales and ability to export our products.
Certain formulations of the branded pain medications we sell in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions contain codeine. In recent years, there has been growing concern about the use and misuse of opioids and related products in the United States and around the world. Natural and synthetic opioids have analgesic and sedative effects, and are commonly prescribed by medical professionals for the temporary management of pain. Clinically weaker opioid analgesics, such as products containing codeine, are available from pharmacists in certain jurisdictions without a doctor’s prescription. However, a number of jurisdictions have implemented or are considering restrictions on OTC products containing codeine. For example, in 2018, Australia reclassified codeine to require a prescription. In Ireland, such products are currently subject to safety restrictions, including prohibition on advertising, restrictions on in-store visibility, and availability only with the recommendation of a qualified pharmacist. In November 2022, Irish regulators notified manufacturers that it would be initiating a formal classification review of non-prescription codeine products. A decision is anticipated by the end of the third quarter of 2023 followed by a brief transition period, should the products be re-classified. Restrictions or prohibitions on the sale of OTC products containing codeine could affect our CSCI segment in future periods.
Tax Regulations
Recent Changes to Tax Laws, Regulations and Related Interpretations
On August 16, 2022, the U.S. enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 ("IR Act"), which, among other changes, introduces a 15% minimum tax based on adjusted financial statement income of certain large corporations with a three-year average adjusted financial statement income in excess of $1 billion, an excise tax on corporate stock buybacks, and several tax incentives to promote clean energy. We evaluated the IR Act and concluded it does not result in any material changes to our income tax reporting for the year ended December 31, 2022. We will continue to evaluate the effects of the IR Act on future accounting periods.
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”), which represents a coalition of member countries, has recommended changes to numerous long-standing tax principles. Changes include imposing a global minimum corporation tax of 15% and introducing new filing obligations. These changes are being adopted and implemented by many of the countries in which we do business and may increase our tax expense. Specifically, in December 2022, the EU adopted a Directive issued by the European Commission requiring EU members to implement the OECD's global minimum tax rules effective January 1, 2024. 
On December 28, 2021, the U.S. Treasury and the IRS released final foreign tax credit regulations addressing various aspects of the foreign tax credit regime. The regulations were, generally, effective on March 7, 2022. We
