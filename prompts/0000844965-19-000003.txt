Products and Services 

Completion Fluids & Products Division
Liquid calcium chloride, calcium bromide, zinc bromide, zinc calcium bromide, sodium bromide, and blends of such products manufactured by our Completion Fluids & Products Division are referred to as clear brine fluids ("CBFs") in the oil and gas industry. CBFs are salt solutions that have variable densities and are used to control bottom-hole pressures during oil and gas completion and workover operations. The Completion Fluids & Products Division sells CBFs and various CBF additives to U.S. and foreign oil and gas exploration and production companies and to other companies that service customers in the oil and gas industry.

The Completion Fluids & Products Division provides both stock and custom-blended CBFs based on each customer's specific needs and the proposed application. The Completion Fluids & Products Division provides a broad range of associated CBF services, including: on-site fluids filtration, handling and recycling; wellbore cleanup; fluid engineering consultation; and fluid management services. The Completion Fluids & Products Division's newest CBF technology, TETRA CS Neptune® completion fluids, are high-density fluids that are free of solids, zinc and formates. They were developed by TETRA to be environmentally friendly and cost-effective alternatives to traditional zinc bromide and cesium formate high-density completion fluids for use in well completion and workover operations, as well as a low-solids reservoir drilling fluid.
We offer to repurchase (buyback) certain used CBFs from customers, which we are able to recondition and recycle. Selling used CBFs back to us reduces the net cost of the CBFs to our customers and minimizes our customers’ need to dispose of used fluids. We recondition used CBFs through filtration, blending and the use of proprietary chemical processes, and then market the reconditioned CBFs.

By blending different stock CBFs and using various additives, we are able to modify the specific density, crystallization temperature, and chemical composition of the CBFs as necessary. The Division’s fluid engineering personnel determine the optimal CBF blend for a customer’s particular application to maximize its effectiveness and lifespan. Our filtration services use a variety of techniques and equipment to remove particulates from CBFs at the customer’s site so the CBFs can be reused. Filtration also enables recovery of a greater percentage of used CBFs for reconditioning.    

The Completion Fluids & Products Division manufactures liquid and dry calcium chloride and liquid calcium bromide, zinc bromide, zinc calcium bromide, and sodium bromide for distribution, primarily into energy markets. Liquid and dry calcium chloride are also sold into water treatment, industrial, cement, food processing, road maintenance, ice melt, agricultural, and consumer products markets. Sodium bromide is also sold into industrial water treatment markets, where it is used as a biocide in recirculated cooling tower waters and in other applications.
Our calcium chloride manufacturing facilities are located in the United States and Finland. We also acquire calcium chloride inventory from other producers. In the United States, we manufacture calcium chloride at five manufacturing plant facilities, the largest of which is our plant near El Dorado, Arkansas, which produces liquid and flake calcium chloride products and sodium chloride. Liquid and flake calcium chloride are also produced at our Kokkola, Finland, plant. We operate our European calcium chloride operations under the name TETRA Chemicals Europe. We also manufacture liquid calcium chloride at our facilities in Parkersburg, West Virginia and Lake Charles, Louisiana, and we have two solar evaporation facility locations located in San Bernardino County, California, that produce liquid calcium chloride and sodium chloride from underground brine reserves, which are replenished naturally. Our calcium chloride production facilities have a combined production capacity of more than 1.5 million equivalent liquid tons per year.
Our Completion Fluids & Products Division manufactures liquid calcium bromide, zinc bromide, zinc calcium bromide and sodium bromide at our West Memphis, Arkansas facility. A patented and proprietary process utilized at this facility uses bromine and zinc to manufacture zinc bromide. This facility also uses proprietary processes to manufacture calcium bromide and sodium bromide and to recondition and upgrade used CBFs that we have repurchased from our customers.

Sources of Raw Materials

Our Completion Fluids & Products Division manufactures calcium chloride, calcium bromide, zinc bromide, zinc calcium bromide, and sodium bromide for sale to its customers. The Completion Fluids & Products Division also recycles used calcium bromide and zinc bromide CBFs repurchased from its oil and gas customers.

The Completion Fluids & Products Division manufactures liquid calcium chloride, either from underground brine or by reacting hydrochloric acid with limestone. The Completion Fluids & Products Division also purchases liquid and dry calcium chloride from a number of U.S. and foreign chemical manufacturers. Our El Dorado, Arkansas, plant produces liquid and flake calcium chloride and sodium chloride, utilizing underground brine (tail brine) obtained from Lanxess AG ("Lanxess") that contains calcium chloride and sodium chloride. We also produce calcium chloride and sodium chloride at our two facilities in San Bernardino County, California, by solar evaporation of pumped underground brine reserves that contain calcium chloride. The underground reserves of this brine are deemed adequate to supply our foreseeable need for calcium chloride at those plants.

The Completion Fluids & Products Division's primary sources of hydrochloric acid are co-product streams obtained from chemical manufacturers. Substantial quantities of limestone are also consumed when converting hydrochloric acid into calcium chloride. Currently, hydrochloric acid and limestone are generally available from multiple sources.

To produce calcium bromide, zinc bromide, zinc calcium bromide, and sodium bromide at our West Memphis, Arkansas facility, we use bromine, hydrobromic acid, zinc, and lime as raw materials. There are multiple sources of zinc that we can use in the production of zinc bromide and zinc calcium bromide. We have a long-term supply agreement with Lanxess, under which the Completion Fluids & Products Division purchases its requirements of raw material bromine from Lanxess’ Arkansas bromine production facilities. In addition, we have a long-term agreement with Lanxess under which Lanxess supplies our El Dorado, Arkansas calcium chloride plant with raw material tail brine.

We also own a calcium bromide manufacturing plant near Magnolia, Arkansas, which was constructed in 1985. This plant was acquired in 1988 and is not operable. We currently lease approximately 30,000 gross acres of bromine-containing brine reserves in the vicinity of this plant. While this plant is designed to produce calcium bromide, it could be modified to produce elemental bromine or select bromine compounds. Development of the brine field, construction of necessary pipelines and reconfiguration of the plant would require a substantial capital investment. The long-term Lanxess bromine supply agreement discussed above provides us with a secure supply of bromine to support the Division’s current operations. We do, however, continue to evaluate our strategy related to the Magnolia, Arkansas, assets and their future development. Lanxess has certain rights to participate in future development of the Magnolia, Arkansas assets.

The Water & Flowback Services Division purchases water management, production testing and rig cooling equipment and components from third-party manufacturers. CCLP designs and fabricates its reciprocating and rotary screw compressor packages with components obtained from third party suppliers. These components represent a significant portion of the cost of the compressor packages. Some of the components used in the assembly of compressor packages, well monitoring, sand separation, water management, production testing, and rig cooling equipment are obtained from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers. We do not have long-term contracts with these suppliers or manufacturers. Should we experience unavailability of the equipment or the components we use to assemble our equipment, we believe there are adequate alternative suppliers and any impact to us would not be severe. CCLP occasionally experiences long-lead times for components from suppliers and, therefore, may at times make purchases in anticipation of future orders.

Market Overview and Competition
Our operations are significantly dependent upon the demand for, and production of, natural gas and oil in the various domestic and international locations in which we operate. Beginning in 2014, and continuing throughout most of 2016, reduced prices of natural gas and oil led to declines in our customers' drilling activities and capital expenditure levels in the domestic and international markets in which we operate. The decline in activity in the natural gas and oil exploration and production industry resulted in reduced demand for certain of our products and services compared to early 2014 levels. Oil and gas pricing increased throughout the second half of 2017 and most of 2018, and onshore demand has improved in the North America and international markets, with offshore activity remaining flat year-over-year. However, oil and gas pricing remains volatile. 
Completion Fluids & Products Division

Our Completion Fluids & Products Division provides its products and services to oil and gas exploration and production companies in the United States and certain foreign markets, and to other customers that service such companies. Current areas of market presence include the onshore U.S., the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, the North Sea, Mexico, and certain countries in South America, Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. Customers with deepwater operations frequently utilize high volumes of clear brine fluids ("CBFs"), which can be subject to harsh downhole conditions, such as high pressure and high temperatures. Demand for CBF products is generally driven by offshore completion activity.
Our Completion Fluids & Products Division’s principal competitors in the sale of CBFs to the oil and gas industry are other major international drilling fluids and energy services companies, to many of which we provide products and services. This market is highly competitive, and competition is based primarily on service, availability, and price. Customers of the Completion Fluids & Products Division include significant oilfield service companies, major and independent U.S. and international oil and gas producers, and U.S. and international chemical providers. The Completion Fluids & Products Division also sells its CBF products through various distributors. 

Our liquid and dry calcium chloride products have a wide range of uses outside the energy industry. Non-energy market segments where these products are used include water treatment, industrial, food processing, road maintenance, ice melt, agricultural, and consumer products. We also sell sodium bromide into industrial water treatment markets as a biocide under the BioRid® tradename. Most of these markets are highly competitive. The Completion Fluids & Products Division’s European calcium chloride operations market our calcium chloride products to certain European markets. Our principal competitors in the non-energy related calcium chloride markets include Occidental Chemical Corporation and Vitro in North America and NedMag in Europe.

Water & Flowback Services Division
The Water & Flowback Services Division provides comprehensive water management and frac flowback services to a wide-range of onshore oil and gas operators located in all active North America unconventional oil and gas basins. The acquisition of SwiftWater continues to expand our market share in the Permian Basin, which is one of the fastest growing basins for oilfield services globally. SwiftWater gives us significant additional service capacity as well as incremental services that allow us increased cross-selling of our water management, flowback and fluids products and services.

Our Water & Flowback Services Division also provides frac flowback services, early production facilities and services, production well testing services, offshore rig cooling services, and other associated services in various onshore domestic and international locations, including well flow management and evaluation services that enable operators to quantify oil and gas reserves, optimize oil and gas production, and minimize oil and gas reservoir production damage. Through our Greywolf subsidiary, the Division serves the western Canada market. In addition, through our OPTIMA subsidiary, we offer offshore oil and gas rig cooling services and associated products that suppress heat and noise generated by high-rate flaring of hydrocarbons during offshore well testing operations. OPTIMA primarily serves offshore markets globally. 
The water management, flowback and production testing markets are highly competitive, and competition is based on availability of appropriate equipment and qualified personnel, as well as price, quality of service, and safety record. We believe that our skilled personnel, operating procedures, integrated closed-loop water management systems, and safety record give us a competitive advantage. Competition in the U.S. water management markets includes various regional companies and Select Energy, while competition in onshore U.S. 
6

and Canadian production testing markets is primarily dominated by numerous small, privately owned operators. Expro International, Halliburton, and Schlumberger are competitors in the foreign markets we serve although we provide these services to their customers on a subcontract basis from time to time. The customers for the Water & Flowback Services Division include major integrated and independent U.S. and international oil and gas producers that are active in the areas in which we operate. Competitors for our water management services include large, multinational providers, as well as small, privately owned operators.

Compression Division
The Compression Division provides its products and services to a broad base of natural gas and oil exploration and production, midstream, pipeline transmission, and storage companies, operating throughout many of the onshore producing regions of the United States. The Compression Division also has operations in Latin America and other foreign regions. While most of the Compression Division's services are performed throughout Texas, the San Juan Basin, the Rocky Mountain region and the Midcontinent region of the United States, we also have a presence in other U.S. producing regions. The Compression Division continues to seek opportunities to further expand its operations into other regions in the U.S. and elsewhere in the world.
This Division’s strategy is to compete on the basis of superior services at a competitive price. The Compression Division believes that it is competitive because of the significant increases in the value that results from the use of its services, its superior customer service, its highly trained field personnel and the quality of the compressor packages it uses to provide services. The Compression Division’s customers include major integrated oil companies, public and private independent exploration and production companies and midstream companies.
The compression services and compressor package fabrication business is highly competitive. Certain of the Compression Division's competitors may be able to more quickly adapt to changes within the compression industry and changes in economic conditions as a whole, more readily take advantage of available opportunities and adopt more aggressive pricing policies. Primary competition for our low-horsepower compression services business comes from various local and regional companies that utilize packages consisting of a screw compressor with a separate engine driver or a reciprocating compressor with a separate engine driver. These local and regional competitors tend to compete with us on the basis of price as opposed to our focus on providing production enhancement value to the customer. Competition for the medium- and high-horsepower compression services business comes primarily from large companies that may have greater financial resources than ours. Such competitors include ArchRock, Kodiak Gas Services, and USA Compression. Our competition in the standard compressor package fabrication and sales market includes several large companies and a large number of small, regional fabricators, including some of those who we compete with for compression services, as well as Enerflex, Exterran and others. The Compression Division's competition in the custom-designed compressor package market usually consists of larger companies that have the ability to address integrated projects and provide product support after the sale. The ability to fabricate these large custom-designed packages at the Compression Division's facilities, which is near the point of end-use of many customers, is often a competitive advantage.
No single customer provided 10% or more of our total consolidated revenues during the year ended December 31, 2018.
Other Business Matters

Backlog

The Compression Division’s equipment sales business consists of the fabrication and sale of standard compressor packages and custom-designed compressor packages that are fabricated to customer specifications and standard specifications, as applicable. The Division's custom-designed compressor packages are typically greater in size and complexity than standard fabrication packages, requiring more labor, materials, and overhead resources. This business requires diligent planning of those resources and project and backlog management in order to meet the customers' desired delivery dates and performance criteria, and achieve fabrication efficiencies. As of December 31, 2018, the Compression Division's equipment sales backlog was $105.2 million, all of which is expected to be recognized in 2019. This backlog consists of firm customer orders for which a purchase or work order has been received, satisfactory credit or financing arrangements exist, and delivery has been scheduled. This backlog is a measure of marketing effectiveness that also allows us to plan future labor and raw material needs and to measure our success in winning bids from our customers. 
7

Other than these Compression Division operations, our products and services generally are either not sold under long-term contracts or do not require long lead times to procure or deliver.

Employees

As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 2,900 employees, including the employees of CCLP. None of our U.S. employees are presently covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Our foreign employees are generally members of labor unions and associations in the countries in which they are employed. We believe that our relations with our employees are good.
Patents, Proprietary Technology and Trademarks

As of December 31, 2018, we owned or licensed thirty-two issued U.S. patents and had six patent applications pending in the United States. We also had thirty-seven owned or licensed patents and fifteen patent applications pending in various other countries. The foreign patents and patent applications are primarily foreign counterparts to certain of our U.S. patents or patent applications. The issued patents expire at various times through 2035. We have elected to maintain certain other internally developed technologies, know-how, and inventions as trade secrets. While we believe that our patents and trade secrets are important to our competitive positions in our businesses, we do not believe any one patent or trade secret is essential to our success.

It is our practice to enter into confidentiality agreements with key employees, consultants and third parties to whom we disclose our confidential and proprietary information, and we have typical policies and procedures designed to maintain the confidentiality of such information. There can be no assurance, however, that these measures will prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our trade secrets and expertise, or that others may not independently develop similar trade secrets or expertise.

We sell various products and services under a variety of trademarks and service marks, some of which are registered in the United States or other countries.

Health, Safety, and Environmental Affairs Regulations

We believe that our service and sales operations and manufacturing plants are in substantial compliance with all applicable U.S. and foreign health, safety, and environmental laws and regulations. We are committed to conducting all of our operations under the highest standards of safety and respect for the environment. However, risks of substantial costs and liabilities are inherent in certain of our operations and in the development and handling of certain products and equipment produced or used at our plants, well locations, and worksites. Because of these risks, there can be no assurance that significant costs and liabilities will not be incurred in the future. Changes in environmental and health and safety regulations could subject us to more rigorous standards. We cannot predict the extent to which our operations may be affected by future regulatory and enforcement policies.
We are subject to numerous federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations relating to health, safety, and the environment, including regulations regarding air emissions, wastewater and storm water discharges, and the disposal of certain hazardous and nonhazardous wastes. Compliance with laws and regulations may expose us to significant costs and liabilities, and cause us to incur significant capital expenditures in our operations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations or associated permits may result in the assessment of fines and penalties and the imposition of other obligations.

Our operations in the United States are subject to various evolving environmental laws and regulations that are enforced by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA"); the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement ("BSEE") of the U.S. Department of the Interior; the U.S. Coast Guard; and various other federal, state, and local environmental authorities. Similar laws and regulations, designed to protect the health and safety of our employees and visitors to our facilities, are enforced by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and other state and local agencies and authorities. Specific environmental laws and regulations applicable to our operations include: (i) the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972 (the "Clean Water Act"); (ii) the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976; (iii) the Clean Air Act of 1977 ("CAA"); (iv) the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 ("CERCLA"); (v) the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986; (vi) the Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976; (vii) the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act of 1975; (viii) and the Pollution Prevention Act of 1990. Our operations outside the United States 
8

are subject to various foreign governmental laws and regulations relating to the environment, health and safety, and other regulated activities in the countries in which we operate.

We routinely deal with natural gas, oil, and other petroleum products. Hydrocarbons or other hazardous wastes may have been released during our operations or by third parties on wellhead sites where we provide services or store our equipment or on or under other locations where wastes have been taken for disposal. These properties may be subject to investigatory, remediation, and monitoring requirements under foreign, federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations.
The EPA has adopted regulations under the CAA to control emissions of hazardous air pollutants from reciprocal internal combustion engines and more recently the EPA adopted regulations that establish air emission controls for natural gas and natural gas liquids production, processing and transportation activities, including EPA's New Source Performance Standards ("NSPS") as well as emission standards to address hazardous air pollutants. Certain CCLP compressor packages are subject to these new requirements and additional control equipment and maintenance operations are required. While we do not believe that compliance with current regulatory requirements will have a material adverse effect on the business, additional regulations could impose new air permitting or pollution control requirements on our equipment that could require us to incur material costs.
The modification or interpretation of existing environmental laws or regulations, the more vigorous enforcement of existing environmental laws or regulations, or the adoption of new environmental laws or regulations may also adversely affect oil and natural gas exploration and production, which in turn could have an adverse effect on us.
In accordance with Section 402 of the Clean Water Act, the EPA is authorized to issue National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) General Permits to regulate offshore discharges in the Gulf of Mexico which includes Treatment, Completion and Workover ("TCW") fluids. Our operations provide services and materials to oil and gas operators for the use of TCW fluids in the Gulf of Mexico. Both Region IV and Region VI of the EPA are currently working with the oil and gas industry to further investigate the toxicity characteristics of TCW fluids. The study is expected to take place over the next few years and could impose additional restrictions under the Clean Water Act, however they are not expected to have a material adverse impact. The Clean Water Act and comparable state laws, and regulations thereunder, also regulate the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters, including industrial wastewater discharges and storm water runoff.
We maintain various types of insurance intended to reimburse us for certain costs in the event of an accident, including an explosion or similar event involving our offshore operations. Our insurance program is reviewed not less than annually with our insurance brokers and underwriters. As part of our insurance program for offshore operations, we maintain Commercial General Liability, Protection and Indemnity, and Excess Liability policies that provide third-party liability coverage, including but not limited to death and personal injury, collision, damage to property including fixed and floating objects, pollution, and wreck removal up to the applicable policy limits.
