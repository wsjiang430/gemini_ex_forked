--------+---------

General 
 Kronos Worldwide, Inc. (NYSE: KRO) (Kronos), incorporated in Delaware in 1989, is a leading global producer and marketer of value-added titanium dioxide pigments, or TiO2, a base industrial product used in a wide range of applications.  We, along with our distributors and agents, sell and provide technical services for our products to approximately 4,000 customers in 100 countries with the majority of sales in Europe, North America and Asia Pacific.  We believe we have developed considerable expertise and efficiency in the manufacture, sale, shipment and service of our products in domestic and international markets. 
 TiO2 is a white inorganic pigment used in a wide range of products for its exceptional durability and its ability to impart whiteness, brightness and opacity.  TiO2 is a critical component of everyday applications, such as coatings, plastics and paper, as well as many specialty products such as inks, food and cosmetics.  TiO2 is widely considered to be superior to alternative white pigments in large part due to its hiding power (or opacity), which is the ability to cover or mask other materials effectively and efficiently.  TiO2 is designed, marketed and sold based on specific end-use applications. 
 TiO2 is the largest commercially used whitening pigment because it has a high refractive rating, giving it more hiding power than any other commercially produced white pigment.  In addition, TiO2 has excellent resistance to interaction with other chemicals, good thermal stability and resistance to ultraviolet degradation.  Although there are other white pigments on the market, we believe there are no effective substitutes for TiO2 because no other white pigment has the physical properties for achieving comparable opacity and brightness or can be incorporated in as cost-effective a manner.  Pigment extenders such as kaolin clays, calcium carbonate and polymeric opacifiers are used together with TiO2 in a number of end-use markets.  However, these products are not able to duplicate the opacity performance characteristics of TiO2 and we believe these products are unlikely to have a significant impact on the use of TiO2. 
 TiO2 is considered a “quality-of-life” product.  Demand for TiO2 has generally been driven by worldwide gross domestic product and has generally increased with rising standards of living in various regions of the world.  According to industry estimates, TiO2 consumption has grown at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 3% since 1990.  Per capita consumption of TiO2 in Western Europe and North America far exceeds that in other areas of the world, and these regions are expected to continue to be the largest consumers of TiO2 on a per capita basis for the foreseeable future.  We believe that Western Europe and North America currently account for approximately 20% and 17% of global TiO2 consumption, respectively.  Markets for TiO2 are generally increasing in South America, Eastern Europe, the Asia Pacific region and China and we believe these are significant markets where we expect continued growth as economies in these regions continue to develop and quality-of-life products, including TiO2, experience greater demand. 
 At December 31, 2018, approximately 50% of our common stock was owned by Valhi, Inc. (NYSE: VHI) and approximately 30% was owned by a wholly-owned subsidiary of NL Industries, Inc. (NYSE: NL).  Valhi also owns approximately 83% of NL Industries’ outstanding common stock.  A wholly-owned subsidiary of Contran Corporation held approximately 92% of Valhi’s outstanding common stock.  As discussed in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, Lisa K. Simmons and Serena Simmons Connelly may be deemed to control Contran, Valhi, NL and us.

Products and end-use markets 
 Including our predecessors, we have produced and marketed TiO2 in North America and Europe, our primary markets, for over 100 years.  We believe we are the largest producer of TiO2 in Europe with 44% of our 2018 sales volumes attributable to markets in Europe.  The table below shows our market share for our significant markets, Europe and North America, for the last three years. 
 
 
 | 2016 | | 2017 | 2018
--------------+------+----+------+-----
Europe | | 17 | % | | 17 | % | 13 | %
North America | | 16 | % | | 18 | % | 17 | %

 
We believe we are the leading seller of TiO2 in several countries, including Germany, with an estimated 8% share of worldwide TiO2 sales volume in 2018.  Overall, we are one of the top six producers of TiO2 in the world.
 We offer our customers a broad portfolio of products that include over 40 different TiO2 pigment grades under the KRONOS® trademark, which provide a variety of performance properties to meet customers’ specific requirements.  Our major customers include domestic and international paint, plastics, decorative laminate and paper manufacturers.  We ship TiO2 to our customers in either a powder or slurry form via rail, truck and/or ocean carrier.  Sales of our core TiO2 pigments represented approximately 94% of our net sales in 2018.  We and our agents and distributors primarily sell our products in three major end-use markets: coatings, plastics and paper. 
 The following tables show our approximate TiO2 sales volume by geographic region and end use for the year ended December 31, 2018: 
 
 
Sales volume percentages by geographic region | Sales volume percentages by end-use
----------------------------------------------+------------------------------------
Europe | 44 | % | Coatings | 56 | %
North America | 37 | % | Plastics | 27 | %
Asia Pacific | 10 | % | Paper | 7 | %
Rest of World | 9 | % | Other | 10 | %

 
Some of the principal applications for our products include the following:
 TiO2 for coatings – Our TiO2 is used to provide opacity, durability, tinting strength and brightness in industrial coatings, as well as coatings for commercial and residential interiors and exteriors, automobiles, aircraft, machines, appliances, traffic paint and other special purpose coatings.  The amount of TiO2 used in coatings varies widely depending on the opacity, color and quality desired.  In general, the higher the opacity requirement of the coating, the greater the TiO2 content. 
 TiO2 for plastics – We produce TiO2 pigments that improve the optical and physical properties of plastics, including whiteness and opacity.  TiO2 is used to provide opacity to items such as containers and packaging materials, and vinyl products such as windows, door profiles and siding.  TiO2 also generally provides hiding power, neutral undertone, brightness and surface durability for housewares, appliances, toys, computer cases and food packages.  TiO2’s high brightness along with its opacity, is used in some engineering plastics to help mask their undesirable natural color.  TiO2 is also used in masterbatch, which is a concentrate of TiO2 and other additives and is one of the largest uses for TiO2 in the plastics end-use market.  In masterbatch, the TiO2 is dispersed at high concentrations into a plastic resin and is then used by manufacturers of plastic containers, bottles, packaging and agricultural films. 
 TiO2 for paper – Our TiO2 is used in the production of several types of paper, including laminate (decorative) paper, filled paper and coated paper to provide whiteness, brightness, opacity and color stability.  Although we sell our TiO2 to all segments of the paper end-use market, our primary focus is on the TiO2 grades used in paper laminates, where several layers of paper are laminated together using melamine resin under high temperature and pressure.  The top layer of paper contains TiO2 and plastic resin and is the layer that is printed with decorative patterns.  Paper laminates are used to replace materials such as wood and tile for such applications as 
 5


counter tops, furniture and wallboard.  TiO2 is beneficial in these applications because it assists in preventing the material from fading or changing color after prolonged exposure to sunlight and other weathering agents. 
 TiO2 for other applications – We produce TiO2 to improve the opacity and hiding power of printing inks.  TiO2 allows inks to achieve very high print quality while not interfering with the technical requirements of printing machinery, including low abrasion, high printing speed and high temperatures.  Our TiO2 is also used in textile applications where TiO2 functions as an opacifying and delustering agent.  In man-made fibers such as rayon and polyester, TiO2 corrects an otherwise undesirable glossy and translucent appearance.  Without the presence of TiO2, these materials would be unsuitable for use in many textile applications. 
 We produce high purity sulfate process anatase TiO2 used to provide opacity, whiteness and brightness in a variety of cosmetic and personal care products, such as skin cream, lipstick, eye shadow and toothpaste.  Our TiO2 is also found in food products, such as candy and confectionaries, and in pet foods where it is used to obtain uniformity of color and appearance.  In pharmaceuticals, our TiO2 is used commonly as a colorant in tablet and capsule coatings as well as in liquid medicines to provide uniformity of color and appearance.  KRONOS® purified anatase grades meet the applicable requirements of the CTFA (Cosmetics, Toiletries and Fragrances Association), USP and BP (United States Pharmacopoeia and British Pharmacopoeia) and the FDA (United States Food and Drug Administration). 
 Our TiO2 business is enhanced by the following three complementary businesses, which comprised approximately 6% of our net sales in 2018: 
  
• | We own and operate two ilmenite mines in Norway pursuant to a governmental concession with an unlimited term. Ilmenite is a raw material used directly as a feedstock by some sulfate-process TiO2 plants. We supply ilmenite to our sulfate plants in Europe. We also sell ilmenite ore to third parties, some of whom are our competitors, and we sell an ilmenite-based specialty product to the oil and gas industry. The mines have estimated ilmenite reserves that are expected to last at least 50 years. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We manufacture and sell iron-based chemicals, which are co-products and processed co-products of sulfate and chloride process TiO2 pigment production. These co-product chemicals are marketed through our Ecochem division and are primarily used as treatment and conditioning agents for industrial effluents and municipal wastewater as well as in the manufacture of iron pigments, cement and agricultural products. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We manufacture and sell titanium oxychloride and titanyl sulfate, which are side-stream specialty products from the production of TiO2. Titanium oxychloride is used in specialty applications in the formulation of pearlescent pigments, production of electroceramic capacitors for cell phones and other electronic devices. Titanyl sulfate productions are used in pearlescent pigments, natural gas pipe and other specialty applications. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Manufacturing, operations and properties
 We produce TiO2 in two crystalline forms: rutile and anatase.  Rutile TiO2 is manufactured using both a chloride production process and a sulfate production process, whereas anatase TiO2 is only produced using a sulfate production process.  Manufacturers of many end-use applications can use either form, especially during periods of tight supply for TiO2.  The chloride process is the preferred form for use in coatings and plastics, the two largest end-use markets.  Due to environmental factors and customer considerations, the proportion of TiO2 industry sales represented by chloride process pigments has increased relative to sulfate process pigments, and in 2018, chloride process production facilities represented approximately 50% of industry capacity.  The sulfate process is preferred for use in selected paper products, ceramics, rubber tires, man-made fibers, food products, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics.  Once an intermediate TiO2 pigment has been produced by either the chloride or sulfate process, it is “finished” into products with specific performance characteristics for particular end-use applications through proprietary processes involving various chemical surface treatments and intensive micronizing (milling). 
  
• | Chloride process – The chloride process is a continuous process in which chlorine is used to extract rutile TiO2. The chloride process produces less waste than the sulfate process because much of the chlorine is recycled and feedstock bearing higher titanium content is used. The chloride process also 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

has lower energy requirements and is less labor-intensive than the sulfate process, although the chloride process requires a higher-skilled labor force. The chloride process produces an intermediate base pigment with a wide range of properties. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Sulfate process – The sulfate process is a batch process in which sulfuric acid is used to extract the TiO2 from ilmenite or titanium slag. After separation from the impurities in the ore (mainly iron), the TiO2 is precipitated and calcined to form an intermediate base pigment ready for sale or can be upgraded through finishing treatments. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We produced 536,000 metric tons of TiO2 in 2018, down from the record 576,000 metric tons we produced in 2017.  Our production volumes include our share of the output produced by our TiO2 manufacturing joint venture discussed below in “TiO2 manufacturing joint venture.”  Our average production capacity utilization rates were approximately 98% in 2016, at full practical capacity in 2017 and approximately 95% in 2018.  Our production rates in 2018 were impacted by maintenance activities at certain facilities and by the first quarter implementation of a productivity-enhancing improvement project at our Belgian facility.
 We operate facilities throughout North America and Europe, including the only sulfate process plant in North America and four TiO2 plants in Europe (one in each of Leverkusen, Germany; Nordenham, Germany; Langerbrugge, Belgium; and Fredrikstad, Norway).  In North America, we have a TiO2 plant in Varennes, Quebec, Canada and, through the manufacturing joint venture described below in “TiO2 manufacturing joint venture,” a 50% interest in a TiO2 plant in Lake Charles, Louisiana. 
 Our production capacity has increased by approximately 6% over the past ten years due to debottlenecking programs, incurring only moderate capital expenditures.  We expect to operate our TiO2 plants at near full practical capacity levels in 2019.  
 The following table presents the division of our expected 2019 manufacturing capacity by plant location and type of manufacturing process: 
 
 
 | | % of capacity by TiO2manufacturing process

(1) | The Leverkusen facility is located within an extensive manufacturing complex owned by Bayer AG. We own the Leverkusen facility, which represents about one-third of our current TiO2 production capacity, but we lease the land under the facility from Bayer under a long-term agreement which expires in 2050. Lease payments are periodically negotiated with Bayer for periods of at least two years at a time. A majority-owned subsidiary of Bayer provides some raw materials including chlorine, auxiliary and operating materials, utilities and services necessary to operate the Leverkusen facility under separate supplies and services agreements.

(3) | We operate the Lake Charles facility in a joint venture with Venator Investments LLC (Venator Investments) (formerly Huntsman P&A Investments LLC), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Venator Group, of which Venator Materials PLC (Venator) owns 100% and the amount indicated in the table above represents the share of TiO2 produced by the joint venture to which we are entitled. See Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements and “TiO2 manufacturing joint venture.” The joint venture owns the land and facility. 
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We own the land underlying all of our principal production facilities unless otherwise indicated in the table above. 
 We also operate two ilmenite mines in Norway pursuant to a governmental concession with an unlimited term.  In addition, we operate a rutile slurry manufacturing plant in Lake Charles, Louisiana, which converts dry pigment primarily manufactured for us at the Lake Charles TiO2 facility into a slurry form that is then shipped to customers. 
 We have various corporate and administrative offices located in the U.S., Germany, Norway, Canada, Belgium, France and the United Kingdom and various sales offices located in North America. 
 TiO2 manufacturing joint venture  
 Kronos Louisiana, Inc., one of our subsidiaries, and Venator Investments each own a 50% interest in a manufacturing joint venture, Louisiana Pigment Company, L.P., or LPC.  LPC owns and operates a chloride-process TiO2 plant located in Lake Charles, Louisiana.  We and Venator share production from the plant equally pursuant to separate offtake agreements, unless we and Venator otherwise agree. 
 A supervisory committee directs the business and affairs of the joint venture, including production and output decisions.  This committee is composed of four members, two of whom we appoint and two of whom Venator appoints.  Two general managers manage the operations of the joint venture acting under the direction of the supervisory committee.  We appoint one general manager and Venator appoints the other. 
 The joint venture is not consolidated in our financial statements, because we do not control it.  We account for our interest in the joint venture by the equity method.  The joint venture operates on a break-even basis and therefore we do not have any equity in earnings of the joint venture.  We are required to purchase one half of the TiO2 produced by the joint venture.  All costs and capital expenditures are shared equally with Venator with the exception of feedstock (purchased natural rutile ore or slag) and packaging costs for the pigment grades produced.  Our share of net costs is reported as cost of sales as the TiO2 is sold.  See Notes 5 and 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Raw materials 
 The primary raw materials used in chloride process TiO2 are titanium-containing feedstock (purchased natural rutile ore or slag), chlorine and coke.  Chlorine is available from a number of suppliers, while petroleum coke is available from a limited number of suppliers.  Titanium-containing feedstock suitable for use in the chloride process is available from a limited but increasing number of suppliers principally in Australia, South Africa, Canada, India and the United States.  We purchase chloride process grade slag from Rio Tinto Iron and Titanium Limited under a long-term supply contract which automatically renewed at the end of 2018 and extends through December 31, 2020.  The contract automatically renews bi-annually, but can be terminated if written notice is given at least twelve months prior to the current contract end date.  We also purchase upgraded slag from Rio Tinto Iron and Titanium Limited under a long-term supply contract that expires at the end of 2019.  We purchase natural rutile ore primarily from Iluka Resources, Limited under a contract that expires in 2019.  In the past we have been, and we expect that we will continue to be, successful in obtaining short-term and long-term extensions to these and other existing supply contracts prior to their expiration.  We expect the raw materials purchased under these contracts, and contracts that we may enter into, will meet our chloride process feedstock requirements over the next several years.

The primary raw materials used in sulfate process TiO2 are titanium-containing feedstock, primarily ilmenite or purchased sulfate grade slag and sulfuric acid.  Sulfuric acid is available from a number of suppliers.  Titanium-containing feedstock suitable for use in the sulfate process is available from a limited number of suppliers principally in Norway, Canada, Australia, India and South Africa.  As one of the few vertically-integrated producers of sulfate process TiO2, we operate two rock ilmenite mines in Norway, which provided all of the feedstock for our European sulfate process TiO2 plants in 2018.  We expect ilmenite production from our mines to meet our European sulfate process feedstock requirements for the foreseeable future.  For our Canadian sulfate process plant, we purchase sulfate grade slag primarily from Rio Tinto Fer et Titane Inc. under a supply contract that renews annually, subject to termination upon twelve months written notice.  We expect the raw materials purchased under these contracts, and contracts that we may enter into, to meet our sulfate process feedstock requirements over the next several years. 
 Many of our raw material contracts contain fixed quantities we are required to purchase, or specify a range of quantities within which we are required to purchase.  The pricing under these agreements is generally negotiated quarterly or semi-annually. 
 The following table summarizes our raw materials purchased or mined in 2018. 
 
 
Production process/raw material | Raw materials procured or mined 
---------------------------------------+---------------------------------
 | (In thousands of metric tons) 
Chloride process plants - | | 
Purchased slag or rutile ore | | 430
Sulfate process plants: | | 
Ilmenite ore mined and used internally | | 328
Purchased slag | | 24 

 Sales and marketing 
 Our marketing strategy is aimed at developing and maintaining strong relationships with new and existing customers.  Because TiO2 represents a significant raw material cost for our customers, the purchasing decisions are often made by our customers’ senior management.  We work to maintain close relationships with the key decision makers through in-depth and frequent in-person meetings.  We endeavor to extend these commercial and technical relationships to multiple levels within our customers’ organization using our direct sales force and technical service group to accomplish this objective.  We believe this has helped build customer loyalty to Kronos and strengthened our competitive position.  Close cooperation and strong customer relationships enable us to stay closely attuned to trends in our customers’ businesses.  Where appropriate, we work in conjunction with our customers to solve formulation or application problems by modifying specific product properties or developing new pigment grades.  We also focus our sales and marketing efforts on those geographic and end-use market segments where we believe we can realize higher selling prices.  This focus includes continuously reviewing and optimizing our customer and product portfolios. 
 Our marketing strategy is also aimed at working directly with customers to monitor the success of our products in their end-use applications, evaluate the need for improvements in product and process technology and identify opportunities to develop new product solutions for our customers.  Our marketing staff closely coordinates with our sales force and technical specialists to ensure that the needs of our customers are met, and to help develop and commercialize new grades where appropriate. 
 We sell a majority of our products through our direct sales force operating in Europe and North America.  We also utilize sales agents and distributors who are authorized to sell our products in specific geographic areas.  In Europe, our sales efforts are conducted primarily through our direct sales force and our sales agents.  Our agents do not sell any TiO2 products other than KRONOS® brand products.  In North America, our sales are made primarily through our direct sales force and supported by a network of distributors.  In export markets, where we have increased our marketing efforts over the last several years, our sales are made through our direct sales force, sales

agents and distributors.  In addition to our direct sales force and sales agents, many of our sales agents also act as distributors to service our customers in all regions.  We offer customer and technical service to customers who purchase our products through distributors as well as to our larger customers serviced by our direct sales force. 
 We sell to a diverse customer base and no single customer comprised 10% or more of our sales in 2018.  Our largest ten customers accounted for approximately 33% of sales in 2018. 
 Neither our business as a whole nor any of our principal product groups is seasonal to any significant extent.  However, TiO2 sales are generally higher in the second and third quarters of the year, due in part to the increase in coatings production in the spring to meet demand during the spring and summer painting seasons.  With certain exceptions, we have historically operated our production facilities at near full capacity rates throughout the entire year, which among other things helps to minimize our per-unit production costs.  As a result, we normally will build inventories during the first and fourth quarters of each year in order to maximize our product availability during the higher demand periods normally experienced in the second and third quarters. 
 Competition
 The TiO2 industry is highly competitive.  We compete primarily on the basis of price, product quality, technical service and the availability of high performance pigment grades.  Since TiO2 is not a traded commodity, its pricing is largely a product of negotiation between suppliers and their respective customers.  Price and availability are the most significant competitive factors along with quality and customer service for the majority of our product grades.  Increasingly, we are focused on providing pigments that are differentiated to meet specific customer requests and specialty grades that are differentiated from our competitors’ products.  During 2018, we had an estimated 8% share of worldwide TiO2 sales volume, and based on sales volume, we believe we are the leading seller of TiO2 in several countries, including Germany. 
 Our principal competitors are The Chemours Company, Cristal Global, Venator Materials PLC, Tronox Incorporated and Lomon Billions.  The top six TiO2 producers (i.e. we and our five principal competitors) account for approximately 58% of the world’s production capacity.  In 2017, one of Venator’s European sulfate plants, which has a capacity of 130,000 metric tons, operated at significantly reduced rates due to a fire at the facility.  In 2018, Venator announced that the facility would be permanently closed and production of approximately 45,000 tons of specialty and differentiated operating capacity would be restored at other sites.
 The following chart shows our estimate of worldwide production capacity in 2018: 
 
 
Worldwide production capacity - 2018
------------------------------------
Chemours | 16 | %
Cristal | 11 | %
Venator | 9 | %
Lomon Billions | 9 | %
Kronos | 7 | %
Tronox | 6 | %
Other | 42 | %

 Chemours has over one-half of total North American TiO2 production capacity and is our principal North American competitor.  In February 2017, Tronox announced a definitive agreement to acquire the TiO2 assets of Cristal Global, but this acquisition has been challenged by U.S. antitrust authorities and has not been completed, and it is uncertain whether it will be completed.  In 2018, Lomon Billions announced construction plans for an additional 200,000 tons of chloride capacity which is scheduled to come on line in 2019 and 2020.
 Over the past ten years, we and our competitors increased industry capacity through debottlenecking projects, which in part compensated for the shut-down of various TiO2 plants throughout the world.  Although overall industry demand is expected to increase in 2019, we do not expect any significant efforts, other than the Lomon Billions expansion mentioned above, will be undertaken by us or our principal competitors to further 
 10


increase capacity for the foreseeable future, other than through debottlenecking projects.  If actual developments differ from our expectations, the TiO2 industry’s and our performance could be unfavorably affected. 
 The TiO2 industry is characterized by high barriers to entry consisting of high capital costs, proprietary technology and significant lead times required to construct new facilities or to expand existing capacity.  We believe it is unlikely any new TiO2 plants will be constructed in Europe or North America in the foreseeable future. 
 Research and development 
 We employ scientists, chemists, process engineers and technicians who are engaged in research and development, process technology and quality assurance activities in Leverkusen, Germany.  These individuals have the responsibility for improving our chloride and sulfate production processes, improving product quality and strengthening our competitive position by developing new products and applications.  Our expenditures for these activities were approximately $13 million in 2016, $18 million in 2017 and $16 million in 2018.  We expect to spend approximately $17 million on research and development in 2019. 
 We continually seek to improve the quality of our grades and have been successful at developing new grades for existing and new applications to meet the needs of our customers and increase product life cycles.  Since the beginning of 2014, we have added nine new grades for pigments and other applications. 
 Patents, trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights 
 We have a comprehensive intellectual property protection strategy that includes obtaining, maintaining and enforcing our patents, primarily in the United States, Canada and Europe.  We also protect our trademark and trade secret rights and have entered into license agreements with third parties concerning various intellectual property matters.  We have also from time to time been involved in disputes over intellectual property. 
 Patents – We have obtained patents and have numerous patent applications pending that cover our products and the technology used in the manufacture of our products.  Our patent strategy is important to us and our continuing business activities.  In addition to maintaining our patent portfolio, we seek patent protection for our technical developments, principally in the United States, Canada and Europe.  U.S. patents are generally in effect for 20 years from the date of filing.  Our U.S. patent portfolio includes patents having remaining terms ranging from five years to 18 years. 
 Trademarks and trade secrets – Our trademarks, including KRONOS®, are covered by issued and/or pending registrations, including in Canada and the United States.  We protect the trademarks that we use in connection with the products we manufacture and sell and have developed goodwill in connection with our long-term use of our trademarks.  We conduct research activities in secret and we protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets through reasonable measures, including confidentiality agreements and security procedures, including data security.  We rely upon unpatented proprietary knowledge and continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position.  Our proprietary chloride production process is an important part of our technology and our business could be harmed if we fail to maintain confidentiality of our trade secrets used in this technology. 
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2018, we employed the following number of people: 
 
 
Europe | 1,805

Certain employees at each of our production facilities are organized by labor unions.  In Europe, our union employees are covered by master collective bargaining agreements for the chemical industry that are generally renewed annually.  In Canada, our union employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement that expires in June 2021.  At December 31, 2018, approximately 86% of our worldwide workforce is organized under collective bargaining agreements.  It is possible that there could be future work stoppages or other labor disruptions that could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial position or liquidity. 
 Regulatory and environmental matters 
 Our operations and properties are governed by various environmental laws and regulations which are complex, change frequently and have tended to become stricter over time.  These environmental laws govern, among other things, the generation, storage, handling, use and transportation of hazardous materials; the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground, air or water; and the health and safety of our employees.  Certain of our operations are, or have been, engaged in the generation, storage, handling, manufacture or use of substances or compounds that may be considered toxic or hazardous within the meaning of applicable environmental laws and regulations.  As with other companies engaged in similar businesses, certain of our past and current operations and products have the potential to cause environmental or other damage.  We have implemented and continue to implement various policies and programs in an effort to minimize these risks.  Our policy is to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations at all our facilities and to strive to improve our environmental performance.  It is possible that future developments, such as stricter requirements in environmental laws and enforcement policies, could adversely affect our operations, including production, handling, use, storage, transportation, sale or disposal of hazardous or toxic substances or require us to make capital and other expenditures to comply, and could adversely affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations or liquidity. 
 Our U.S. manufacturing operations are governed by federal, state and local environmental and worker health and safety laws and regulations.  These include the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, or RCRA, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, as amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act, or CERCLA, as well as the state counterparts of these statutes.  Some of these laws hold current or previous owners or operators of real property liable for the costs of cleaning up contamination, even if these owners or operators did not know of, and were not responsible for, such contamination.  These laws also assess liability on any person who arranges for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances, regardless of whether the affected site is owned or operated by such person.  Although we have not incurred and do not currently anticipate any material liabilities in connection with such environmental laws, we may be required to make expenditures for environmental remediation in the future. 
 While the laws regulating operations of industrial facilities in Europe vary from country to country, a common regulatory framework is provided by the European Union, or the EU.  Germany and Belgium are members of the EU and follow its initiatives.  Norway is not a member but generally patterns its environmental regulatory actions after those of the EU. 
 At our sulfate plant facilities in Germany, we recycle spent sulfuric acid either through contracts with third parties or at our own facilities.  In addition, at our German locations we have a contract with a third-party to treat certain sulfate-process effluents.  At our Norwegian plant, we ship spent acid to a third-party location where it is used as a neutralization agent.  These contracts may be terminated by either party after giving three or four years advance notice, depending on the contract. 
 From time to time, our facilities may be subject to environmental regulatory enforcement under U.S. and non-U.S. statutes.  Typically we establish compliance programs to resolve these matters.  Occasionally, we may pay penalties.  To date, such penalties have not involved amounts having a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity.  We believe that all of our facilities are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws. 
 From time to time, new environmental, health and safety regulations are passed or proposed in the countries in which we operate or sell our products, seeking to regulate our operations or to restrict, limit or classify TiO2.  We believe that we are in substantial compliance with laws applicable to the regulation of TiO2.  However,

increased regulatory scrutiny could affect consumer perception of TiO2 or limit the marketability and demand for TiO2 or products containing TiO2 and increase our regulatory and compliance costs.
 Our capital expenditures related to ongoing environmental compliance, protection and improvement programs, including capital expenditures which are primarily focused on increasing operating efficiency but also result in improved environmental protection such as lower emissions from our manufacturing facilities, were $17.1 million in 2018 and are currently expected to be approximately $25 million in 2019.
