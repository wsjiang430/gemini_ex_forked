Item 1. Business
General



OptimizeRx is a digital health technology company enabling care-focused engagement between life sciences organizations, healthcare providers, and patients at critical junctures throughout the patient care journey. Connecting over 60% of U.S. healthcare providers and millions of their patients through an intelligent technology platform embedded within a proprietary point-of-care network, OptimizeRx helps patients start and stay on their medications.



We are a Nevada corporation organized in September 2008. We conduct our operations through our wholly-owned subsidiaries, OptimizeRx Corporation, a Michigan corporation, CareSpeak Communications, Inc., a New Jersey corporation, CareSpeak Communications, D.O.O., a controlled foreign corporation incorporated in Croatia, and Cyberdiet, a controlled foreign corporation incorporated in Israel.


We employ a “land and expand” strategy focused on growing our existing client base and generating greater and more consistent revenues in part through the continued shift in our business model toward enterprise level engagements, while also broadening our platform with innovative proprietary solutions such as our TelaRep™ virtual communication solution and our AI-powered real-world evidence solution which uses sophisticated proprietary algorithms.

Industry Background


Life sciences organizations face a challenging commercial landscape. In recent years, they have met increased competition, shrinking market sizes, and inconsistent access to patients and healthcare professionals - their most important customers. The majority of new drug approvals, 81%, are specialty medications, leading to more complex diagnosis criteria, increased utilization management by healthcare payors, and lengthy wait times for patients to begin treatment once care decisions are made.




As a result, life sciences organizations have increasingly turned to technology solutions to support their commercial strategies. Spending on digital solutions to facilitate greater access to their end markets accounts for one-third of their collective $30bn commercial spend in the United States (U.S.).


We believe significant opportunity exists to address the unmet needs of life sciences organizations as they relate to digital solutions, including omni-channel access to health care professionals, for complex commercial challenges.

Principal Solutions



Historically, we primarily facilitated financial messages to health care providers via their EHR and ePrescribe systems using the OptimizeRx proprietary network to solve the ever-increasing communication barriers between pharmaceutical representatives and healthcare providers. Over time, as the demand for communication of an increasing variety of different health information between life science companies, providers, and patients has risen, our platform has expanded to encompass additional solutions that enable healthcare providers to access information for patients at the point of care. These solutions include evidence-based physician engagement, point of care banner messaging, social network banner messaging, institutional account-based banner messaging, innovative patient engagement services, and various accelerators to the therapy initiation workflow.



Our principal solutions can be summarized as follows:



Evidence-Based Physician Engagement – Our evidence-based physician engagement solution uses predictive analytics via machine learning methods applied to real-world data (RWD) to assist healthcare providers (HCPs) in identifying patients who may be qualified for specific therapies, raise awareness of patient access pathways, and identify early indicators of non-adherence among patient populations. This RWD-enabled solution translates into better support for providers as they look to make the best treatment decisions for their patients. This solution has a “patient-first” focus, helping manufacturers identify which HCPs to engage by first identifying if they currently care for qualified patients, based on where they are in their care journey and disease state. These Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) models provide our clients with the most relevant targets and fuel the deployment of programs across our other solutions.
Point of Care Banner Messaging – Our point of care banner messaging solution is utilized to deliver a variety of awareness (brand, therapeutic support, affordability, HUB, and patient support program) and messaging within the clinical workflow which can be tailored to meet the needs of each brand.
Social Network Banner Messaging – This past year we expanded to provide exclusive access to deliver banner messaging to HCPs within their social network apps. With extensive reach and granular reporting, this solution both expands the ability to reach more prescribers while adding to the mind share we can capture throughout a care delivery day. Given these messages are targeted to specific HCPs, many of the same awareness messages offered on the point of care banner solution are offered here as well.

Institutional Account-based Banner Messaging – Our Institutional Account-based Banner Messaging solution provides our clients access to delivering banner messaging online and on the intranets of targeted health system accounts. This allows our clients to capture additional mind share while also reaching other prescribers and support staff at key health systems or integrated delivery networks (IDNs).
Financial Messaging – Our Financial Messaging solution has been enhanced by Patient Support Messaging at the point-of-care. This solution provides prescribers visibility to branded copay offers and other patient support programs directly within their EHR and/or e-Prescribe system(s). It allows them to print, digitally send directly to patients via SMS, and/or digitally send copay offer details electronically to the dispensing pharmacy. Our solution addresses the fact that many healthcare systems and prescribers are looking for an easier, more effective way to increase affordable access and adherence to their prescribed branded medications.
Patient Engagement – Our technology solution provides digital messaging services through our cloud-based Mobile Health Messenger (“MHM”) Platform. We provide interactive health messaging for improved medication adherence and care coordination. Our HIPAA-compliant, automated, mobile messaging platform allows pharmaceutical manufactures and related entities to directly engage with patients to improve regimen compliance.
Therapy Initiation Workflow – The therapy initiation workflow is a group of digital solutions focused on accelerating patient access to treatments where time-consuming medical documentation is required of HCPs prior to pharmacies dispensing prescribed drugs. These solutions support the fast-growing area of specialty medications. This technology enhancement allows life sciences companies to simplify therapy initiation by presenting HCPs with a fully electronic option synchronizing enrollment, benefits verification, prior authorization, and patient support onboarding.
Sales and Marketing


We employ a sales team of over 19 people, marketing our solutions to new and existing clients. Our sales team drives awareness of the increased value of our technology stack as an enterprise platform, enhanced this year by the addition of the social channel, and momentum of our institutional/account-based banner message solutions offering. Accordingly, our sales efforts are not directed merely at selling individual solutions, but more broadly towards selling enterprise platform engagements with access to our full set of solutions across our network.




Our sales and marketing organizations work closely together to cultivate customer relationships. We use a number of methods to market and promote our solutions, including digital advertising, industry events, trade shows, conferences, media coverage, social media and email. We released a physician survey of 100 physicians across five specialties, detailing the specialty landscape as it pertains to prescribing pain points specialists experience. Additionally, we hosted our third annual Innovate4Outcomes event, partnering with Melinta Therapeutics, bringing individuals together across healthcare verticals, including HCPs, commercial manufacturer representatives, and health tech. The event focused on applying design thinking principles to contributing factors to Anti-Microbial Resistance, and was independently covered in end-of-year trade publications for the first time.



Technology



To support our growth and provide maximum security, scalability, and flexibility, all of our systems, including from acquisitions, are now hosted and integrated in the cloud. Our technology development and systems management core team is in the U.S. and in Croatia, with contractors in India and Ukraine to provide bench depth, rich skills experience, and business economies. The teams are organized into Centers of Excellence focused on Product Domains, Quality Assurance, Information Security, Data Warehousing and Business Intelligence, Platform Services, and Internal Systems Support.



Systems enhancements in 2022 included upgrades and documentation of processes and procedures and security implementation for ongoing Sarbanes Oxley, HIPAA, and customer assessments, and in achieving Enterprise HITRUST Certification, as well as for other needs.

Competition



Our platforms face competition from numerous other companies, both in attracting users and in generating revenue from advertisers and sponsors. We compete for users with online services and websites that provide savings on medications and healthcare products. Our messaging offerings compete for pharmaceutical budgets with a variety of other forms of advertising and promotion.



Our platforms compete broadly in the highly competitive pharmaceutical and life sciences digital marketing industry that is dominated by large well-known companies with established names, solid market niches, wide arrays of product offerings and marketing networks. Many of our competitors have greater financial, technical, product development, marketing and other resources than we do. These companies may be better known than we are and have more customers or users than we do. As a result, many of these companies may respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and standards and changes in customer requirements. These companies may be able to invest more resources in research and development, strategic acquisitions, and sales and marketing. The primary direct competitor in our financial messaging solution is ConnectiveRx. We generally compete on the basis of several factors, including size of our network, quality of our service, our ability to target specific customer needs, and to a lesser extent, price. For more information on risks relating to our competition, see Item 1A. Risk Factors.



Intellectual Property



We own patents important to our business, and we expect to continue to file patent applications to protect our research and development investments in new products. As of December 31, 2022 we held 3 patents and several pending patent applications, including foreign counterpart patents and foreign applications. For the United States, patents may last 20 years from the date of the patent’s filing, depending upon term adjustments made by the patent office.



In addition, we hold trademarks in the United States and other countries. As of December 31, 2022, OPTIMIZERx, OPTIMIZEMD, CareSpeak, DIETWATCH, Innovate4Outcomes, SPRx, SPx and TELAREP are our registered trademarks. We also have several pending trademark applications.



We also have licenses to intellectual property for the use and sale of certain of our solutions. In addition, we obtain other intellectual property rights and/or licenses used in connection with our business when practical and appropriate. Historically, we have created intellectual property or obtained intellectual property through commercial relationships and in connection with acquisitions.



Government Regulation



The healthcare industry and, in particular, our customers and partners are subject to U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those governing fraud, abuse, privacy and security. Many of these laws and regulations are complicated and how they might apply to us, our customers, our partners, or the specific services and relationships we have with our customers and partners are not always well-defined. Our failure, or perceived failure, to accurately apply, or comply with, these laws and regulations could subject us to significant fines and liability, result in reputational harm, and adversely affect our business. Any new or amended laws or regulations that impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements may negatively impact our business. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for more information on the impact of Government Regulations on OptimizeRx.
Employees



As of December 31, 2022, we had 94 full-time employees in the U.S, as well as 15 full-time employees in Croatia, and 1 part-time employee. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or collective bargaining agreement with respect to their employment with us. The majority of our employees work remotely and are geographically distributed across the United States and Croatia. We supplement our workforce with contractors in the United States and internationally on an as-needed basis. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good and have not experienced any work stoppages.We are dedicated to maintaining an environment where everyone feels valued, and we celebrate both the differences and similarities among our people. We also believe that diversity in all areas, including cultural background, experience and thought, is essential in making our Company stronger. Our Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Committee (DE&I) is actively engaged in improving our culture, hiring practices and education. In 2022, we endeavored to uphold the Parity Pledge – a commitment made in 2021 to interview and consider at least one qualified woman and underrepresented minority for every open role, VP or higher. In addition, the DE&I Committee sponsored quarterly events in 2022, including “Celebrate Women’s History”, “Celebrate Diversity Month”, and “Hot One’s Trivia Show.”

We prioritize recruiting, retaining, and incentivizing a highly qualified, diverse workforce. We pay our employees competitively and offer a broad range of company-paid benefits, which we believe are competitive with others in our industry. Moreover, we believe our long-term incentives are structured in a manner to provide time-based vesting schedules that are retentive and we incentivize selected employees through the granting of stock-based awards for and cash-based performance bonus awards.



We have increased our focus on training and development for our current employees. We offer learning and development opportunities and other resources to support our employees in achieving and enhancing their development objectives. We equip our managers with the skills and tools to provide ongoing coaching and feedback so employees can maximize their performance and potential, delivering success for the company and the employee.
