Item 1. | Business.

OVERVIEW
AngioDynamics, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, "AngioDynamics," the "Company," "we," "our" or "us") designs, manufactures and sells a wide range of medical, surgical and diagnostic devices used by professional healthcare providers for the treatment of peripheral vascular disease, vascular access and for use in oncology and surgical settings. Our devices are generally used in minimally invasive, image-guided procedures.
HISTORY
AngioDynamics was founded in Queensbury, N.Y., U.S., in 1988. Queensbury was chosen due to its location in the heart of "Catheter Valley," an area in New York's Adirondack Region named for its long history of catheter and other medical device manufacturing. Initially dedicated to the research and development of products used in interventional radiology, AngioDynamics began manufacturing and shipping product in the early 1990s. The Company soon became well established as a producer of diagnostic catheters for non-coronary angiography and thrombolytic delivery systems.
The Company grew over the following years as a result of acquisitions of companies including RITA Medical Systems in January 2007, Oncobionic in May 2008, Vortex Medical, Inc. in October 2012, Clinical Devices in August 2013, the assets of Diomed in June 2008 and the assets of Microsulis Medical Limited in January 2013. These acquisitions added product lines including market-leading ablation and NanoKnife systems, vascular access products, angiographic products and accessories, dialysis products, drainage products, thrombolytic products, embolization products, venous products and targeted renal therapy products. In May 2012, AngioDynamics acquired Navilyst Medical, bringing market-leading Fluid Management systems into our portfolio. The acquisition significantly expanded the Company's scale, doubling its share of the vascular access market while building critical mass in the peripheral vascular market.
In August 2018, the Company acquired the BioSentry product line from Surgical Specialties, LLC. In September 2018, the Company acquired RadiaDyne, which consisted of the OARtrac dose monitoring technology along with endorectal and vaginal balloons. 
On May 31, 2019, the Company completed the sale of the Fluid Management business (the “Divestiture”) and all of the assets used primarily in connection with the Fluid Management business to Medline Industries, Inc. (“Medline”) pursuant to an asset purchase agreement dated April 17, 2019 (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”). 
Headquartered in Latham, N.Y., with manufacturing primarily out of the Queensbury facility, AngioDynamics is publicly traded on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the symbol ANGO.
PRODUCTS
Our product offerings fall within three Global Business Units (GBUs): Oncology/Surgery ("OS"), Vascular Interventions and Therapies ("VIT") and Vascular Access ("VA"). All products discussed below have been cleared for sale in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration ("FDA"). International regulatory clearances vary by product and jurisdiction. 
Oncology/Surgery Products
AngioDynamics offers a range of comprehensive ablation technologies, including thermal tissue ablation systems (microwave energy and radiofrequency energy), surgical resection and the NanoKnife System, an innovative alternative to thermal ablation.

IRE Ablation 
NanoKnife®
The NanoKnife® System is an alternative to traditional thermal ablation that has received 510(k) clearance from the Food and Drug Administration for the surgical ablation of soft tissue. The NanoKnife Ablation System utilizes low energy direct current electrical pulses to permanently open pores in target cell membranes. These permanent pores or nano-scale defects in the cell membranes result in cell death. The treated tissue is then removed by the body’s natural processes in a matter of weeks, mimicking natural cell death. Unlike other ablation technologies, NanoKnife Ablation System does not achieve tissue ablation using thermal energy.



The NanoKnife Ablation System consists of two major components: a Low Energy Direct Current, or LEDC Generator and needle-like electrode probes. Up to six (6) electrode probes can be placed into or around the targeted soft tissue. Once the probes are in place, the user enters the appropriate parameters for voltage, number of pulses, interval between pulses, and the pulse length into the generator user interface. The generator then delivers a series of short electric pulses between each electrode probe. The energy delivery is hyperechoic and can be monitored under real-time ultrasound.
Microwave Ablation 
Solero Microwave Tissue Ablation (MTA) System
The Solero MTA System features the Solero Microwave (MW) Generator and the specially designed Solero MW Applicators. The solid state Solero MW Generator with a 2.45 GHz operating frequency can power up to 140W for optimized power delivery and fast ablations. The Solero MW Applicator’s optimized ceramic tip diffuses MW energy nearly spherically, and its patented cooling channel with thermocouple provides real-time monitoring to help protect non-targeted tissue during the ablation. In addition, the Solero MTA System offers physicians scalability with a single applicator designed for multiple, predictable ablation volumes by varying time and wattage. Solero is a single applicator system able to complete up to a 5 cm ablation in six (6) minutes at maximum power. 



The Solero MTA System and Accessories are indicated in the U.S. for the ablation of soft tissue during open procedures. The Solero MTA System is not intended for cardiac use.
Radiofrequency Ablation 
StarBurst Radiofrequency Ablation Devices
Radiofrequency Ablation (RFA) products use radiofrequency energy to provide a minimally invasive approach to ablating solid cancerous or benign tumors. Our StarBurst Radiofrequency Ablation devices deliver radiofrequency energy to raise the temperature of cells above 45-50°C, causing cellular death. The physician inserts the disposable needle electrode device into the targeted body tissue, typically under ultrasound, CT or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) guidance. 
During the procedure, our system automatically adjusts the amount of energy delivered in order to maintain the temperature necessary to ablate the targeted tissue. For a typical 5 cm ablation using our StarBurst ® Xli-enhanced disposable device, the ablation process takes approximately ten minutes. The RFA system consists of a radiofrequency generator and a family of disposable devices.

In addition to thermal ablation systems and NanoKnife, AngioDynamics also offers Habib 4X Surgical Resection devices that are used in minimally invasive laparoscopic surgery procedures in surgical specialties such as Hepato-Biliary, GI, Surgical Oncology, Transplant Surgery and Urology (Partial Nephrectomy Resections). It is clinically indicated to assist in coagulation of tissue during intraoperative and laparoscopic procedures.
BioSentry Tract Sealant System


 The BioSentry tract sealant system deploys a self-expanding hydrogel plug into the pleural space following a percutaneous lung biopsy, creating an airtight seal that closes the pleural puncture. Depth markings provide accurate and consistent placement based on CT-guided measurements, while depth adjustment wheel and locking mechanisms ensure proper plug deployment. 
The hydrogel plug is made from a synthetic tissue-friendly polymer that fully reabsorbs into the body and the co-axial adapter mates with a coaxial needle to ensure a proper fit and delivery of the plug.
The BioSentry Tract Sealant System is indicated for sealing pleural punctures to significantly reduce the risk of pneumothoraxes (air leaks) associated with percutaneous, transthoracic needle lung biopsies and to provide accuracy in marking a biopsy location for visualization during surgical resection. 
IsoLoc Endorectal Balloon


The IsoLoc Endorectal Balloon's unique, customer-driven design is the result of collaborations with Radiation Oncologists, Therapists and Physicists with one goal in mind - to create a new standard for endorectal balloons (ERB) in the oncology space. 
The design of IsoLoc not only addresses patient comfort, but also simplifies three challenging clinical scenarios that many physicians face when using radiation therapy for and/or in relation to the prostate. First, it's gas-release tip removes rectal gas and reduces prostate motion for gaseous patients. Secondly, the structure of the ERB aids in defining the anatomy for difficult planning scenarios with post-radical patients. Lastly, IsoLoc repositions and lifts the bowel in patients that have a low-lying bowel. 
Alatus Vaginal Balloon Packing System


Alatus was developed with the patient's comfort in mind and to assist the physician to move healthy tissue away from the radiation treatment field. Prior to Alatus, the clinician would push gauze into the vagina to move the bladder and bowel away from the radiation treatment field. Inserting gauze into the vagina can be uncomfortable before treatment and unpleasant at the end of treatment as it tends to dry out before removing. 
Studies have shown, relative to traditional gauze packing, Alatus offers a more comfortable procedure for the patient, reduces the need for post-procedural pain medication and moves healthy tissue away from the radiation field. 
OARtrac
The OARtrac system provides real-time dose data physically delivered during many cancer treatments, thus allowing physicians to know the delivered dose. The dose information obtained during the treatment is compared with the planned dose that the Radiation Oncologist expected to provide the patient. The OARtrac System itself does not stop the radiation treatment, or change the radiation delivery, but provides dose data which the Radiation Oncologist can use to adjust a patient's treatment plan. 
 Vascular Interventions and Therapies Products


AngioDynamics’ Vascular Interventions and Therapies product offerings support the medical areas of Venous Insufficiency, Thrombus Management, Peripheral Products (Core) and Fluid Management, which was divested on May 31, 2019.
Thrombus Management
Our Thrombus Management portfolio includes the proprietary AngioVac venous drainage cannula and circuit, as well as catheter directed thrombolytic devices and Uni-Fuse infusion catheters. AngioDynamics offers a range of options when treating thrombus and removing fresh, soft thrombi or emboli.
4

AngioVac
Our AngioVac venous drainage system includes a Venous Drainage Cannula and Extracorporeal Circuit. The cannula is indicated for use as a venous drainage cannula and for removal of fresh, soft thrombi or emboli during extracorporeal bypass. The cardiopulmonary bypass circuit is indicated for use in procedures requiring extracorporeal circulatory support for periods of up to six hours. AngioVac devices are for use with other manufacturers’ off-the-shelf pump, filter and reinfusion cannula, to facilitate venous drainage as part of an extracorporeal bypass procedure. 


The AngioVac venous drainage cannula is a 22 French coil-reinforced cannula designed with a balloon actuated, expandable funnel shaped distal tip. The proprietary funnel shaped tip enhances venous drainage flow when the balloon is inflated, prevents clogging of the cannula with commonly encountered undesirable intravascular material, and facilitates embolic removal of such extraneous material.
Thrombolytic Catheters
Thrombolytic catheters are used to deliver thrombolytic agents, which are drugs that dissolve blood clots in hemodialysis access grafts, arteries, veins and surgical bypass grafts. AngioDynamics’ Uni-Fuse infusion catheter features pressure response outlets, a patented, time-tested slit technology that provides a consistent, even distribution of fluid volume along the entire length of the infusion pattern, resulting in a 12-fold advantage over standard side-hole catheters.¹
We also offer the Pulse-Spray infusion system for high pressure, pulsed delivery of lytic agent to shorten treatment time, and the Speed Lyser infusion system built for dialysis grafts and fistulas.
Peripheral Products (Core)
We offer a comprehensive portfolio for minimally invasive peripheral products. Product categories include an extensive line of angiographic catheters and diagnostic and interventional guidewires, percutaneous drainage catheters and coaxial micro-introducer kits.
Angiographic Products and Accessories
Angiographic products and accessories are used during peripheral diagnostic and interventional procedures. These products permit physicians to reach targeted locations to deliver contrast media for visualization purposes and therapeutic agents and devices, such as percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) balloons. Angiographic products consist of angiographic catheters and guidewires.

Our angiographic catheter line includes the following brands, all with radiopaque tips to assure excellent visibility under fluoroscopy:

• | Soft-Vu flush catheters are available in flush and selective varieties. Flush catheters are used in procedures where a high flow of contrast is required for “big picture” diagnostics. Anomalies discovered through a flush angiogram may require further investigation into a vessel of interest. Soft-Vu selective catheters are used to gain access to smaller or more distal vessels and advance the catheter or wire into the diseased section. 


• | Accu-Vu sizing catheters feature radiopaque marker bands at the distal (farthest away) portion of the catheter to provide a highly accurate measurement of the patient’s anatomy. This enables precise measurement for interventional devices (stents, filters, etc.)


• | AngiOptic catheters have total catheter radiopacity, ensuring tip-to-hub visibility. This catheter is also constructed with a firm tip material that enhances stability during high-flow injections, providing excellent pushability.


• | Mariner catheters have a hydrophilic coating that, when combined with water, reduces friction. This makes insertion potentially easier and more comfortable for the patient, and can also be used for advancing through tortuous anatomy.

AngioDynamics guidewires include Nit-Vu (featuring a kink-resistant NiTi alloy core facilitating smooth navigation through tortuous vasculature and accurate wire control) and PTFE (Polytetrafluoroethylene) Coated (fixed core and movable core) diagnostic guidewires.
AngioDynamics catheters and guidewires are available in more than 500 tip configurations and lengths.
Drainage Products
Drainage products percutaneously drain abscesses and other fluid pockets. An abscess is a tender inflamed mass that typically must be drained by a physician. AngioDynamics offers two brands of drainage catheters for multi-purpose/general, nephrostomy and biliary drainage: Total Abscession and Exodus. Each offer features and benefits depending on case presentation and physician preferences.
Micro Access Kits
Our Micro Access sets provide interventional physicians a smaller introducer system for minimally-invasive procedures. Our Micro Access product line provides physicians with the means to choose from the wide selection of configurations, including guidewire, needle and introducer options. Two lines are available in stiff/standard, 10cm or 15cm and echogenic for visibility under ultrasound guidance: Micro Introducer Kit and Ministick Max.
Fluid Management 
Our Fluid Management product offerings include the NAMIC® Fluid Management portfolio. Since 1969, the NAMIC product line has been a leader in providing clinicians high quality, dependable devices that help in the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular and peripheral vascular disease. The NAMIC product line includes an extensive offering of manifolds, contrast management systems, closed fluid systems, guidewires, disposable transducers and interventional accessories. These devices are utilized together and allow clinicians to aspirate or inject contrast, saline, remove waste and monitor invasive blood pressures throughout the procedure. This business was divested on May 31, 2019.
Venous Insufficiency
VenaCure EVLT laser system
Our VenaCure EVLT (endovenous laser treatment) system products are used in endovascular laser procedures to treat superficial venous disease (varicose veins). Superficial venous disease is a malfunction of one or more valves in the leg veins whereby blood refluxes or does not return to the heart, thereby pooling in the legs and leading to symptoms such as pain, swelling and ulcerations. VenaCure EVLT uses laser energy to stop the reflux by ablating (collapsing and destroying) the affected vein. Blood is then re-routed to other healthy veins.


6

The procedure is minimally invasive and generally takes less than an hour, allowing the patient to quickly return to normal activities with minimal post-operative pain. 
VenaCure EVLT is sold as a system that includes diode laser hardware and procedure kits which include disposable laser fiber components, an access sheath, access wires and needles. Our VenaCure EVLT 1470 nanometer wavelength laser allows physicians to more efficiently heat the vein wall using lower power settings thereby reducing the risk of collateral damage. The NeverTouch tip fiber eliminates laser tip contact with the vein wall, which in turn minimizes perforations of the vein wall that typically result in less pain and bruising as compared to traditional bare-tip fibers. The NeverTouch tip also maximizes ultrasonic visibility, making it easier for physicians to use. Procedure kits are available in a variety of lengths and configurations to accommodate varied patient anatomies.
The VenaCure EVLT system comes with a comprehensive physician training program and extensive marketing support.
Asclera (polidocanol) Injection
Asclera (polidocanol) injection is the only FDA-approved sclerosant with an indication to treat uncomplicated spider veins and uncomplicated reticular veins in the lower extremity. AngioDynamics distributes Asclera through a global agreement with the manufacturer and their distributor. The agreement to sell the Asclera product was terminated in April 2019. 
Vascular Access Products
Our portfolio of Vascular Access products includes a broad offering of peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs), midline catheters, implantable ports, dialysis catheters and related accessories and supplies. These products are used to deliver, primarily, short-term drug therapies, such as chemotherapeutic agents and antibiotics, into the central venous system. Delivery to the circulatory system allows drugs to mix with a large volume of blood as compared to intravenous drug delivery into a superficial vessel. Our Vascular Access product family also includes the proprietary BioFlo catheter.
BioFlo®
AngioDynamics offers BioFlo, the only catheter on the market with Endexo Technology, a material more resistant to thrombus accumulation, in vitro (based on platelet count). Endexo Technology is a permanent and non-eluting polymer that is “blended” into the polyurethane from which the catheter is made. It is present throughout the catheter, including the extraluminal, intraluminal and cut catheter surface of the tip. Endexo Technology remains present for the life of the catheter. BioFlo’s long-term durability and efficacy is intended to provide clinicians a high degree of safety and confidence in providing better patient care and improved patient outcomes. BioFlo catheters are available across the Vascular Access family of products, including PICCs, midlines, ports and dialysis catheters.




PICCs
A peripherally inserted central catheter, or PICC, is a long thin catheter that is inserted into a peripheral vein, typically in the upper arm, and advanced until the catheter tip terminates in a large vein in the chest near the heart to obtain intravenous access. PICCs can typically be used for prolonged periods of time and provide an alternative to central venous catheters. Our PICC product offerings include:

• | BioFlo® PICC: Our BioFlo line is the only power injectable PICC available that incorporates Endexo Technology into the manufacturing and design of the catheter. Advanced features such as large lumen diameters allow the BioFlo® PICC to deliver the power injection flow rates required for contrast-enhanced Computed Tomography (CT) scans compatible with up to 325 psi CT injections.


• | BioFlo® Midline: The BioFlo Midline Catheter is an effective solution to preserving a patient’s peripheral access. It provides a cost-effective alternative to multiple IV site rotations for patients who need short-term venous access.


• | Xcela PICC: The Xcela® PICC line is designed to provide a high degree of safety, ease and confidence in patient care. Advanced features such as large lumen diameters allow the Xcela® PICC to deliver the power injection flow rates required for contrast-enhanced CTs compatible with up to 325 psi CT injections.

• | PASV® Valve Technology: The PASV® Valve Technology is available in both BioFlo and Xcela lines and is designed to automatically resist backflow and reduce blood reflux that could lead to catheter-related complications.

Ports 
Ports are implantable devices utilized for the central venous administration of a variety of medical therapies and for blood sampling and diagnostic purposes. Central venous access facilitates a more systemic delivery of treatment agents, while mitigating certain harsh side effects of certain treatment protocols and eliminating the need for repeated access to peripheral veins. Depending upon needle gauge size and the port size, a port can be utilized for up to approximately 2,000 accesses once implanted in the body. Our ports are used primarily in systemic or regional short- and long-term cancer treatment protocols that require frequent infusions of highly concentrated or toxic medications (such as chemotherapy agents, antibiotics or analgesics) and frequent blood samplings. Our port products and accessories include:

• | BioFlo® Port: Our BioFlo Port is the only port available that features a catheter with Endexo Technology. Advanced features of the BioFlo Port include multiple profile and catheter options, a large septum area for ease of access and the ability to administer contrast through a CT injection for purposes of imaging.


• | SmartPort®: The Smart Port power-injectable port with Vortex technology offers the ability for a clinician to access a vein for both the delivery of medications or fluids and for administering power-injected contrast to perform a (CT) scan. The ability to access a port for power-injected contrast studies eliminates the need for additional needle sticks in the patient’s arm and wrist veins. Once implanted, repeated access to the bloodstream can be accomplished with greater ease and less discomfort. Our Smart Port is available in mini and low-profiles to accommodate more patient anatomies.


• | Vortex®: Our Vortex port technology line of ports is a clear-flow port technology that, we believe, revolutionized port design. With its rounded chamber, the Vortex port is designed to have no sludge-harboring corners or dead spaces. This product line consists of titanium, plastic and dual-lumen offerings.


• | PASV® Valve Technology: The PASV® Valve Technology is designed to automatically resist backflow and reduce blood reflux that could lead to catheter-related complications.


• | LifeGuard®: The LifeGuard Safety Infusion Set and The LifeGuard Vision are used to infuse our ports and complement our port and vascular access catheters. The needles’ low profile design is intended to allow clinicians to easily dress the site.

Dialysis Products
We market a complete line of dialysis products that provide short and long-term vascular access for dialysis patients. Dialysis, or cleaning of the blood, is necessary in conditions such as acute renal failure, chronic renal failure and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). We currently offer a variety of dialysis catheters, including:

• | BioFlo® DuraMax: Our BioFlo DuraMax is the only dialysis catheter with Endexo Technology. Advanced features of the BioFlo DuraMax dialysis catheter include large inner diameter lumens designed for long term patency, a proprietary guidewire lumen to facilitate catheter exchanges and Curved Tip Technology that allows the catheter to self-center in the Superior Vena Cava (SVC).


• | DuraMax®: The DuraMax catheter is a stepped-tip catheter designed to improve ease of use, dialysis efficiency and overall patient outcomes.

In addition, AngioDynamics also offers other renal therapies, including DuraFlow™ Chronic Hemodialysis Catheter, Schon Chronic Hemodialysis Catheter, EVENMORE Chronic Hemodialysis Catheter, EMBOSAFE™ Valved, Splitable Sheath Dilator and Perchik™ Button Suture Retention Device.
RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT 
Our growth depends in large part on the continuous introduction of new and innovative products, together with ongoing enhancements to our existing products. This happens through internal product development, technology licensing and strategic alliances. We recognize the importance of, and intend to continue to make investments in, research and development (R&D).
Our R&D teams work closely with our marketing teams, sales force and regulatory and compliance teams to incorporate customer feedback into our development and design process. We believe that we have a reputation among interventional physicians as a strong partner for developing high quality products because of our tradition of close physician collaboration, dedicated market focus, responsiveness and execution capabilities for product development and commercialization.

COMPETITION
We encounter significant competition across our product lines and in each market in which our products are sold. These markets are characterized by rapid change resulting from technological advances, scientific discoveries and changing customer needs and expectations. We face competitors, ranging from large manufacturers with multiple business lines, to small manufacturers that offer a limited selection of products.
Our primary device competitors include: Boston Scientific Corporation; Cook Medical; Medical Components, Inc. (Medcomp); TeleFlex Medical; BD Medical Technology; Smiths Medical, a subsidiary of Smiths Group plc; Medtronic; Merit Medical; Terumo Medical Corporation; Johnson and Johnson and Total Vein Systems.
We believe our products compete primarily based on their quality, clinical outcomes, ease of use, reliability, physician familiarity and cost-effectiveness. In the current environment of managed care, which is characterized by economically motivated buyers, consolidation among health care providers, increased competition and declining reimbursement rates, we have been increasingly required to compete on the basis of price. We believe that our continued competitive success will depend upon our ability to develop or acquire scientifically advanced technology, apply our technology cost-effectively across product lines and markets, attract and retain skilled personnel, obtain patent or other protection for our products, obtain required regulatory and reimbursement approvals, manufacture and successfully market our products either directly or through outside parties, and maintain sufficient inventory to meet customer demand.
SALES AND MARKETING
We sell our broad line of quality devices in the United States primarily through a direct sales force and internationally through a combination of direct sales and distributor relationships. We support our customers and sales organization with a marketing staff that includes product managers, customer service representatives and other marketing specialists. 
We focus our sales and marketing efforts on interventional radiologists, interventional cardiologists, vascular surgeons, urologists, interventional and surgical oncologists and critical care nurses. 
MANUFACTURING
We manufacture certain proprietary components and products and then assemble, inspect, test and package our finished products. By designing and manufacturing many of our products from raw materials, and assembling and testing our subassemblies and products, we believe that we are able to maintain better quality control, ensure compliance with applicable regulatory standards and our internal specifications, and limit outside access to our proprietary technology. We have custom-designed proprietary manufacturing and processing equipment and have developed proprietary enhancements for existing production machinery.
We own two primary manufacturing properties providing capabilities which include manufacturing, service, engineering and research, distribution warehouses and offices. These facilities are registered with the FDA and have been certified to ISO 13485 standards, as well as the CMD/CAS Canadian Medical Device Regulations. ISO 13485 is a quality system standard that satisfies European Union regulatory requirements, thus allowing us to market and sell our products in European Union countries. Our manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic inspections by regulatory authorities to ensure compliance with domestic and non-U.S. regulatory requirements. See “Government Regulation” section of this report for additional information. See Item 2 "Properties" for details on each manufacturing location.
In February 2017, we announced the consolidation of our global operations into two facilities located in New York State. Operations in our Denmead, U.K. and Manchester, GA. manufacturing facilities were consolidated into the Glens Falls and Queensbury, NY facilities during fiscal year 2018. On May 31, 2019, the Company completed the sale of the Fluid Management business which included one of the two Glens Falls, NY manufacturing facilities. As of June 1, 2019, the Company will manufacture most of its product from the Queensbury, NY facility and one small facility in Glens Falls, NY. 
BACKLOG
Historically, we ship the majority of products within 24-48 hours of receiving an order, and accordingly our backlog is not significant. 
 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
Patents, trademarks and other proprietary rights are very important to our business. We also rely upon trade secrets, manufacturing know-how, technological innovations and licensing opportunities to maintain and improve our competitive 
9

position. We regularly monitor and review third-party proprietary rights, including patents and patent applications, as available, to aid in the development of our intellectual property strategy, avoid infringement of third-party proprietary rights, and identify licensing opportunities.
The Company owns an extensive portfolio of patents and patent applications in the United States and in certain foreign countries. The portfolio also includes exclusive licenses to third party patents and applications.
Most of our products are sold under the AngioDynamics trade name or trademark. Additionally, products are sold under product trademarks and/or registered product trademarks owned by AngioDynamics, Inc., or an affiliate or subsidiary. Some products contain trademarks of companies other than AngioDynamics.
See Part I. Item 3 of this report for additional details on litigation regarding proprietary technology.
LITIGATION
We operate in an industry characterized by extensive patent litigation. Patent litigation can result in significant damage awards and injunctions that could prevent the manufacture and sale of affected products, or result in significant royalty payments in order to continue selling those products. The medical device industry is also susceptible to significant product liability claims. These claims may be brought by individuals seeking relief on their own behalf or purporting to represent a class. In addition, product liability claims may be asserted against us in the future based on events we are not aware of at the present time. At any given time, we are involved in a number of product liability actions. For additional information, see both Part I. Item 3 of this report and Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
GOVERNMENT REGULATION
The products we manufacture and market are subject to regulation by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and international regulations to our specific target markets.
United States FDA Regulation
Before a new medical device can be introduced into the market, a manufacturer generally must obtain marketing clearance or approval from the FDA through either a 510(k) submission (a premarket notification) or a premarket approval application (PMA).
The 510(k) procedure is available only in particular circumstances. The 510(k) clearance procedure is available only if a manufacturer can establish that its device is “substantially equivalent” in intended use and in safety and effectiveness to a “predicate device,” which is a legally marketed device with 510(k) clearance in class I or II or preamendment status based upon products commercially distributed on or before May 28, 1976. After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, requires a new 510(k) clearance. The 510(k) clearance procedure including questions and responses may take up to 12 months. In some cases, supporting clinical data may be required. The FDA may determine that a new or modified device is not substantially equivalent to a predicate device or may require that additional information, including clinical data, be submitted before a determination is made, either of which could significantly delay the introduction of new or modified device products. If a device cannot demonstrate substantial equivalence, it may be subject to either a de novo submission or a PMA.
The PMA application procedure is more comprehensive than the 510(k) procedure and typically takes more time to complete. The PMA application must be supported by scientific evidence providing pre-clinical and clinical data relating to the safety and efficacy of the device and must include other information about the device and its components, design, manufacturing and labeling. The FDA will approve a PMA application only if a reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended use can be provided. As part of the PMA application review, the FDA will inspect the manufacturer’s facilities for compliance with its Quality System Regulation, or QSR. As part of the PMA approval the FDA may place restrictions on the device, such as requiring additional patient follow-up for an indefinite period of time. If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA application or the manufacturing facility is not favorable, the FDA may deny approval of the PMA application or issue a “not approvable” letter. The FDA may also require additional clinical trials, which can delay the PMA approval process by several years. After the PMA is approved, if significant changes are made to a device, its manufacturing or labeling, a PMA supplement containing additional information must be filed for prior FDA approval.
Historically, our products have been introduced into the market using the 510(k) procedure.
The process of FDA submissions requires extensive and expensive validations and testing. The financial outlay for this is large and requires a significant amount of time. Recent changes in both regulations and FDA perspectives have increased both 
10

time and testing requirements, which have caused significant delays and increased costs for approvals. The parameters for increased testing have and will continue to cause severe delays. The increased focus by the FDA on such issues as chemical identification of all colorants, non-acceptance of certain colorants (certain forms of carbon black) and other concerns, continue to cause problems and delays. In addition, changes to existing products call into question previously approved devices and result in additional costs for testing and material analysis.
The devices manufactured by us are also subject to the QSR, which imposes elaborate testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures. Every phase of production, including raw materials, components and subassembly, manufacturing, testing, quality control, labeling, tracing of consignees after distribution and follow-up and reporting of complaint information is governed by the FDA’s QSR. Device manufacturers are required to register their facilities and list their products with the FDA and certain state agencies. The FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities and, if there are alleged violations, the operator of a facility must correct them or satisfactorily demonstrate the absence of the violations or face regulatory action. Penalties for failure to maintain compliance to the QSR include warning letters and potentially consent decrees. Failure to maintain the QSR appropriately could result in the development of further warning letters. In addition, non-compliance with applicable FDA requirements can result in, among other things, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, failure of the FDA to grant marketing approvals, withdrawal of marketing approvals, a recommendation by the FDA to disallow us to enter into government contracts, and criminal prosecutions. The FDA also has the authority to request repair, replacement or refund of the cost of any device manufactured or distributed by us.
Other U.S. Regulatory Bodies
We and our products are subject to a variety of state and local laws in those jurisdictions where our products are, or will be, marketed. We and our products are also subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws relating to matters such as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances. In addition, we are subject to various federal and state laws governing our relationships with the physicians and others who purchase or make referrals for our products. For instance, federal law prohibits payments of any form that are intended to induce a referral for any item payable under Medicare, Medicaid or any other federal healthcare program. Many states have similar laws. There can be no assurance that we will not be required to incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future, or that such laws or regulations will not have a material adverse effect upon our ability to do business.
International Regulation
Internationally, all of our current products are considered medical devices under applicable regulatory regimes, and we anticipate that this will be true for all of our future products. Sales of medical devices are subject to regulatory requirements in many countries. The regulatory review process may vary greatly from country to country. For example, the European Union has a dedicated set of regulations regarding medical devices, specifically regulating their design, manufacturing, clinical trials, labeling and adverse event reporting. Devices that comply with those requirements are entitled to bear a Conformité Européenne, or CE Mark, indicating that the device conforms to the essential requirements of the applicable directives and can be commercially distributed in countries that are members of the European Union. Similar regulations are in place for Canada, Japan, China and most other countries.
In some cases, we rely on our international distributors to obtain regulatory approvals, complete product registrations, comply with clinical trial requirements and complete those steps that are customarily taken in the applicable jurisdictions.
International sales of medical devices manufactured in the United States that are not approved or cleared by the FDA for use in the United States, or are banned or deviate from lawful performance standards, are subject to FDA export requirements. Before exporting such products to a foreign country, we must first comply with the FDA’s regulatory procedures for exporting unapproved devices.
The process of obtaining approval to distribute medical products is costly and time-consuming in virtually all the major markets where we sell medical devices. We cannot assure that any new medical devices we develop will be approved in a timely or cost-effective manner or approved at all. There can be no assurance that new laws or regulations regarding the release or sale of medical devices will not delay or prevent sale of our current or future products.

THIRD-PARTY REIMBURSEMENT AND ANTI-FRAUD AND CORRUPT PRACTICES REGULATION
United States
The delivery of our devices is subject to regulation by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and comparable state and non-U.S. agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of health care items and services. U.S. laws and regulations are imposed primarily in conjunction with the Medicare and Medicaid programs, as well as the government’s interest in regulating the quality and cost of health care. Foreign governments also impose regulations in conjunction with their health care reimbursement programs and the delivery of health care items and services.
U.S. federal health care laws apply when we or customers submit claims for items or services that are reimbursed under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federally-funded health care programs. The principal U.S. federal laws include: (1) the Anti-kickback Statute which prohibits offers to pay or receive remuneration of any kind for the purpose of including or rewarding referrals of items or services reimbursable by a federal health care program; (2) the False Claims Act which prohibits the submission of false or otherwise improper claims for payment to a federally-funded health care program, including claims resulting from a violation of the Anti-kickback Statute; (3) the Stark law which prohibits physicians from referring Medicare or Medicaid patients to a provider that bills these programs for the provision of certain designated health services if the physician (or a member of the physician’s immediate family) has a financial relationship with that provider; and (4) health care fraud statutes that prohibit false statements and improper claims to any third-party payer. There are often similar state false claims, anti-kickback, and anti-self-referral and insurance laws that apply to state-funded Medicaid and other health care programs and private third-party payers. In addition, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) can be used to prosecute companies in the U.S. for arrangements with physicians or other parties outside the U.S. if the physician or party is a government official of another country and the arrangement violates the law of that country.
International
Our success in international markets will depend largely upon the availability of reimbursement from the third-party payors through which healthcare providers are paid in those markets. Reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country. The main types of healthcare payment systems are government sponsored healthcare and private insurance. Reimbursement approval must be obtained individually in each country in which our products are marketed. Outside the U.S., we generally rely on our distributors to obtain reimbursement approval in the countries in which they will sell our products. There can be no assurance that reimbursement approvals will be received.
INSURANCE
Our product liability insurance coverage is limited to a maximum of $10 million per product liability claim and an annual aggregate policy limit of $10 million, subject to a self-insured retention of $500,000 per occurrence and $2 million in the aggregate. The policy covers, subject to policy conditions and exclusions, claims of bodily injury and property damage from any product sold or manufactured by us.
There is no assurance that this level of coverage is adequate. We may not be able to sustain or maintain this level of coverage and cannot assure you that adequate insurance coverage will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. A successful product liability claim or other claim, with respect to uninsured or underinsured liabilities, could have a material adverse effect on our business.
ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY
We are subject to federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations and policies governing the use, generation, manufacture, storage, air emission, effluent discharge, handling and disposal of certain hazardous and potentially hazardous substances used in connection with our operations. Our operations are also subject to laws and regulations related to occupational health and safety. We maintain safety, training and maintenance programs as part of our ongoing efforts to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. 
Although we believe that we have complied with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in all material respects and, to date, have not been required to take any action to correct any noncompliance, there can be no assurance that we will not be required to incur significant costs to comply with environmental regulations in the future.
