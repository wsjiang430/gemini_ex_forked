Item 1. Business
The following discussion of our business contains “forward-looking statements,” as discussed in “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Information” above. Our business, operations and financial condition are subject to various risks as set forth in Part I, Item 1A., ‘‘Risk Factors’’ below. The following information should be read in conjunction with the Risk Factors, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Company Overview
We are the largest and only national wholesale distributor of landscape supplies in the United States and have a growing presence in Canada. Our customers are primarily residential and commercial landscape professionals who specialize in the design, installation and maintenance of lawns, gardens, golf courses and other outdoor spaces. As of December 30, 2018, we had over 550 branch locations in 45 U.S. states and six Canadian provinces. Through our expansive North American network, we offer a comprehensive selection of more than 120,000 stock keeping units (“SKUs”) including irrigation supplies, fertilizer and control products (e.g., herbicides), landscape accessories, nursery goods, hardscapes (including paving, natural stone and blocks), outdoor lighting and ice melt products. We also provide value-added consultative services to complement our product offerings and to help our customers operate and grow their businesses. Our consultative services include assistance with irrigation network design, commercial project planning, generation of sales leads, marketing services and product support, as well as a series of technical and business management seminars that we call SiteOne University. 
Our typical customer is a private landscape contractor that operates in a single market. We interact regularly with our customers because of the recurring nature of landscape services and because most contractors buy products on an as-needed basis. We believe our high-touch customer service model strengthens relationships, builds loyalty and drives repeat business. In addition, our broad product portfolio, convenient branch locations and nationwide fleet of over 1,400 delivery vehicles position us well to meet the needs of our customers and ensure timely delivery of products. We source our products from approximately 3,000 suppliers, including the major irrigation equipment manufacturers, turf and ornamental fertilizer/chemical companies and a variety of suppliers who specialize in nursery goods, outdoor lighting, hardscapes and other landscape products. 
We have a balanced mix of sales across product categories, construction sectors and end markets. We derived approximately 56% of our 2018 Fiscal Year net sales from the residential construction sector, 30% from the commercial (including institutional) construction sector and 14% from the recreational and other construction sector. By end market, we derived approximately 41% of our 2018 Fiscal Year net sales from maintenance of residential, commercial and recreational properties. The recurring nature of landscape maintenance demand helps to provide stability in our financial performance across economic cycles. Fertilizer and control products are the primary products used in maintenance. The sale of products relating to new construction of homes, commercial buildings and recreational spaces accounted for approximately 40% of our 2018 Fiscal Year net sales. These products primarily include irrigation, nursery, hardscapes, outdoor lighting and landscape accessories. Approximately 19% of our 2018 Fiscal Year net sales were derived from sales of products for the repair and upgrade of existing landscapes. These sales benefit from increasing existing home sales, increasing home prices and rising consumer spending.

Net Sales for 2018 Fiscal Year
Our History

Our company was established in 2001 after Deere & Company (“Deere”) entered the wholesale landscape distribution market through the acquisitions of McGinnis Farms and Century Rain Aid in 2001, United Green Mark in 2005 and LESCO Inc. (“LESCO”) in 2007, each of which significantly expanded our geographic footprint and broadened our product portfolio. In December 2013, an affiliate (the “CD&R Investor”) of Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, LLC (“CD&R”) purchased a 60% interest in our company from Deere (“CD&R Acquisition”). On May 17, 2016, we completed the initial public offering (“IPO”) of our common stock in which Deere and the CD&R Investor were the sole sellers of our common stock to the public. On December 5, 2016, May 1, 2017 and July 26, 2017, we completed secondary offerings of our common stock in which Deere and CD&R Investor were the sole sellers.
Our Industry
Based on management’s estimates, we believe that our addressable market in North America for the wholesale distribution of landscape supplies represented approximately $19 billion in revenue in 2018. Growth in our industry is driven by a broad array of factors, including consumer spending, housing starts, existing home sales, home prices, commercial construction, repair and remodeling spending, and demographic trends. Within the wholesale landscape supply distribution industry, products sold for residential applications represent the largest construction sector, followed by the commercial and recreational and other sectors. Based on management estimates, we believe that nursery products represent the largest product category in the industry, with sales accounting for more than one-third of industry sales, followed by landscape accessories with approximately one-fifth of industry sales and each of control products, hardscapes, irrigation products and outdoor lighting, and fertilizer and other accounting for approximately one-tenth of industry sales.
The wholesale landscape supply distribution industry is highly fragmented, consisting primarily of regional private businesses that typically have a small geographic footprint, a limited product offering and limited supplier relationships. Wholesale landscape supply distributors primarily sell to landscape service firms, ranging from sole proprietorships to national enterprises. Landscape service firms include general landscape contractors and specialty landscape firms, such as lawn care, tree and foliage maintenance firms. Over the past decade, professional landscape contractors have increasingly offered additional products and services to meet their customers’ needs. These firms historically needed to make numerous trips to branches in various locations to source their products. Consequently, landscape professionals have come to value distribution partners who offer a larger variety of product categories and services, particularly given the recurring nature of landscape maintenance services.
Our Strategies
Key elements of our strategy are as follows:
Build Upon Strong Customer and Supplier Relationships to Expand Organically
Our national footprint and broad supplier relationships, combined with our regular interaction with a large and diverse customer base, make us an important link in the supply chain for landscape products. Our suppliers benefit from access to our more than 230,000 customers, a single point of contact for improved production planning and efficiency, and our ability to bring new product launches quickly to market on a national scale. We intend to continue to increase our size and scale in customer, geographic and product reach, which we believe will continue to benefit our supplier base. We will continue to work with new and existing suppliers to maintain the most comprehensive product offering for our customers at competitive prices and enhance our role as a critical player in the supply chain. 
4

Grow at the Local Level
The vast majority of our customers operate at a local level. We believe we can grow market share in our existing markets with limited capital investment by systematically executing local strategies to expand our customer base, increase the amount of our customers’ total spending with us, optimize our network of locations, coordinate multi-site deliveries, partner with strategic local suppliers, introduce new products and services, increase our share of underrepresented products in particular markets and improve sales force performance. We currently offer our full product line only in approximately 30% of the metropolitan statistical areas (“MSAs”) in the United States where we have a branch, and therefore believe we have the capacity to offer significantly more product lines and services in our geographic markets.
Pursue Value-Enhancing Strategic Acquisitions
Through recently completed acquisitions, we have added new markets in the United States and Canada, new product lines, talented associates and operational best practices. In addition, we increased our sales by introducing products from our existing portfolio to customers of newly acquired companies. We intend to continue pursuing strategic acquisitions to better serve our customers, grow our market share and enhance our local market leadership positions by taking advantage of our scale, operational experience and acquisition know-how to pursue and integrate attractive targets. In addition, we currently have branches in approximately 50% of the 381 U.S. MSAs and are focused on identifying and reviewing attractive new geographic markets for expansion through acquisitions. We will continue to apply a selective and disciplined acquisition strategy to maximize synergies obtained from enhanced sales and lower procurement and corporate costs.
Execute on Identified Operational Initiatives 
We continue to undertake operational initiatives, utilizing our scale to improve our profitability, enhance supply chain efficiency, strengthen our pricing and category management capabilities, streamline and refine our marketing process and invest in more sophisticated information technology systems and data analytics.  Additionally, we have commenced our e-Commerce initiative, to include the relaunch of our website and implementation of a business-to-business (B2B) e-Commerce platform. Although we are still in the early stages of these initiatives, they have already enhanced our customer service, contributed to improvement in our profitability, and we believe we will continue to benefit from these and other operational improvements.
Be the Employer of Choice
We believe our associates are the key drivers of our success, and we aim to recruit, train, promote and retain the most talented and success-driven personnel in the industry. Our size and scale enable us to offer structured training and career path opportunities for our associates, while at the area and branch level we have built a vibrant and entrepreneurial culture that rewards performance. We promote ongoing, open and honest communication with our associates to ensure mutual trust, engagement and performance improvement. We believe that high-performing local leaders coupled with creative, adaptable and engaged associates are critical to our success and to maintaining our competitive position, and we are committed to being the employer of choice in our industry.
Our Products and Services
Our comprehensive portfolio of landscape products consists of over 120,000 SKUs from approximately 3,000 suppliers. Our product portfolio includes irrigation, fertilizer and other, control products, landscape accessories, nursery goods, hardscapes and outdoor lighting products. Our customers value our product breadth and geographic reach, as well as our on-site expertise and consultative services. While pricing is important to our customers, availability, convenience and expertise are also important factors in their purchase decisions. In addition to other capabilities, our ability to offer the significant yard space and special equipment that items such as nursery goods and hardscapes require provides us with a competitive advantage over many competitors who offer a more limited selection of product categories.
See “Note 2. Revenue from Contracts with Customers” to our audited financial statements for information on our net sales in landscaping products (irrigation, nursery, hardscapes, outdoor lighting and landscape accessories) and agronomic and other products (fertilizer, control products, ice melt, equipment and other products).
Irrigation
Our irrigation products include controllers, valves, sprinkler heads and irrigation and drainage pipes. The market for irrigation products has historically provided stable growth and is driven primarily by new home construction and maintenance of existing irrigation systems. 
5

Fertilizer & Other
Our fertilizer and other products include fertilizer, grass seed and ice melt products. Fertilizer products are sold to the maintenance end market and accordingly are relatively stable through economic cycles.
Control Products
Our control products are specialty products that include herbicides, fungicides, rodenticides and other pesticides. Similar to fertilizer products, control products sales are strongly tied to the maintenance end market and accordingly are relatively stable through economic cycles. 
Landscape Accessories
Our landscape accessories products include mulches, soil amendments, tools and sod. Landscape accessories are typically sold in combination with other landscape supply products. As a result, sales of these accessories are often tied to sales of fertilizers and control products, as well as sales of nursery goods and hardscape products.
Nursery Goods
Our nursery goods include deciduous shrubs, evergreen shrubs and trees, ornamental trees, shade trees, both field grown and container-grown nursery stock, and hundreds of plant species and cultivars available in a number of heights and bloom colors. 
Outdoor Lighting
Our outdoor lighting products include accent lights, dark lights, path lights, up lights, down lights, wall lights and pool and aquatic area lighting. 
Hardscapes
Hardscapes include paving, natural stone, blocks and other durable materials. 
Proprietary Branded Products
In addition to distributing branded products of third parties, we offer products under our proprietary brands. Sales of LESCO®, SiteOne Green Tech® and Pro-Trade® together accounted for approximately 14% of our 2018 Fiscal Year net sales, the large majority of which is attributable to LESCO®.
LESCO®
LESCO® is a premium brand and maintains strong brand awareness with golf and professional landscape contractors.
Under the LESCO® brand, we offer formulations of fertilizer (liquid and granular), combination products (pesticides on a fertilizer carrier), control products (liquid and granular pesticides), specialty chemicals, turf seed, application equipment (engine powered and walk behind or other non-engine powered), paint, maintenance products like engine oil, windshield washer fluid, ice melt, trimmer line and soil tests. LESCO® products are sold through our branches and retail outlets such as The Home Depot, True Value and Ace Hardware.
SiteOne Green Tech®
We offer pre-packaged landscape and irrigation management solutions that are designed to help customers manage and conserve water under the SiteOne Green Tech® brand. The core SiteOne Green Tech® product lines include central irrigation control systems, solar assemblies, fertilizer injection systems, irrigation pumps and hand-held remote control equipment.
Pro-Trade®
In 2017, we launched a line of professional-grade LED lamps and lighting solutions under our Pro-Trade® brand.  The Pro-Trade® line of products is sold exclusively through our branches and currently includes lamps, brass and aluminum fixtures and transformers. We saw success with this product line in 2018.  We introduced an additional 11 products in 2018 and plan to expand our current offering into other categories in 2019 and beyond.

Services
We offer a variety of complementary, value-added services to support the sale of our products. We do not derive separate revenue for these services, but we believe they are an important differentiator in establishing our value proposition to our customers.
Product Knowledge and Technical Expertise
Consultative services provided by our local staff, many of whom are former landscape contractors or golf course superintendents, include product selection and support, assistance with design and implementation of landscape projects and potential sales leads for new business opportunities. Our SiteOne University program provides customers with access to substantive training and informational seminars that directly support the growth of their businesses. The program includes technical training, licensing, certifications and business management seminars. In addition, our product category experts provide technical knowledge on the features and benefits of products we provide as well as on job installation techniques.
Project Services
We partner with our customers by providing consultative services to help them save time, money and effort in bidding for new projects and for new landscape installations. Our regionally based project services teams specialize in quoting, estimating and completing sales for customers who compete in the commercial construction sector. Other services provided by our project services teams include specifications assistance and irrigation design.
Partners Program
We offer a loyalty program, our Partners Program, which had approximately 17,000 enrolled customers as of December 30, 2018 and provides business and personal rewards, access to business services at preferred rates and technical training and support. Reward points may be spent, for example, on credit on account, trips and special events, gift cards to major retailers and SiteOne University courses and educational events. Access to preferred rate business services includes, for example, payroll and select human resources services, cell phone services, office supplies, auto and fleet insurance and fuel rebates. For the 2018 Fiscal Year, Partners Program participants accounted for approximately 52% of our net sales.
Operational Structure
Our operational philosophy is to create local area teams and branch networks specifically designed to best meet our customers’ needs at the local market level, while supporting these teams with the resources of a large company delivered through regional and divisional management, including company-wide functions.
At the local market level, we organize our over 550 branches and approximately 345 outside sales representatives into 58 designated “areas” that each serve a defined geography, typically a large MSA or a combination of MSAs in close proximity. Area managers are responsible for organization and talent planning, branch operations, sales strategy and product delivery strategy. Area managers are supported by an area business manager responsible for executing the local market strategies and key initiatives to grow sales and profitability. 
We support our over 550 branches and 58 areas with regional management and company-wide functions providing: management of business performance; development and execution of local strategies; sharing of best practices; execution and integration of acquisitions; finance and accounting expertise (credit/collections, payables); category management and procurement; supply chain (planners, buyers); pricing strategies; marketing; and information technology. Our branches are integrated on a single technology platform, allowing us to leverage our full operational scale for procurement, inventory management, financial support, data analytics and performance reporting.
Our outside sales force is organized by geographic area. Each area maintains a number of outside sales representatives who drive sales growth on behalf of several branches across a variety of accounts from landscape contractors to municipal agencies. We also maintain a sales force of agronomic sales representatives who are focused on growing sales to the golf industry.
We have a national account sales organization which leads sales strategy and execution for our largest national and regional customers. The national sales team is organized around five different market verticals: landscape and grounds maintenance, golf, retail, international and environmental accounts. Each national account manager is responsible for a group of large accounts and coordinates our business with them both nationally and locally through our local sales representatives. National account managers negotiate national programs with our largest customers in order to increase our share of their business.

Distribution Network
We use two distribution models to offer a comprehensive selection of products and meet the needs of each local market.
Branches
Our branch network is the core of our operations and creates a valuable connection between our suppliers and our customers.  Of our approximately 3,000 suppliers, few are set up to serve the shipping needs of our customers as their supply chains are typically focused on bulk quantities shipped from only a few locations. In contrast, many of our customers often require comparatively small quantities of products from numerous suppliers to complete a typical project, making it unfeasible to source directly from those suppliers.  Our branch network provides significant value to our suppliers by maintaining local availability of core and complementary products in quantities our customers need.
The majority of our branches carry multiple product categories, but do not carry all of them. Branches that carry our full product lines combine our regular branch facilities with large 8-to-15 acre yards suitable for nursery goods and hardscape products. Yards are well-equipped to manage truckload-purchased landscape, nursery and hardscape products and can maintain a diverse variety of greenhouse and nursery plants. All locations offering nursery goods have water distribution systems to maintain inventories, and many of these locations have access to municipal water supply, wells or ponds.  Branches are strategically located near residential areas with convenient highway access. In-store merchandising displays are utilized to emphasize product features and seasonal promotions. We primarily lease 5,000 to 15,000 square foot facilities in both freestanding and multi-tenant buildings, with secured outside storage yards averaging from 10,000 to 20,000 square feet in some branches.
Direct Distribution
Our direct distribution business provides point-to-point logistics for bulk quantities of landscape products between suppliers and customers. Our direct distribution business provides customers with sourcing and logistics support services for inventory management and delivery, in many cases more economically than the producers might otherwise provide. We believe that producers view us not as competitors, but as providers of a valuable service, brokering these large orders through the use of our network. We typically do not maintain inventory for direct distribution but rather use our existing supplier relationships, marketing expertise and ordering and logistics infrastructure to serve this demand, requiring less working capital investment for these sales. Approximately 7% of our 2018 Fiscal Year net sales were from direct distribution.
Direct distribution is preferred for contractors with large projects, typically designed by professional landscape architects. Contractors work hand-in-hand with our outside sales and inside sales teams, including project planning support with material take-offs, product sourcing and bid preparation. Using our large vendor network, our associates arrange convenient direct shipments to jobs, coordinated and staged according to each phase of construction. This distribution channel primarily handles bulk nursery, agronomic, landscape and hardscape products.
Customers
Our customers are primarily residential and commercial landscape professionals who specialize in the design, installation and maintenance of lawns, gardens, golf courses and other outdoor spaces. Our customer base consists of more than 230,000 firms and individuals, with our top 10 customers collectively accounting for approximately 4% of our 2018 Fiscal Year net sales, with no single customer accounting for more than 2% of net sales. Small customers, with annual purchases of up to $25,000, made up 27% of our 2018 Fiscal Year net sales. Medium customers, with annual purchases between $25,000 and $150,000, made up 33% of our 2018 Fiscal Year net sales. Large customers, with annual purchases over $150,000, made up 40% of our 2018 Fiscal Year net sales. Some of our largest customers include BrightView, The Home Depot, Davey Tree Expert Company and TruGreen. Distribution of our LESCO® proprietary branded products on a wholesale basis to retailers represented less than 1% of our 2018 Fiscal Year net sales.
Suppliers
We source our products from approximately 3,000 suppliers, including the major irrigation equipment manufacturers, turf and ornamental fertilizer/chemical companies, and a variety of suppliers who specialize in nursery goods, outdoor lighting, hardscapes and other landscape products. Some of our largest suppliers include Hunter, Rain Bird, Toro, Oldcastle, Bayer, Syngenta, BASF, Dow AgroSciences, Vista and NDS. Purchases from our top 10 suppliers accounted for approximately 36% of total purchases for our 2018 Fiscal Year.
We generally procure our products through purchase orders rather than under long-term contracts with firm commitments. We work to develop strong relationships with a select group of suppliers that we target based on a number of factors, including brand and market recognition, price, quality, product support and service, service levels, delivery terms and their strategic positioning. We generally 
8

have annual supplier agreements, and while they typically do not provide for specific product pricing, many include volume-based financial incentives that we earn by meeting or exceeding target purchase volumes. Our ability to earn these volume-based incentives is an important factor in our financial results. In limited cases, we have entered into supply contracts with terms that exceed one year for the manufacture of our LESCO® branded fertilizer and some nursery goods and grass seed, which may require us to purchase products in the future.
Competition
The majority of our competition comes from other wholesale landscape supply distributors. Among wholesale distributors, we primarily compete against a small number of regional distributors and many small, local, privately-owned distributors. Some of our competitors carry several product categories, while others mainly focus on one product category such as irrigation, fertilizer/control, nursery goods or hardscapes. We are one of the only wholesale distributors which carries the full line of irrigation, fertilizer and other, control products, landscape accessories, nursery goods, hardscapes and outdoor lighting products.
We believe our top nine largest competitors include Ewing, Harrell’s, Horizon Distributors (a subsidiary of Pool Corporation), Winfield Solutions, BWI, Target Specialty Products, Howard Fertilizer and Chemical, BFG Supply and Central Turf & Irrigation Supply.
We believe smaller, regional or local competitors still comprise approximately 89% of the landscape supply industry based on 2018 net sales. The principal competitive factors in our business include, but are not limited to, location, availability of materials and supplies, technical product knowledge and expertise, advisory or other service capabilities, delivery capabilities, pricing of products and availability of credit.
Associates
As of December 30, 2018, we had approximately 4,300 associates, none of whom were affiliated with labor unions. We believe that we have good relations with our associates. Additionally, we believe that the training provided through our development programs and our entrepreneurial, performance-based culture provides significant benefits to our associates. Approximately 93% of our associates are employed on a full-time, year-round basis. Our associate count currently includes approximately 275 seasonal associates, who are temporarily employed due to the weather-dependent nature of our business. An associate is anyone employed by the Company.
Service Marks, Trademarks and Trade Names
We hold various trademark registrations, including SiteOne®, LESCO®,  and Pro-Trade®, which we consider important to our marketing activities. Generally, trademark rights have a perpetual life, provided that they are renewed on a timely basis and continue to be used properly as trademarks. We intend to maintain these trademark registrations and the other trademarks associated with our business so long as they remain valuable to our business. In addition, other than commercially available software licenses, we do not believe that any of our licenses for third-party intellectual property are material to our business, taken as a whole.
Weather Conditions and Seasonality
For a discussion regarding seasonality and weather, see Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Weather Conditions and Seasonality,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Regulatory Compliance
Government Regulations
We are subject to various federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations, compliance with which increases our operating costs, limits or restricts the products and services we provide or the methods by which we offer and sell those products and services or conduct our business and subjects us to the possibility of regulatory actions or proceedings. Noncompliance with these laws and regulations can subject us to fines or various forms of civil or criminal prosecution, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
These federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations include laws relating to consumer protection, wage and hour, deceptive trade practices, permitting and licensing, state contractor laws, workers’ safety, tax, healthcare reforms, collective bargaining and other labor matters, environmental and employee benefits.
9

Environmental, Health and Safety Matters
We are subject to numerous federal, state, provincial and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including laws that regulate the emission or discharge of materials into the environment, govern the use, handling, treatment, storage, disposal and management of hazardous substances and wastes, protect the health and safety of our associates and users of our products and impose liability for investigating and remediating, and damages resulting from, present and past releases of hazardous substances at sites we have ever owned, leased or operated or used as a disposal site.
In the United States, we are regulated under many environmental, health and safety laws, including the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, the Federal Environmental Pesticide Control Act, the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act and the Occupational Safety and Health Act, each as amended. Certain laws, such as those requiring the registration of herbicides and pesticides, and regulating their use, also involve the oversight of regulatory authorities and public health agencies. Although we strive to comply with such laws and have processes in place designed to achieve compliance, we may be unable to prevent violations of these or other laws from occurring. We could also incur significant investigation and clean-up costs for contamination at any currently or formerly owned or operated facilities, including LESCO’s manufacturing and blending facilities. See “Note 11. Commitments and Contingencies” to our audited consolidated financial statements.
In addition, we cannot predict the effect of possible future environmental, health or safety laws on our operations. Changes in, or new interpretations of, existing laws, regulations or enforcement policies, the discovery of previously unknown contamination, or the imposition of other environmental liabilities or obligations in the future, including obligations with respect to any potential health hazards of our products, may lead to additional compliance or other costs.
