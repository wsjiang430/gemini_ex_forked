ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
 
Unless otherwise specified, references to the “Company,” “Twin River,” “we,” “our” or “us” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Annual Report”) mean Twin River Worldwide Holdings, Inc. and all entities included in our consolidated financial statements along with Dover Downs Gaming & Entertainment, Inc. (“Dover Downs”), which became an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary on March 28, 2019. See the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report for information regarding our financial performance.
 
Overview
 
We are a Delaware corporation based in Lincoln, Rhode Island, and a multi-jurisdictional owner of gaming and racing facilities. We currently own and manage the Twin River Casino and Hotel (“Twin River Casino Hotel”) in Lincoln, Rhode Island which is our flagship property, the Tiverton Casino Hotel (“Tiverton Casino Hotel”), in Tiverton, Rhode Island, the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino (“Hard Rock Biloxi”) in Biloxi, Mississippi, Dover Downs Hotel, Casino and Raceway (“Dover Downs Hotel & Casino”) in Dover, Delaware, and the Arapahoe Park racetrack and Havana Park off-track betting (collectively, “Mile High USA”) in Aurora, Colorado. On September 1, 2018, we opened the Tiverton Casino Hotel following the closure of the Newport Grand Casino (“Newport Grand”) in August 2018. On March 28, 2019, we completed our merger with Dover Downs. As of March 28, 2019, our casinos had an aggregate of over 400,000 square feet of gaming space, approximately 8,500 slot machines, approximately 260 gaming tables, approximately 65 stadium gaming positions, approximately 40 dining establishments, 20 bars, three entertainment venues and approximately 1,200 hotel rooms.
Acquisitions
 
On July 10, 2014, we acquired 100% of the assets of Hard Rock Biloxi in a cash transaction for approximately $250.0 million. With the completion of the transaction, the Hard Rock Biloxi became a wholly-owned subsidiary and continues to operate as the Hard Rock Biloxi.
 
On July 14, 2015, we acquired Newport Grand for the agreed upon purchase price of $21.8 million, including net working capital. In November 2016, we received state and town referendum approval to terminate the existing Newport Grand gaming license and have a new gaming license issued to a new casino to be developed in Tiverton, Rhode Island.
 
On May 1, 2018, we sold the land and building related to Newport Grand to a third party for $10.2 million. We then leased back the Newport Grand land and building from May 1, 2018 until November 1, 2018 at which time we vacated the property. On August 28, 2018, Newport Grand was closed for operations, and Tiverton Casino Hotel was opened on September 1, 2018.
 
On January 29, 2019, we entered into a definitive agreement pursuant to which we have agreed to acquire a subsidiary of Affinity Gaming (“Affinity”) that owns Golden Gates, Golden Gulch and Mardi Gras, Affinity’s three casino properties in Black Hawk, Colorado. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including review by the Colorado Division of Gaming and approval by the Colorado Limited Gaming Control Commission, and is expected to close in early 2020.
 
On March 28, 2019, we completed our merger with Dover Downs, with Dover Downs becoming our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary (the “Merger”). As part of the Merger, Dover Downs shareholders received common stock of Twin River representing 7.225% of the equity of the combined company at closing. We expect to continue to operate the wholly-owned subsidiary as “Dover Downs Gaming & Entertainment, Inc.”
 
We seek to continue to grow our business by actively pursuing the acquisition and development of new gaming opportunities and reinvesting in our existing operations. In addition, we seek to increase revenues through enhancing the guest experience by providing popular games, restaurants, hotel accommodations, entertainment and other amenities in attractive surroundings with high-quality guest service.

Our Operating Structure
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had four operating segments: Twin River Casino Hotel, Hard Rock Biloxi, Tiverton Casino Hotel and Mile High USA, and two reportable segments, Rhode Island and Biloxi. Newport Grand, which represented an immaterial operating segment and operated up until its closing in August 2018, has been aggregated with Twin River Casino Hotel and Tiverton Casino Hotel to form the Rhode Island reportable segment. Our Biloxi reportable segment includes only Hard Rock Biloxi. We report Mile High USA, an immaterial operating segment, and shared services provided by our management subsidiary in the “Other” category. We anticipate that Dover Downs Hotel & Casino will operate as a separate operating segment and we are still evaluating the reporting segment structure inclusive of Dover Downs Hotel & Casino.
 
Our operations are all within the United States. See Note 15, “Segment Reporting” to our consolidated financial statements presented in Part II, Item 8 for additional information.
 
Properties
 
As of March 28, 2019, we own and operate five properties. We derive the majority of our net revenues from our gaming operations, which generated approximately 75% of net revenue in 2018 and 2017, and 73% of net revenue in 2016. Food and beverage revenue represent our next most significant revenue source, generating approximately 11% of net revenue in 2018 and 2017, and 13% of net revenue in 2016, respectively. Hotel revenue and other revenue each contributed less than 10% of net revenue during each year. All revenue figures do not include the impact of Dover Downs Hotel & Casino. Information relating to the location and general characteristics of our properties is provided in “Item 2. Properties.”
Intellectual Property
 
As of March 28, 2019, we own six trademarks and have four pending trademarks with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.
 
As part of our acquisition of the Hard Rock Biloxi in July 2014, Hard Rock Biloxi entered into an amendment to the existing license agreement with Hard Rock Hotel, Licensing, Inc., which provides for an initial term of 20 years through September 2025 and the option to renew for two successive ten-year terms. Under the license agreement, we have the exclusive right to use the “Hard Rock” brand name in connection with, and as it relates to, the Hard Rock Biloxi property for an annual fee.
Competition
 
The gaming industry is characterized by a high degree of competition among a large number of operators, including riverboat casinos, dockside casinos, land-based casinos, video lotteries, video gaming terminals at taverns in certain states, sweepstakes and poker machines not located in casinos, Native American gaming, emerging varieties of Internet and fantasy sports gaming, increased sports betting and other forms of gaming in the United States (“U.S.”). In a broader sense, our gaming operations face competition from many leisure and entertainment activities, including, for example: shopping, athletic events, television and movies, concerts and travel. Legalized gaming is currently permitted in various forms in different parts of the U.S., in several Canadian provinces and on many lands taken into trust for the benefit of certain Native Americans in the U.S. and First Nations in Canada. Other jurisdictions, including states near our current properties (such as Massachusetts and Connecticut), have legalized and expanded or have plans to license additional gaming facilities, video gaming terminals and other gaming offerings in the near future. In addition, more gaming jurisdictions could award additional gaming licenses or permit the expansion or relocation of existing gaming operations. New, relocated or expanded operations by other companies could increase competition for our gaming operations and could adversely affect us. Finally, the imposition of smoking bans and/or higher gaming tax rates in Mississippi, Colorado and Delaware, where a smoking ban already exists, would have a significant impact on our properties’ ability to compete with facilities in nearby jurisdictions.
 
Our racing operation at Arapahoe Park currently owns all of the off-track betting (“OTB”) licenses in Colorado. However, Arapahoe Park does face competition from advance deposit wagering, online wagering on horse racing and other forms of entertainment such as casino and online gaming. Additionally, for a number of years, there has been a general decline in the number of people attending and wagering on live horse races at North American racetracks due to a number of factors, including increased competition from other wagering and entertainment alternatives and unwillingness of customers to travel a significant distance to racetracks.

Various competitive properties have opened or will be opening in the future that may affect our flagship casino in Rhode Island. In November 2011, the Expanded Gaming Act was signed into law in Massachusetts, which allowed up to three commercial destination resort casinos located in three geographically diverse regions across the state and a single slots facility for one location statewide. In February 2014, the Massachusetts Gaming Commission (“MGC”) awarded the slots-only gaming license to Plainridge Park Casino in Plainville, Massachusetts, which opened in June 2015. In the third quarter of 2018, MGM Resorts International opened the $1.0 billion Springfield resort casino in Springfield, Massachusetts, and the $2.5 billion Encore Boston Harbor casino is scheduled to open in June 2019 in Everett, Massachusetts. We have taken various steps designed to increase our competitive position, including building a hotel adjacent to our Twin River Casino Hotel facility near Providence, Rhode Island, constructing a new facility in Tiverton, Rhode Island and obtaining regulatory approvals for changes in gaming operations designed to bolster our competitive position. There can be no assurance that these steps will be effective, or what the ultimate effect of this additional competition will be. Also, the Massachusetts law allows the MGC at its discretion to award one additional commercial casino license, limited to the southeast region of the Commonwealth. The MGC solicited public comment late in 2018 on this issue as it continues to evaluate whether to issue such license. Among other things, the regulatory agreement under which our Rhode Island properties operate (the “Regulatory Agreement”) prohibits us and our subsidiaries from owning, operating, managing, or providing gaming specific goods and services to any properties in Rhode Island (other than the Twin River Casino Hotel and Tiverton Casino Hotel), Massachusetts, Connecticut or New Hampshire, which may adversely affect growth and market opportunity in those states. Finally, construction of a tribal casino in Taunton, Massachusetts is currently on hold following a U.S. Department of the Interior ruling in September 2018 regarding the validity of the tribe’s land in trust taking. The tribe has initiated litigation challenging this decision in the U.S. District Court of Massachusetts. Further, companion Senate and House bills have been introduced in Congress that would award the land in trust to the tribe and prevent any further litigation, including pending cases, with regard to its status. The outcome of this litigation and the likelihood of the proposed legislation passing is inherently uncertain.
 
We also face gaming competition from the Mohegan Sun Casino & Resort and the Foxwoods Resort Casino, both in Connecticut, which are owned by the Mohegan Tribe and the Mashantucket Pequot Tribe, respectively. In addition, other federally recognized Native American tribes continue to pursue new gaming projects elsewhere in the northeastern United States.
 
In Delaware, we compete in local and regional markets with casinos, horse tracks and racinos. Many of our gaming competitors are in jurisdictions with a closer proximity to large population bases and with a lower tax burden. The introduction or expansion of gaming in neighboring jurisdictions, particularly Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, Washington, D.C., Pennsylvania or New Jersey, the proliferation of internet gaming or the legalization of additional gaming venues in Delaware, could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations. Delaware is surrounded by jurisdictions which permit slot machines and table games, such as Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland and West Virginia. In recent years, the mid-Atlantic region has experienced an unprecedented expansion in gaming venues and gaming offerings and many analysts believe that the market is showing signs of saturation, in part due to the fact that new gaming venues often result in a substantial loss of business for existing locations.
 
Additionally, groups seeking federal recognition as Native American tribes, as well as federally recognized Native American tribes, continue efforts to establish or expand casino gaming on reservation lands. Additional casino gaming operations in the northeastern United States may adversely affect our results of operations in this market. We are unable to predict whether changes in federal recognition rules or efforts by federally recognized Native American tribes or groups seeking federal recognition as Native American tribes will lead to the establishment of additional tribal casino gaming operations in the northeastern United States.
 
In addition, in May 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down as unconstitutional the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992, a federal statute enacted to stop the spread of state-sponsored sports gambling. This decision has the effect of lifting federal restrictions on sports wagering and leaves individual jurisdictions such as states to determine the legality of sports wagering. While new federal online gaming legislation has been introduced in Congress from time to time, there has been no federal legislative response to the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision.
 
As a result, Washington, D.C., Nevada, Delaware, Mississippi, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, West Virginia, New Mexico and Arkansas have passed legislation authorizing fixed-odds sports betting. Our Rhode Island, Delaware and Mississippi properties now offer sports wagering pursuant to state law in each case.
 
We may also face competition from other gaming facilities which are able to offer sports wagering services following the enactment of applicable legislation. A law authorizing sports betting in New York was enacted in 2013, but regulations to implement that law have yet to be promulgated, and a measure to allow for full-scale sports betting failed in June 2018. Numerous states that border our locations have pending or proposed legislation which would allow for sports betting, including Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maryland, Louisiana, Tennessee, Oklahoma and Kansas, each of which could adversely affect our financial results.

Government Regulation
 
General
 
The gaming and racing industries are highly regulated and we must maintain licenses and pay gaming taxes in each jurisdiction in which we operate in order to continue operations. Each of our facilities is subject to extensive regulation under the laws, rules and regulations of the jurisdiction where it is located. These laws, rules and regulations generally concern the responsibility, financial stability, integrity and character of the owners, managers and persons with financial interests in the gaming operations. Violations of laws or regulations in one jurisdiction could result in disciplinary action in that and other jurisdictions.
 
Gaming laws are generally based upon declarations of public policy designed to protect gaming consumers and the viability and integrity of the gaming industry. Gaming laws also may be designed to protect and maximize state and local tax revenues, as well as to enhance economic development and tourism. To accomplish these public policy goals, gaming laws establish stringent procedures to ensure that participants in the gaming industry meet certain standards of character and responsibility. Among other things, gaming laws require gaming industry participants to:
 

· | ensure that unsuitable individuals and organizations have no role in gaming operations;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | establish procedures designed to prevent cheating and fraudulent practices;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | establish and maintain anti-money laundering practices and procedures;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


· | establish and maintain responsible accounting practices and procedures;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | maintain effective controls over their financial practices, including establishing minimum procedures for internal fiscal affairs and the safeguarding of assets and revenues;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | maintain systems for reliable record keeping;
--+----------------------------------------------


· | file periodic reports with gaming regulators;
--+----------------------------------------------


· | establish programs to promote responsible gaming; and
--+------------------------------------------------------


· | enforce minimum age requirements.
--+----------------------------------



Typically, a state regulatory environment is established by statute and underlying regulations and is administered by one or more regulatory agencies with broad discretion to regulate the affairs of owners, managers and persons with financial interests in gaming operations. Among other things, gaming authorities in the various jurisdictions in which we conduct our business:
 

· | adopt rules and regulations under the implementing statutes;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


· | interpret and enforce gaming laws and regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------


· | impose disciplinary sanctions for violations, including fines and penalties;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | review the character and fitness of participants in gaming operations and make determinations regarding their suitability or qualification for licensure;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | grant licenses for participation in gaming operations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


· | collect and review reports and information submitted by participants in gaming operations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | in the case of Rhode Island, collect proceeds from our operations in Rhode Island and provide us with commissions based on such proceeds;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | review and approve certain transactions, which may include acquisitions or change-of-control transactions of gaming industry participants and securities offerings and debt transactions engaged in by such participants; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | establish and collect fees and taxes in jurisdictions where applicable.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Any change in the laws or regulations of a gaming jurisdiction could adversely affect our gaming operations.

Licensing and Suitability Determinations.
 
Gaming laws require us, and each of our subsidiaries engaged in gaming operations, certain of our directors, officers and employees, and in some cases, certain of our shareholders, to obtain licenses from gaming authorities. Licenses typically require a determination that the applicant qualifies or is suitable to hold the license. Gaming authorities have broad discretion in determining whether an applicant qualifies for licensing or should be deemed suitable. Criteria used in determining whether to grant or renew a license to conduct gaming operations, while varying among jurisdictions, generally include consideration of factors such as:

· | the character, honesty and integrity of the individual applicant;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the financial stability, integrity and responsibility of the entity applicant, including whether its operation is adequately capitalized in the state and whether it exhibits the ability to maintain adequate insurance levels; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the quality of the entity applicant’s casino facilities;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


· | the amount of revenue to be derived by the applicable state from the operation of the entity applicant’s casino; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the effect on competition and general impact on the community of the entity applicant’s casino or racing operations.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In evaluating individual applicants, gaming authorities consider the individual’s business experience and reputation for good character, the individual’s criminal history and the character of those with whom the individual associates.
 
Some gaming jurisdictions limit the number of licenses granted to operate casinos within the state, and some states limit the number of licenses granted to any one gaming operator. Licenses under gaming laws are generally not transferable without regulatory approval. Licenses in the jurisdictions in which we conduct gaming operations are granted for limited durations and require renewal from time to time. There can be no assurance that any of our licenses will be renewed. The failure to renew any of our licenses could adversely affect our gaming operations.
 
In addition to us and our direct and indirect subsidiaries engaged in gaming operations, gaming authorities may investigate any individual who has a material relationship to or material involvement with any of our entities to determine whether such individual is suitable or should be licensed. Our officers, directors and certain key employees must file applications with the gaming authorities and may be required to be licensed or to qualify or be found suitable in many jurisdictions. Gaming authorities may deny an application for licensing for any cause which they deem reasonable. Qualification and suitability determinations require submission of detailed personal and financial information followed by a thorough investigation. The applicant must pay all the costs of the investigation. Changes in licensed positions must be reported to gaming authorities and, in addition to their authority to deny an application for licensure, qualification or a finding of suitability, gaming authorities have jurisdiction to disapprove a change in a corporate position.
 
If one or more gaming authorities were to find that an officer, director or key employee fails to qualify or is unsuitable for licensing or unsuitable to continue having a relationship with us, we would be required to sever all relationships with such person. In addition, gaming authorities may require us to terminate the employment of any person who refuses to file appropriate applications.
 
Moreover, in many jurisdictions, certain of our stockholders may be required to undergo a suitability investigation similar to that described above. Many jurisdictions require any person who acquires beneficial ownership of more than a certain percentage of our voting securities, typically 5%, to report the acquisition to gaming authorities, and gaming authorities may require such holders to apply for qualification or a finding of suitability. Many gaming authorities, including those in Delaware and Rhode Island, however, allow an “institutional investor” to apply for a waiver or a reduced disclosure obligation. An “institutional investor” is generally defined as an investor acquiring and holding voting securities in the ordinary course of business as an institutional investor for passive investment purposes only, and not for the purpose of causing, directly or indirectly, the election of a member of our board of directors (the “Board”), any change in our corporate charter, bylaws, management, policies or operations, or those of any of our gaming affiliates, or the taking of any other action which gaming authorities find to be inconsistent with holding our voting securities for passive investment purposes only. Even if a waiver or reduced disclosure obligation is granted, an institutional investor generally may not take any action inconsistent with its status when the waiver was granted without once again becoming subject to the foregoing reporting and application obligations.
 
Generally, any person who fails or refuses to apply for a finding of suitability or a license within the prescribed period after being advised that it is required by gaming authorities may be denied a license or found unsuitable, as applicable. Under a shareholders agreement applicable prior to the Company’s listing and the Company’s bylaws, if a stockholder were to be found by an applicable gaming authority to be an unsuitable person, or if the Board were otherwise to determine that a stockholder is an unsuitable person under applicable gaming laws, then the Company may, subject to compliance with the bylaws, redeem such stockholder’s voting securities. In addition, in these circumstances, until such voting securities are owned by suitable stockholders, (1) the Company would not be required or permitted to pay any dividend, payment, distribution or interest with respect to such voting securities, (2) the unsuitable stockholder holder would not be entitled to exercise any voting rights in respect of such voting securities, (3) the Company would not pay any remuneration in any form to the holder of such voting securities (other than, if applicable, the redemption price for such securities), (4) no unsuitable person could continue as a manager, officer, partner or director of the Company, and (5) all other rights (including economic and voting rights) of such unsuitable persons in respect of the voting securities would be suspended.

Violations of Gaming Laws
 
If we or our subsidiaries violate applicable gaming laws, our gaming licenses could be limited, conditioned, suspended or revoked by gaming authorities, and we and any other persons involved could be subject to substantial fines. Further, a supervisor or conservator can be appointed by gaming authorities to conduct operations at our gaming properties, or in some jurisdictions, take title to our gaming assets in the jurisdiction, and under certain circumstances, earnings generated during such appointment could be forfeited to the applicable state or states. Furthermore, violations of laws in one jurisdiction could result in disciplinary action in other jurisdictions. As a result, violations by us of applicable gaming laws could adversely affect our gaming operations.
 
Some gaming jurisdictions prohibit certain types of political activity by a gaming licensee, its officers, directors and key people. A violation of such a prohibition may subject the offender to criminal and/or disciplinary action.
 
Reporting and Record-Keeping Requirements
 
We are required periodically to submit detailed financial and operating reports and furnish any other information about us or our subsidiaries which gaming authorities may require. Under federal law, we are required to record and submit detailed reports of currency transactions involving greater than $10,000 at our casinos, as well as any suspicious activity that may occur at such facilities. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in fines or cessation of operations. We are required to maintain a current stock ledger which may be examined by gaming authorities at any time. If any securities are held in trust by an agent or by a nominee, the record holder may be required to disclose the identity of the beneficial owner to gaming authorities. A failure to make such disclosure may be grounds for finding the record holder unsuitable. Gaming authorities may require certificates for our securities to bear a legend indicating that the securities are subject to specified gaming laws.
 
Review and Approval of Transactions
 
Substantially all material loans, leases, sales of securities and similar financing transactions by us and our subsidiaries must be reported to, and in some cases approved by, gaming authorities. Neither us nor any of our subsidiaries may make a public offering of securities without the prior approval of certain gaming authorities. Changes in control through merger, consolidation, stock or asset acquisitions, management or consulting agreements, or otherwise are subject to receipt of prior approval of gaming authorities. Entities seeking to acquire control of us or one of our subsidiaries must satisfy gaming authorities with respect to a variety of stringent standards prior to assuming control. Gaming authorities may also require controlling stockholders, officers, directors and other persons having a material relationship or involvement with the entity proposing to acquire control to be investigated and licensed as part of the approval process relating to the transaction.
 
Because of regulatory restrictions, our ability to grant a security interest in any of our gaming assets is limited and subject to receipt of prior approval by certain gaming authorities.
 
License Fees and Gaming Taxes
 
We pay substantial taxes in our jurisdictions, including some of the cities and towns in which our operations are conducted, in connection with our casino gaming operations, computed in various ways depending on the type of gaming or activity involved. Depending upon the particular fee or tax involved, these fees and taxes are payable with varying frequency. License fees and taxes are based upon such factors as:

· | a percentage of the gaming revenues received;
--+----------------------------------------------


· | the number of gaming devices and table games; and/or
--+-----------------------------------------------------


· | one-time fees payable upon the initial receipt of license and fees in connection with the renewal of license.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In some jurisdictions, gaming tax rates are graduated such that the tax rates increase as gaming revenue increases. Tax rates are subject to change, sometimes with little notice, and such changes could adversely affect our gaming operations.

-

 

In addition to taxes specifically unique to gaming, we are required to pay all other applicable taxes, such as income and property taxes.
 
Rhode Island Commissions
 
In Rhode Island, our gaming operations are subject to extensive regulation by the Rhode Island Department of Business Regulation and the Division of Lotteries of the Rhode Island Department of Revenue. Unlike other jurisdictions in which we operated in 2018, Rhode Island does not have a traditional tax on gaming operations. The state receives all of the gaming win that comes into our Rhode Island operations and then pays us a percentage of the gaming win. As a result, our revenue from Rhode Island operations reflects only the net amount we are paid of the total gaming win from our Rhode Island casinos. Delaware operates on a similar commission-type basis, and we are still evaluating how this will be accounted for at Dover Downs Hotel & Casino.
Operational Requirements
 
In our jurisdictions, we are subject to certain requirements and restrictions on how we must conduct our gaming operations.
 
Some gaming jurisdictions prohibit cash distributions from a gaming operation, except to allow for the payment of taxes, if the distribution would impair the financial viability of the gaming operation. Moreover, many jurisdictions require a gaming operation to maintain insurance and post bonds in amounts determined by their gaming authority.
 
In addition, our ability to conduct certain types of games, introduce new games or move existing games within our facilities may be restricted or subject to regulatory review and approval.
 
Racetracks
 
We conduct horse racing operations at our racetracks in Aurora, Colorado and Dover, Delaware and operate additional OTB locations throughout Colorado. Regulations governing our horse racing operation in Colorado and Delaware are administered separately from the regulations governing gaming operations, with separate licenses and license fee structures. The racing authorities responsible for regulating our racing operations have broad oversight authority, which may include: annually reviewing and granting racing licenses and racing dates, approving the opening and operation of OTB facilities, approving simulcasting activities, licensing all officers, directors, racing officials and certain other employees of a racing licensee, and approving certain contracts entered into by a racing licensee affecting racing, pari-mutuel wagering, account wagering and OTB operations.
The Regulatory Agreement
 
On July 1, 2016, certain of our subsidiaries, the Rhode Island Department of Business Regulation and the Division of Lotteries of the Rhode Island Department of Revenue entered into the Regulatory Agreement, which replaced an earlier regulatory agreement. The Regulatory Agreement sets forth certain requirements with respect to the Division of Lotteries of the Rhode Island Department of Revenue and the Rhode Island Department of Business Regulation’s regulatory oversight of us. The Regulatory Agreement restricts, among other things, our ability to amend or modify our credit agreement, to increase the principal amount of loans thereunder, to sell, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets, to create, incur, assume or permit to exist certain liens or to incur additional indebtedness or make certain distributions if certain requirements are not met. Unless waived, we must also limit a person from acquiring direct or indirect financial interest in any class of securities in Twin River to the extent such acquisitions would exceed ownership limitations imposed by Rhode Island regulations or entering into certain related-party transactions, except for limited situations with respect to stock repurchases by us. The Regulatory Agreement also provides affirmative obligations, including setting a minimum number of employees that we must employ in Rhode Island and providing the Rhode Island Department of Business Regulation and the Division of Lotteries of the Rhode Island Department of Revenue with periodic information updates about us. Among other things, the Regulatory Agreement prohibits us and our subsidiaries from owning, operating, managing or providing gaming specific goods and services to any properties in Rhode Island (other than Twin River Casino Hotel and Tiverton Casino Hotel), Massachusetts, Connecticut or New Hampshire. Termination of the Regulatory Agreement may be effected by the Rhode Island Department of Business Regulation and the Division of Lotteries of the Rhode Island Department of Revenue at any time acting in their sole discretion and in accordance with the laws of the State of Rhode Island. Termination may be effected by us if we are no longer involved in the ownership or management of the Lincoln or Tiverton facilities. A failure to comply with the provisions in the Regulatory Agreement could subject us to injunctive or monetary relief, payments to the Rhode Island regulatory agencies and ultimately the revocation or suspension of our licenses to operate in Rhode Island.

Delaware
 
Delaware law regulates the percentage of commission we are entitled to receive from our gaming activities at Dover Downs Hotel & Casino. Video lottery operations, sports wagering, table game and internet gaming operations are by statute operated and administered by the Director of the Delaware State Lottery Office (the “Lottery Director”) and Delaware’s Department of Safety and Homeland Security, Division of Gaming Enforcement.  Dover Downs is a Licensed Agent authorized to conduct these activities under the Delaware State Lottery Code. The Lottery Director has discretion to adopt such rules and regulations as the Lottery Director deems necessary or desirable for the efficient and economical operation and administration of the lottery.
 
We neither own nor lease the slot machines or computer systems used by Delaware in connection with our video lottery gaming operations.  The Lottery Director enters into contracts directly with the providers of the slot machines and computer systems and we are not a party to those negotiations.  Delaware purchases or leases all equipment and the Lottery Director licenses all technology providers, and we share in the expense.  Similarly, but at no expense to us, the Lottery Director enters into contracts directly with internet service providers. Our operations could be disrupted if a licensed technology provider violates its agreement with Delaware or ceases to be licensed for any reason.  Such an event would be outside of our control and could adversely affect our gaming revenues.
 
Our gaming license in Delaware allows for video lottery operations, sports wagering, table games and internet gaming operations.  Delaware gaming licenses do not have an expiration date. However, the Lottery Director may revoke or suspend the license of a Licensed Agent, such as ours, for “cause.”
 
In order to maintain our gaming license with the Delaware Lottery, we are required to maintain our license for harness horse racing with the Delaware Harness Racing Commission (“DHRC”) and must conduct a minimum of 80 live race days each racing season, subject to the availability of racing stock. We hold a license from the DHRC, through which we are authorized to hold harness race meetings on our premises, and to make, conduct and sell pools through the use of pari-mutuel machines or totalizators.  The license requires renewal on an annual basis.  DHRC may reject an application for a license for any cause which it deems sufficient, and the action of the DHRC is final.  Any license granted by the DHRC may also be subject to such reasonable rules and regulations as may be prescribed from time to time by the United States Trotting Association.
 
Mississippi
 
We are subject to the licensing and regulatory control of the Mississippi Gaming Commission, and are required to periodically submit detailed financial, operating and other reports to the Mississippi Gaming Commission and furnish any other information which the Mississippi Gaming Commission may require. If we are unable to satisfy the requirements of the Mississippi Act, we cannot own or operate gaming facilities in Mississippi. We are also required to periodically submit detailed financial, operating and other reports to the Mississippi Gaming Commission and the Mississippi Department of Revenue and to furnish any other information required thereby. With certain exceptions, no person may become a stockholder of, or receive any percentage of profits from, the casino licensees without first obtaining licenses and approvals from the Mississippi Gaming Commission.

We make our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, our Current Reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to these reports, available free of charge through our corporate website as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports are filed with, or furnished to, the SEC. In addition, our Code of Business Conduct, Corporate Governance Guidelines, and charters of the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, the Compliance Committee, and the Nominating and Governance Committee are available on our website, www.twinriverwwholdings.com.
