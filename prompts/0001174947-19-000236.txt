ITEM 1—BUSINESS
Company Overview
 Sturm, Ruger & Company, Inc. and Subsidiary (the “Company”) is principally engaged in the design, manufacture, and sale of firearms to domestic customers. Virtually all of the Company’s sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 were from the firearms segment, with approximately 1% from the castings segment. Export sales represent approximately 4% of firearms sales. The Company’s design and manufacturing operations are located in the United States and almost all product content is domestic.
 
The Company has been in business since 1949 and was incorporated in its present form under the laws of Delaware in 1969. The Company primarily offers products in three industry product categories – rifles, pistols, and revolvers. The Company’s firearms are sold through independent wholesale distributors, principally to the commercial sporting market.
 
The Company manufactures and sells investment castings made from steel alloys and metal injection molding (“MIM”) parts for internal use in the firearms segment and has minimal sales to outside customers. The castings and MIM parts sold to outside customers, either directly or through manufacturers’ representatives, represented approximately 1% of the Company’s total sales for the year ended December 31, 2018.
 
For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, net sales attributable to the Company's firearms operations were $490.6 million, $517.7 million and $658.4 million. The balance of the Company's net sales for the aforementioned periods was attributable to its castings operations.
 
Firearms Products
 The Company presently manufactures firearm products, under the “Ruger” name and trademark, in the following industry categories:
 

Rifles | | Revolvers
--------+------------------------+----------
· | Single-shot | · | Single-action
· | Autoloading | · | Double-action
· | Bolt-action | | 
· | Modern sporting | | 
Pistols | | | 
· | Rimfire autoloading | | 
· | Centerfire autoloading | | 

 
Most firearms are available in several models based upon caliber, finish, barrel length, and other features.

Rifles
 A rifle is a long gun with spiral grooves cut into the interior of the barrel to give the bullet a stabilizing spin after it leaves the barrel. Net sales of rifles by the Company accounted for $258.1 million, $243.0 million, and $264.9 million of total net sales for the years 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.
Pistols
 A pistol is a handgun in which the ammunition chamber is an integral part of the barrel and which typically is fed ammunition from a magazine contained in the grip. Net sales of pistols by the Company accounted for $144.3 million, $176.2 million, and $250.0 million of revenues for the years 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.
Revolvers
 A revolver is a handgun that has a cylinder that holds the ammunition in a series of chambers which are successively aligned with the barrel of the gun during each firing cycle. There are two general types of revolvers, single-action and double-action. To fire a single-action revolver, the hammer is pulled back to cock the gun and align the cylinder before the trigger is pulled. To fire a double-action revolver, a single trigger pull advances the cylinder and cocks and releases the hammer. Net sales of revolvers by the Company accounted for $63.3 million, $74.6 million, and $104.9 million of revenues for the years 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.
Accessories
 The Company also manufactures and sells accessories and replacement parts for its firearms. These sales accounted for $25.0 million, $23.9 million, and $38.6 million of total net sales for the years 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.
Castings Products
 Net sales attributable to the Company’s casting operations (excluding intercompany transactions) accounted for $5.0 million, $4.6 million, and $5.9 million, for 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. These sales represented approximately 1% of total net sales in each of these years.
Manufacturing
 
Firearms
 The Company produces one model of pistol, all of its revolvers and most of its rifles at the Newport, New Hampshire facility. Most of the Company’s pistols are produced at the Prescott, Arizona facility. Some rifle models and pistol models are produced at the Mayodan, North Carolina facility.
 
Many of the basic metal component parts of the firearms manufactured by the Company are produced by the Company's castings segment through processes known as precision investment casting. The Company also uses many MIM parts in its firearms. See "Manufacturing- Investment Castings and Metal Injected Moldings" below for a description of these processes. The Company believes that investment castings and MIM parts provide greater design flexibility and result in component parts which are generally close to their ultimate shape and, therefore, require less machining than processes requiring machining a solid billet of metal to obtain a part. 
  5

Through the use of investment castings and MIM parts, the Company endeavors to produce durable and less costly component parts for its firearms.
 
All assembly, inspection, and testing of firearms manufactured by the Company are performed at the Company's manufacturing facilities. Every firearm, including every chamber of every revolver manufactured by the Company, is test-fired prior to shipment.
 
Investment Castings and Metal Injection Moldings
 To produce a product by the investment casting method, a wax model of the part is created and coated (“invested”) with several layers of ceramic material. The shell is then heated to melt the interior wax, which is poured off, leaving a hollow mold. To cast the desired part, molten metal is poured into the mold and allowed to cool and solidify. The mold is then broken off to reveal a near net shape cast metal part.
 
Metal injection molding is a three part powder metallurgy process by which a feedstock consisting of finely powdered metal and binders is processed through injection molding, debinding, and sintering equipment to produce steel, stainless steel, and alloy parts of complex shape and geometry. This process allows for high volume production while eliminating many of the wastes of traditional metal working methods, yielding net shape and near net shape parts.
 
Marketing and Distribution
 
Firearms
 The Company's firearms are primarily marketed through a network of federally licensed, independent wholesale distributors who purchase the products directly from the Company. They resell to federally licensed, independent retail firearms dealers who in turn resell to legally authorized end users. All retail purchasers are subject to a point-of-sale background check by law enforcement. These end users include sportsmen, hunters, people interested in self-defense, law enforcement and other governmental organizations, and gun collectors. Each domestic distributor carries the entire line of firearms manufactured by the Company for the commercial market. Currently, 19 distributors service the domestic commercial market, with an additional 23 distributors servicing the domestic law enforcement market and 41 distributors servicing the export market.
 
In 2018, the Company’s largest customers and the percent of firearms sales they represented were as follows: Davidson’s-21%; Lipsey’s-20%; and Sports South-16%.
 
In 2017, the Company’s largest customers and the percent of firearms sales they represented were as follows: Davidson’s-21%; Lipsey’s-18%; Sports South-13%; and Jerry’s/Ellett Brothers-12%.
 
In 2016, the Company’s largest customers and the percent of firearms sales they represented were as follows: Davidson’s-19%; Lipsey’s-17%; Jerry’s/Ellett Brothers-15%; and Sports South-14%.

The Company employs 14 employees who service these distributors and call on retailers and law enforcement agencies. Because the ultimate demand for the Company's firearms comes from end users rather than from the independent wholesale distributors, the Company believes that the loss of any distributor would not have a material, long-term adverse effect on the Company, but may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial results for a particular period. The Company considers its relationships with its distributors to be satisfactory.
 
The Company also exports its firearms through a network of selected commercial distributors and directly to certain foreign customers, consisting primarily of law enforcement agencies and foreign governments. Foreign sales were less than 5% of the Company's consolidated net sales for each of the past three fiscal years.
 
The Company does not consider its overall firearms business to be predictably seasonal; however, orders of many models of firearms from the distributors tend to be stronger in the first quarter of the year and weaker in the third quarter of the year. This is due in part to the timing of the distributor show season, which occurs during the first quarter.
 
Investment Castings and Metal Injection Moldings
 The castings segment provides castings and MIM parts for the Company’s firearms segment. In addition, the castings segment produces some products for a number of customers in a variety of industries.
Competition
 
Firearms
 Competition in the firearms industry is intense and comes from both foreign and domestic manufacturers. While some of these competitors concentrate on a single industry product category such as rifles or pistols, several competitors manufacture products in all four industry categories (rifles, shotguns, pistols, and revolvers). The principal methods of competition in the industry are product innovation, quality, availability, brand, and price. The Company believes that it can compete effectively with all of its present competitors.
Investment Castings and Metal Injection Moldings
 There are a large number of investment castings and MIM manufacturers, both domestic and foreign, with which the Company competes. Competition varies based on the type of investment castings products and the end use of the product. Companies offering alternative methods of manufacturing such as wire electric discharge machining (EDM) and advancements in computer numeric controlled (CNC) machining also compete with the Company’s castings segment. Many of these competitors are larger corporations than the Company with substantially greater financial resources than the Company, which could affect the Company’s ability to compete with these competitors. The principal methods of competition in the industry are quality, price, and production lead time.
Employees
 
7

As of February 1, 2019, the Company employed approximately 1,830 full-time employees, approximately 28% of whom had at least ten years of service with the Company. From time to time, the Company uses temporary employees to supplement its workforce. As of February 1, 2019, the Company did not have any temporary employees.
 
None of the Company's employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement.
 
Research and Development
 
In 2018, 2017, and 2016, the Company spent approximately $8.5 million, $9.8 million, and $8.7 million, respectively, on research and development activities relating to new products and the improvement of existing products. As of February 1, 2019, the Company had approximately 70 employees whose primary responsibilities were research and development activities.
Patents and Trademarks
 
The Company owns various United States and foreign patents and trademarks which have been secured over a period of years and which expire at various times. It is the policy of the Company to apply for patents and trademarks whenever new products or processes deemed commercially valuable are developed or marketed by the Company. However, none of these patents and trademarks are considered to be fundamental to any important product or manufacturing process of the Company and, although the Company deems its patents and trademarks to be of value, it does not consider its business materially dependent on patent or trademark protection.
Environmental Matters
 
The Company is committed to achieving high standards of environmental quality and product safety, and strives to provide a safe and healthy workplace for its employees and others in the communities in which it operates. The Company has programs in place that monitor compliance with various environmental regulations. However, in the normal course of its manufacturing operations the Company is subject to governmental proceedings and orders pertaining to waste disposal, air emissions, and water discharges into the environment. These regulations are integrated into the Company’s manufacturing, assembly, and testing processes. The Company believes that it is generally in compliance with applicable environmental regulations and that the outcome of any environmental proceedings and orders will not have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the Company, but could have a material adverse effect on the financial results for a particular period.
