Item 1. Business
Company Overview
 
Research Solutions was incorporated in the State of Nevada on November 2, 2006, and is a publicly traded holding company with two wholly owned subsidiaries at June 30, 2019: Reprints Desk, Inc., a Delaware corporation and Reprints Desk Latin America S. de R.L. de C.V, an entity organized under the laws of Mexico.
 
We provide two service offerings to our customers: annual licenses that allow customers to access and utilize certain premium features of our cloud based software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) research intelligence platform (“Platforms”) and the transactional sale of published scientific, technical, and medical (“STM”) content managed, sourced and delivered through the Platform (“Transactions”). Platforms and Transactions are packaged as a single solution that enable life science and other research intensive organizations to speed up research and development activities with faster, single sourced access and management of content and data used throughout the intellectual property development lifecycle.
 
Platforms
 
Our cloud-based SaaS research intelligence platform consists of proprietary software and Internet-based interfaces sold to customers for an annual subscription fee. Legacy functionality allows customers to initiate orders, route orders for the lowest cost acquisition, manage transactions, obtain spend and usage reporting, automate authentication, and connect seamlessly to in-house and third-party software systems. Customers can also enhance the information resources they already own or license and collaborate around bibliographic information.
 
Additional functionality has recently been added to our Platform in the form of interactive app-like gadgets. An alternative to manual data filtering, identification and extraction, gadgets are designed to gather, augment, and extract data across a variety of formats, including bibliographic citations, tables of contents, RSS feeds, PDF files, XML feeds, and web content. We are rapidly developing new gadgets in order to build an ecosystem of gadgets. Together, these gadgets will provide researchers with an “all in one” toolkit, delivering efficiencies in core research workflows and knowledge creation processes.
 
Our Platform is deployed as a single, multi-tenant system across our entire customer base. Customers securely access the Platform through online web interfaces and via web service APIs that enable customers to leverage Platform features and functionality from within in-house and third-party software systems. The Platform can also be configured to satisfy a customer’s individual preferences. We leverage our Platform’s efficiencies in scalability, stability and development costs to fuel rapid innovation and competitive advantage.

Transactions
 
Our Platform provides our customers with a single source to the universe of published STM content that includes over 70 million existing STM articles and over one million newly published STM articles each year. STM content is sold to our customers on a transaction basis. Researchers and knowledge workers in life science and other research-intensive organizations generally require single copies of published STM journal articles for use in their research activities. These individuals are our primary users.
 
Our Platform allows customers to find and download digital versions of STM articles that are critical to their research. Customers submit orders for the articles they need which we source and electronically deliver to them generally in under an hour. This service is generally known in the industry as single article delivery or document delivery. We also obtain the necessary permission licenses from the content publisher or other rights holder so that our customer’s use complies with applicable copyright laws. We have arrangements with hundreds of content publishers that allow us to distribute their content. The majority of these publishers provide us with electronic access to their content, which allows us to electronically deliver single articles to our customers often in a matter of minutes.


Competitive Strengths
 
We believe that we possess the following competitive strengths:
 
Services and Technology
 
We have developed proprietary software, a sophisticated information logistics technology backbone, and Internet-based interfaces that allow customers to initiate orders for STM content, manage these transactions, obtain reporting, automate authentication, improve seamless connectivity to in-house and third-party software systems, and maximize the information resources they already own or license, as well as organize workgroups to collaborate around bibliographic information. We are focused on rapidly developing an ecosystem of new interactive app-like gadgets for researchers that will deliver time saving efficiencies in core research workflows and knowledge creation processes. We continually enhance the performance of our existing proprietary software and systems and develop and implement new technologies that expand the available methods of discovering, obtaining and managing content.
 
Our services are highly configurable to meet customers’ needs and provide a personalized yet turnkey solution that covers the full spectrum of customer requirements; from identifying and locating articles, to facilitating copyright compliance, maximizing information resources already owned, monitoring usage, and automating end-user authentication. Our services alleviate the need for our customers to develop internal systems or contact multiple content publishers in order to obtain the content that is critical to their research.
 
Experienced Management Team
 
Our management team has well over 100 years of experience satisfying customers across the information services and STM publishing and technology industries. We are led by CEO Peter Derycz, an innovator in the space for more many decades and earning many accolades along the way, including being nominated to the Pharma Voice 100 list of most inspiring people in the Pharmaceutical industry.
Customer Loyalty
 
The majority of our revenue comes from our loyal base of customers, indicative of our focus on customer satisfaction and quality. Since our inception we have ranked first overall and in every category for every Document Delivery Buyer Survey conducted by industry research and advisory firm Outsell, Inc.: customer satisfaction (depth and breadth of coverage, fair pricing, and ease of doing business) and loyalty (intention to renew or continue service, and willingness to recommend the service to others).
Industry Presence and Established Relationships
 
We have a well-established presence and a network of contacts with our customers (life science companies, academic institutions, and other research intensive organizations), STM publishing partners, and others in the information services space. We have existing arrangements with hundreds of content publishers that allow us to distribute their content.
Promotion
 
We employ a segment-focused marketing approach that focuses on traditional buyers such as corporate libraries as well as new types of non-library buyers across a variety of business functions, including those within research and development. In pursuit of growth, we invest in vertical integration and channel relationships to increase the value we provide to customers, extend our promotional reach, and decrease customer acquisition costs. We anticipate growth coming from cross-selling into our existing customer base, penetrating new market verticals, and generating market demand and preference from both existing and new customers. While we place emphasis on the life science market, with a focus on pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device customers, we are also penetrating the following markets: academic, aerospace, automotive, electronics, chemicals and food and agriculture.

Growth Strategy
 
Organic Growth
 
We seek to grow our customer base through targeted direct and channel promotions of our Platform to potential customers. This strategy for sales and marketing is supported by inbound marketing driven by educational content, innovative technological systems, competitive pricing and high quality service. We are also positioning our sales force to be able to better serve small and medium sized businesses that we consider to be largely underserved today.

In addition, we submit proposals to potential customers in response to requests for proposals, or “Request for Proposals” (RFPs). We are continually improving our operations and technology to ensure that they are capable of delivering proposed solutions and supporting future growth.
 
Acquisitions and Combinations
 
From time to time, and as opportunities arise, we may explore strategic acquisitions and combinations, including the acquisition of customer lists, that bring revenue, profitability, growth potential and additional technology, products, services, operations and/or geographic capabilities to our company.
International Expansion
 
We have expanded internationally through increased sales to companies located abroad, particularly in Europe and Japan. From time to time, and as opportunities arise, we may further expand internationally through partnerships or acquisitions.
Publisher Agreements
 
We have arrangements with all of the major STM content publishers and most of the smaller STM publishers that allow us to distribute their content, and we regularly advance new business opportunities such as rentals through amendments to existing agreements. In addition, we regularly contact publishers to negotiate additional publisher agreements. A typical publisher agreement would allow us to distribute the publisher’s content according to a negotiated price list, thereby eliminating the need to contact the publisher and obtain the rights for each individual order. The majority of these publishers provide us with electronic access to their content, which allows us to further expedite the delivery of single articles to our customers. In addition, we rely on a small number of content publishers for the majority of our content costs.
Company Services
 
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), ("ASC 606"). The underlying principle of ASC 606 is to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers at the amount expected to be collected. We adopted the guidance of ASC 606 on July 1, 2018. The implementation of ASC 606 had no impact on the consolidated financial statements and no cumulative effect adjustment was recognized.
 
Revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services are transferred to a customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. We derive our revenues from two sources: annual licenses that allow customers to access and utilize certain premium features of our cloud based SaaS research intelligence platform (“Platforms”) and the transactional sale of STM content managed, sourced and delivered through the Platform (“Transactions”).
 


We apply the following five steps in order to determine the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized as we fulfill our obligations under each of our agreements:



• | identify the contract with a customer;
--+---------------------------------------


• | identify the performance obligations in the contract;
--+------------------------------------------------------


• | determine the transaction price;
--+---------------------------------


• | allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | recognize revenue as the performance obligation is satisfied.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

Platforms 
 
We charge a subscription fee that allows customers to access and utilize certain premium features of our Platform. Revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the subscription agreement, which is typically one year, provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. Billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition are recorded as deferred revenue.
Transactions
 
We charge a transactional service fee for the electronic delivery of single articles, and a corresponding copyright fee for the permitted use of the content. We recognize revenue from single article delivery services upon delivery to the customer provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met.
Customers and Suppliers
 
There were no customers that accounted for greater than 10% of our revenue for the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018.
 
Approximately 39% and 38% of our content cost for the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, was derived from our three largest suppliers of content. Loss of any or all of these suppliers of content would significantly reduce our revenue, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We can provide no assurance that these suppliers of content will continue to supply us with content in the future.
Sales and Marketing
 
To efficiently acquire customers, we rely on marketing in close cooperation with value based selling to acquire new small, medium and large geographically-dispersed enterprises. The promotional mix of tactics we utilize includes: search engine optimization and digital marketing, educational content, advertising, events, direct response and integrated marketing campaigns, public relations and content publicity, thought leadership programs, channel alliances training, and analyst relations. In addition, we focus on customer retention, which, we believe, increases total lifetime customer value and generates referrals for new business.Competition
 
The markets in which we compete are highly competitive. The primary methods of competition in our industry are price, service, technology and niche focus. Competition based on price is often successful in the short-term, but can limit the ability of a supplier to provide adequate service levels. Competition based on service and/or technology requires significant investment in systems and that investment requires time to produce results. Niche operators focus on narrow activities, but cannot aggregate sufficient content, technology and services to satisfy broad customer needs. We believe that many customers and potential customers are less price sensitive if the service levels are high and the technology creates efficiency and/or management information that has not been available previously.
 
Our competition includes:
 

· | Gadget –Like Toolkit Providers – We consider the rapidly increasing number of companies that are focused on specialized toolkits for researchers as competition. These include: Accelrys, Benchling, ChemAxon, Comsol Multiphysics, Genomenom, Main GCl, Workbench, Molsoft, and SnapGene. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Reference Management Applications – We expect to increasingly compete with tools that exist in the marketplace that are used to aid in organizing references, storing personal content assets, and prepare scholarly papers for submission to congresses and journals. 
· | Piracy - Perhaps, our most serious competitor. Many entities use content for commercial purposes without complying with applicable copyright laws, and paying the required copyright to the content publisher. As information becomes more readily available, the opportunity for piracy increases. 
· | STM Single Article Delivery Vendors and Content Aggregators - Our primary competitors for global, full-service single article delivery services are Copyright Clearance Center, regional interlibrary loan networks throughout the world such as those owned and operated by OCLC, and numerous national libraries located outside of the United States. 
· | Customer In-House Services - While single article delivery services are challenging for our customers to provide in-house, many existing and potential customers manage these services internally. 
· | Publisher In-House Capabilities - Some large publishers have developed in-house capabilities to service the content re-use market, however, many of them neglect other content repurposing opportunities and may not be able to aggregate content from other publishers.
