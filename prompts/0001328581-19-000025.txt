ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Boise Cascade is a large, vertically-integrated wood products manufacturer and building materials distributor with widespread operations throughout the United States (U.S.) and one manufacturing facility in Canada. As used in this Form 10-K, the terms "Boise Cascade," "we," and "our" refer to Boise Cascade Company and its consolidated subsidiaries. We are one of the largest producers of engineered wood products (EWP) and plywood in North America and a leading U.S. wholesale distributor of building products. Our broad line of products is used primarily in new residential construction, residential repair-and-remodeling projects, light commercial construction, and industrial applications. We have a broad base of more than 4,500 customers, which includes a diverse mix of retail lumberyards, home improvement centers, leading wholesalers, specialty distributors, and industrial converters. We believe our large, vertically-integrated operations provide us with significant advantages over less integrated competitors and position us to optimally serve our customers. Our operations began on October 29, 2004, when we acquired the forest products assets of OfficeMax, Incorporated. We completed an initial public offering of our common stock on February 11, 2013.
Our Industry
              The building products manufacturing and distribution industry in North America is highly competitive, with a number of producers manufacturing and selling a broad range of products. Demand for our products is principally influenced by new residential construction, residential repair-and-remodeling activity, and light commercial construction in the U.S. Drivers of new residential construction, residential repair-and-remodeling activity, and light commercial construction include new household formation, the age of the housing stock, availability of credit and other macroeconomic factors, such as GDP growth, population growth and migration, interest rates, employment, and consumer sentiment. Purchasing decisions made by the customers who buy our products are generally based on price, quality, availability, and customer service.
Segments
We operate our business using two reportable segments: Wood Products and Building Materials Distribution. We present information pertaining to our segments, including product sales, customer concentration, and the geographic areas in which we operate, in Note 17, Segment Information, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Form 10-K.

Wood Products 
Products
 We manufacture laminated veneer lumber (LVL), I-joists, and laminated beams, which are collectively referred to as EWP. LVL and laminated beams are structural products used in applications where extra strength and consistent quality are required, such as headers and beams. LVL is also used in the manufacture of I-joists, which are assembled by combining a vertical web of oriented strand board (OSB) with top and bottom LVL or solid wood flanges. I-joists, which are used primarily in residential and commercial flooring and roofing systems and other structural applications, are stronger, lighter, and straighter than conventional lumber joists. In addition, we manufacture structural, appearance, and industrial plywood panels.
In November 2018, we sold two lumber mills and a particleboard plant located in Northeast Oregon, consistent with our strategy to focus on veneer-based manufacturing. As a result, we no longer produce particleboard and have limited lumber production. In December 2018, we committed to sell a hardwood plywood facility located in Moncure, North Carolina (the Moncure Sale), and subsequently entered into a definitive sale agreement in January 2019. The Moncure Sale is expected to close in first quarter 2019. For additional information, see Note 7, Sale of Manufacturing Facilities, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in "Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Form 10-K.

Facilities 
Our Wood Products segment operates six EWP facilities. Our two most significant EWP facilities are located in Louisiana and Oregon and have a high degree of raw material and manufacturing integration with our neighboring plywood and veneer facilities. We also operate nine plywood and veneer plants, as well as two sawmills. The sale of the Moncure plywood facility is expected to close in first quarter 2019.
Raw Materials and Input Costs
Wood fiber. Wood fiber is the primary raw material used in our Wood Products operations, and our primary source of wood fiber is logs. For the year ended December 31, 2018, wood fiber accounted for approximately 44% of materials, labor, and other operating expenses (excluding depreciation) in our Wood Products segment. Our EWP facilities use parallel-laminated veneer panels and veneer sheets produced by our facilities, as well as lumber, OSB, and veneer sheets purchased from third parties, to manufacture LVL, I-joists, and laminated beams. Our EWP, plywood, and veneer facilities use Douglas fir, white woods, and pine logs as raw materials. Our manufacturing facilities are located in close proximity to active wood fiber markets. 
Logs comprised approximately 74% of our wood fiber costs during 2018, and we satisfy our log requirements through a combination of purchases under supply agreements, open-market purchases, and purchases pursuant to contracts awarded under public auctions.
Approximately 74% of our log supply in 2018 was supplied through purchases from private land owners or through dealers. We also bid in auctions conducted by federal, state, and local authorities for the purchase of logs, generally at fixed prices, under contracts with terms of generally one to three years. 
Our log requirements and our access to supply, as well as the cost of obtaining logs, are subject to change based on, among other things, the availability of logs in each of our operating areas, our operating schedules, competition from other manufacturers, the effect of governmental laws and regulations, impacts of weather or fire on log availability, and the status of environmental appeals. For a discussion of contractual commitments relating to log supply agreements, see "Contractual 
4

 
Obligations" in "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of this Form 10-K.
The cost of logs is correlated with prevailing product prices for building materials and manufacturers' expectations for future product prices, with the increase in product prices driving increases in log costs. Generally, increases in the cost of logs lag product price increases, as improved manufacturer profitability often leads to increased demand for logs. Prices for logs have been historically cyclical in response to changes in domestic and foreign demand and supply. Our aggregate cost of obtaining logs is also affected by fuel costs and the distance of the log source from our facilities, as we are often required to transport the logs we purchase from the source to our facilities.
Demand for dimension lumber has a strong influence on log pricing, as the dimension lumber industry is the largest consumer of logs. Historically, the level of foreign demand for log exports from the western U.S. has fluctuated based on economic activity in China and other Pacific Rim countries, currency exchange rates, and the availability of log supplies from other countries such as Canada, Russia, and New Zealand. Sustained periods of high log costs may impair the cost competitiveness of our manufacturing facilities. Log costs in the western U.S. have historically been more volatile due to foreign demand for log exports. In addition, per-unit log costs in the western U.S. are higher than per-unit log costs in the southern U.S. due to higher harvest and delivery costs, as well as various supply-side constraints, including seasonal weather-related restrictions, slower growth cycles, and a higher proportion of federal and state timberland ownership.
           We also purchase OSB, which is used as the vertical web to assemble I-joists, from a supplier with multiple locations throughout North America. OSB accounted for approximately 7% of the aggregate amount of materials, labor, and other operating expenses (excluding depreciation) for our Wood Products segment in 2018. OSB is a commodity, and prices have been historically volatile in response to industry capacity and operating rates, inventory levels in various distribution channels, and seasonal demand patterns. Sustained periods of high OSB costs lead to higher costs of our I-joist production. 
Wood fiber also includes, to a lesser extent than OSB, lumber purchased from third parties for I-joist production at our Canadian EWP facility and for production at our laminated beam plant in Idaho. Lumber input costs are subject to similar commodity-based volatility characteristics noted above for OSB. 
Other raw materials and energy costs. We use a significant quantity of various resins and glues in our manufacturing processes. Resin and glue product costs are influenced by changes in the prices of raw material input costs, primarily fossil fuel products. We purchase resins and glues, other raw materials, and energy used to manufacture our products in both the open market and through supply contracts. The contracts are generally with regional suppliers who agree to supply all of our needs for a certain raw material or energy within the applicable region. These contracts have terms of various lengths and typically contain price adjustment mechanisms that take into account changes in market prices. Therefore, although our long-term contracts provide us with supplies of raw materials and energy that are more stable than open-market purchases, in many cases, they may not alleviate fluctuations in market prices.
Sales, Marketing, and Distribution 
 Our EWP sales force is managed centrally through a main office that oversees regional sales teams. Our sales force spends a significant amount of time working with end customers who purchase our EWP. Our sales force provides a variety of technical support services, including integrated design, engineering, product specification software, distributor inventory management software, and job-pack preparation systems. Sales of plywood are also managed centrally. 
In 2018, EWP and plywood, accounted for 47% and 34%, respectively, of our Wood Products sales. The majority of our wood products are sold to leading wholesalers (including our Building Materials Distribution segment), home improvement centers, retail lumberyards, and industrial converters in North America. Our Building Materials Distribution segment is our Wood Products segment's largest customer, representing approximately 54% of our Wood Products segment's overall sales in 2018. In 2018, 74% and 36%, of our Wood Products segment's EWP and plywood sales volumes, respectively, were to our Building Materials Distribution segment.

Segment Strategy
Grow Our Operations With a Continued Focus on Expanding Our Market Position in EWP
We have expanded our market position in EWP through acquisitions and targeted capital spending for internal veneer production. We have also expanded our market position in EWP by utilizing our large-scale manufacturing position, comprehensive customer service offering, design support capabilities, and efficient distribution network. We expect to see further increases in EWP demand as a result of the ongoing recovery in housing construction and intend to optimize our existing asset base to take advantage of these increases and continue to grow our market position in EWP. We are also pursuing sales opportunities into low-rise commercial construction.
Continue to Improve Our Competitiveness Through Operational Excellence
We use a disciplined cost management approach to maximize our competitiveness without sacrificing our ability to react to future growth opportunities. Additionally, we have made capital investments and process improvements in certain facilities. These capital investments and process improvements have improved our veneer self-sufficiency and allowed us to produce lower-cost, higher-quality veneers. We use a data-driven process improvement program to further strengthen our manufacturing operations. We believe there are opportunities to further apply this process improvement program in our manufacturing operations and apply similar techniques and methods to different functional areas to realize efficiencies in those areas.
Building Materials Distribution 
Products 
We sell a broad line of building materials; including OSB, plywood, and lumber (collectively commodities), general line items such as siding, composite decking, metal products, insulation, and roofing, and EWP. Except for EWP, we purchase most of these building materials from a vendor base of approximately 1,000 third-party suppliers ranging from large manufacturers, such as James Hardie Building Products, Trex Company, Huber Engineered Woods, and Louisiana-Pacific Corporation, to small regional producers. Substantially all of our EWP is sourced from our Wood Products segment. Our products are used in the construction of new residential housing, including single-family, multi-family, and manufactured homes, the repair-and-remodeling of existing housing, the construction of light industrial and commercial buildings, and other industrial applications.

Facilities 
Our Building Materials Distribution segment operates a nationwide network of 37 building materials distribution facilities throughout the U.S. and also operates a single truss manufacturing plant. Our broad geographic presence reduces our exposure to market factors in any single region. During 2018, we acquired wholesale building material distribution locations in Nashville, Tennessee, Medford, Oregon, and Cincinnati, Ohio. These locations complement our existing distribution business and strengthen our nationwide presence. In addition, we believe we will be able to broaden our product and service offerings within those markets. For further discussion on acquisitions, see Note 8, Acquisitions, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Form 10â€‘K.
Sales, Marketing, and Distribution
We market our building materials primarily to retail lumberyards, home improvement centers, and specialty distributors that then sell the products to end customers, who are typically professional builders, independent contractors, and homeowners engaged in residential construction and repair-and-remodeling projects. We also market our products to a wide variety of industrial accounts, which use our products to assemble cabinets, doors, agricultural bins, crating, and other products used in industrial and construction applications. We believe that our national presence and long-standing relationships with many of our key suppliers allow us to obtain favorable price and term arrangements and offer excellent customer service on leading brands in the building materials industry. We also believe our broad product line provides our customers with an efficient, one-stop resource for their building materials needs. We also have expertise in special-order sourcing and merchandising support, which is a key service for our home improvement center customers that choose not to stock certain items in inventory.
We sell products through two primary distribution channels: warehouse sales and direct sales. Warehouse sales are delivered from our distribution centers to our customers and direct sales are shipped from the manufacturer to the customer without our taking physical inventory possession. Each of our distribution centers implements its own distribution and logistics model using centralized information systems. We use internal and external trucking resources to deliver materials on a regularly scheduled basis. Our highly efficient logistics system allows us to deliver superior customer service and assist our customers in optimizing their working capital.
7

 
We have a large, decentralized sales force to support our suppliers and customers. Our sales force and product managers have local product knowledge and decision-making authority, which we believe enables them to optimize stocking, pricing, and product assortment decisions. Our sales force has access to centralized information technology systems, an extensive vendor base, and corporate-level working capital support, which we believe complements our localized sales model. Our sales force is compensated, in part, based on branch-level performance.
We regularly evaluate opportunities to introduce new products. Broadening our product offering helps us serve as a one-stop resource for building materials, which we believe improves our customers' purchasing and operating efficiencies. The introduction of new products is primarily driven by customer demand or product extensions originating from our vendors. We believe our long-standing customer relationships allow us to respond to customer feedback and introduce new products more rapidly. Broadening our product offering also helps us drive additional products through our distribution system, thereby increasing our scale and efficiency.
Segment Strategy
Grow Market Share 
We intend to grow our Building Materials Distribution business in existing markets by adding products and services to better serve our customers. We also plan to opportunistically expand our Building Materials Distribution business by acquiring facilities, opening new locations, relocating and expanding capacity at existing facilities, and capturing local market share through our supply chain capabilities and customer service.
Further Differentiate Our Products and Services 
We seek to continue to differentiate ourselves from our competitors by providing a broad line of high-quality products and superior customer service. Our highly efficient logistics system allows us to deliver superior customer service and assist our customers in optimizing their working capital. Our national distribution platform, coupled with the manufacturing capabilities of our Wood Products segment, differentiates us from most of our competitors and is critical to servicing retail lumberyards, home improvement centers, and industrial accounts locally, regionally, and nationally. Additionally, we believe that our nationwide system allows us to procure product more efficiently and to develop and maintain stronger relationships with our vendors. Because of these relationships and our national presence, we believe many of our vendors have offered us favorable pricing and provide us with enhanced product introductions and ongoing marketing support.
Customers
We maintain relationships with a broad customer base across multiple market segments and various end markets. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our top ten customers represented approximately 37% of our sales, with no customer accounting for 10% or more of total sales. At December 31, 2018, receivables from Home Depot and Builders FirstSource accounted for approximately 11% and 13%, respectively, of total receivables. Sales to Home Depot were recorded in our Building Materials Distribution and Wood Products segments and substantially all sales to Builders FirstSource were recorded in our Building Material Distribution segment. For additional information related to customers of our Wood Products and Building Materials Distribution segments, see the "Sales, Marketing, and Distribution" sections above. 
Competition 
Wood Products. The wood products manufacturing markets in which we operate are large and highly competitive. We compete against several major North American EWP producers, such as Weyerhaeuser Company and Louisiana-Pacific Corporation, as well as several other smaller firms. Our EWP products also face competition from numerous dimension lumber producers, because EWP may be substituted by dimension lumber in many building applications. In plywood, we compete with Georgia-Pacific, the largest manufacturer in North America, other large producers such as Roseburg Forest Products, foreign imports produced principally in South America, and several smaller domestic producers. Our plywood products also face competition from OSB producers, because OSB can be substituted for plywood in many building and industrial applications. We have leading market positions in the manufacture of EWP and plywood. In the wood products manufacturing markets, we compete primarily on the basis of price, quality, availability, and particularly with respect to EWP, customer service, product support, and performance features offered. Most of our competitors are located in the U.S. and Canada, although we also compete with manufacturers in other countries, particularly when the U.S. dollar and economy are stronger relative to other countries, encouraging foreign producers to sell more of their plywood into the U.S. Our competition includes not only manufacturers and distributors of similar building products but also manufacturers and distributors of products made from alternative materials, such as steel and plastic. Some of our competitors enjoy strong reputations for product quality and 
8

 
customer service, and these competitors may have strong relationships with certain distributors, making it more difficult for our products to gain additional market share. Some of our competitors in this segment are also vertically integrated and/or have access to internal sources of wood fiber, which may allow them to subsidize their base manufacturing business in periods of rising fiber prices.
Building Materials Distribution. The building materials distribution markets in which we operate are highly fragmented and we compete in each of our geographic and product markets with national, regional, and local distributors. Our wholesale distribution competitors include BlueLinx Holdings Inc., Weyerhaeuser Company, Dixie Plywood and Lumber, OrePac, U.S. Lumber Group, and Capital Lumber, among others. We also compete with wholesale brokers, specialty distributors, and certain buying cooperatives. We compete on the basis of pricing and availability of product, service and delivery capabilities, ability to assist customers with problem solving, extension of credit terms, customer relationships, geographic coverage, and breadth of product offerings. We distribute products for some manufacturers that also engage in direct sales to our distribution customers. In recent years, there has been consolidation among retail lumberyards. As the customer base consolidates, this dynamic could affect our ability to maintain margins. Proximity to customers is an important factor in minimizing shipping costs and facilitating quick order turnaround and on-time delivery. We believe our ability to obtain quality materials, from both internal and external sources, the scale and efficiency of our national footprint, and our focus on customer service are our primary competitive advantages in this segment. Also, financial stability is important to suppliers and customers in choosing distributors and allows for more favorable terms on which we are able to obtain our products from our suppliers and sell our products to our customers.
