Item 1. Business 
 General 
               Bain Capital Specialty Finance, Inc. (the "Company") was formed on October 5, 2015 ("Inception") as a Delaware corporation structured as an externally managed, closed-end, non-diversified management investment company. The Company commenced investment operations on October 13, 2016 ("Commencement"). The Company has elected to be treated as a business development company ("BDC") under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"). In addition, the Company has elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a regulated investment company (a "RIC") under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). As a RIC, the Company will not be taxed on its income to the extent that it distributes such income each year and satisfies other applicable income tax requirements. 
               On October 6, 2016, the Company completed its initial closing of capital commitments (the "Initial Closing") and subsequently commenced substantial investment operations. On November 19, 2018, the Company closed its initial public offering (the "IPO") issuing 7,500,000 shares of its common stock at a public offering price of $20.25 per share. Shares of common stock of the Company began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "BCSF" on November 15, 2018. 
               The Company is managed by the Advisor, an investment adviser that is registered with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the "Advisers Act"). The Advisor also provides the administrative services necessary for the Company to operate (in such capacity, the "Administrator"). Company management consists of investment and administrative professionals from the Advisor and Administrator along with the Board of Directors (the "Board"). The Advisor directs and executes the investment operations and capital raising activities of the Company subject to oversight from the Board, which sets the broad policies of the Company. The Board has delegated investment management of the Company's investment assets to the Advisor. The Board consists of five directors, three of whom are independent. 
               Our primary focus is capitalizing on opportunities within Bain Capital Credit's Senior Direct Lending Strategy, as defined below, which seeks to provide risk-adjusted returns and current income to investors by investing primarily in middle-market companies with between $10.0 million and $150.0 million in annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA"). However, we may, from time to time, invest in larger or smaller companies. We focus on senior investments with a first or second lien on collateral and strong structures and documentation intended to protect the lender. We generally seek to retain effective voting control in respect of the loans or particular class of securities in which we invest through maintaining affirmative voting positions or negotiating consent rights that allow us to retain a blocking position. We may also invest in mezzanine debt and other junior securities, including common and preferred equity, on an opportunistic basis, and in secondary purchases of assets or portfolios, but such investments are not the principal focus of our investment strategy. We may also invest, from time to time, in distressed debt, debtor-in-possession loans, structured products, structurally subordinate loans, investments with deferred interest features, zero-coupon securities and defaulted securities. Our investments are subject to a number of risks. See "Item 1A. Risk FactorsRisks Related to Our Investments." Leverage may be utilized to help the Company meet its investment objective. Any such leverage would be expected to increase the total capital available for investment by the Company. 
               We may invest in debt securities which are either rated below investment grade or not rated by any rating agency but, if they were rated, would be rated below investment grade. Below investment grade securities, which are often referred to as "junk," have predominantly speculative characteristics with 
 4

   respect to the issuer's capacity to pay interest and repay principal. They may also be illiquid and difficult to value. 
               We may borrow money from time to time within the levels permitted by the 1940 Act. On November 28, 2018, the Board approved the reduction of the Company's asset coverage requirements in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act to 150% and recommended the stockholders to vote in favor of the proposal at the special stockholder meeting on February 1, 2019. On February 1, 2019, the Company's stockholders approved the application of the reduced asset coverage. Effective February 2, 2019, the Company is permitted to borrow amounts such that its asset coverage ratio is at least 150% after such borrowing (if certain requirements are met), rather than 200%, as previously required. In determining whether to borrow money, we will analyze the maturity, covenant package and rate structure of the proposed borrowings as well as the risks of such borrowings compared to our investment outlook. The use of borrowed funds or the proceeds of preferred stock offerings to make investments would have its own specific set of benefits and risks, and all of the costs of borrowing funds or issuing preferred stock would be borne by holders of our common stock. See "Item 1A. Risk FactorsRisks Relating to Our Business and StructureOur strategy involves a high degree of leverage. We intend to continue to finance our investments with borrowed money, which will magnify the potential for gain or loss on amounts invested and may increase the risk of investing in us. The risks of investment in a highly leverage fund include volatility and possible distribution restrictions." 
   The Investment Advisor 
               The Company's investment activities are managed by the Advisor, an investment adviser that is registered with the SEC under the Advisers Act. The Advisor is responsible for originating prospective investments, conducting research and due diligence investigations on potential investments, analyzing investment opportunities, negotiating and structuring our investments and monitoring our investments and portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. More information regarding the Advisor and its business activities can be found on its registration under Form ADV located on the Investment Adviser Registration Depository website of the SEC. 
               The Advisor has entered into a Resource Sharing Agreement (the "Resource Sharing Agreement") with Bain Capital Credit, LP ("Bain Capital Credit"), pursuant to which Bain Capital Credit provides the Advisor with experienced investment professionals (including the members of the Advisor's Credit Committee) and access to the resources of Bain Capital Credit so as to enable the Advisor to fulfill its obligations under the investment advisory agreement (the "Investment Advisory Agreement"). Through the Resource Sharing Agreement, the Advisor intends to capitalize on the significant deal origination, credit underwriting, due diligence, investment structuring, execution, portfolio management and monitoring experience of Bain Capital Credit's investment professionals. There can be no assurance that Bain Capital Credit will perform its obligations under the Resource Sharing Agreement. The Resource Sharing Agreement may be terminated by either party on 60 days' notice, which if terminated may have a material adverse consequence on the Company's operations. See "Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence." 
 About Bain Capital Credit 
               Bain Capital Credit was established in 1998. Bain Capital Credit and its subsidiaries (including the credit vehicles managed by its Alternative Investment Fund Manager affiliate) had approximately $39.2 billion in assets under management as of December 31, 2018. To date, Bain Capital Credit has invested across the credit products and fixed income universe, including performing and distressed bank loans, high yield bonds, debtor-in-possession loans, senior direct lending, mezzanine debt and other junior securities, structured products, credit-based equities and other investments. Bain Capital Credit has invested over $7.1 billion in the Senior Direct Lending Strategy (as defined below) since 1999 (of which 
 5

   approximately $1.9 billion has been invested within the 12-month period ending December 31, 2018) and has an extensive track record as a non-traditional lender in the middle market. The Senior Direct Lending Strategy is defined as primarily consisting of investments in secured debt in companies with EBITDA of $10.0 million to $150.0 million. 
               Bain Capital Credit is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bain Capital, LP ("Bain Capital") and the Advisor is a majority-owned subsidiary of Bain Capital Credit. As a diversified private investment firm, Bain Capital and its affiliates, including Bain Capital Credit and the Advisor, engage in a broad range of activities, including investment activities for their own account and for the account of other investment funds or accounts, and provide investment banking, advisory, management and other services to funds and operating companies. 
   The Board of Directors 
               Our business and affairs are managed under the direction of the Board. The Board consists of five members, three of whom are not "interested persons" of the Company, the Advisor or their respective affiliates as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act. We refer to these individuals as our "Independent Directors." The Independent Directors compose a majority of the Board. The Board elects our officers, who serve at the discretion of the Board. The responsibilities of the Board include quarterly determinations of fair value of our assets, corporate governance activities, oversight of our financing arrangements and oversight of our investment activities. 
 Investment Advisory Agreement; Administration Agreement 
               Our investment activities are managed by the Advisor, which is responsible for originating prospective investments, conducting research and due diligence investigations on potential investments, analyzing investment opportunities, negotiating and structuring our investments and monitoring our investments and portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. We have entered into an Investment Advisory Agreement with the Advisor, pursuant to which we have agreed to pay the Advisor a base management fee and an incentive fee for its services. The cost of both the base management fee and the incentive fee will ultimately be borne by our stockholders. 
               The base management fee is calculated at an annual rate of 1.5% of our gross assets, including assets purchased with borrowed funds or other forms of leverage but excluding cash and cash equivalents. For services rendered under the Investment Advisory Agreement, the base management fee is payable quarterly in arrears. The base management fee is calculated based on the average value of our gross assets at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters, and appropriately adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the current calendar quarter. Base management fee for any partial month or quarter will be appropriately pro-rated. For purposes of the Investment Advisory Agreement, cash equivalents means U.S. government securities and commercial paper instruments maturing within one year of purchase. 
               The Advisor, however, has agreed to contractually waive its right to receive base management fee in excess of 0.75% of the aggregate gross assets excluding cash (including capital drawn to pay the Company's expenses) during any period prior to the IPO. The Advisor is not permitted to recoup any waived amounts at any time. 
               We will pay the Advisor an incentive fee. The incentive fee will consist of two partsan incentive fee based on income and an incentive fee based on capital gainswhich are described in more detail below. 
 6

                 The first part, the income incentive fee, will be calculated and payable quarterly in arrears and equals: 

   
(a) | 100% of the excess of our pre-incentive fee net investment income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter, over a preferred return of 1.5% per quarter (6% annualized) (the "Hurdle"), until the Advisor has received a "catch-up" equal to: 
 | | (i) | 15% of the pre-incentive fee net investment income for the current quarter prior to the IPO, or 
 | | (ii) | 17.5% of the pre-incentive fee net investment income for the current quarter after the IPO; and 
(b) | | (i) | 15% of all remaining pre-incentive fee net investment income above the "catch-up" prior to the IPO, or
 | | (ii) | 17.5% of all remaining pre-incentive fee net investment income above the "catch-up" after the IPO. 


              The second part, the capital gains incentive fee, will be determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each fiscal year, and equals: 

   
(a) | prior to the IPO, 15% of the Company's realized capital gains, if any, on a cumulative basis from inception through the end of the fiscal year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gain incentive fees (the "Cumulative Capital Gains"), or 
(b) | after the IPO, 17.5% of the Cumulative Capital Gains. 


              Pre-incentive fee net investment income means interest income, distribution income and any other income (including any other fees, such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that we receive from portfolio companies but excluding fees for providing managerial assistance) accrued during each calendar quarter, minus our operating expenses for such quarter (including the base management fee, expenses payable under the administration agreement (the "Administration Agreement") and any interest expense and distributions paid on any issued and outstanding debt or preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee). Pre-incentive fee net investment income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as market discount, original issue discount ("OID"), debt instruments with payment-in-kind ("PIK") interest, preferred stock with PIK dividends and zero coupon securities), accrued income that we have not yet received in cash. See "Item 1A. Risk FactorsRisks Relating to Our Business and StructureOur management and incentive fee structure may create incentives for our Advisor that are not fully aligned with the interests of our stockholders and may induce our Advisor to make speculative investments."
               Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. Because of the structure of the incentive fee, it is possible that we may pay an incentive fee in a quarter where we incur a loss. For example, if we receive pre-incentive fee net investment income in excess of the Hurdle rate for a quarter, we will pay the applicable incentive fee even if we have incurred a loss in that quarter due to realized and unrealized capital losses. 
               Pre-incentive fee net investment income will be compared to a "Hurdle Amount" equal to the product of (i) the "hurdle rate" of 1.5% per quarter (6% annualized) and (ii) the Company's net assets (defined as total assets less indebtedness and before taking into account any incentive fees payable during the period) at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter. If market interest rates rise, we may be able to invest our funds in debt instruments that provide for a higher return, which would increase our pre-incentive fee net investment income and make it easier for the Advisor to surpass the fixed Hurdle rate 
 7

   and receive an incentive fee based on such net investment income. PIK interest and OID will also increase our pre-incentive fee net investment income and make it easier to surpass the fixed Hurdle rate. Our pre-incentive fee net investment income used to calculate this part of the incentive fee is also included in the amount of our total assets (other than cash but including assets purchased with borrowed amounts) used to calculate the base management fee. 
               Prior to the IPO, the Company paid the income incentive fee in each calendar quarter as follows:
 

 no income incentive fee in any calendar quarter in which the Company's pre-incentive fee net investment income does not exceed the Hurdle
Amount; 
 100% of the Company's pre-incentive fee net investment income with respect to that portion of such pre-incentive fee net investment income, if
any, that exceeds the Hurdle Amount but is less than or equal to an amount (the "Pre-Qualified IPO Catch-Up Amount") determined on a quarterly basis by multiplying 1.7647% by the Company's net asset
value at the beginning of each applicable calendar quarter. The Pre-Qualified IPO Catch-Up Amount is intended to provide the Advisor with an incentive fee of 15% on all of the Company's pre-incentive
fee net investment income when the Company's pre-incentive fee net investment income reaches the Pre-Qualified IPO Catch-Up Amount in any calendar quarter; and 
 for any calendar quarter in which the Company's pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeds the Pre-Qualified IPO Catch-Up Amount, the
income incentive fee shall equal 15% of the amount of the Company's pre-incentive fee net investment income for the calendar quarter. 

               On and after the IPO, the Company will pay the income incentive fee in each calendar quarter as follows:
 

 no income incentive fee in any calendar quarter in which the Company's pre-incentive fee net investment income does not exceed the Hurdle
Amount; 
 100% of the Company's pre-incentive fee net investment income with respect to that portion of such pre-incentive fee net investment income, if
any, that exceeds the Hurdle Amount but is less than or equal to an amount (the "Post-Qualified IPO Catch-Up Amount") determined on a quarterly basis by multiplying 1.8182% by the Company's net asset
value at the beginning of each applicable calendar quarter. The Post-Qualified IPO Catch-Up Amount is intended to provide the Advisor with an incentive fee of 17.5% on all of the Company's
pre-incentive fee net investment income when the Company's pre-incentive fee net investment income reaches the Post-Qualified IPO Catch-Up Amount in any calendar quarter; and 
 for any calendar quarter in which the Company's pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeds the Post-Qualified IPO Catch-Up Amount, the
income incentive fee shall equal 17.5% of the amount of the Company's pre-incentive fee net investment income for the calendar quarter. 

               These calculations will be appropriately pro-rated for any period of less than three months and adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases by the Company during the current quarter. Because the IPO occurred on a date other than the first day of a calendar quarter, the income incentive fee was calculated for the fourth quarter 2018 at a weighted rate calculated based on the fee rates applicable before and after the IPO based on the number of days in the calendar quarter before and after the IPO. 
               On October 11, 2018, the Board approved, subject to completion of the IPO, an Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement. Beginning with the calendar quarter that commenced 
 8

   January 1, 2019, the incentive fee based on income is subject to (i) a three-year lookback provision and (ii) a cap on quarterly income incentive fee payments based on net realized or unrealized capital loss, if any, during the applicable three-year lookback period. 
   Annual Incentive Fee Based on Capital Gains 
               The second part of the incentive fee is a capital gains incentive fee that will be determined and payable in arrears in cash as of the end of each fiscal year (or upon termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement, as of the termination date), and equals (i) 15% of our realized capital gains as of the end of the fiscal year prior to the IPO and (ii) 17.5% of our realized capital gains as of the end of the fiscal year after the IPO. In determining the capital gains incentive fee payable to the Advisor, we calculate the cumulative aggregate realized capital gains and cumulative aggregate realized capital losses since our inception, and the aggregate unrealized capital depreciation as of the date of the calculation, as applicable, with respect to each of the investments in our portfolio. For this purpose, cumulative aggregate realized capital gains, if any, equals the sum of the differences between the net sales price of each investment, when sold, and the cost of such investment. Cumulative aggregate realized capital losses equals the sum of the amounts by which the net sales price of each investment, when sold, is less than the cost of such investment. Aggregate unrealized capital depreciation equals the sum of the difference, if negative, between the valuation of each investment as of the applicable calculation date and the cost of such investment. At the end of the applicable year, the amount of capital gains that serves as the basis for our calculation of the capital gains incentive fee equals the cumulative aggregate realized capital gains less cumulative aggregate realized capital losses, less aggregate unrealized capital depreciation, with respect to our portfolio of investments. If this number is positive at the end of such year, then the capital gains incentive fee for such year will equal 15% before the IPO or 17.5% after the IPO, as applicable, of such amount, less the aggregate amount of any capital gains incentive fees paid in respect of our portfolio in all prior years as calculated in accordance with the below after the IPO. 
               Because the IPO occurred on a date other than the first day of a fiscal year, a capital gains incentive fee shall be calculated as of the day before the IPO, with such capital gains incentive fee paid to the Advisor following the end of the 2018 fiscal year. For the avoidance of doubt, such capital gains incentive fee shall be equal to 15% of the Company's realized capital gains on a cumulative basis from inception through November 14, 2018, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gains incentive fees. Following the IPO, solely for the purposes of calculating the capital gains incentive fee, the Company will be deemed to have previously paid capital gains incentive fees prior to the IPO equal to the product obtained by multiplying (a) the actual aggregate amount of previously paid capital gains incentive fees for all periods prior to the IPO by (b) the percentage obtained by dividing (x) 17.5% by (y) 15%. In the event that the Investment Advisory Agreement shall terminate as of a date that is not a fiscal year end, the termination date shall be treated as though it were a fiscal year end for purposes of calculating and paying a capital gains incentive fee.

     Examples of Quarterly Incentive Fee Calculation 

   
Example 1: Income Related Portion of Incentive Fee: (*) 
Alternative 1 - The Company is below the hurdle Assumptions 
Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 1.5% Hurdle rate(1) = 1.5% Management fee(1) = 0.375% Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.)(2) = 0.1525% 
Pre-incentive fee net investment income (investment income(management fee + other expenses)) = 0.9725% 
Pre-incentive net investment income does not exceed hurdle rate, therefore there is no incentive fee. 
Alternative 2 - The Company exceeds the hurdle Assumptions 
Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 2.25% Hurdle rate(1) = 1.5% Management fee(1) = 0.375% Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.)(2) = 0.1525% Pre-incentive fee net investment income 
(investment income(management fee + other expenses)) = 1.7225%, which exceeds the hurdle rate 
Incentive fee 
= 100% × "catch-up" + the greater of 0% and (17.5% × (pre-incentive fee net investment income1.8182%)) 
= 100% × (1.7225%1.5%) + 0% 
= 0.2225% of total net assets 
Alternative 3The Company exceeds the catch-up Assumptions 
Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 3.0% Hurdle rate(1) = 1.5% Management fee(1) = 0.375% Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.)(2) = 0.1525% Pre-incentive fee net investment income (investment income(management fee + other expenses)) = 2.4725% 
Incentive fee = 17.5% × pre-incentive fee net investment income, subject to "catch-up"(3) 
= 100% × "catch-up" + the greater of 0% and (17.5% × (pre-incentive fee net 
investment income1.8182%)) 
Catch-up = 1.8182%1.5% = 0.3182% 
Incentive fee = (100% × 0.3182%) + (17.5% × (2.4725%1.8182%)) 
= 0.3182% + (17.5% × 0.6543%) = 0.3182% + 0.11450% = 0.43270% of total net assets 


  (*)  The hypothetical amount of pre-incentive fee net investment income shown is based on a percentage of total net assets. (1)  Represents 6.0% annualized hurdle rate and 1.5% annualized management fee. (2)  Excludes organizational and offering expenses. (3)  The "catch-up" provision is intended to provide our Advisor with an incentive fee of approximately 17.5% on all of our pre-incentive fee net investment income as if a hurdle rate did not apply when our net investment income exceeds 1.8182% in any calendar quarter.

              Example 2: Capital Gains Portion of Incentive Fee:
               Assumptions

   
Year 1: | $25.0 million investment made in Company A ("Investment A"), $35.0 million investment made in Company B ("Investment B") and $30.0 million investment made in Company C ("Investment C")
Year 2: | Investment A sold for $35.0 million, fair value of Investment B determined to be $30.0 million and fair value of Investment C determined to be $32.0 million 
Year 3: | Fair value of Investment B determined to be $34.0 million and Investment C sold for $35.0 million 
Year 4: | Fair value of Investment B determined to be $45.0 million 


              Determination of Incentive Fee based on capital gains 

   
The Incentive Fee based on capital gains, if any, would be:
Year 1: | None 
Year 2: | $0.875 million 
 | The portion of the incentive fee based on capital gains equals (A) 17.5% of our realized capital gains, if any, on a cumulative basis from inception through the end of the fiscal year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, minus (B) the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gain incentive. Therefore, using the assumptions above, the incentive fee based on capital gains equals (A) 17.5% × ($10.0 million-$5.0 million) minus (B) $0. Therefore, the incentive fee based on capital gains equals $0.875 million. 
Year 3: | $1.575 million, which is calculated as follows: The incentive fee based on capital gains equals (A) 17.5% × ($15.0 million-$1.0 million) minus (B) $0.875 million. Therefore, the incentive fee based on capital gains equals $1.575 million. 
Year 4: | $0.175 million, which is calculated as follows: The incentive fee based on capital gains equals (x) (A) 17.5% × ($15.0 million-$0.0 million) minus (B) $2.45 million. Therefore, the incentive fee based on capital gains equals $0.175 million. 


              The Board will monitor the mix and performance of our investments over time and will seek to satisfy itself that the Advisor is acting in our interests and that our fee structure appropriately incentivizes the Advisor to do so. 
               We have also entered into an Administration Agreement with the Administrator, pursuant to which the Administrator will provide the administrative services necessary for us to operate, and we will utilize the Administrator's office facilities, equipment and recordkeeping services. Pursuant to the Administration Agreement, the Administrator has agreed to oversee our public reporting requirements and tax reporting and monitor our expenses and the performance of professional services rendered to us by others. The Administrator has also hired a sub-administrator to assist in the provision of administrative services. We may reimburse the Administrator for its costs and expenses and our allocable portion of overhead incurred by it in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including compensation paid to or compensatory distributions received by our officers (including our Chief Compliance Officer and Chief Financial Officer) and any of their respective staff who provide services to 
 11

   us, operations staff who provide services to us, and internal audit staff, if any, to the extent internal audit performs a role in our Sarbanes-Oxley internal control assessment. Our allocable portion of overhead will be determined by the Administrator, which expects to use various methodologies such as allocation based on the percentage of time certain individuals devote, on an estimated basis, to the business and affairs of the Company, and will be subject to oversight by the Board. The sub-administrator will be paid its compensation for performing its sub-administrative services under the sub-administration agreement. The Company incurred expenses related to the sub-administrator of $0.8 million, $0.5 million and $0.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, which is included in other general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of operations. The Administrator not seek reimbursement in the event that any such reimbursements would cause any distributions to our stockholders to constitute a return of capital. See "Fees and Expenses." In addition, the Administrator is permitted to delegate its duties under the Administration Agreement to affiliates or third parties and we will reimburse the expenses of these parties incurred and paid by the Advisor on our behalf. 
               Both the Investment Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement have been approved by the Board. Unless earlier terminated as described below, both the Investment Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement will remain in effect for a period of two years from their effective date and will remain in effect from year to year thereafter if approved annually by (i) the vote of the Board, or by the vote of a majority of our outstanding voting securities, and (ii) the vote of a majority of our Independent Directors. The Investment Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement will automatically terminate in the event of assignment. Both the Investment Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty upon not less than 60 days' written notice to the other. Upon termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Company will be required to change its name which may have a material adverse impact on the Company's operations. See "Item 1A. Risk FactorsRisks Relating to Our Business and Structure We are dependent upon key personnel of Bain Capital Credit and our Advisor." 
               Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Advisor has not assumed any responsibility to us other than to render the services called for under that agreement. It will not be responsible for any action of the Board in following or declining to follow the Advisor's advice or recommendations. Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Advisor, its officers, managers, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons, members and any other person or entity affiliated with the Advisor, and any person controlling or controlled by the Advisor will not be liable to us, any subsidiary of ours, our directors, our stockholders or any subsidiary's stockholders or partners for acts or omissions performed in accordance with and pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement, except those resulting from acts constituting gross negligence, willful misfeasance, bad faith or reckless disregard of the duties that the Advisor owes to us under the Investment Advisory Agreement. In addition, as part of the Investment Advisory Agreement, we have agreed to indemnify the Advisor and each of its officers, managers, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons, members and any other person or entity affiliated with the Advisor, from and against any claims or liabilities, including reasonable legal fees and other expenses reasonably incurred, arising out of or in connection with our business and operations or any action taken or omitted on our behalf pursuant to authority granted by the Investment Advisory Agreement, except where attributable to gross negligence, willful misfeasance, bad faith or reckless disregard of such person's duties under the Investment Advisory Agreement. These protections may lead the Advisor to act in a riskier manner when acting on our behalf than it would when acting for its own account. 
               United States federal and state securities laws may impose liability under certain circumstances on persons who act in good faith. Nothing in the Investment Advisory Agreement will constitute a waiver or limitation of any rights that the Company may have under any applicable federal or state securities laws. 
 12

     Investment Decision Process 
               The Advisor's investment process can be broken into four processes: (1) Sourcing and Idea Generation, (2) Investment Diligence & Recommendation, (3) Credit Committee Approval and Portfolio Construction and (4) Portfolio & Risk Management. 
   Sourcing and Idea Generation
              The investment decision-making process begins with sourcing ideas. Bain Capital Credit's Private Credit Group interacts with over 1,500 global contacts as a means to generate middle market investment opportunities. Our Advisor also seeks to leverage the contacts of Bain Capital Credit's industry groups, Trading Desk, Portfolio Group and Restructuring team, including private equity firms, banks and a variety of advisors and other intermediaries. 
   Investment Diligence & Recommendation
              Our Advisor utilizes Bain Capital Credit's bottom-up approach to investing, and it starts with the due diligence performed by its Private Credit Group. The group works with the close support of Bain Capital Credit's industry groups. This diligence process typically begins with a detailed review of an offering memorandum as well as Bain Capital Credit's own independent diligence efforts, including in-house materials and expertise, third-party independent research and interviews, and hands-on field checks where appropriate. For deals that progress beyond an initial stage, the team will usually schedule one or more meetings with company management, facilities visits and also meetings with the sponsor in order to ask more detailed questions and to better understand the sponsor's view of the business and plans for it going forward. The team's diligence work is summarized in investment memoranda and accompanying credit packs. Work product also includes full models and covenant analysis. 
   Credit Committee Approval and Portfolio Construction
              If the reviewing team deems an investment worthy of serious consideration, it generally must be presented to the credit committee, which is comprised of at least three experienced credit professionals, who are selected based on strategy and geography. A portfolio manager leads the decision making process for each investment and engages the credit committee throughout the investment process in order to prioritize and direct the underwriting of each potential investment opportunity. For middle market holdings, the path to exit an investment is often discussed at credit committee meetings, including restructurings, acquisitions and sale to strategic buyers. Since most middle market investments are illiquid, exits are driven by a sale of the portfolio company or a refinancing of the portfolio company's debt. 
   Portfolio & Risk Management
              Our Advisor utilizes Bain Capital Credit's Private Credit Group for the daily monitoring of its respective credits after an investment has been made. Our Advisor believes that the ongoing monitoring of financial performance and market developments of portfolio investments is critical to successful investment management. Accordingly, our Advisor is actively involved in an on-going portfolio review process and attends board meetings. To the extent a portfolio investment is not meeting our Advisor's expectations, our Advisor takes corrective action when it deems appropriate, which may include raising interest rates, gaining a more influential role on its board, taking warrants and, where appropriate, restructuring the balance sheet to take control of the company. Our Advisor will utilize the Bain Capital Credit Risk and Oversight Committee. The Risk and Oversight Committee is responsible for monitoring and reviewing risk management, including portfolio risk, counterparty risk and firm-wide risk issues. In addition to the methods noted above, there are a number of proprietary methods and tools used through all levels of Bain Capital Credit to manage portfolio risk.

     Investment Strategy 
               The Advisor, through the resources and personnel provided by Bain Capital Credit through the Resource Sharing Agreement, uses detailed business, industry and competitive analyses to make investments. In evaluating potential opportunities, Bain Capital Credit's investment professionals typically complete market analyses to assess the attractiveness of a given industry and a specific investment and monitor, on an ongoing basis, financial performance and market developments. The Advisor's approach to making investments generally involves evaluating the following business characteristics: market definition, market size and growth prospects, competitive analysis, historical financial performance, margin analysis and cost structure, quality of earnings, capital structure, access to capital markets and regulatory, risk analysis, tax and legal matters. Additionally, the Advisor places significant emphasis on the quality and track record of the controlling stockholders and management team as well as careful consideration to the underlying deal structure and documentation. When considering an investment that meets the Company's return objectives, the Advisor seeks to mitigate downside risk. 
               We seek to create a broad and varied portfolio of investments across various industries as a method to manage risk and capitalize on specific sector trends, all concentrated in a small number of industries. 
   Investment Focus 
               Our primary focus is capitalizing on senior middle market lending opportunities. We seek to provide risk adjusted returns and current income to investors by investing primarily in middle market companies with between $10.0 million and $150.0 million in EBITDA. However, we may, from time to time, invest in larger or smaller companies. We focus on senior investments with a first or second lien on collateral and strong structures and documentation intended to protect the lender. We generally seek to retain effective voting control in respect of the loans or particular class of securities in which we invest through maintaining affirmative voting positions or negotiating consent rights that allow us to retain a blocking position. We may also invest in mezzanine debt and other junior securities, including common and preferred equity, on an opportunistic basis, and in secondary purchases of assets or portfolios, but such investments are not the principal focus of our investment strategy. We may also invest, from time to time, in distressed debt, debtor in possession loans, structured products, structurally subordinate loans, investments with deferred interest features, zero coupon securities and defaulted securities. The Company may also invest, from time to time, in equity securities, distressed debt, debtor in possession loans, structured products, structurally subordinate loans, investments with deferred interest features, zero coupon securities and defaulted securities. Leverage is expected to be utilized to help the Company meet its investment objective. Any such leverage, if incurred, is expected to increase the total capital available for investment by the Company. As a BDC, we may also invest up to 30% of our portfolio opportunistically in "non qualifying" portfolio investments, such as investments in non U.S. companies. 
               In addition, we have invested with Antares Midco Inc. ("Antares") in a joint venture, Antares Bain Capital Complete Financing Solution LLC ("ABCS"). ABCS's principal purpose is to make investments in senior secured unitranche loans. Investment decisions of ABCS require the consent of both the Investment Advisor and Antares Credit Opportunities Manager LLC, as representatives of the Company and Antares, respectively. We will also seek to collaborate with Antares to provide other senior secured loans to middle-market companies. ABCS is not a qualifying asset under Section 55 (a) of the 1940 Act. 
               We may invest in securities that are rated below investment grade by rating agencies or that would be rated below investment grade if they were rated (i.e. junk bonds). See "Item 1A. Risk FactorsRisks Related to Our InvestmentsThe lack of liquidity in our investments may adversely affect our business." Our investments also may include non-cash income features, including PIK interest and OID. See "Item 1A. Risk FactorsRisks Related to Our InvestmentsOur investments in OID and PIK interest income may expose 
 14

    us to risks associated with such income being required to be included in accounting income and taxable income prior to receipt of cash."

              The Advisor monitors our portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. It monitors the financial trends of each portfolio company to determine if they are meeting their respective business plans and to assess the appropriate course of action for each company. The Advisor has several methods of evaluating and monitoring the performance and fair value of our investments, which may include the following:
 

 assessment of success in adhering to the portfolio company's business plan and compliance with covenants; 
 periodic or regular contact with portfolio company management and, if appropriate, the financial or strategic sponsor to discuss financial
position, requirements and accomplishments; 
 comparisons to our other portfolio companies in the industry, if any; 
 attendance at and participation in board meetings or presentations by portfolio companies; and 

 15

   

 review of monthly and quarterly consolidated financial statements and financial projections of portfolio companies. 

               The Advisor rates the investments in our portfolio at least quarterly and it is possible that the rating of a portfolio investment may be reduced or increased over time. For investments rated 3 or 4, the Advisor enhances its level of scrutiny over the monitoring of such portfolio company. Our internal performance ratings do not constitute any rating of investments by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization or represent or reflect any third-party assessment of any of our investments. 
 

 An investment is rated 1 if, in the opinion of the Advisor, it is performing above underwriting expectations, and the business trends and risk
factors are generally favorable, which may include the performance of the portfolio company or the likelihood of a potential exit. 
 An investment is rated 2 if, in the opinion of the Advisor, it is performing as expected at the time of our underwriting and there are
generally no concerns about the portfolio company's performance or ability to meet covenant requirements, interest payments or principal amortization, if applicable. All new investments or acquired
investments in new portfolio companies are initially given a rating of 2. 
 An investment is rated 3 if, in the opinion of the Advisor, the investment is performing below underwriting expectations and there may be
concerns about the portfolio company's performance or trends in the industry, including as a result of factors such as declining performance, non-compliance with debt covenants or delinquency in loan
payments (but generally not more than 180 days past due). 
 An investment is rated 4 if, in the opinion of the Advisor, the investment is performing materially below underwriting expectations. For debt
investments, most of or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance and payments are substantially delinquent. Investments rated 4 are not anticipated to be repaid in full, if applicable, and
there is significant risk that we may realize a substantial loss on our investment.

  Competition 
               Our primary competitors in providing financing to middle-market companies include public and private funds, other business development companies, commercial and investment banks, commercial financing companies and, to the extent they provide an alternative form of financing, private equity and hedge funds. Some of our competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. For example, we believe some competitors may have access to funding sources that are not available to us. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships than us. Furthermore, many of our competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions that the 1940 Act imposes on us as a BDC or to the distribution and other requirements we must satisfy to maintain our qualification as a RIC. 
               We expect to use the expertise of the investment professionals of Bain Capital Credit to which we have access to assess investment risks and determine appropriate pricing for our investments in portfolio companies. In addition, we expect that the relationships of Bain Capital Credit will enable us to learn about, and compete effectively for, financing opportunities with attractive middle-market companies in the industries in which we seek to invest. For additional information concerning the competitive risks we face, see "Item 1A. Risk FactorsRisks Relating to Our Business and StructureWe operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities, which could reduce returns and result in losses." 
 Fees and Expenses 
               Our primary operating expenses include the payment of fees to the Advisor under the Investment Advisory Agreement, our allocable portion of overhead expenses under the Administration Agreement and other operating costs described below. We bear all other out-of-pocket costs and expenses of our operations and transactions, including:
  
 our operational and organizational costs; 

 the costs of any public offerings of our common stock and other securities, including registration and listing fees;  

 cost of calculating our net asset value, including the cost and expenses of any third-party valuation services;  

 fees and expenses payable to third parties relating to evaluating, making and disposing of investments, including our Advisor's or its affiliates' travel expenses, research costs and out-of-pocket 

 17

   
fees
and expenses associated with performing due diligence and reviews of prospective investments, monitoring our investments and, if necessary, enforcing our rights; 

  
 interest payable on debt and other borrowing costs, if any, incurred to finance our investments; 

 costs of effecting sales and repurchases of our common stock and other securities; 

 the base management fee and any incentive fee; 

 distributions on our common stock; 

 transfer agent and custody fees and expenses; 

 the allocated costs incurred by the Administrator in providing managerial assistance to those portfolio companies that request it;  

 other expenses incurred by BCSF Advisors or us in connection with administering our business, including payments made to third-party providers of goods or services; 

 brokerage fees and commissions; 

 federal and state registration fees; 

 U.S. federal, state and local taxes; 

 independent directors' fees and expenses; 

 costs associated with our reporting and compliance obligations under the 1940 Act and applicable U.S. federal and state securities laws;  

 costs of any reports, proxy statements or other notices to our stockholders, including printing costs;  

 costs of holding stockholder meetings; 

 our fidelity bond; 

 directors and officers' errors and omissions liability insurance, and any other insurance premiums; 

 litigation, indemnification and other non-recurring or extraordinary expenses; 

 direct costs and expenses of administration and operation, including printing, mailing, long distance telephone, staff, audit, compliance, tax and legal costs; 

 fees and expenses associated with marketing efforts; 

 dues, fees and charges of any trade association of which we are a member; and 

 all other expenses reasonably incurred by us or the Administrator in connection with administering our business. 

               To the extent that expenses to be borne by us are paid by BCSF Advisors, we will generally reimburse BCSF Advisors for such expenses. To the extent the Administrator outsources any of its functions, we will pay the fees associated with such functions on a direct basis without profit to the Administrator. We also reimburse the Administrator for its costs and expenses and our allocable portion of overhead incurred by it in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent 
 18

   and compensation paid to or compensatory distributions received by our officers (including our Chief Compliance Officer and Chief Financial Officer) and any of their respective staff who provide services to us, operations staff who provide services to us, internal audit staff, if any, to the extent internal audit performs a role in our Sarbanes-Oxley internal control assessment and fees paid to third-party providers for goods or services. Our allocable portion of overhead will be determined by the Administrator, which expects to use various methodologies such as allocation based on the percentage of time certain individuals devote, on an estimated basis, to our business and affairs, and will be subject to oversight by the Board. The sub-administrator is paid its compensation for performing its sub-administrative services under the sub-administration agreement. We incurred expenses related to the sub-administrator of $0.8 million, $0.5 million and $0.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, which is included in professional fees on the consolidated statements of operations. 
               The fee we pay our Advisor is higher after the completion of the IPO. With respect to any period prior to the date of the IPO, pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement and a waiver agreement with our Advisor, all base management fees in excess of an annual rate of 0.75% of the aggregate gross assets excluding cash and cash equivalents were contractually waived by our Advisor and not subject to recoupment by our Advisor. As a result, upon completion of the IPO, the base management fee has increased to an annual rate of 1.5% of our gross assets. For the period from the date of the IPO through December 31, 2018, the Advisor has voluntarily waived its right to receive the Base Management Fee in excess of 0.75%. If the base management fee waivers, contractual and voluntary, had not been in place for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the base management fee charged would have increased by $8.8 million, $2.9 million and $0.2 million, respectively. Further, upon completion of the IPO, we pay our Advisor a 17.5% incentive fee based on pre-incentive fee net investment income and capital gains, an increase from 15.0% prior to the completion of the IPO. For the period from the date of the IPO through December 31, 2018, the Advisor has voluntarily waived its right to receive the incentive fee in excess of 15.0%. If the incentive fee waivers, contractual and voluntary, had not been in place for the year ended December 31, 2018, the incentive fee charged would have increased by $1.9 million. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, there were no incentive fee waivers. In addition, prior to the completion of the IPO, our Administrator did not seek reimbursement for certain expenses payable by us under the Administration Agreement. 
               All of the foregoing expenses are ultimately borne by our stockholders. 
               From time to time, the Administrator or its affiliates may pay third-party providers of goods or services. We will reimburse the Administrator or such affiliates thereof for any such amounts paid on our behalf. The Administrator will waive its right to be reimbursed in the event that such reimbursements would cause any distributions to our stockholders to constitute a return of capital. 
               The Advisor is authorized to determine the broker to be used for each securities transaction. In selecting brokers to execute transactions, the Advisor need not solicit competitive bids and does not have an obligation to seek the lowest available commission cost. In selecting brokers, the Advisor may or may not negotiate "execution only" commission rates and thus we may be deemed to be paying for other services provided by the broker that are included in the commission rate. In negotiating commission rates, the Advisor will take into account the financial stability and reputation of the broker and the brokerage, research and other services provided to us, the Advisor and other customers of the Advisor and its affiliates by such broker, even though we may not, in any particular instance, be the direct or indirect beneficiaries of the research or other services provided and the base management fee payable to the Advisor is not reduced because it receives such services. In addition, the Advisor may direct commissions to certain brokers that on the foregoing basis may furnish other services to us, the Advisor and other customers of the Advisor and its affiliates, such as telephone lines, news and quotation equipment, electronic office equipment, account record keeping and clerical services, trading software, financial publications and economic consulting services. As a result of the brokerage practices described above, the 
 19

   levels of commission paid and prices paid or received by us in securities transactions may be less favorable than in securities transactions effected on a best price and execution basis. 
               The Advisor engaged placement agents to assist with the placement of the Company's shares, and may engage additional or different placement agents in the future. The Advisor and/or investors referred by a placement agent shall pay all compensation to the placement agents. The Company did not pay compensation to any placement agents in connection with the Company's initial private offering (the "Private Offering"). The prospect of receiving placement fees or other compensation may provide placement agents and/or their salespersons with an incentive to favor sales of the shares of the Company over the sale of interests of other investments with respect to which the placement agent does not receive such additional compensation, or receives lower levels of additional compensation. 
   Capital Resources and Borrowings 
               We anticipate cash to be generated from future offerings of securities and cash flows from operations, including interest earned from the temporary investment of cash in cash equivalents, U.S. government securities and other high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less. Additionally, we are permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of stock senior to our common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least equal to 200% immediately after each such issuance. Effective February 2, 2019, following shareholder approval of the reduce asset coverage proposal, the Company may maintain an asset coverage ratio of only 150%. Furthermore, while any indebtedness and senior securities remain outstanding, we must make provisions to prohibit any distribution to our stockholders or the repurchase of such securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the distribution or repurchase. In connection with borrowings, our lenders may require us to pledge assets, investor commitments to fund capital calls and/or the proceeds of those capital calls. In addition, the lenders may ask us to comply with positive or negative covenants that could have an effect on our operations. 
 SMBC Revolving Credit Agreement 
               On December 22, 2016, we entered into the revolving credit agreement (the "SMBC Revolving Credit Agreement"). The maximum commitment amount under the SMBC Revolving Credit Facility was $150.0 million, and may be increased up to $350.0 million ("Maximum Commitment") with the consent of SMBC or reduced upon our request. Effective July 31, 2018, we reduced the commitment amount under the SMBC Revolving Credit Facility to $85.0 million. Proceeds under the SMBC Revolving Credit Facility may be used for any purpose permitted under our organizational documents, including general corporate purposes such as the making of investments. The SMBC Revolving Credit Agreement contains certain covenants, including maintaining an asset coverage ratio of total assets to total borrowings of at least 200%. 
               Borrowings under the SMBC Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus a margin. The SMBC Revolving Credit Facility was accruing interest expense at a rate of LIBOR plus 1.40%. We pay an unused commitment fee of: (a) where the Maximum Commitment which is unused on such date is greater than fifty (50) percent of the Maximum Commitment, a rate of 20 basis points (0.20%) per annum; or (b) where the Maximum Commitment which is unused on such date is less than or equal to fifty (50) percent of the Maximum Commitment, a rate of 15 basis points (0.15%) per annum. Interest is payable in arrears either on a one month, two month, three month or six month LIBOR period. Any amounts borrowed under the SMBC Revolving Credit Facility, and all accrued and unpaid interest, will be due and payable, on the earliest of: (a) December 22, 2019; (b) the date upon which SMBC declares the obligations, or the obligations become, due and payable after the occurrence of an event of default under the SMBC Revolving Credit Facility; (c) the date upon which we terminate the commitments under the SMBC Revolving Credit Facility; and (d) 45 days prior to the 
 20

   earlier of (1) the date upon which the commitment period under the subscription agreements terminates and (2) the date upon which the ability to make capital calls and receive capital contributions otherwise terminates. 
               On November 21, 2018, the SMBC Revolving Credit Facility was terminated. The proceeds from the initial public offering on November 15, 2018, were used to repay the total outstanding debt. 
   BCSF Revolving Credit Facility 
               On October 4, 2017, we entered into the revolving credit agreement (the "BCSF Revolving Credit Facility") with us, as equity holder, BCSF I, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly owned and consolidated subsidiary of the Company, as borrower, and Goldman Sachs Bank USA, as sole lead arranger ("Goldman Sachs"). The BCSF Revolving Credit Facility was subsequently amended on May 15, 2018 to reflect certain clarifications regarding margin requirements and hedging currencies. The maximum commitment amount under the BCSF Revolving Credit Facility is $500.0 million, and may be increased up to $750.0 million. Proceeds of the loans under the BCSF Revolving Credit Facility may be used to acquire certain qualifying loans and such other uses as permitted under the BCSF Revolving Credit Facility. The BCSF Revolving Credit Facility includes customary affirmative and negative covenants, including certain limitations on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and liens, as well as usual and customary events of default for revolving credit facilities of this nature. As of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with these covenants. 
               Borrowings under the BCSF Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at LIBOR plus a margin. As of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the BCSF Revolving Credit Facility was accruing interest expense at a rate of LIBOR plus 2.50%. We pay an unused commitment fee of 30 basis points (0.30%) per annum. Interest is payable quarterly in arrears. Any amounts borrowed under the BCSF Revolving Credit Facility, and all accrued and unpaid interest, will be due and payable, on the earliest of: (a) October 5, 2022 and (b) the date upon which all loans shall become due and payable in full, whether by acceleration or otherwise. 
               BCSF I, LLC is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and Borrower under the BCSF Revolving Credit Facility. BCSF I, LLC has entered into an investment management agreement with the Company as of October 4, 2017, pursuant to which the Company manages the BCSF I, LLC investment program and related activities. All intercompany transactions between BCSF I, LLC and the Company are eliminated in consolidation. 
   2018-1 Notes 
               On September 28, 2018, (the "2018-1 Closing Date"), the Company, through BCC Middle Market CLO 2018-1 LLC (the "2018-1 Issuer"), a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly owned and consolidated subsidiary of the Company, completed its $451.2 million term debt securitization (the "CLO Transaction"). The notes issued in connection with the CLO Transaction (the "2018-1 Notes") are secured by a diversified portfolio of the Issuer consisting primarily of middle market loans and participation interests in middle market loans, the majority of which are senior secured loans (the "2018-1 Portfolio"). At the 2018-1 Closing Date, the 2018-1 Portfolio was comprised of assets transferred from the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries. All transfers were eliminated in consolidation and there were no realized gains or losses recognized in the CLO Transaction.

  Dividend Reinvestment Plan 
               We have adopted a DRIP that provides for the reinvestment of dividends and other distributions on behalf of our stockholders, unless a stockholder elects to receive cash. As a result, if our Board declares a cash distribution, then our stockholders who acquire shares of our common stock after our listing and have not elected to "opt out" of our DRIP will have their cash distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock as described below. Any stockholders who held shares of our common stock prior to our listing had to opt in to the DRIP. 
 Administration 
               We do not currently have any employees. Each officer of the Company is also an employee of the Advisor or its affiliates. See "Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance."
               Our day-to-day investment operations are managed by the Advisor. Pursuant to its Resource Sharing Agreement with Bain Capital Credit, the Advisor has access to the individuals who comprise the Advisor's Credit Committee, and a team of additional experienced investment professionals who, collectively, comprise the Advisor's investment team. The Advisor may hire additional investment professionals to provide services to us, based upon its needs. See "Item 1. Business-GeneralInvestment Advisory Agreement; Administration Agreement." 
 The Private Offering 
               Our Initial Closing occurred on October 6, 2016 and the Company commenced operations on October 13, 2016. We have entered into separate Subscription Agreements with a number of investors for the Private Offering. Each investor will make a capital commitment to purchase shares of our common stock pursuant to the Subscription Agreements. Investors will be required to make capital contributions to purchase shares of the Company's common stock each time the Company delivers a drawdown notice, which will be delivered at least 10 business days prior to the required funding date, in an aggregate amount not to exceed their respective capital commitments. All purchases will generally be made pro rata in accordance with the investors' capital commitments, at a per-share price as determined by the Board (including any committee thereof) as of the end of the most recent calendar quarter or such other date determined by the Board prior to the date of the applicable drawdown notice. The per-share price shall be at least equal to the net asset value per share in accordance with the limitations under Section 23 of the 1940 Act. The Board may set the per-share price above the net asset value per share based on a variety of factors, including without limitation the total amount of the Company's organizational and other expenses. Following the IPO, investors were released from any further obligation to purchase additional shares, subject to certain exceptions. Prior to the IPO, no investor was permitted to sell, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of its shares or capital commitment unless the Company provides its prior written consent and the transfer is otherwise made in accordance with applicable law. 
               The Company filed an election on October 6, 2016 to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. Additional closings of the Private Offering may occur from time to time as determined by the Company. The Company reserves the right to conduct additional offerings of securities in the future in addition to the Private Offering. In the event that the Company enters into Subscription Agreements with one or more investors after the initial drawdown, each such investor will be required to make purchases of shares of common stock (each, a "Catch-up Purchase") on one or more dates to be determined by the Company. The aggregate purchase price of the Catch-up Purchases will be equal to an amount necessary to ensure that, upon payment of the aggregate purchase price, such investor will have contributed the same percentage of its capital commitment to the Company as all investors whose subscriptions were accepted at previous closings. Catch-up Purchases will be made at a per-share price as determined by the Board (including any committee thereof) as of the end of the most recent calendar quarter or such other date as 
 22

   determined by the Board prior to the date of the applicable drawdown notice. The per-share price shall be at least equal to the net asset value per share of the Company's common stock in accordance with the limitations under Section 23 of the 1940 Act. The Board may set the per-share price above the net asset value per share based on a variety of factors, including without limitation the total amount of the Company's organizational and other expenses. 
               In addition to all legal remedies available to the Company, failure by an investor to purchase additional common stock when requested by the Company will (following a cure period of ten business days) result in that investor being subject to certain default provisions set forth in the Subscription Agreements. Defaulting investors may also forfeit their right to participate in purchasing additional shares on any future drawdown date or otherwise participate in any future investments in the Company. 
               Except as provided above, three and a half years following the Initial Closing (the "Commitment Period"), investors in the Private Offering will be released from any further obligation to purchase additional shares of common stock, except to the extent necessary to (a) pay Company expenses, including base management fee, any amounts that may become due under any borrowings or other financings or similar obligations and any other liabilities, contingent or otherwise, in each case to the extent they relate to the Commitment Period, (b) complete investments in any transactions for which there are binding written agreements as of the end of the Commitment Period (including investments that are funded in phases), (c) fund follow-on investments made in existing portfolio companies that, in the aggregate, do not exceed 10% of total commitments, (d) fund obligations under any Company guarantee or indemnity made during the Commitment Period and/or (e) fund any defaulted commitments. Upon the commencement of the IPO, the Private Offering has ended and the Commitment Period has terminated. 
   Regulation as a Business Development Company 
               We have elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. A BDC must be organized in the United States for the purpose of investing in or lending to primarily private companies and making significant managerial assistance available to them. A BDC may use capital provided by public stockholders and from other sources to make long-term, private investments in businesses. A publicly-traded BDC provides stockholders the ability to retain the liquidity of a publicly-traded stock while sharing in the possible benefits, if any, of investing in primarily privately owned companies. 
               We may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or withdraw our election as, a BDC unless authorized by vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities, as required by the 1940 Act. A majority of the outstanding voting securities of a company is defined under the 1940 Act as the lesser of: (a) 67% or more of such company's voting securities present at a meeting if more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of such company are present or represented by proxy, or (b) more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of such company. We do not anticipate any substantial change in the nature of our business. 
               As with other companies regulated by the 1940 Act, a BDC must adhere to certain substantive regulatory requirements. A majority of our directors must be persons who are not interested persons, as that term is defined in the 1940 Act. Additionally, we are required to provide and maintain a bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to protect the BDC. Furthermore, as a BDC, we are prohibited from protecting any director or officer against any liability to us or our stockholders arising from willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such person's office. 
               As a BDC, we are required to meet an asset coverage ratio, defined under the 1940 Act as the ratio of our total assets (less all liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities) to our outstanding senior securities, of at least 200% after each issuance of senior securities. Effective February 2, 
 23

   2019, following stockholder approval of the reduced asset coverage requirements, the Company must maintain an asset coverage ratio of only 150%. We may also be prohibited under the 1940 Act from knowingly participating in certain transactions with our affiliates without the prior approval of our directors who are not interested persons and, in some cases, prior approval by the SEC. As a BDC, we are limited in our ability to invest in any portfolio company in which the Advisor or any of its affiliates currently has an investment or to make any co-investments with the Advisor or its affiliates without an exemptive order from the SEC, subject to certain exceptions. 
               We do not intend to acquire securities issued by any investment company that exceed the limits imposed by the 1940 Act. Under these limits, except for registered money market funds, we generally cannot acquire more than 3% of the voting stock of any investment company, invest more than 5% of the value of our total assets in the securities of one investment company or invest more than 10% of the value of our total assets in the securities of investment companies in the aggregate. The portion of our portfolio invested in securities issued by investment companies ordinarily will subject our stockholders to additional expenses. Our investment portfolio is also subject to diversification requirements by virtue of our intention to qualify as a RIC for U.S. tax purposes. 
               We will generally not be able to issue and sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share. We may, however, sell our common stock, or warrants, options or rights to acquire our common stock, at a price below the then-current net asset value of our common stock if the Board determines that such sale is in our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders, and our stockholders approve such sale. In addition, we may generally issue new shares of our common stock at a price below net asset value in rights offerings to existing stockholders, in payment of distributions and in certain other limited circumstances. 
               As a BDC, we are subject to certain risks and uncertainties. See "Item 1A. Risk Factors." 
 



Qualifying Assets 


               We may invest up to 30% of our portfolio opportunistically in "non-qualifying assets", which will be driven primarily through opportunities sourced through the Advisor. However, under the 1940 Act, a BDC may not acquire any asset other than assets of the type listed in Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, which are referred to as "qualifying assets," unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the BDC's total assets. The principal categories of qualifying assets relevant to our proposed business are the following: 
 

(1)securities
purchased in transactions not involving any public offering from the issuer of such securities, which issuer (subject to certain limited exceptions) is an
eligible portfolio company, or from any person who is, or has been during the preceding 13 months, an affiliated person of an eligible portfolio company, or from any other person, subject to
such rules as may be prescribed by the SEC. An eligible portfolio company is defined in the 1940 Act as any issuer which:


(a)is
organized under the laws of, and has its principal place of business in, the United States;
(b)is
not an investment company (other than a small business investment company wholly owned by the BDC) or a company that would be an investment company but for
certain exclusions under the 1940 Act; and 


 24

   


(c)satisfies
either of the following:


i.does
not have any class of securities that is traded on a national securities exchange or has any class of securities listed on a national securities exchange
subject to a $250.0 million market capitalization maximum; or;
ii.is
controlled by a BDC or a group of companies including a BDC the BDC actually exercises a controlling influence over the management or policies of the eligible
portfolio company, and, as a result, the BDC has an affiliated person who is a director of the eligible portfolio company.




(2)securities
of any eligible portfolio company which we control;
(3)securities
purchased in a private transaction from a U.S. issuer that is not an investment company or from an affiliated person of the issuer, or in transactions
incident thereto, if the issuer is in bankruptcy and subject to reorganization or if the issuer, immediately prior to the purchase of its securities, was unable to meet its obligations as they came
due without material assistance other than conventional lending or financing arrangements;
(4)securities
of an eligible portfolio company purchased from any person in a private transaction if there is no ready market for such securities and we already own 60%
of the outstanding equity of the eligible portfolio company;
(5)securities
received in exchange for or distributed on or with respect to securities described in (1) through (4) above, or pursuant to the exercise of
warrants or rights relating to such securities; and
(6)cash,
cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment. 

 Limitations on Leverage 
               As a BDC, we are required to meet an asset coverage ratio, defined under the 1940 Act as the ratio of our total assets (less all liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities) to our outstanding senior securities. On November 28, 2018, the Board approved the reduction of the Company's asset coverage requirements in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act to 150% and recommended the stockholders to vote in favor of the proposal at the special stockholder meeting on February 1, 2019. On February 1, 2019, the Company's stockholders approved the application of the reduced asset coverage. Effective February 2, 2019, the Company is permitted to borrow amounts such that its asset coverage ratio is at least 150% after such borrowing (if certain requirements are met), rather than 200%, as previously required. 
 Managerial Assistance to Portfolio Companies 
               A BDC must have been organized under the laws of, and have its principal place of business in, any state or states within the United States and must be operated for the purpose of making investments in the types of securities described in (1), (2) or (3) above. However, in order to count portfolio securities as qualifying assets for the purpose of the 70% test, the BDC must either control the issuer of the securities or must offer to make available to the issuer of the securities (other than small and solvent companies described above) significant managerial assistance; except that, where the BDC purchases such securities in conjunction with one or more other persons acting together, one of the other persons in the group may make available such managerial assistance. Making available managerial assistance means, among other 
 25

   things, any arrangement whereby the BDC, through its directors or officers, offers to provide, and, if accepted, does so provide, significant guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company. 
   Monitoring Investments 
               In most cases, we will not have influence over the Board of Directors of our portfolio companies. In some instances, the Advisor's investment professionals may obtain board representation or observation rights in conjunction with our investments. In conjunction with the Advisor's Credit Committee and the Board, the Advisor will take an active approach in monitoring all investments, which includes reviews of financial performance on at least a quarterly basis and may include discussions with management and/or the equity sponsor. The monitoring process will begin with structuring terms and conditions which require the timely delivery and access to critical financial and business information regarding portfolio companies. 
 Temporary Investments 
               Pending investment in other types of "qualifying assets," as described above, our investments may consist of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment, which we refer to, collectively, as "temporary investments," so that 70% of our assets are qualifying assets. See "Item 1. Business  Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax ConsequencesElection to be Subject to be Taxed as a RIC." Typically, we will invest in U.S. Treasury bills or in repurchase agreements, provided that such agreements are fully collateralized by cash or securities issued by the U.S. government or its agencies. A repurchase agreement involves the purchase by an investor, such as us, of a specified security and the simultaneous agreement by the seller to repurchase it at an agreed-upon future date and at a price which is greater than the purchase price by an amount that reflects an agreed-upon interest rate. There is no percentage restriction on the proportion of our assets that may be invested in such repurchase agreements. However, if more than 25% of our gross assets constitute repurchase agreements from a single counterparty, we may not satisfy the diversification tests in order to qualify as a RIC. Thus, we do not intend to enter into repurchase agreements with a single counterparty in excess of this limit. The Advisor will monitor the creditworthiness of the counterparties with which we enter into repurchase agreement transactions. 
 Senior Securities 
               Historically, the 1940 Act has permitted us to issue "senior securities," including borrowing money from banks or other financial institutions, only in amounts such that our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, equals at least 200% after such incurrence or issuance. In March 2018, the Small Business Credit Availability Act, or the SBCAA, was enacted into law. The SBCAA, among other things, amended the 1940 Act to reduce the asset coverage requirements applicable to business development companies from 200% to 150% so long as the business development company meets certain disclosure requirements and obtains certain approvals. On November 28, 2018, the Board approved the reduction of the Company's asset coverage requirements in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act to 150% and recommended the stockholders to vote in favor of the proposal at the special stockholder meeting on February 1, 2019. On February 1, 2019, the Company's stockholders approved the application of the reduced asset coverage. Effective February 2, 2019, the Company is permitted to borrow amounts such that its asset coverage ratio is at least 150% after such borrowing (if certain requirements are met), rather than 200%, as previously required. 
               While any senior securities remain outstanding, we must make provisions to prohibit any distribution to our stockholders or the repurchase of such securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the distribution or repurchase. We may also borrow amounts up to 5% of the value of our total assets for temporary or emergency purposes without regard to asset 
 26

   coverage. See "Item 1A. Risk FactorsRisks Relating to Our Business and StructureOur strategy involves a high degree of leverage. We intend to continue to finance our investments with borrowed money, which will magnify the potential for gain or loss on amounts invested and may increase the risk of investing in us. The risks of investment in a highly leverage fund include volatility and possible distribution restrictions." 
               The 1940 Act imposes limitations on a BDC's issuance of preferred shares, which are considered "senior securities" and thus are subject to the 150% asset coverage requirement described above. In addition, (i) preferred shares must have the same voting rights as the common stockholders (one share, one vote); and (ii) preferred stockholders must have the right, as a class, to appoint directors to the Board. 
   Code of Ethics 
               As required by Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act and Rule 204A-1 under the Advisers Act, respectively, we and the Advisor have adopted codes of ethics which apply to, among others, our and the Advisor's executive officers, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as well as the Advisor's officers, directors and employees. Our codes of ethics generally will not permit investments by our and the Advisor's personnel in securities that may be purchased or sold by us. 
               We hereby undertake to provide a copy of the codes to any person, without charge, upon request. Requests for a copy of the codes may be made in writing addressed to Investor Relations, Bain Capital Specialty Finance, Inc., 200 Clarendon Street, 37th Floor, Boston, Massachusetts 02116, Attention: Bain Capital Specialty Finance, Inc. Investor Relations, or by emailing us at creditinfo@baincapital.com. 
   Compliance Policies and Procedures 
               We and the Advisor have adopted and implemented written policies and procedures reasonably designed to detect and prevent violation of the federal securities laws and we are required to review these compliance policies and procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation and designate a Chief Compliance Officer to be responsible for administering the policies and procedures. 
   Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 
 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act") imposes a wide variety of regulatory requirements on publicly-held companies and their insiders. Many of these requirements affect us. For example:
 

 pursuant to Rule 13a-14 under the Exchange Act, our President and Chief Financial Officer must certify the accuracy of the consolidated
financial statements contained in our periodic reports; 
 pursuant to Item 307 of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), our periodic reports
must disclose our conclusions about the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures; 
 pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, our management must prepare an annual report regarding its assessment of our internal
control over financial reporting and, depending on our accelerated filer status, this report may be required to be audited by our independent public accounting firm, starting from the date on which we
cease to be an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act, must obtain an audit of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting performed by our independent registered public
accounting firm; and 

 27

   

 pursuant to Item 308 under Regulation S-K under the Securities Act and Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, our periodic
reports must disclose whether there were significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect these controls subsequent to the date
of their evaluation, including any corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses. 

               The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires us to review our current policies and procedures to determine whether we comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder. We will continue to monitor our compliance with all regulations that are adopted under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and will take actions necessary to ensure that we are in compliance therewith. 
   Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures 
               We will delegate our proxy voting responsibility to the Advisor. The Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures of the Advisor are set forth below. The guidelines will be reviewed periodically by the Advisor and our non-interested directors will receive a copy annually, and, accordingly, are subject to change. 
               An investment adviser registered under the Advisers Act has a fiduciary duty to act solely in the best interests of its clients. As part of this duty, the Advisor recognizes that conflicts of interest may arise from time to time in relation to proxy voting requirements. A conflict between the Advisor and any client can arise in a number of situations. The following non-exclusive examples illustrate conflicts of interest that could arise:
 

 A failure to vote in favor of a position supported by management may harm the relationship the Advisor or the Company has with the company; 
 A failure to vote in favor of a particular proposal may harm the relationship the Advisor or the Company has with the proponent of the
proposal; 
 A failure to vote for or against a particular proposal may adversely affect a business or personal relationship, such as when an officer of the
Advisor has a spouse or other relative who serves as a director of the company, is employed by the company or otherwise has an economic interest therein; or 
 Conflicts arising from investment positions held by affiliates of the Advisor. 

               These policies and procedures for voting proxies are intended to comply with Section 206 of, and Rule 206(4)-6 under, the Advisers Act. 
               The Advisor intends to vote proxies or similar corporate actions in accordance with the best interests of our shareholders, taking into account such factors as it deems relevant in its sole discretion. Upon receipt of a proxy request, the Advisor's Operations department contacts a senior investment professional responsible for the issuer. The senior investment professional communicates the proxy voting decision to Operations. The hard-copy documentation is completed by Operations and sent back to the appropriate party. Operations maintains a log of all proxy voting documentation received and the status thereof. 
   Privacy Principles 
               We are committed to maintaining the privacy of our stockholders and to safeguarding their non-public personal information. The following information is provided to help investors understand what personal information we collect, how we protect that information and why, in certain cases, we may share information with select other parties. 
 28

                 Pursuant to our privacy policy, we will not disclose any non-public personal information concerning any of our stockholders who are individuals unless the disclosure meets certain permitted exceptions under Regulation S-P under the Gramm  Leach Bliley Act, as amended. We generally will not use or disclose any stockholder information for any purpose other than as required by law. 
               We may collect non-public information about investors from our Subscription Agreements or other forms, such as name, address, account number and the types and amounts of investments, and information about transactions with us or our affiliates, such as participation in other investment programs, ownership of certain types of accounts or other account data and activity. We may disclose the information that we collect from our stockholders or former stockholders, as described above, only to our affiliates and service providers and only as allowed by applicable law or regulation. Any party that receives this information will use it only for the services required by us and as allowed by applicable law or regulation, and is not permitted to share or use this information for any other purpose. To protect the non-public personal information of individuals, we permit access only by authorized personnel who need access to that information to provide services to us and our stockholders. 
               In order to guard our stockholders' non-public personal information, we maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that are designed to comply with applicable law. Non-public personal information that we collect about our stockholders will generally be stored on secured servers. An individual stockholder's right to privacy extends to all forms of contact with us, including telephone, written correspondence and electronic media, such as the Internet. 
               Pursuant to our privacy policy, we will provide a clear and conspicuous notice to each investor that details our privacy policies and procedures at the time of the investor's subscription. 
   Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company 
               We currently are, and expect to remain, an "emerging growth company," as that term is used in the JOBS Act until the earliest of:
 

 the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of our initial public offering, or December 31, 2023; 
 the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues exceed $1.07 billion; 
 the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt; and 
 the date on which we qualify as a "large accelerated filer" as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the
market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates equals $700 million or more as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter. 

               Under the JOBS Act, we are exempt from the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which would require that our independent registered public accounting firm provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This may increase the risk that material weaknesses or other deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting go undetected. See Part I, Item 1A. of this Form 10-K "Risk FactorsRisks Related to the IPO and Our Common Stock  We will incur significant costs as a result of being a public company" and "Efforts to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act will involve significant expenditures, and non-compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may adversely affect us and the market price of our common stock."
 29



              In addition, Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act and Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act, as amended by Section 102(b) of the JOBS Act, provide that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. However, pursuant to Section 107 of the JOBS Act, we have chosen to "opt out" of such extended transition period, and as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Our decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.

   Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences 
               The following discussion is a general summary of the material U.S. federal income tax considerations applicable to us and to an investment in shares of our common stock. This summary does not purport to be a complete description of the income tax considerations applicable to such an investment. For example, we have not described certain considerations that may be relevant to certain types of holders subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws, including stockholders subject to the alternative minimum tax, tax-exempt organizations, insurance companies, dealers in securities, traders in securities that elect to mark-to-market their securities holdings, pass-through entities (including S-corporations) pension plans and trusts, financial institutions, real estate investment trusts ("REITs"), RICs, persons that have a functional currency (as defined in Section 985 of the Code) other than the U.S. dollar and financial institutions. This summary assumes that investors hold shares of our common stock as capital assets (within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code). The discussion is based upon the Code, Treasury regulations, and administrative and judicial interpretations, each as of the date of the filing of this prospectus and all of which are subject to change, possibly retroactively, which could affect the continuing validity of this discussion. We have not sought and will not seek any ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS"), regarding any offering of our securities. This summary does not discuss any aspects of U.S. estate or gift tax or foreign, state or local tax. It does not discuss the special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws that could result if we were to invest in tax-exempt securities or certain other investment assets. For purposes of this discussion, a "U.S. stockholder" is a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes:



 an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; 
 a corporation, or other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized in or under the laws of the
United States or any state thereof, including, for this purpose, the District of Columbia; 


 30

   


 a trust if (i) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or
more "United States persons" (as defined in the Code) have the authority to control all substantive decisions of the trust, or (ii) the trust has in effect a valid election to be treated as a
domestic trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes; or 
 an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source. 


               For purposes of this discussion, a "Non-U.S. stockholder" is a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock that is not a U.S. stockholder or a partnership (or an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
               If a partnership (including an entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) holds shares of our common stock, the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. A prospective investor that is a partner in a partnership that will hold shares of our common stock should consult its tax advisors with respect to the purchase, ownership and disposition of shares of our common stock. Tax matters are very complicated and the tax consequences to each stockholder of the ownership and disposition of shares of our common stock will depend on the facts of his, her or its particular situation. You should consult your own tax adviser regarding the specific tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of shares of our common stock to you, including tax reporting requirements, the applicability of U.S. federal, state and local tax laws and non-U.S. tax laws, eligibility for the benefits of any applicable income tax treaty and the effect of any possible changes in the tax laws. 
   Election to be Subject to be Taxed as a RIC 
               We have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code, beginning with our taxable year ended December 31, 2016. As a RIC, we generally will not have to pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any net ordinary income or capital gains that we timely distribute to our stockholders as dividends. To qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements (as described below). In addition, we must distribute to our stockholders, for each taxable year, dividends of an amount at least equal to 90% of our "investment company taxable income," which is generally our net ordinary income plus the excess of realized net short-term capital gains over realized net long-term capital losses and determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid (the "Annual Distribution Requirement"). Although not required for us to maintain our RIC tax status, in order to preclude the imposition of a 4% nondeductible federal excise tax imposed on RICs, we must distribute to our stockholders in respect of each calendar year dividends of an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98% of our net ordinary income (taking into account certain deferrals and elections) for the calendar year, (2) 98.2% of the excess (if any) of our realized capital gains over our realized capital losses, or capital gain net income (adjusted for certain ordinary losses), generally for the one-year period ending on October 31 of the calendar year and (3) the sum of any net ordinary income plus capital gains net income for preceding years that were not distributed during such years and on which we paid no federal income tax (the "Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement"). If we qualify as a RIC and satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, then we will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of our investment company taxable income and net capital gain (generally, net long-term capital gain in excess of net short-term capital loss) that we timely distribute (or are deemed to timely distribute) as dividends to our stockholders. We will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the regular corporate rates on any income or capital gain not distributed (or deemed distributed) to our stockholders. 
 31

                 In order to qualify as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must, among other things:
 


 qualify and have in effect an election to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act at all times during each taxable year; 
 derive in each taxable year at least 90% of our gross income from dividends, interest, payments with respect to loans of certain securities,
gains from the sale of stock or other securities, net income derived from an interest in a "qualified publicly traded partnership" (as defined in the Code), or other income derived with respect to our
business of investing in such stock or securities (the "90% Income Test"); and 
 diversify our holdings so that at the end of each quarter of the taxable year (i) at least 50% of the value of our assets consists of
cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities, securities of other RICs, and other securities if such other securities of any one issuer do not represent more than 5% of the value of our assets
or more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer; and (ii) no more than 25% of the value of our assets is invested in the securities, other than U.S. government securities or
securities of other RICs, of one issuer or of two or more issuers that are controlled, as determined under applicable tax rules, by us and that are engaged in the same or similar or related trades or
businesses or in the securities of one or more qualified publicly traded partnerships (collectively, the "Diversification Tests"). 


               We may invest in partnerships, including qualified publicly traded partnerships, which may result in our being subject to state, local or foreign income, franchise or other tax liabilities. For the purpose of determining whether the Company satisfies the 90% Income Test and the Diversification Tests described above, the character of our distributive share of items of income, gain, losses, deductions and credits derived through any investments in companies that are treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes (other than certain publicly traded partnerships), or are otherwise treated as disregarded from us for U.S. federal income tax purposes, generally will be determined as if we realized these tax items directly. Further, for purposes of calculating the value of our investment in the securities of an issuer for purposes of determining the 25% requirement described above, the Company's proper proportion of any investment in the securities of that issuer that are held by a member of our "controlled group" must be aggregated with our investment in that issuer. A controlled group is one or more chains of corporations connected through stock ownership with us if (a) at least 20% of the total combined voting power of all classes of voting stock of each of the corporations is owned directly by one or more of the other corporations, and (b) we directly own at least 20% or more of the combined voting stock of at least one of the other corporations. 
               In addition, as a RIC we are subject to ordinary income and capital gain distribution requirements under U.S. federal excise tax rules for each calendar year. If we do not meet the required distributions we will be subject to a 4% nondeductible federal excise tax on the undistributed amount. The failure to meet U.S. federal excise tax distribution requirements will not cause us to lose our RIC status. Although we currently intend to make sufficient distributions each taxable year to satisfy the U.S. federal excise tax requirements, under certain circumstances, we may choose to retain taxable income or capital gains in excess of current year distributions into the next tax year in an amount less than what would trigger payments of federal income tax under Subchapter M of the Code. We may then be required to pay a 4% excise tax on such income or capital gains. 
               A RIC is limited in its ability to deduct expenses in excess of its investment company taxable income. If our deductible expenses in a given taxable year exceed our investment company taxable income, we may incur a net operating loss for that taxable year. However, a RIC is not permitted to carry forward net operating losses to subsequent taxable years and such net operating losses do not pass through to its 
 32

   stockholders. In addition, deductible expenses can be used only to offset investment company taxable income, not net capital gain. A RIC may not use any net capital losses (that is, the excess of realized capital losses over realized capital gains) to offset its investment company taxable income, but may carry forward such net capital losses, and use them to offset future capital gains, indefinitely. Any underwriting fees paid to us are not deductible. Due to these limits on deductibility of expenses and net capital losses, we may for tax purposes have aggregate taxable income for several taxable years that we are required to distribute and that is taxable to our stockholders even if such taxable income is greater than the net income we actually earn during those taxable years. 
               We may be required to recognize taxable income in circumstances in which we do not receive cash. For example, if we hold debt obligations that are treated under applicable tax rules as having OID (such as debt instruments with PIK interest or, in certain cases, with increasing interest rates or issued with warrants), we must include in income each year a portion of the OID that accrues over the life of the obligation, regardless of whether cash representing such income is received by us in the same taxable year. Because any OID accrued will be included in our investment company taxable income for the taxable year of accrual, we may be required to make a distribution to our stockholders in order to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement or the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement, even though we will not have received any corresponding cash amount. Furthermore, a portfolio company in which we hold equity or debt instruments may face financial difficulty that requires us to work out, modify, or otherwise restructure such equity or debt instruments. Any such restructuring could, depending upon the terms of the restructuring, cause us to incur unusable or nondeductible losses or recognize future non-cash taxable income. 
               Certain of our investment practices may be subject to special and complex U.S. federal income tax provisions that may, among other things, produce income that will not be qualifying income for purposes of the 90% Income Test. We intend to monitor our transactions and may make certain tax elections that are intended to maintain our status as a RIC and avoid a fund-level tax. 
               Gain or loss realized by us from warrants acquired by us as well as any loss attributable to the lapse of such warrants generally will be treated as capital gain or loss. Such gain or loss generally will be long term or short term, depending on how long we held a particular warrant. 
               Although we do not presently expect to do so, we are authorized to borrow funds and to sell assets in order to satisfy distribution requirements. However, under the 1940 Act, we are not permitted to make distributions to our stockholders while our debt obligations and other senior securities are outstanding unless certain "asset coverage" tests are met. Moreover, our ability to dispose of assets to meet our distribution requirements may be limited by (1) the illiquid nature of our portfolio and/or (2) other requirements relating to our qualification as a RIC, including the Diversification Tests. If we dispose of assets in order to meet the Annual Distribution Requirement or the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement, we may make such dispositions at times that, from an investment standpoint, are not advantageous. 
               Some of the income and fees that we may recognize, such as fees for providing managerial assistance, certain fees earned with respect to our investments, income recognized in a work-out or restructuring of a portfolio investment, or income recognized from an equity investment in an operating partnership, will not satisfy the 90% Income Test. In order to manage the risk that such income and fees might disqualify us as a RIC for a failure to satisfy the 90% Income Test, we may be required to recognize such income and fees indirectly through one or more entities treated as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Such corporations will be required to pay U.S. corporate income tax on their earnings, which ultimately will reduce our return on such income and fees.

     Failure to Qualify as a RIC 
               If we were unable to qualify for treatment as a RIC and are unable to cure the failure, for example, by disposing of certain investments quickly or raising additional capital to prevent the loss of RIC status, we would be subject to tax on all of our taxable income at regular corporate rates (and any applicable U.S. state and local taxes). The Code provides some relief from RIC disqualification due to failures to comply with the 90% Income Test and the Diversification Tests, although there may be additional taxes due in such cases. We cannot assure you that we would qualify for any such relief should we fail the 90% Income Test or the Diversification Tests. 
               Should failure occur, not only would all our taxable income be subject to tax at regular corporate rates (as well as any applicable U.S. state and local taxes), we would not be able to deduct dividend distributions to stockholders, nor would they be required to be made. Distributions, including distributions of net long-term capital gain, would generally be taxable to our stockholders as ordinary dividend income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits. Subject to certain limitations under the Code, certain corporate stockholders would be eligible to claim a dividends received deduction with respect to such dividends and non-corporate stockholders would generally be able to treat such dividends as "qualified dividend income," which is subject to reduced rates of U.S. federal income tax. Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits would be treated first as a return of capital to the extent of the stockholder's tax basis, and any remaining distributions would be treated as a capital gain. If we fail to qualify as a RIC, we may be subject to regular corporate tax on any net built-in gains with respect to certain of our assets (i.e., the excess of the aggregate gains, including items of income, over aggregate losses that would have been realized with respect to such assets if we had been liquidated) that we elect to recognize on requalification or when recognized over the next five taxable years.
