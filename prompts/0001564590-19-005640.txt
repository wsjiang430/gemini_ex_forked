Our primary source of revenue is generated by gaming operations, and we utilize our hotels, restaurants, bars, entertainment, racing, retail shops and other services to attract customers to our properties. 
 We were founded in 1973 by the Carano family with the opening of the Eldorado Hotel Casino in Reno, Nevada. In 1993, we partnered with MGM Resorts International to build Silver Legacy Resort Casino (“Silver Legacy”), the first mega-themed resort in Reno. In 2005, we acquired our first property outside of Reno when we purchased a casino in Shreveport, Louisiana, now known as Eldorado Shreveport. In September 2014, we merged with MTR Gaming Group, Inc. and acquired its three gaming and racing facilities in Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. The following year, in November 2015, we acquired Circus Circus Reno (“Circus Reno”) and the 50% membership interest in the Silver Legacy that was owned by MGM Resorts International. On May 1, 2017, we completed our acquisition of Isle of Capri Casinos, Inc. (“Isle” or “Isle of Capri”), adding 13 gaming properties to our portfolio. On August 7, 2018, we acquired the Elgin Riverboat Resort – Riverboat Casino d/b/a Grand Victoria Casino (“Elgin”) (“Elgin Acquisition”). On October 1, 2018, we completed our acquisition of Tropicana Entertainment, Inc. (“Tropicana”), adding seven properties to our portfolio (the “Tropicana Acquisition”).
 We own 22 of our casinos and lease or manage our remaining casinos, including five casinos that are subject to a master lease with GLP Capital, L.P., the operating partnership of Gaming and Leisure Properties, Inc. (“GLPI”), that we entered into in connection with the Tropicana Acquisition on October 1, 2018 (the “Master Lease”). (See full description under “Master Lease”).

Master Lease
 The Master Lease provides for the lease of land, buildings, structures and other improvements on the land (including barges and riverboats), easements and similar appurtenances to the land and improvements relating to the operation of the leased properties. Our properties that are currently subject to the Master Lease are Trop AC, Laughlin, Greenville, Baton Rouge and Evansville. The Master Lease provides for an initial term of fifteen years with no purchase option. At our option, the Master Lease may be extended for up to four five-year renewal terms beyond the initial 15-year term. If we elect to renew the term of the Master Lease, the renewal will be effective as to all, but not less than all, of the leased property then subject to the Master Lease. We do not have the ability to terminate its obligations under the Master Lease prior to its expiration without GLPI’s consent. The obligations of the tenant under the Master Lease are guaranteed by ERI.
 The rent payable under the Master Lease is comprised of “Base Rent” and “Percentage Rent.” Base rent is the sum of:
  
• | Building Base Rent: a fixed component equal to $60.9 million during the first year of the Master Lease, and thereafter escalated annually by 2%, subject to a cap that would cause the preceding year’s adjusted revenue to rent ratio for the properties in the aggregate not to fall below 1.20:1.00 for the first five years of the Master Lease and 1.80:1.00 thereafter; plus
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Land Base Rent: a fixed component equal to $13.4 million, subject to adjustment in the event of the termination of the Master Lease with respect to any of the leased properties.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The percentage rent payable under the Master Lease is adjusted every two years based on the actual net revenues of the leased properties during the two-year period then ended. The initial variable rent percentage, which is fixed for the first two years, is $13.4 million per year. The actual percentage increase is based on actual performance and may change materially.
 The Master Lease is commonly known as a triple net lease. Accordingly, in addition to rent, we are required to pay the following, among other things: (i) lease payments to the underlying ground lessor for properties that are subject to ground leases; (ii) facility maintenance costs; (iii) all insurance premiums for insurance with respect to the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties; (iv) taxes levied on or with respect to the leased properties (other than taxes on the income of the lessor); and (v) all utilities and other services necessary or appropriate for the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties.
 The foregoing summary of the Master Lease is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Master Lease, which has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  It was determined that the Master Lease did not meet the requirements of a normal leaseback under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 840 “Leases” due to prohibited forms of continuing involvement and is therefore accounted for as a financing obligation.

 The gaming industry is characterized by an increasingly high degree of competition and competition is intense in most of the markets in which we operate.  We compete with a variety of gaming operations, including land-based casinos, dockside casinos, riverboat casinos, casinos located on racing tracks and casinos located on Native American reservations as well as other forms of legalized gaming such as video gaming terminals (VGTs) at bars, restaurants and truck stops. We also compete, to a lesser extent, with other forms of legalized gaming and entertainment such as online gambling, bingo, pull tab games, card parlors, sports books, fantasy sports websites, “cruise-to-nowhere” operations, pari-mutuel or telephonic betting on horse racing and dog racing, state-sponsored lotteries, jai-alai, and, in the future, may compete with gaming at other venues. In addition, we compete more generally with other forms of entertainment for the discretionary spending of our customers.  Certain of our competitors are large gaming companies with greater name recognition and marketing and financial resources.  In some instances, particularly in the case of Native American casinos, our competitors pay lower taxes or no taxes.  These factors create additional challenges for us in competing for customers and accessing cash flow or financing to fund improvements for our casino and entertainment product that enable us to remain competitive.
Governmental Gaming Regulations
 The gaming and racing industries are highly regulated, and we must maintain our licenses and pay gaming taxes to continue our operations. We are subject to extensive regulation under laws, rules and supervisory procedures primarily in the jurisdictions where our facilities are located or docked. These laws, rules and regulations generally concern the responsibility, financial stability and characters of the owners, managers, and persons with financial interests in the gaming operations. If additional gaming regulations are adopted in a jurisdiction in which we operate, such regulations could impose restrictions or costs that could have a significant adverse effect on us. From time to time, various proposals have been introduced in legislatures of jurisdictions in which we have operations that, if enacted, could adversely affect the tax, regulatory, operational or other aspects of the gaming industry and us. We do not know whether or when such legislation will be enacted. Gaming companies are currently subject to significant state and local taxes and fees in addition to normal federal and state corporate income taxes, and such taxes and fees are subject to increase at any time. Any material increase in these taxes or fees could adversely affect us.
 Some jurisdictions, including those in which we are licensed, empower their regulators to investigate participation by licensees in gaming outside their jurisdiction and require access to periodic reports respecting those gaming activities. Violations of laws in one jurisdiction could result in disciplinary action in other jurisdictions.
 Under provisions of gaming laws in jurisdictions in which we have operations, and under our organizational documents, certain of our securities are subject to restriction on ownership which may be imposed by specified governmental authorities. The restrictions may require a holder of our securities to dispose of the securities or, if the holder refuses, or is unable, to dispose of the securities, we may be required to repurchase the securities.
 A more detailed description of the regulations to which we are subject is contained in Exhibit 99.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10‑K, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Reporting and Record‑Keeping Requirements
 We are required periodically to submit detailed financial and operating reports and furnish any other information about us and our subsidiaries that gaming authorities may require. We are required to maintain a current stock ledger that may be examined by gaming authorities at any time. If any securities are held in trust by an agent or by a nominee, the record holder may be required to disclose the identity of the beneficial owner to gaming authorities. A failure to make such disclosure may be grounds for finding the record holder unsuitable. Gaming authorities may, and in certain jurisdictions do, require certificates for our securities to bear a legend indicating that the securities are subject to specified gaming laws.
 Taxation
 Gaming companies are typically subject to significant taxes and fees in addition to normal federal, state and local income taxes, and such taxes and fees are subject to increase at any time. We pay substantial taxes and fees with respect to our operations. From time to time, federal, state, local and provincial legislators and officials have proposed changes in tax laws, or in the administration of such laws, affecting the gaming industry. It is not possible to determine with certainty the likelihood of changes in tax laws or in the administration of such laws.
Internal Revenue Service Regulations
 The Internal Revenue Service requires operators of casinos located in the United States to file information returns for U.S. citizens, including names and addresses of winners, for keno, bingo and slot machine winnings in excess of stipulated amounts. The Internal Revenue Service also requires operators to withhold taxes on some keno, bingo and slot machine winnings of nonresident aliens. We are unable to predict the extent to which these requirements, if extended, might impede or otherwise adversely affect operations of, and/or income from, the other games.
 Regulations adopted by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the Treasury Department (“FINCEN”) and the Nevada Gaming Authorities require the reporting of currency transactions in excess of $10,000 occurring within a gaming day, including identification of the patron by name and social security number. This reporting obligation began in May 1985 and may have resulted in the loss of gaming revenues to jurisdictions outside the United States which are exempt from the ambit of these regulations. In addition to currency transaction reporting requirements, suspicious financial activity is also required to be reported to FINCEN.
 Other Laws and Regulations
 Our businesses are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations in addition to gaming regulations. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages, food service, smoking, environmental matters, employees and employment practices, currency transactions, taxation, zoning and building codes, and marketing and advertising. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. Material changes, new laws or regulations, or material differences in interpretations by courts or governmental authorities could adversely affect our operating results.
 The sale of alcoholic beverages is subject to licensing, control and regulation by applicable local regulatory agencies. All licenses are revocable and are not transferable. The agencies involved have full power to limit, condition, suspend or revoke any license, and any disciplinary action could, and revocation would, have a material adverse effect upon our operations.
 Intellectual Property
 We use a variety of trade names, service marks, trademarks, patents and copyrights in our operations and believe that we have all the licenses necessary to conduct our continuing operations. We have registered several service marks, trademarks, patents and copyrights with the United States Patent and Trademark Office or otherwise acquired the licenses to use those which are material to conduct our business. We also own patents relating to unique casino games. We file copyright applications to protect our creative artworks, which are often featured in property branding, as well as our distinctive website content.

Seasonality
 Casino, hotel and racing operations in our markets are subject to seasonal variation. Seasonal weather conditions can frequently adversely affect transportation routes to each of our properties and may cause flooding and other effects that result in the closure of our properties. As a result, unfavorable seasonal conditions could have a material adverse effect on our operations.
Environmental Matters
 We are subject to various federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those relating to the use, storage, discharge, emission and disposal of hazardous materials and solid, animal and hazardous wastes and exposure to hazardous materials. Such laws and regulations can impose liability on potentially responsible parties, including the owners or operators of real property, to clean up, or contribute to the cost of cleaning up, sites at which hazardous wastes or materials were disposed of or released. In addition to investigation and remediation liabilities that could arise under such laws and regulations, we could also face personal injury, property damage, fines or other claims by third parties concerning environmental compliance or contamination or exposure to hazardous materials and could be subject to significant fines or penalties for any violations. We have from time to time been responsible for investigating and remediating, or contributing to remediation costs related to, contamination located at or near certain of our facilities, including contamination related to underground storage tanks and groundwater contamination arising from prior uses of land on which certain of our facilities are located. In addition, we have been, and may in the future be, required to manage, abate, remove or contain manure and wastewater generated by concentrated animal feeding operations due to our racetrack operations, mold, lead, asbestos‑containing materials or other hazardous conditions found in or on our properties. Although we have incurred, and expect that we will continue to incur, costs related to the investigation, identification and remediation of hazardous materials or conditions known or discovered to exist at our properties, those costs have not had, and are not expected to have, a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.
Employees and Labor Relations
 As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 18,700 employees. As of such date, we had 21 collective bargaining agreements covering approximately 3,400 employees. Two collective bargaining agreements are scheduled to expire in 2019, and we are currently renegotiating three collective bargaining agreements that expired in 2018. There can be no assurance that we will be able to extend or enter into replacement agreements. If we are able to extend or enter into replacement agreements, there can be no assurance as to whether the terms will be on comparable terms to the existing agreements.
