     ITEM 1.    BUSINESS 
  Overview 
         Unless the context otherwise requires, all references in this report to "Halcón," "our," "us," and "we" refer to Halcón Resources Corporation and its subsidiaries, as a common entity.
         Certain prior year financial statements are not comparable to our current year financial statements due to the adoption of fresh-start accounting. References to "Successor" or "Successor Company" relate to the financial position and results of operations of the reorganized Company subsequent to September 9, 2016. References to "Predecessor" or "Predecessor Company" relate to the financial position and results of operations of the Company prior to, and including, September 9, 2016.
         We are an independent energy company focused on the acquisition, production, exploration and development of onshore liquids-rich oil and natural gas assets in the United States. During 2017, we acquired certain properties in the Delaware Basin and divested our assets located in the Williston Basin in North Dakota (the Williston Divestiture) and in the El Halcón area of East Texas (the El Halcón Divestiture). As a result, our properties and drilling activities are currently focused in the Delaware Basin, where we have an extensive drilling inventory that we believe offers attractive economics. The Williston Divestiture improved our liquidity and significantly reduced our debt, better enabling us to accelerate development of our Delaware Basin properties and execute our growth plans in the basin. 
         At December 31, 2018, our estimated total proved oil and natural gas reserves, as prepared by our independent reserve engineering firm, Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. (Netherland, Sewell) using the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) prices for crude oil and natural gas, which are based on the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil spot price of $65.56 per Bbl and Henry Hub natural gas spot price of $3.100 per MMBtu, were approximately 85.2 MMBoe, consisting of 50.7 MMBbls of oil, 17.1 MMBbls of natural gas liquids, and 104.7 Bcf of natural gas. Approximately 47% of our estimated proved reserves were classified as proved developed as of December 31, 2018. We maintain operational control of approximately 99% of our estimated proved reserves. 
         Our total operating revenues for 2018 were approximately $226.6 million compared to total operating revenues for 2017 of approximately $378.0 million. Full year 2018 production averaged 13,904 Boe/d compared to average daily production of 27,397 Boe/d for 2017. The decrease in total operating revenues and average daily production year over year was driven by our divestitures in 2017 and was partially mitigated by the production associated with our assets located in the Delaware Basin and our drilling activities since acquiring the assets. In 2018, we participated in the drilling of 31 gross (30 net) operated wells, none of which were dry holes. 
   Recent Developments 
   Sale of Water Infrastructure Assets 
         On December 20, 2018, we sold our water infrastructure assets located in the Delaware Basin (the Water Assets) to WaterBridge Resources LLC (the Purchaser) for an adjusted purchase price of $214.1 million in cash (the Water Infrastructure Divestiture) at closing. The effective date of the transaction was October 1, 2018. Additional incentive payments of up to $25.0 million per year for the next five years are available subject to our ability to meet certain annual incentive thresholds relating to the number of wells connected to the Water Assets per year. Our ability to achieve the incentive thresholds will be driven by, among other things, our development program which will consider future market conditions and is subject to change. 
         Upon closing, we dedicated all of the produced water from our oil and natural gas wells within our Monument Draw, Hackberry Draw and West Quito Draw operating areas to the Purchaser. There are no drilling or throughput commitments associated with the Water Infrastructure Divestiture. The 
 7

   Purchaser will receive a current market price, subject to annual adjustments for inflation, in exchange for the transportation, disposal and treatment of such produced water, and the Purchaser will receive a market price for the supply of freshwater and recycled produced water provided to us. 
   Acquisition of West Quito Draw Properties 
         On February 6, 2018, one of our wholly owned subsidiaries entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Shell PSA) with SWEPI LP (Shell), an affiliate of Shell Oil Company, pursuant to which we agreed to purchase acreage and related assets in the Delaware Basin located in Ward County, Texas (the West Quito Draw Properties) for a total adjusted purchase price of $198.5 million. The effective date of the acquisition was February 1, 2018, and we closed the transaction on April 4, 2018. We funded the cash consideration of the acquisition of the West Quito Draw Properties with the net proceeds from our issuance of the Additional 2025 Notes (defined below) and common stock, both of which are discussed below. 
 Issuance of Additional 2025 Notes 
         On February 15, 2018, we issued an additional $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 6.75% senior notes due 2025 at a price to the initial purchasers of 103.0% of par (the Additional 2025 Notes). The Additional 2025 Notes were sold pursuant to the exemption from registration under the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws, including Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act. The net proceeds from the sale of the Additional 2025 Notes were approximately $202.4 million after initial purchasers' premiums and deducting commissions and offering expenses. The proceeds were used to fund the cash consideration for the acquisition of the West Quito Draw Properties and for general corporate purposes, including funding our 2018 drilling program. These notes were issued under the Indenture, dated as of February 16, 2017, among us, certain of our subsidiaries and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee, which governs our 6.75% senior notes due 2025 that were issued on February 16, 2017 (the 2025 Notes). The Additional 2025 Notes are treated as a single class with, and have the same terms as the 2025 Notes, except that the Additional 2025 Notes will initially be subject to transfer restrictions and have the benefit of certain registration rights and provisions for the payment of additional interest in the event of a breach with respect to such registration rights. 
         In connection with the issuance of the Additional 2025 Notes, on February 15, 2018, we, our subsidiary guarantors and J.P. Morgan Securities, LLC, on behalf of itself and the initial purchasers, entered into a Registration Rights Agreement, pursuant to which we and our subsidiary guarantors agreed to, among other things, use reasonable best efforts to file a registration statement under the Securities Act and complete an exchange offer for the Additional 2025 Notes within 180 days after closing. We filed such registration statement on March 20, 2018 and it was declared effective by the SEC on April 9, 2018. In addition, we completed the exchange offer for the Additional 2025 Notes on May 17, 2018. 
   Issuance of Common Stock 
         On February 9, 2018, we sold 9.2 million shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, in a public offering at a price of $6.90 per share. The net proceeds to us from the offering were approximately $60.4 million, after deducting underwriters' discounts and offering expenses. 
 Senior Revolving Credit Facility 
         On February 28, 2019, the lenders party to our Senior Credit Agreement issued a consent (the Severance and Office Payments Consent) to us whereby Severance Payments and Office Payments (as defined in the Severance and Office Payments Consent) may exceed the maximum level allowed for adding back non-recurring expenses and charges in the definition of EBITDA (as defined in the Senior 
 8

   Credit Agreement) when calculating the ratio of Consolidated Total Net Debt to EBITDA (as defined in the Senior Credit Agreement) for the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2019. 
         On February 15, 2019, we entered into the Seventh Amendment (the Seventh Amendment) to the Senior Credit Agreement which, among other things, provides for (i) the use of annualized financial data in determining EBITDA (as defined in the Senior Credit Agreement) for the fiscal quarters ending March 31, 2019, June 30, 2019 and September 30, 2019 and (ii) amends the ratio of Consolidated Total Net Debt (as defined in the Senior Credit Agreement) to EBITDA to be (a) 5.00 to 1.0 for the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2019, (b) 4.75 to 1.0 for the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2019, (c) 4.5 to 1.0 for the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2019, (d) 4.25 to 1.0 for the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2019, and (e) 4.0 to 1.0 for the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2020 and any fiscal quarter thereafter. 
         On November 16, 2018, we entered into the Sixth Amendment (the Sixth Amendment) to the Senior Credit Agreement, which, among other things, provided for (i) provisions allowing for optional increases in the maximum Credit Amount (as defined in the Senior Credit Agreement) by us and the lenders party thereto. The Sixth Amendment also established the borrowing base at $350.0 million following the closing of the sale of the Water Assets; however, we and the lenders agreed to reduce the Aggregate Maximum Credit Amounts (as defined in the Senior Credit Agreement) to $275.0 million, thereby effectively limiting the amount available to borrow under the Senior Credit Agreement to $275.0 million. 
         On November 7, 2018, we entered into the Fifth Amendment (the Fifth Amendment) to the Senior Credit Agreement which, among other things, provided for (i) the use of annualized financial data in determining EBITDA (as defined in the Senior Credit Agreement) for the fiscal quarters ending September 30, 2018, December 31, 2018, March 31, 2019, June 30, 2019 and September 30, 2019 and (ii) amended the ratio of Consolidated Total Net Debt (as defined in the Senior Credit Agreement) to EBITDA of (a) 4.75 to 1.0 for the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2018, (b) 4.25 to 1.0 for the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2018 and (c) 4.0 to 1.0 for the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2019 and any fiscal quarter thereafter. 
         On November 6, 2018, the lenders party to our Senior Credit Agreement issued a consent (the H2S Consent) to us whereby H2S Expenses (as defined in the H2S Consent) may exceed the maximum level allowed for adding back non-recurring expenses and charges in the definition of EBITDA (as defined in the Senior Credit Agreement) when calculating the ratio of Consolidated Total Net Debt to EBITDA (as defined in the Senior Credit Agreement) for the fiscal quarters ending September 30, 2018, December 31, 2018 and March 31, 2019. 
         During the year, we also periodically sought amendments to the covenants in the Senior Credit Agreement, including the financial covenants, where we anticipated difficulty in maintaining compliance. On July 12, 2018, we entered into the Fourth Amendment to the Senior Credit Agreement and on February 2, 2018, we entered into the Second Amendment to the Senior Credit Agreement. Refer to Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, for a further discussion of these amendments. 
   Option Agreement to Acquire Monument Draw Assets (Ward and Winkler Counties, Texas) 
         On December 9, 2016, one of our wholly owned subsidiaries entered into an agreement with a private company, pursuant to which it acquired the rights to purchase up to 15,040 net acres in the Monument Draw area of the Delaware Basin, located in Ward and Winkler Counties, Texas (the Ward County Assets) prospective for the Wolfcamp and Bone Spring formations. The Ward County Assets are divided into two tracts (the Southern Tract and the Northern Tract) with separate options for each tract. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement (as amended), on June 15, 2017, we purchased the 
 9

   Southern Tract for approximately $87.4 million and on January 9, 2018, we purchased the Northern Tract for approximately $108.2 million. 
   2019 Capital Budget 
         We expect to spend approximately $190 million to $210 million on drilling and completion capital expenditures during 2019. Overall, we currently plan to drill 17 gross operated wells during the year, complete 18 gross operated wells, bring 23 gross operated wells on production, and have five gross operated wells drilling over year-end 2019. Our 2019 drilling and completion budget currently contemplates running an average of two operated rigs in the Delaware Basin during the year and is subject to change. In addition, we expect to spend approximately $60 million to $80 million on infrastructure, seismic and other activities in 2019. 
         We expect to fund our budgeted 2019 capital expenditures with cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash flows from operations and borrowings under our Senior Credit Agreement. We strive to maintain financial flexibility and may access capital markets as necessary to maintain adequate borrowing capacity under our Senior Credit Agreement, facilitate drilling on our large undeveloped acreage position and permit us to selectively expand our acreage position and fund infrastructure projects. In the event our cash flows are materially less than anticipated and other sources of capital we historically have utilized are not available on acceptable terms, we may be required to curtail drilling, development, land acquisitions and other activities to reduce our capital spending. 
         Our financial results depend upon many factors, but are largely driven by the volume of our oil and natural gas production and the price that we receive for that production. Our production volumes will decline as reserves are depleted unless we expend capital in successful development and exploration activities or acquire properties with existing production. The amount we realize for our production depends predominately upon commodity prices and our related commodity price hedging activities, which are affected by changes in market demand and supply, as impacted by overall economic activity, weather, pipeline capacity constraints, inventory storage levels, basis differentials and other factors. Accordingly, finding and developing oil and natural gas reserves in an economical manner is critical to our long-term success. 
   Business Strategy 
         Our primary long-term objective is to increase stockholder value by cost-effectively increasing our production of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, adding to our proved reserves and growing our inventory of economic drilling locations. To accomplish this objective, we intend to execute the following business strategies: 


 Develop our Acreage Position to Grow Production and Reserves
Efficiently.  We are the operator for the majority of our acreage, which gives us control over the timing of capital expenditures, execution and
costs. It also allows us to adjust our capital spending based on drilling results and the economic environment. As operator, we are also able to evaluate industry drilling results and implement
improved operating practices which may enhance our initial production rates, ultimate recovery factors and rate of return on invested capital. 
 Manage Our Property Portfolio
Actively.  We continually evaluate our property base to identify and either divest, acquire or trade acreage to allow us to optimally execute on
our plans to drill long-lateral operated wells (i.e. primarily 10,000 foot laterals). We may also divest less economic properties over time which will allow us to focus on a portfolio of core
properties with the greatest economic potential to increase our proved reserves and production. 
 Selectively Grow Our Acreage
Positions.  We plan to selectively acquire high quality assets complementary to our core acreage and expand our drilling inventory. We will
leverage our management team's geologic, engineering and financial expertise to selectively identify and execute on such acreage at attractive prices.

  Oil and Natural Gas Reserves 
         The proved reserves estimates reported herein for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 have been independently evaluated by Netherland, Sewell, a worldwide leader of petroleum property analysis for industry and financial organizations and government agencies. Netherland, Sewell was founded in 1961 and performs consulting petroleum engineering services under Texas Board of Professional Engineers Registration No. F-2699. Within Netherland, Sewell, the technical persons primarily responsible for preparing the estimates set forth in the Netherland, Sewell reserves reports incorporated herein are Mr. Neil H. Little and Mr. Mike K. Norton. Mr. Little, a Licensed Professional Engineer in the State of Texas (No. 117966), has been practicing consulting petroleum engineering at Netherland, Sewell since 2011 and has over nine years of prior industry experience. He graduated from Rice University in 2002 with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Chemical Engineering and from University of Houston in 2007 with a Master of Business Administration Degree. Mr. Norton, a Licensed Professional Geoscientist in the State of Texas (No. 441), has been a practicing petroleum geoscience consultant at Netherland, Sewell since 1989 and has over ten years of prior industry experience. He graduated from Texas A&M University in 1978 with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Geology. Netherland, Sewell has reported to us that both technical principals meet or exceed the education, training, and experience requirements set forth in the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers; they are both proficient in judiciously applying industry standard practices to engineering and geoscience evaluations as well as applying SEC and other industry reserves definitions and guidelines. 
         Our board of directors has established a reserves committee composed of independent directors with experience in energy company reserve evaluations. Our independent engineering firm reports jointly to the reserves committee and to our Senior Vice President of Corporate Reserves. The reserves committee is charged with ensuring the integrity of the process of selection and engagement of the independent engineering firm and in making a recommendation to our board of directors as to whether to approve the report prepared by our independent engineering firm. Ms. Tina Obut, our Senior Vice President of Corporate Reserves, is primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of the annual reserve report by Netherland, Sewell. She graduated from Marietta College with a Bachelor of Science degree in Petroleum Engineering, received a Master of Science degree in Petroleum and Natural Gas Engineering from Penn State University and a Master of Business Administration degree from the University of Houston. 
         The reserves information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K represents only estimates. Reserve evaluation is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. As a result, estimates of different engineers may vary significantly. In addition, results of drilling, testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may lead to revising the original estimate. Accordingly, initial reserve estimates are often different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered. The meaningfulness of such estimates depends primarily on the accuracy of the assumptions upon which they were based. Except to the extent we acquire additional properties containing proved reserves or conduct successful exploration and development activities or both, our proved reserves will decline as reserves are produced. For additional information regarding estimates of proved reserves, the preparation of such estimates by Netherland, Sewell and other information about our oil and natural gas reserves, see Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"Supplemental Oil and Gas Information (Unaudited)." 
         Proved reserve estimates are based on the unweighted arithmetic average prices on the first day of each month for the 12-month period ended December 31, 2018. Average prices for the 12-month period were as follows: WTI crude oil spot price of $65.56 per Bbl, adjusted by lease or field for quality, transportation fees, and market differentials and a Henry Hub natural gas spot price of 
 11

   $3.100 per MMBtu, as adjusted by lease or field for energy content, transportation fees, and market differentials. All prices and costs associated with operating wells were held constant in accordance with SEC guidelines. 
         The following table presents certain proved reserve information as of December 31, 2018. 

   
Proved Reserves (MBoe)(1) | | | | 
Developed | | | 39,869 |

Natural gas reserves are converted to oil reserves using a ratio of six Mcf to one Bbl of oil. This ratio does not assume price equivalency and, given price differentials, the price for a barrel of oil equivalent for natural gas may differ significantly from the price for a barrel of oil.


        The following table sets forth the number of productive oil and natural gas wells in which we owned an interest as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. Shut-in wells currently not capable of production are excluded from the well information below.

  Oil and Natural Gas Production 
         During 2017, we divested our assets located in the Williston Basin in North Dakota and in the El Halcón area of East Texas, which represented substantially all of our proved reserves and production at the time, and we acquired certain properties in the Delaware Basin. As a consequence, our estimated proved reserves, oil and natural gas production and anticipated capital expenditures are currently focused entirely in this core area. 
 Core Resource PlayDelaware Basin 
         We have working interests in approximately 56,900 net acres in the Delaware Basin as of December 31, 2018 in Pecos, Reeves, Ward and Winkler Counties, Texas. This core resource play is characterized by high oil and liquids-rich natural gas content in thick, continuous sections of source rock that can provide repeatable drilling opportunities and significant initial production rates. Our primary targets in this area are the Wolfcamp and Bone Spring formations. Our current capital budget contemplates running an average of two operated rigs in the Delaware Basin during 2019. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 104 operated wells producing in this area in addition to minor working interests in 19 non-operated wells. Our average daily net production from this area for the year ended December 31, 2018 was approximately 13,900 Boe/d. As of December 31, 2018, estimated proved reserves for the Delaware Basin were approximately 85.2 MMBoe, of which approximately 47% were classified as proved developed and approximately 53% as proved undeveloped. 
 Risk Management 
         We have designed a risk management policy for the use of derivative instruments to provide partial protection against certain risks relating to our ongoing business operations, such as commodity price 
 12

   declines, including price differentials between the NYMEX commodity price and the index price at the location where our production is sold. Derivative contracts are utilized to hedge our exposure to price fluctuations and reduce the variability in our cash flows associated with anticipated sales of future oil and natural gas production. Our objective generally is to hedge 70-80% of our anticipated oil and natural gas production for the next 18 to 24 months. However, our decision on the quantity and price at which we choose to hedge our production is based in part on our view of current and future market conditions. Our hedge policies and objectives change as our operational profile changes and/or commodity prices. Our future performance is subject to commodity price risks and our future cash flows from operations may be subject to greater volatility than historically. We do not enter into derivative contracts for speculative trading purposes. 
         While there are many different types of derivatives available, we typically use costless collar, fixed-price swap and basis swap agreements to attempt to manage price risk more effectively. The costless collar agreements are put and call options used to establish floor and ceiling commodity prices for a fixed volume of production during a certain time period. All costless collar agreements provide for payments to counterparties if the settlement price under the agreement exceeds the ceiling and payments from the counterparties if the settlement price under the agreement is below the floor. The swap agreements call for payments to, or receipts from, counterparties depending on whether the index price of oil or natural gas for the period is greater or less than the fixed price established for the period contracted under the swap agreement. Basis swaps effectively lock in a price differential between regional prices (i.e. Midland) where the product is sold and the relevant pricing index under which the oil production is hedged (i.e. Cushing). 
         It is our policy to enter into derivative contracts only with counterparties that are creditworthy financial institutions deemed by management as competent and competitive market makers. As of December 31, 2018, the Company did not post collateral under any of its derivative contracts as they are secured under the Company's Senior Credit Agreement or are uncollateralized trades. We will continue to evaluate the benefit of employing derivatives in the future. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk and Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary DataNote 9, "Derivative and Hedging Activities," for additional information. 
   Oil and Natural Gas Operations 
         Our principal properties consist of leasehold interests in developed and undeveloped oil and natural gas properties and the reserves associated with these properties. Generally, oil and natural gas leases remain in force as long as production in paying quantities is maintained. Leases on undeveloped oil and natural gas properties are typically for a primary term of three to five years within which we are generally required to develop the property or the lease will expire. In some cases, the primary term of leases on our undeveloped properties can be extended by option payments; the amount of any 
 13

   payments and time extended vary by lease. The table below sets forth the results of our drilling activities for the periods indicated:

Although a well may be classified as productive upon completion, future changes in oil and natural gas prices, operating costs and production may result in the well becoming uneconomical, particularly extension or exploratory wells where there is no production history.


        We own interests in developed and undeveloped oil and natural gas acreage in the locations set forth in the table below. These ownership interests generally take the form of working interests in oil and natural gas leases that have varying provisions. The following table presents a summary of our acreage interests as of December 31, 2018: 

   
 | | Developed Acreage | | Undeveloped Acreage | | Total Acreage | 
State | | Gross | | Net | | Gross | | Net | | Gross | | Net | 
Montana | | | 280 | | | 66 | | | 1,353 | | | 562 | | | 1,633 | | | 628 |

        The table below reflects the percentage of our total net undeveloped acreage as of December 31, 2018 that will expire each year if we do not establish production in paying quantities on the units in 
 14

   which such acreage is included or do not pay (to the extent we have the contractual right to pay) delay rentals or obtain other extensions to maintain the lease. 

   
Year | | Percentage Expiration | 
2019 | | | 4 | %
2020 | | | 9 | %
2021 | | | 7 | %

        For our proved undeveloped locations that are not scheduled to be drilled until after lease expiration, we continually review our near-term lease expirations to determine which lease extensions and renewals to actively pursue, and modify our drilling schedules in order to preserve the leases. We have no current plans to drill on acreage in other areas outside of our core area of operations. 
         At December 31, 2018, we had estimated proved reserves of approximately 85.2 MMBoe comprised of 50.7 MMBbls of crude oil, 17.1 MMBbls of natural gas liquids, and 104.7 Bcf of natural gas. The following table sets forth, at December 31, 2018, these reserves: 

   
 | Proved Developed | | Proved Undeveloped | Total Proved
Oil (MBbls) | | 24,672 | | 25,982 | 50,654 
Natural Gas Liquids (MBbls) | | 7,740 | | 9,360 | 17,100 
Natural Gas (MMcf) | | 44,743 | | 60,006 | 104,749
Equivalent (MBoe)(1) | | 39,869 | | 45,343 | 85,212 


  (1)
Natural gas reserves are converted to oil reserves using a ratio of six Mcf to one Bbl of oil. This ratio does not assume price equivalency and, given price differentials, the price for a barrel of oil equivalent for natural gas may differ significantly from the price for a barrel of oil.


        At December 31, 2018, total estimated proved reserves were approximately 85.2 MMBoe, a 34.1 MMBoe net increase over the previous year's estimate of 51.1 MMBoe. The net increase in total proved reserves was the result of additions and extensions of 53.2 MMBoe and acquisitions totaling 3.7 MMBoe, partially offset by net negative revisions of 17.6 MMBoe and production of 5.1 MMBoe. 
         At December 31, 2018, our estimated proved undeveloped (PUD) reserves were approximately 45.3 MMBoe, a 10.2 MMBoe net increase over the previous year's estimate of 35.1 MMBoe. The net increase in total proved undeveloped reserves was the result of additions and extensions of 40.1 MMBoe, partially offset by net negative revisions of 17.9 MMBoe and development of 12.0 MMBoe. 
         As of December 31, 2018, all of our PUD reserves are planned to be developed within five years from the date they were initially recorded. During 2018, approximately $182.0 million in capital expenditures went toward the development of proved undeveloped reserves, which includes drilling, completion and other facility costs associated with developing proved undeveloped wells. 
         Reliable technologies were used to determine areas where PUD locations are more than one offset location away from a producing well. These technologies include seismic data, wire line openhole log data, core data, log cross-sections, performance data, and statistical analysis. In such areas, these data demonstrated consistent, continuous reservoir characteristics in addition to significant quantities of economic estimated ultimate recoveries from individual producing wells. Our management team has been a leader in data gathering and evaluation in these areas and was instrumental in developing 
 15

   consortiums that allow various operators to exchange data. We relied only on production flow tests and historical production data, along with the reliable geologic data mentioned above to estimate proved reserves. No other alternative methods or technologies were used to estimate proved reserves. Out of total proved undeveloped reserves of 45.3 MMBoe at December 31, 2018, 10.8 MMBoe were associated with 10 gross PUD locations that were more than one offset location from a producing well. 
         The estimates of quantities of proved reserves contained in this report were made in accordance with the definitions contained in SEC Release No. 33-8995,  Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting. For additional information on our oil and natural gas reserves, including a table detailing the changes by year of our proved reserves, see Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"Supplemental Oil and Gas Information (Unaudited)." We account for our oil and natural gas producing activities using the full cost method of accounting in accordance with SEC regulations. Accordingly, all costs incurred in the acquisition, exploration, and development of proved and unproved oil and natural gas properties, including the costs of abandoned properties, dry holes, geophysical costs, direct internal costs and annual lease rentals are capitalized. All general and administrative corporate costs unrelated to drilling activities are expensed as incurred. Sales or other dispositions of oil and natural gas properties are accounted for as adjustments to capitalized costs, with no gain or loss recorded unless the ratio of cost to proved reserves would significantly change. Depletion of evaluated oil and natural gas properties is computed on the units of production method based on proved reserves. The net capitalized costs of evaluated oil and natural gas properties are subject to a quarterly full cost ceiling test. See further discussion in Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary DataNote 6, "Oil and Natural Gas Properties."
         Capitalized costs of our evaluated and unevaluated properties at December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 are summarized as follows (in thousands):

Natural gas reserves are converted to oil reserves using a ratio of six Mcf to one Bbl of oil. This ratio does not assume price equivalency and, given price differentials, the price for a barrel of oil equivalent for natural gas may differ significantly from the price for a barrel of oil.


        The average crude oil and natural gas sales prices above do not reflect the impact of cash paid on, or cash received from, settled derivative contracts as these amounts are reflected as "Net gain (loss) on 
 17

    derivative contracts" in the consolidated statements of operations, consistent with our decision not to elect hedge accounting. Including this impact, for the year ended December 31, 2018, the average crude oil sales price was $56.82 per Bbl, the average natural gas sales price was $1.90 per Mcf and the average natural gas liquids sales price was $30.68 per Bbl. Including this impact, for the year ended December 31, 2017, the average crude oil sales price was $47.62 per Bbl and the average natural gas sales price was $2.29 per Mcf. Including this impact, during the period of September 10, 2016 through December 31, 2016 and the period of January 1, 2016 through September 9, 2016, average crude oil sales prices were $68.99 and $69.25 per Bbl, respectively and average natural gas sales prices were $2.33 and $1.58 per Mcf, respectively. 
   Competitive Conditions in the Business 
         The oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive and we compete with a substantial number of other companies that have greater financial and other resources. Many of these companies explore for, produce and market oil and natural gas, as well as carry on refining operations and market the resultant products on a worldwide basis. The primary areas in which we encounter substantial competition are in locating and acquiring desirable leasehold acreage for our drilling and development operations, locating and acquiring attractive producing oil and natural gas properties, obtaining sufficient availability of drilling and completion equipment and services, obtaining purchasers and transporters of the oil and natural gas we produce and hiring and retaining key employees. There is also competition between oil and natural gas producers and other industries producing energy and fuel. Furthermore, competitive conditions may be substantially affected by various forms of energy legislation and/or regulation considered from time to time by the government of the United States and the states in which our properties are located. It is not possible to predict the nature of any such legislation or regulation which may ultimately be adopted or its effects upon our future operations. Such laws and regulations may substantially increase the costs of exploring for, developing or producing oil and natural gas and may prevent or delay the commencement or continuation of a given operation. 
   Other Business Matters 
   Markets and Major Customers 
         The purchasers of our oil and natural gas production consist primarily of independent marketers, major oil and natural gas companies and gas pipeline companies. Historically, we have not experienced any significant losses from uncollectible accounts. In 2018, two individual purchasers of our production, Sunoco, Inc. and Western Refining, Inc., each accounted for more than 10% of total sales, collectively representing 77% of our total sales for the period. In 2017 and 2016, two individual purchasers of our production, Crestwood Midstream Partners and Suncor Energy Marketing, Inc., each accounted for more than 10% of total sales, collectively representing 58% of our total sales for each year. 
 Seasonality of Business 
         Weather conditions affect the demand for, and prices of, natural gas and can also delay drilling activities, disrupting our overall business plans. Demand for natural gas is typically higher during the winter, resulting in higher natural gas prices for our natural gas production during our first and fourth fiscal quarters. Due to these seasonal fluctuations, our results of operations for individual quarterly periods may not be indicative of the results that we may realize on an annual basis. 
 Operational Risks 
         Oil and natural gas exploration and development involves a high degree of risk, which even a combination of experience, knowledge and careful evaluation may not be able to be overcome. There is no assurance that we will discover or acquire additional oil and natural gas in commercial quantities. 
 18

   Oil and natural gas operations also involve the risk that well fires, blowouts, equipment failure, human error and other events may cause accidental releases of toxic or hazardous materials, such as petroleum liquids or drilling fluids into the environment, or cause significant injury to persons or property. In such event, substantial liabilities to third parties or governmental entities may be incurred, the satisfaction of which could substantially reduce available cash and possibly result in loss of oil and natural gas properties. Such hazards may also cause damage to or destruction of wells, producing formations, production facilities and pipeline or other processing facilities. 
         As is common in the oil and natural gas industry, we will not insure fully against all risks associated with our business either because such insurance is not available or because we believe the premium costs are prohibitive. A loss not fully covered by insurance could have a material effect on our operating results, financial position or cash flows. For further discussion on risks see Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
   Regulations 
         All of the jurisdictions in which we own or operate producing oil and natural gas properties have statutory provisions regulating the exploration for and production of oil and natural gas, including provisions related to permits for the drilling of wells, bonding requirements to drill or operate wells, the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled, sourcing and disposal of water used in the drilling and completion process, and the plugging and abandonment of wells. Our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations. These laws and regulations govern the size of drilling and spacing units, the density of wells that may be drilled in oil and natural gas properties and the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties. In this regard, some states allow the forced pooling or integration of land and leases to facilitate exploration while other states rely primarily or exclusively on voluntary pooling of land and leases. In areas where pooling is primarily or exclusively voluntary, it may be difficult to form spacing units and therefore difficult to develop a project if the operator owns less than 100% of the leasehold. In addition, state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells, generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas, and impose specified requirements regarding the ratability of production. On some occasions, local authorities have imposed moratoria or other restrictions on exploration and production activities pending investigations and studies addressing potential local impacts of these activities before allowing oil and natural gas exploration and production to proceed. 
         The effect of these regulations is to limit the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill, although we can apply for exceptions to such regulations or to have reductions in well spacing. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations can result in substantial penalties. The regulatory burden on the industry increases the cost of doing business and affects profitability. Moreover, each state generally imposes a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids within its jurisdiction. 
   Environmental Regulations 
         Our operations are subject to stringent federal, state and local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to health and safety or the protection of the environment. Numerous governmental agencies, such as the United States Environmental Protection Agency, commonly referred to as the EPA, issue regulations to implement and enforce these laws, which often require difficult and costly compliance measures. Among other things, environmental regulatory programs typically govern the permitting, construction and operation of a facility. Many factors, including public perception, can materially impact the ability to secure an environmental construction or operation permit. Failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations may result 
 19

   in the assessment of substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties, as well as the issuance of injunctions limiting or prohibiting our activities. In addition, some laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment may, in certain circumstances, impose strict liability for environmental contamination, which could result in liability for environmental damages and cleanup costs without regard to negligence or fault on our part. 
         Beyond existing requirements, new programs and changes in existing programs may address various aspects of our business, including natural occurring radioactive materials, oil and natural gas exploration and production, air emissions, waste management, and underground injection of waste material. Environmental laws and regulations have been subject to frequent changes over the years, and the imposition of more stringent requirements could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The following is a summary of the more significant existing environmental, health and safety laws and regulations to which our business operations are subject and for which compliance in the future may have a material adverse impact on our capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position. 
   Hazardous Substances and Wastes 
         The federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, referred to as CERCLA or the Superfund law, and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to fault, on certain classes of persons that are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons may include the current or former owner or operator of the disposal site or sites where the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances that have been released at the site. Under CERCLA, these persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of investigating and cleaning up hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of some health studies. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances or other pollutants released into the environment. 
         Under the federal Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, referred to as RCRA, most wastes generated by the exploration and production of oil and natural gas are not regulated as hazardous waste. Periodically, however, there are proposals to lift the existing exemption for oil and gas wastes and reclassify them as hazardous wastes or to subject them to enhanced solid waste regulation. If such proposals were to be enacted, they could have a significant impact on our operating costs and on those of all the industry in general. In the ordinary course of our operations, moreover some wastes generated in connection with our exploration and production activities may be regulated as solid waste under RCRA, as hazardous waste under existing RCRA regulations or as hazardous substances under CERCLA. From time to time, releases of materials or wastes have occurred at locations we own or at which we have operations. Under CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws, we have been and may be required to remove or remediate such materials or wastes. 
   Water Discharges 
         Our operations also may be subject to the federal Clean Water Act and analogous state statutes. Those laws regulate discharges of wastewater, oil, and other pollutants to surface water bodies, such as lakes, rivers, wetlands, and streams. Failure to obtain permits for such discharges could result in civil and criminal penalties, orders to cease such discharges, and costs to remediate and pay natural resources damages. These laws also require the preparation and implementation of Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure Plans in connection with on-site storage of significant quantities of oil. In the event of a discharge of oil into U.S. waters, we could be liable under the Oil Pollution Act for cleanup costs, damages and economic losses. 
 20

           Our oil and natural gas production also generates salt water, which we dispose of by underground injection. The federal Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA), the Underground Injection Control (UIC) regulations promulgated under the SDWA, and related state programs regulate the drilling and operation of salt water disposal wells. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) directly administers the UIC program in some states, and in others it is delegated to the state. Permits must be obtained before drilling salt water disposal wells, and casing integrity monitoring must be conducted periodically to ensure the casing is not leaking salt water to groundwater. Contamination of groundwater by oil and natural gas drilling, production, and related operations may result in fines, penalties, and remediation costs, among other sanctions and liabilities under the SDWA and state laws. In addition, third party claims may be filed by landowners and other parties claiming damages for alternative water supplies, property damages, and bodily injury. 
   Hydraulic Fracturing 
         Our completion operations are subject to regulation, which may increase in the short- or long-term. In particular, the well completion technique known as hydraulic fracturing, which is used to stimulate production of oil and natural gas, has come under increased scrutiny by the environmental community, and many local, state and federal regulators. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand and additives under pressure, usually down casing that is cemented in the wellbore, into prospective rock formations at depths to stimulate oil and natural gas production. We engage third parties to provide hydraulic fracturing or other well stimulation services to us in connection with substantially all of the wells for which we are the operator. 
         Working at the direction of Congress, the EPA issued a study in 2016 finding that hydraulic fracturing could potentially harm drinking water resources under adverse circumstances such as injection directly into groundwater or into production wells lacking mechanical integrity. The EPA also promulgated pre-treatment standards under the Clean Water Act for wastewater discharges from shale hydraulic fracturing operations to municipal sewage treatment plants. Beyond that, several environmental groups have petitioned the EPA to extend toxic release reporting requirements under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act to the oil and natural gas extraction industry and to require disclosure under the Toxic Substances Control Act of chemicals used in fracturing. Congress might likewise consider legislation to amend the federal SDWA to require the disclosure of chemicals used by the oil and natural gas industry in the hydraulic fracturing process. Various states, including Texas, already have issued similar disclosure rules. 
         In addition, the Department of the Interior promulgated regulations concerning the use of hydraulic fracturing on lands under its jurisdiction, which includes lands on which we conduct or plan to conduct operations. While the Trump Administration rescinded those rules, that decision is being challenged in court. Regardless of how the federal issues are eventually resolved, states have been imposing new restrictions or bans on hydraulic fracturing. Even local jurisdictions, such as Denton, Texas and several cities in Colorado, have adopted, or tried to adopt, regulations restricting hydraulic fracturing. Additional hydraulic fracturing requirements at the federal, state or local level may limit our ability to operate or increase our operating costs. 
   Air Emissions 
         The federal Clean Air Act and comparable state laws regulate emissions of various air pollutants through permitting programs and the imposition of other requirements. In addition, the EPA has developed and may continue to develop stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollutants at specified sources, including oil and natural gas production. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with air permits or other requirements of the federal Clean Air Act and associated state laws and regulations. Our operations, or 
 21

   the operations of service companies engaged by us, may in certain circumstances and locations be subject to permits and restrictions under these statutes for emissions of air pollutants. 
         In 2012 and 2016, the EPA issued air regulations for the oil and natural gas industry that address emissions from certain new sources of volatile organic compounds, sulfur dioxide, air toxics, and methane. The rules included the first federal air standards for natural gas and oil wells that are hydraulically fractured, or refractured, as well as requirements for other processes and equipment, including storage tanks. Compliance with these regulations has imposed additional requirements and costs on our operations. The Trump Administration may rescind some of the 2016 requirements, but supporters of the existing regulations likely would seek judicial review of any such decision. 
         In October 2015, the EPA announced that it was lowering the primary national ambient air quality standard for ozone from 75 parts per billion to 70 parts per billion. Implementation will take place over several years; however, the new standard could result in a significant expansion of ozone nonattainment areas across the United States, including areas in which we operate. Oil and natural gas operations in ozone nonattainment areas would likely be subject to increased regulatory burdens in the form of more stringent emission controls, emission offset requirements, and increased permitting delays and costs. 
   Climate Change 
         Studies over recent years have indicated that emissions of certain gases may be contributing to warming of the Earth's atmosphere. In response, governments increasingly have been adopting domestic and international climate change regulations that require reporting and reductions of the emission of such greenhouse gases. Methane, a primary component of natural gas, and carbon dioxide, a byproduct of burning oil, natural gas and refined petroleum products, are considered greenhouse gases. Internationally, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement address greenhouse gas emissions, and several countries, including those comprising the European Union, have established greenhouse gas regulatory systems. In the United States, at the state level, many states, either individually or through multi-state regional initiatives, have been implementing legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, primarily through emission inventories, emissions targets, greenhouse gas cap and trade programs or incentives for renewable energy generation, while others have considered adopting such greenhouse gas programs. 
         At the federal level, the EPA has issued regulations requiring us and other companies to annually report certain greenhouse gas emissions from oil and natural gas facilities. Beyond its measuring and reporting rules, the EPA has issued an "Endangerment Finding" under section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act, concluding greenhouse gas pollution threatens the public health and welfare of current and future generations. The finding served as the first step in issuing regulations that require permits for and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for certain facilities. 
         In addition, the Obama Administration developed a Strategy to Reduce Methane Emissions that was intended to result by 2025 in a 40-45% decrease in methane emissions from the oil and gas industry as compared to 2012 levels. Consistent with that strategy, the EPA issued air rules for oil and gas production sources, and the federal Bureau of Land Management (BLM) promulgated standards for reducing venting and flaring on public lands. The Trump Administration has been trying to roll back many of the Obama-era policies and rules; however, the long-term direction of federal climate regulation is uncertain. 
         Any laws or regulations that may be adopted to restrict or reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could require us to incur additional operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems or other compliance costs, and reduce demand for our products.

     The National Environmental Policy Act 
         Oil and natural gas exploration and production activities may be subject to the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA. NEPA requires federal agencies, including the Department of the Interior, to evaluate major agency actions that have the potential to significantly impact the environment. In the course of such evaluations, an agency will prepare an Environmental Assessment that assesses the potential direct, indirect and cumulative impacts of a proposed project and, if necessary, will prepare a more detailed Environmental Impact Statement that may be made available for public review and comment. All of our current exploration and production activities, as well as proposed exploration and development plans, on federal lands require governmental permits that are subject to the requirements of NEPA. This process has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects. 
   Threatened and endangered species, migratory birds, and natural resources 
         Various state and federal statutes prohibit certain actions that adversely affect endangered or threatened species and their habitat, migratory birds, wetlands, and natural resources. These statutes include the Endangered Species Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the Clean Water Act. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service may designate critical habitat areas that it believes are necessary for survival of threatened or endangered species. A critical habitat designation could result in further material restrictions on federal land use or on private land use and could delay or prohibit land access or development. Where takings of or harm to species or damages to wetlands, habitat, or natural resources occur or may occur, government entities or at times private parties may act to prevent or restrict oil and gas exploration activities or seek damages for any injury, whether resulting from drilling or construction or releases of oil, wastes, hazardous substances or other regulated materials, and in some cases, criminal penalties may result. 
   Occupational Safety and Health Act 
         We are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's hazard communication standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees. 
 Employees and Principal Office 
         As of December 31, 2018, we had 116 full-time employees. We hire independent contractors on an as needed basis. We have no collective bargaining agreements with our employees. We believe that our employee relationships are satisfactory. 
         As of December 31, 2018, we leased corporate office space in Houston, Texas at 1000 Louisiana Street, where our principal offices are located. We also lease corporate office space in Denver, Colorado. 
   Access to Company Reports 
         We file periodic reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC in accordance with the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
