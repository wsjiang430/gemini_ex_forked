 ﻿
 Century Mile Racetrack and Casino – Edmonton, Alberta, Canada (“CMR” or “Century Mile”). In September 2016, we were selected by Horse Racing Alberta (“HRA”) as the successful applicant to own, build and operate a horse racing facility in the Edmonton market area, which we are planning to operate as Century Mile Racetrack and Casino. In March 2017, we received approval for the Century Mile project from Alberta Gaming, Liquor and Cannabis (“AGLC”). Century Mile will be a one-mile horse racetrack and a multi-level REC. The multi-level REC is expected to have 550 slot machines, 14 video lottery terminals, restaurants, bars, delis, an off-track betting parlor and grandstand. We expect to hold a minimum of 100 racing days per year. The project is located on Edmonton International Airport land close to the city of Leduc, south of Edmonton. Century Mile will be approximately 30 miles from both CRA and CSA. We estimate that this project will cost approximately CAD 61.5 million ($45.1 million based on the exchange rate in effect as of December 31, 2018) and the REC will open on April 1, 2019. We financed the project with $25.0 million of the $34.4 million received from the common stock offering we completed in November 2017, of which $24.2 million had been used as of December 31, 2018. The balance of the Century Mile project is being financed through our credit agreement with the Bank of Montreal (“BMO”), which was amended in August 2018 to add additional borrowing capacity of CAD 33.0 million ($24.2 million based on the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2018), and with available cash.

 *CPL has received approval from the Poland Minister of Finance to utilize our third Warsaw casino license granted in July 2018 to operate the casino at the Marriott Hotel and to transfer the existing license at the Marriott Hotel, expiring September 2022, to the Hilton Hotel. With this approval, CPL will expand the casino at the Marriott Hotel to encompass two floors and will add six table games to the existing 27 table games. The relocation of the licenses is planned to take place in April 2019. Once the licenses are transferred, the Marriott Hotel’s license will expire in July 2024 and the Hilton Hotel’s license will expire in September 2022.

Casino licenses are granted for six years. Before a casino license expires, the Polish Minister of Finance notifies the public of its availability and interested parties can submit an application for the casino license. Following approval of a casino license by the Minister of Finance, there is a period in which applicants can appeal the decision. In October 2017, we were awarded casino licenses expiring in 2023 for the Polish cities of Katowice and Wroclaw. The Wroclaw casino opened in April 2018 and the Katowice casino opened in May 2018. In June 2018, we were awarded casino licenses expiring in 2024 for the Polish cities of Krakow and Lodz. The Krakow casino reopened in July 2018 and the Lodz casino reopened in August 2018.

Corporate and Other

Cruise Ships. Through concession agreements with TUI Cruises, Windstar Cruises and Diamond Cruise International Co., Ltd. (“Diamond Cruise”), we currently operate 10 ship-based casinos. The following table summarizes information about the ship-based casinos that we operated as of December 31, 2018. 
 ﻿

----+-------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿
 Our concession agreements on the Mein Schiff 1, Marella Discovery and Wind Star ships ended in April 2018, October 2018 and November 2018, respectively. We will not renew the concession agreements for the remaining ships with Windstar Cruises that expire in March, April and May 2019 because the cruise line intends to use the casino space for other purposes. As a result, our revenue and associated expenses from ship-based casinos will decrease in 2019.
 ﻿
 In March 2015, in connection with a termination agreement with Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (“Norwegian”), pursuant to which we agreed to the early termination of concession agreements with Oceania Cruises (“Oceania”) and Regent Seven Seas Cruises (“Regent”), we entered into a two-year consulting agreement with Norwegian that became effective June 1, 2015. Under the consulting agreement, we provided limited consulting services for the ship-based casinos of Oceania and Regent in exchange for receiving a consulting fee of $2.0 million payable $250,000 per quarter through May 2017.
 ﻿
 Century Casino Bath (“CCB”). In June 2017, our subsidiary CRM acquired casino licenses held by Saw Close Casino Ltd. in Bath, England (the “CCB License Acquisition”). The purchase price for the license acquisition was GBP 0.6 million, of which GBP 0.1 million ($0.1 million based on the exchange rate in effect on June 20, 2017) was paid at closing, GBP 0.2 million ($0.3 million based on the exchange rate in effect on December 22, 2017) was paid after the receipt of regulatory and governmental approvals, and GBP 0.3 million ($0.4 million based on the exchange rate in effect on May 8, 2018) was paid after the opening of the casino in May 2018. In addition, we assumed liabilities in the amount of GBP 0.2 million ($0.3 million based on the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2018) that are repayable if the casino meets certain performance criteria. CCB is located in the evening leisure district of Bath, serving a metropolitan population of 0.2 million people. The facility has 60 TITO slot and electronic roulette machines, 15 tables, three bars, and a lounge area.

Mendoza Central Entretenimientos S.A. (“MCE”). In October 2014, our subsidiary CRM purchased 7.5% of the shares of MCE for $1.0 million. The shares are reported on our consolidated balance sheet using the cost method of accounting. MCE has an exclusive agreement with the Instituto Provincial de Juegos y Casinos (“IPJC”) to lease slot machines and provide related services to Casino de Mendoza, a casino located in Mendoza, Argentina and owned by the Province of Mendoza. MCE may also pursue other gaming opportunities. MCE leases 600 TITO slot machines to Casino de Mendoza. CRM has appointed one director to MCE’s board of directors and had a three-year option through October 2017 to purchase up to 50% of the shares of MCE, which we did not exercise. In addition, CRM and MCE have entered into a consulting services agreement pursuant to which CRM provides advice on casino matters and receives a service fee consisting of a fixed fee plus a percentage of MCE’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”). See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this report.
 ﻿
 Minh Chau Ltd. (“MCL”). In April 2018, our subsidiary CRM entered into a Shareholder’s Agreement with Golden Hospitality Ltd. (“GHL”) and GHL’s shareholders, pursuant to which CRM purchased a 51% ownership interest in GHL. The remaining 49% of GHL is owned by unaffiliated shareholders and is reported by us as a non-controlling financial interest. For our ownership interest in GHL, we recognized assets of $0.5 million, including $0.2 million in cash, and assumed liabilities of $0.1 million as of the date of acquisition. 
 ﻿
 GHL entered into an agreement with MCL and MCL’s owners, pursuant to which GHL purchased an initial 6.36% ownership interest in MCL and agreed to purchase an additional ownership interest of up to a total of 51% of MCL over a three-year period for approximately $3.6 million.  GHL has the option to purchase an additional 19% ownership interest in MCL for a total of 70% of MCL under certain conditions. In October 2018, GHL purchased an additional 2.85% ownership interest in MCL for $0.2 million, resulting in a total ownership interest of 9.21%. MCL is the owner of a small hotel and entertainment and gaming club in the Cao Bang province of Vietnam that is 300 feet from the Vietnamese – Chinese border station. The hotel offers 32 rooms, and the entertainment and gaming club currently offers nine electronic table games for non-Vietnamese passport holders under a provincial investment certificate that allows for up to 26 electronic table games. GHL and MCL also entered into a management agreement under which GHL is managing the operations at the hotel and entertainment and gaming club in exchange for receiving a portion of MCL’s net profit. 
 ﻿
 Additional Projects and Other Developments

We are exploring an expansion at Century Casino & Hotel Cripple Creek to provide additional hotel rooms for our existing casino and hotel.
 ﻿
 In August 2017, we announced that, together with the owner of the Hamilton Princess Hotel & Beach Club in Hamilton, Bermuda, we had submitted a license application to the Bermudan government for a casino at the Hamilton Princess Hotel & Beach Club. The casino will feature approximately 200 slot machines, 17 live table games, one or more electronic table games and a high limit area and salon privé. In September 2017, the Bermuda Casino Gaming Commission granted a provisional casino gaming license, which is subject to certain conditions and approvals including the adoption of certain rules and regulations by the Parliament of Bermuda. CRM entered into a long-term management agreement with the owner of the hotel to manage the operations of the casino and receive a management fee if the license is awarded. CRM will also provide a $5.0 million loan for the purchase of casino equipment if the license is awarded.
 ﻿
 We have additional potential gaming projects and acquisition opportunities that we are currently exploring. Along with the capital needs of potential projects, there are various other risks which, if they materialize, could affect our ability to complete a proposed project or acquisition or could eliminate its feasibility altogether. For more information on these and other risks related to our business, see Item 1A, “Risk Factors” below. 
 ﻿

Capital Needs, Uses and Cash Flow

As a gaming company, our operating results are highly dependent on the volume of customers at our casinos. Most of our revenue is essentially cash-based, through customers wagering with cash or paying for non-gaming services with cash or credit cards. Our industry is capital intensive, and we rely heavily on the ability of our casinos to generate operating cash flow to maintain operations, fund reinvestment in existing properties for both refurbishment and expansion projects, repay third party debt, and pursue additional growth via new development and acquisition opportunities. When necessary and available, we supplement the cash flows generated by our operations with either cash on hand or funds provided by bank borrowings or other debt or equity financing.

 Marketing and Competition

We face intense competition from other casinos within the jurisdictions in which we operate. Many of our competitors are larger and have substantially greater name recognition and financial and marketing resources than we do. We seek to compete through promotion of our players’ clubs, enhancement of social networking initiatives and other marketing efforts. In addition to our players’ clubs, we also have various cash and prize promotions and market our casinos through a variety of media outlets including internet, television, radio, print and billboard advertising. Our marketing focuses on competition and other facts and circumstances of each market area in which we operate. Our primary marketing strategy centers on attracting new customers and rewarding repeat customers through our players’ club programs. All visitors to our properties are offered the opportunity to join our players’ club. We maintain a proprietary database that consists primarily of slot machine customers that allows us to create effective targeted marketing and promotional programs, cash and merchandise giveaways, coupons, downloadable promotional credits, preferred parking, food, lodging, game tournaments and other special events. In Colorado, our players’ club cards allow us to update our database and track member gaming preferences, including, but not limited to, maximum, minimum, and total amounts wagered and frequency of visits. We have designed reward programs based on total amount wagered and frequency of visits to reward customer loyalty and attract new customers to our properties. Those who qualify for VIP status receive additional benefits compared to regular club membership, such as invitations to exclusive VIP events.

Canada

· | Edmonton – As of December 31, 2018, the Century Casino & Hotel in Edmonton, Canada and Century Casino St. Albert have six competitors (five casinos and one REC) in the Edmonton market. The distance between our properties is approximately 13 miles. We do not believe that our properties compete against one another for customers. The Century Mile project will be located 30 miles from our existing properties. As a result and because the competing REC in the market has closed, we do not anticipate that the opening of Century Mile will increase competition in the Edmonton market.

§ | Century Casino & Hotel in Edmonton – This property is one of two casinos in Edmonton that have both a hotel and showrooms.

Our main marketing activity focuses on branding the casino, through various forms of media, as the ultimate entertainment destination and as a provider of a sophisticated, interactive and intimate gaming experience. The casino is located in a densely populated area with the closest competing casino approximately five miles away.

 United States
 Cripple Creek, Central City and Black Hawk are the only three cities in Colorado that allow gaming, exclusive of two Native American gaming operations in southwestern Colorado. Cripple Creek, located approximately 45 miles southwest of Colorado Springs, and Central City and Black Hawk, located approximately 35 miles west of Denver, are historic mining towns dating back to the late 1800’s that have developed into tourist attractions. As of December 31, 2018, there were 12 active casino licensees operating in Cripple Creek, 6 active casino licensees operating in Central City and 15 active casino licensees operating in Black Hawk. Unlike other regions in which we operate, gaming in Colorado is “limited stakes”, which restricts any single wager to a current maximum of one hundred dollars. 
 ﻿

The cities of Central City and Black Hawk are adjoining small mountain tourist towns, located approximately one mile apart. Central City and Black Hawk compete with one another for market share, and we view the two cities as one combined market servicing the Denver area. Black Hawk, which we believe does not maintain the same rigorous historical preservation standards as Central City, has been able to successfully attract major casino industry leaders with the ability to offer larger hotels, upscale dining facilities, performance centers and spa facilities. The casino operations in Black Hawk constitute a significant portion of the overall casino gaming market in Colorado (exclusive of the Native American gaming operations), with 56% of the total gaming devices in Colorado in 2018 and approximately 75% of total gaming revenue in Colorado in 2018.
 ﻿

Management believes that an integral component in attracting gaming patrons to our Colorado casinos is the availability of adequate, nearby parking and lodging. At our Cripple Creek property, we presently own a total of 271 surface parking spaces. We believe we have sufficient close proximity parking. However, covered parking garages provided by four of our competitors in Cripple Creek may negatively impact our casino, particularly during inclement weather. Our casino in Central City has a 500-space covered parking garage offering free public parking. Several other casinos in the Central City/Black Hawk market also have covered parking garages. In addition, three of our competitors in the Cripple Creek market and five of our competitors in the Central City and Black Hawk market have more hotel rooms, providing them with an advantage during inclement weather and the peak tourist season. 
 ﻿
 Our marketing objective for the casinos in Colorado is to create public awareness by positioning our casinos as the premier provider of personal service, convenient parking, the latest gaming products and superior food. In addition to our players’ clubs, we also have various cash and prize promotions and market our casinos through a variety of channels including radio, billboard, print and social media.

 Poland
 There are 52 casino licenses available throughout Poland. The Polish government generally forbids the marketing of gaming activities outside of a casino, but the marketing of entertainment is permissible. Therefore, CPL’s marketing has focused on advertising the entertainment possibilities at each casino, such as concerts and parties. CPL also relies on the locations of its casinos, which are primarily in hotels in major cities throughout Poland, to attract customers. The Polish government issues casino licenses in Poland by district, and there are additional casinos in each district in which CPL operates. For example, four other casinos in the Warsaw district compete with our two casinos operating in Warsaw. The Polish Minister of Finance does not disclose individual casino data. Changes to the Polish gaming law that went into effect in April 2017 legalize online gaming and reintroduce slot arcades through a state-run company. Slot arcades began operating in June 2018 and online gaming began in December 2018. We have not experienced a negative impact to our results of operations in Poland from slot arcades or online gaming; however, the increased competition from slot arcades that are located in the cities in which our casinos are located as well as online gaming could occur and adversely affect our results of operations in the future.    ﻿Corporate and Other

· | Cruise Ships – We have limited marketing opportunities on our ship-based casinos. We work jointly with the onboard revenue departments of the cruise lines on casino promotions and signage, which are in line with the cruise line’s guidelines. While we offer modern gaming products, we compete with other activities on the ship as well as onshore activities, including land-based casinos.

· | Bath, England – CCB currently is the only casino in the city of Bath. No additional casino licenses can be created in, or moved to, Bath without new legislation by the British Parliament. The casino is located in a new development in the center of Bath’s evening leisure district adjoining the Komedia Club and opposite the Theatre Royal. In addition to the casino, the leisure district includes a new 4-star boutique hotel with 147 rooms and two ground floor restaurants. The closest competition is three casinos located in Bristol, 13 miles away.

 Seasonality 

Canada – Our Edmonton and Calgary casinos in Alberta, Canada attract more customers from September through April. During the remainder of the year, the casinos attract fewer customers because we compete with outdoor activities. Century Downs also attracts additional customers during the racing season from March through November. Our off-track betting parlors attract more customers during the peak racing season from May through August.
 ﻿
 United States – Our casinos in Colorado attract more customers during the warmer months from May through September. We expect to attract fewer customers from October through April because weather conditions during this period are variable and can have a significant impact on daily business levels. 
 ﻿
 Poland – CPL generally attracts more customers from October through March because domestic customers generally vacation out of the country during the summer months.

 Corporate and Other

· | Cruise Ships – Our business onboard cruise ships typically is not impacted by seasonality because the cruise ships generally operate year round. Our revenue from these operations fluctuates significantly with the volume and quality of the players onboard the ships. In addition, the cruise ships on which we conduct operations may be out of service from time to time for maintenance or based on the operating schedule of the cruise line, which may impact revenue from our cruise ship casinos.

Governmental Regulation and Licensing

The ownership and operation of casino gaming facilities are subject to extensive state, local, foreign, provincial or federal regulations. We are required to obtain and maintain gaming licenses in each of the jurisdictions in which we conduct gaming operations. The limitation, conditioning, suspension, revocation or non-renewal of gaming licenses, or the failure to reauthorize gaming in certain jurisdictions, would materially adversely affect our gaming operations in that jurisdiction. In addition, changes in law that restrict or prohibit gaming operations in any jurisdiction could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
 ﻿

Statutes and regulations can require us to meet various standards relating to, among other matters, business licenses, registration of employees, floor plans, background investigations of licensees and employees, historic preservation, building, fire and accessibility requirements, payment of gaming taxes, and regulations concerning equipment, machines, chips, gaming participants, and ownership interests. Civil and criminal penalties, including shutdowns or the loss of our ability to operate gaming facilities in a particular jurisdiction, can be assessed against us and/or our officers to the extent of their individual participation in, or association with, a violation of any of the state or local gaming statutes or regulations. Such laws and regulations apply in all jurisdictions in which we may do business. Management believes that we are in compliance with all applicable gaming and non-gaming regulations as described below.

Canada
 AGLC - Gaming in Alberta is governed by the provincial government. The AGLC administers and regulates the gaming industry in Alberta. The AGLC operates in accordance with the Gaming and Liquor Act, the Gaming and Liquor Regulation and the Criminal Code of Canada. 
 ﻿

The AGLC requires all gaming operations to be licensed but only allows a certain number of licenses to be granted. All available licenses have currently been granted and the AGLC has an indefinite moratorium on new casinos and RECs. If the AGLC increases the number of licenses available in the future, applicants for a gaming license must submit an application and run through a detailed approval process. Following the approval of the board of the AGLC, the applicant may operate the casino applied for in accordance with federal and provincial legislation, regulation, and policies as well as the municipal requirements, permits, licenses and authorization relating to the casino. In September 2018, the AGLC extended the renewal period for our four casinos in Alberta with the next renewals scheduled for 2019 for all properties. Our licenses are renewable every five years at Edmonton and Calgary and every two years at Century Downs and St. Albert. The AGLC monitors the casino operator and its compliance with all requirements. In the event of a violation of such requirements, civil and criminal charges can be assessed. The failure or inability of our casinos, or the failure or inability of others associated with these casinos, to maintain necessary gaming licenses or approvals for our casinos would have a material adverse effect on our operations.
 ﻿
 The AGLC allows casinos to operate slot machines and table games a daily maximum of 17 consecutive hours commencing at 10:00 a.m. and ending no later than 3:00 a.m. and to operate casino poker rooms 24 hours a day. Casinos and RECs may permit only individuals 18 or older to gamble in the casino. The AGLC permits slot machines, video lottery terminals, baccarat, blackjack, poker, craps and roulette. There is a maximum single bet of $2,000 on table games and a maximum table aggregate bet of $12,000 on baccarat. There is also a maximum denomination bet of $5 for slot machines with a maximum single bet of $125. 
 ﻿

The AGLC provides casinos with slot machines, slot technicians and personnel to administer table game counts. In return, casino licensees provide the AGLC with a place to operate slot machines, market the casinos, and provide table game dealers, slot attendants, security and surveillance. Casino licensees do not incur lease expenditures to the AGLC. In lieu of these lease expenses and other expenses associated with operating slot machines (i.e. equipment and personnel), casino licensees retain only a portion of net sales. Net sales, as defined by the AGLC, are calculated as cash played, less cash won, less the cost to lease the equipment, if applicable. At our Edmonton, St. Albert and Calgary casinos, the AGLC retains 85% of slot machine net sales, of which it allocates 15% to charities designated by the AGLC and 70% to the Alberta Lottery Fund. At Century Downs, the AGLC retains 45% of slot machine net sales, which are allocated to the Alberta Lottery Fund. For all table games, excluding poker and craps, we are required to allocate 50% of our net win to a charity designated by the AGLC, with the exception of St. Albert, from which we allocate 35% of our net win to a charity designated by the AGLC. For poker and craps, we are required to allocate 25% of our net win to the charity. We record our revenue net of the amounts retained by the AGLC or allocated to the AGLC-designated charity or the Alberta Lottery Fund.
 ﻿
 HRA - HRA was formed in June 2002 to facilitate long term industry renewal for horse racing. The objectives of HRA are to govern, direct, control, regulate, manage, market and promote horse racing in any or all of its forms; to protect the health, safety and welfare of racehorses and, with respect to horse racing, the safety and welfare of racing participants and racing officials; and to safeguard the interest of the general public in horse racing.
 ﻿
 HRA requires all horse racing operators to be licensed. A licensed operator is responsible for the general supervision of horse races at its facilities but must not interfere with the proper performance of the functions and responsibilities of racing officials. Only individuals 18 or older may place a bet on horse races. HRA also prohibits racing officials, HRA employees, jockeys, drivers of horses and any employee of any of them from betting on a race, encouraging others to bet on a race on their behalf or owning a pari-mutuel ticket. A licensed owner of a horse, its trainer and any authorized agent or employee of such owner or trainer may not bet or encourage others to place a bet on their behalf on a horse other than the horse owned or trained by such licensed owner or trainer.
 ﻿
 A licensed operator must also provide and maintain a suitable racetrack, file with HRA a certificate of measurement of the track and provide services at race meetings, including first aid and ambulance facilities. HRA must approve the equipment, facility and any services the operator will provide. HRA also requires a licensed operator to establish and maintain complete records of each horse race conducted by the operator.
 ﻿
 The HRA’s portion of slot machine net sales retained from Century Downs, which is currently 11.25%, is used to fund animal welfare programs, purses, breed improvement programs, marketing, and administration and backstretch programs. For off-track betting and live racing wagers, CBS and CDR retain approximately 21.5% of each bet, from which they will distribute 5.4% to the HRA, 0.8% to the Canadian Pari-Mutuel Agency and use the remainder to pay expenses related to the conduct of pari-mutuel wagering.
 ﻿
 United States

The ownership and operation of gaming facilities in Colorado are subject to extensive state and local regulations. Licenses must be obtained from the Colorado Limited Gaming Control Commission (the “Gaming Commission”) prior to offering limited gaming to the public in the State of Colorado. In addition, the Division of Gaming (the “DOG”) within the Colorado Department of Revenue, licenses, implements, regulates, and supervises the conduct of limited stakes gaming. The Director of the DOG, under the supervision of the Gaming Commission, has been granted broad powers to ensure compliance with the laws and regulations. The Gaming Commission, DOG and DOG Director are collectively referred to as the “Colorado Gaming Authorities.”
 ﻿
 The laws, regulations, and internal control minimum procedures of the Colorado Gaming Authorities seek to maintain public confidence and trust that licensed limited gaming is conducted honestly and competitively, that the rights of the creditors of licensees are protected, and that gaming is free from criminal and corruptive elements. The Colorado Gaming Authorities’ stated policy is that public confidence and trust can be maintained only by strict regulation of all persons, locations, practices, associations, and activities related to the operation of the licensed gaming establishments and the manufacture and distribution of gaming devices and equipment. 
 ﻿

 The Gaming Commission is empowered to issue six types of licenses. In order to operate a casino, an operator is required to obtain a retail gaming license. Further, under Colorado gaming regulations, no person or entity can have an ownership interest in more than three retail licenses. We currently operate under the maximum of three retail gaming licenses in Colorado (Century Casino & Hotel in Cripple Creek operates under two gaming licenses). Licenses must be renewed every two years, with the next renewals scheduled for 2019 for our casinos in Central City and Cripple Creek. In addition, the Gaming Commission has broad discretion to revoke, suspend, condition, limit or restrict the licensee at any time. The failure or inability of the Century Casino & Hotel in Central City or Cripple Creek, or the failure or inability of others associated with these casinos, to maintain necessary gaming licenses or approvals for the casinos would have a material adverse effect on our operations.    ﻿

Our Colorado casinos must meet specified architectural requirements and must not exceed specified gaming square footage limits as a total of each floor and the full building. Colorado casinos may operate 24-hours a day, and may permit only individuals 21 or older to gamble in the casino. Colorado law permits slot machines, blackjack, poker, craps and roulette with a maximum single bet of $100. Colorado casinos may not provide credit to gaming patrons. 
 ﻿

The Colorado constitution permits a gaming tax of up to 40% on adjusted gross proceeds (“AGP”), and voter approval is required for any increase to this gaming tax rate. The current gaming tax in Colorado established by the Gaming Commission is a graduated rate of 0.25% to 20% on AGP, where casinos pay a higher percentage as their AGP increase. 
 ﻿

Colorado law requires that every officer, director or stockholder holding a 5% or greater interest or controlling interest of a publicly traded corporation, or owner of an applicant or licensee, shall be a person of good moral character and submit to and pay the cost of a full background investigation conducted by the Gaming Commission. Persons found unsuitable by the Gaming Commission may be required to immediately terminate any interest in, association or agreement with, or relationship to, a gaming licensee. A finding of unsuitability with respect to any officer, director, employee, associate, lender or beneficial owner of a licensee or applicant may also jeopardize the licensee’s retail license or applicant’s license application. Licenses may, however, be conditioned upon termination of any relationship with unsuitable persons. 
 ﻿

We may not issue any voting securities except in accordance with the provisions of the Colorado Limited Gaming Act (the “Act”) and the regulations promulgated thereunder. The issuance of any voting securities in violation of the Act will be void, and the voting securities will be deemed not to be issued and outstanding. No voting securities may be transferred, except in accordance with the provisions of the Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder. Any transfer in violation of these provisions will be void. If the Gaming Commission at any time determines that a holder of our voting securities is unsuitable to hold the securities, then we may, within sixty (60) days after the finding of unsuitability, purchase the voting securities of the unsuitable person at the lesser of (a) the cash equivalent of such person’s investment, or (b) the current market price as of the date of the finding of unsuitability, unless such voting securities are transferred to a suitable person within sixty (60) days after the finding of unsuitability. Until our voting securities are owned by persons found by the Gaming Commission to be suitable to own them, (a) we are not permitted to pay any dividends or interest with regard to the voting securities, (b) the holder of such voting securities will not be entitled to vote, and the voting securities will not for any purposes be included in the voting securities entitled to vote, and (c) we may not pay any remuneration in any form to the holder of the voting securities, except in exchange for the voting securities.
 ﻿
 Poland

Gaming in Poland is governed by the Minister of Finance, who operates in accordance with Polish gaming law and has the authority to grant casino licenses. Polish gaming law was enacted in 1992. Key items included in Polish gaming law include the following requirements:
 ﻿

· | Slot arcades and online gaming are operated through a state-run company;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | A maximum of 70 slot machines are allowed per casino;
--+------------------------------------------------------


· | Licenses are not renewable, and licensees must reapply for a license once their current six-year license has expired;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The gaming tax rate assessed on gross gaming revenue is 50%; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


· | Poker cash games are prohibited in Poland, except for authorized poker tournaments.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

Casino licenses in Poland are limited to 52 and are subject to regional limitations. Before a casino license expires, the Minister of Finance notifies the public of its availability, and those interested can submit an application for the casino license. Applicants for a gaming license must complete a detailed approval process. Following approval from the Minister of Finance, there is a period in which applicants can appeal the decision. Once the license is awarded, the applicant may operate the casino for six years. The Minister of Finance monitors the casino operator and its compliance with all requirements. In the event of a violation, the Minister of Finance can assess charges and, in certain cases, withdraw casino licenses.    ﻿

· | Bath, England – Gaming in England is governed by the Gambling Commission, operating in accordance with the Gambling Act of 2005.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿
 The laws and regulations of the Gambling Commission seek to keep gambling crime free, ensure that gambling is conducted in a fair and open way, and protect children and other vulnerable people from being harmed or exploited by gambling. Casino operators must create corporate policies and procedures in compliance with the Gambling Commission’s License Conditions and Codes of Practice and other industry guidance. Operators must commit to conducting their licensing activities with integrity, maintaining a responsible gaming provision, providing regular training to advise and guide staff as well as ensuring that a healthy, responsible and informed environment is maintained.
 ﻿
 In order to operate a casino, an operator is required to obtain an operating license, personal licenses and a premises license from the Gambling Commission. The operator must pay an annual fee to maintain an operating license, and the license may be suspended or revoked. Personal licenses are granted to individuals responsible for activities at licensed gambling operators and are renewed every five years. A premises license is granted to operate a casino on certain premises. Currently, no additional premise licenses can be awarded under the Gambling Act of 2005.
 ﻿
 The Gambling Act of 2005 sets the gambling duty rate based on the type of gambling and gross gaming yield of the casino premises. The gaming duty rate is scaled from 15% to 50% based on the gross gaming yield in a three-month period.
 ﻿
 The Gambling Act of 2005 requires that a personal declaration be completed by any stockholder holding a 10% or greater interest in a company that owns a casino. In addition, the Gambling Commission also requires that the company list all stockholders with a 3% or greater interest in the company. 
 ﻿

· | Vietnam – Gaming in Vietnam is governed by the Socialist Republic of Vietnam through the Decree on Casino Business.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿
 Under the Decree on Casino Business, casino operators must conduct their operations with transparency, objectiveness and honesty. Operators are required to have a certificate of eligibility to run a casino in Vietnam. Minh Chau’s certificate is valid through 2053. The casino is issued a certificate stating the number of slot and/or table games that it is allowed to operate. A casino operator may increase that number with approval from the Prime Minister and additional investment into the casino.
 ﻿
 Gambling within casinos is banned for Vietnamese citizens, and only foreign tourists can gamble in casinos located within the country. In 2018, a three-year pilot program was commenced to allow Vietnamese citizens to gamble within specified casinos within the country. Minh Chau is not one of the casinos that was named to participate in this pilot program.
 ﻿

Other Regulation

We are subject to certain foreign, federal, state, provincial and local safety and health, employment and environmental laws, regulations and ordinances that apply to our non-gaming operations. We have not made, and do not anticipate making, material expenditures with respect to these laws, regulations and ordinances. However, the coverage of, and attendant compliance costs associated with, such laws, regulations and ordinances may result in future additional costs to our operations.
 ﻿

Rules and regulations regarding the service of alcoholic beverages are strict. The loss or suspension of a liquor license could significantly impair our operations. Local building, parking and fire codes and similar regulations also could impact our operations and any proposed development of our properties.
 ﻿
 We also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to various reporting and anti-money laundering laws and regulations. Any violations of anti-money laundering laws or regulations by any of our properties could have an adverse effect on our business.

Employees

As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 1,757 full-time employees and 415 part-time employees. During busier months, a casino may supplement its permanent staff with seasonal employees. Approximately 231 employees at our CPL casinos in Poland belong to trade unions. The trade unions do not currently have any collective bargaining agreements with CPL, but changes in pay of union employees at CPL require approval of the unions.
