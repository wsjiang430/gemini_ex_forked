ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Description of Business
Townsquare is a community-focused digital media and digital marketing solutions company with market leading local radio stations, principally focused outside the top 50 markets in the U.S. Our integrated and diversified products and solutions enable local, regional and national advertisers to target audiences across multiple platforms, including digital, mobile, social, video, streaming, e-commerce, radio and events. Our assets include a subscription digital marketing services business (“Townsquare Interactive”), providing website design, creation and hosting, search engine optimization, social platforms and online reputation management for approximately 30,650 small to medium sized businesses; a robust digital advertising division (“Townsquare Ignite,” or “Ignite”), a powerful combination of (a) an owned and operated portfolio of more than 400 local news and entertainment websites and mobile apps along with a network of leading national music and entertainment brands, collecting valuable first party data and (b) a proprietary digital programmatic advertising technology stack with an in-house demand and data management platform; and a portfolio of 357 local terrestrial radio stations in 74 U.S. markets strategically situated outside the Top 50 markets in the United States. Our portfolio includes local media brands such as WYRK.com, WJON.com and NJ101.5.com, and premier national music brands such as XXLmag.com, TasteofCountry.com, UltimateClassicRock.com, and Loudwire.com.
We believe that our diversified product offering substantially differentiates us from our competition. This diversification allows us to provide superior solutions to our advertisers and engaging experiences for our audience, underpins our growth strategy and, we believe, helps to mitigate the risks associated with advertising revenue dependency.
In our markets, we are among the largest providers of original local content available to consumers. The quality and availability of our original local content distinguishes our brands from other local offerings, attracting large and loyal audiences. Several of our competitors, particularly in print media, have reduced the amount of original local content they produce or created pay-walls that restrict access to their content. According to research conducted by UNC School of Media and Journalism, approximately 1,800 newspapers have closed in the United States since 2004. We believe these trends will continue and further amplify the attractiveness of our offerings as we fill this expanding void in our communities, both online and on-air. We believe that our focus on providing original local news, entertainment, music and lifestyle media experiences to our audience is a key driver of our powerful reach and engagement metrics. In 2022, we set new company records reaching more than 70 million unique visitors per month, on average, across our digital platform, 11 million listeners on a weekly basis across our radio platform, and 42 million social media followers across our local and national media brands. We believe the investment in our original content strategy has contributed to a larger and more engaged online audience that is spending more time-consuming content on our websites and mobile apps, and a stable radio audience, in terms of both number of listeners and, importantly, time spent listening.
The local media industry is an important medium for advertisers to reach local consumers and for consumers to engage with relevant local content and events. According to S&P Global Market Intelligence, local advertising spending across all U.S. major media categories was forecasted to be $106.0 billion in 2022. Since 2017, U.S. local advertising has increased at a 5.4% compound annual growth rate and is projected to grow at a 6.0% compound annual growth rate through 2026.
Our Transformation
Townsquare was founded in 2010 with 60 radio stations in 13 markets with a vision of becoming the number one local media company in each of our markets. Through a series of acquisitions, we built our radio platform to 357 radio stations across 74 local markets. Since 2010, we have leveraged our radio platform to penetrate these local markets and organically build a full and comprehensive suite of digital advertising and marketing solutions that meet our customers’ needs to grow their business. Our significant radio reach and audience engagement provided a powerful foundation from which we were able to build and grow our digital solutions, including websites, mobile applications, a social media presence, online radio streams, subscription digital marketing solutions, and a robust programmatic owned 
and operated digital advertising platform. We believe that the increased interaction and engagement with consumers across our digital products and platforms in turn reinforces consumer loyalty and affinity toward our local radio brands.
Radio is a component of our business. However, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence, radio advertising was approximately 5% of all advertising dollars spent in the United States in 2022, while digital advertising solutions contributed approximately 65%. According to S&P Global Market Intelligence, it is estimated that digital advertising will grow to represent over 70% of all advertising spend in 2025. Therefore, while radio will continue to be a component of our local offering, we do not expect it to be our primary growth driver. Our growth engine is and will be digital, and we now consider ourselves a “Digital First” local media company.
Digital First. Internally and externally, we position ourselves as a digital company that also owns powerful local radio assets. Therefore, when any of our local sales account executives engage with local advertisers to help them grow their business, they are able to educate them on how important it is to have a strong digital presence and online storefront, and how Townsquare has the preeminent tools and suite of solutions to accomplish that for them. Digital First means ensuring that our content is as engaging, relevant and local online as it is on-air. In addition, it means that our first priority for internal investment is to fuel the growth in our digital platforms, in terms of additional personnel, incremental product development and physical expansion. Our longstanding local client relationships, combined with our best-in-class digital product suite and skilled salesforce, have enabled us to create meaningful digital businesses and fully embrace a Digital First strategy.
Our Segments
The Company has identified three segments, which are Subscription Digital Marketing Solutions, Digital Advertising, Broadcast Advertising, and the remainder of our business is reported in an Other category. The Subscription Digital Marketing Solutions segment includes our subscription digital marketing solutions business, Townsquare Interactive. The Digital Advertising segment, which we market externally as Townsquare Ignite, includes digital advertising on our owned and operated digital properties and our digital programmatic advertising platform. The Broadcast Advertising segment includes our local, regional and national advertising products and solutions delivered via terrestrial radio broadcast, and other miscellaneous revenue that is associated with our broadcast advertising platform. The Other category includes our owned and operated live events.
Our Digital revenue, comprised of our Subscription Digital Marketing Solutions segment and our Digital Advertising segment, was $230.8 million in 2022 and $198.7 million in 2021, comprising 50% and 48% of our total net revenue, respectively. Our organically developed, flexible and customized content management system, digital advertising products and delivery capabilities, mobile applications, digital marketing solutions capabilities, digital programmatic advertising platform, data management and analytics and strategic insights platform, and online video content allow us to deliver world-class products in markets outside the top 50 in the U.S. As such, we believe we offer superior solutions for advertisers and audiences alike as compared to many of our local competitors.
Subscription Digital Marketing Solutions
Our Subscription Digital Marketing Solutions segment encompasses Townsquare Interactive, our subscription digital marketing solutions business. Townsquare Interactive offers digital marketing solutions, on a subscription basis, to small and medium-sized businesses (“SMBs”) in markets outside the top 50 across the United States, including but importantly not limited to the markets in which we operate radio stations. As of December 31, 2022, Townsquare Interactive had approximately 30,650 subscribers, 61% of which are located outside our local radio footprint. A subscriber is defined as a customer that has the right to receive subscription digital marketing services. Subscribers include customers in promotional periods. Unless converted to a paying subscription, these customers are removed from the subscriber list at the end of the promotion. Additionally, subscribers include customers whose subscription fees are past due while attempting to collect payment until the Company terminates the customers rights due to non-payment. Our Subscription Digital Marketing Solutions segment generated net revenue of $90.4 million in 2022 and $81.8 million in 2021.
We offer a variety of digital marketing solutions, which enables SMBs to choose the optimal features for their specific business. These solutions primarily include:
•Traditional and mobile-enabled website design, creation, and development as well as hosting services;
•Search engine optimization services;
•Online directory optimization services;
•E-commerce solutions;
•Online reputation monitoring;
•Social media management;
•Appointment scheduling services;
•Payment and invoice services;
•Customer management services;
•Email marketing services; and
•Website retargeting.
We believe our Townsquare Interactive offerings represent an attractive value and provide strong return on investment for our SMB clients as compared to the competition, such as self-serve platforms or others that charge a significant upfront fee in addition to hourly customer service rates. Our pricing is transparent and fixed on a monthly basis, providing for unlimited customer service. Some features which differentiates our offerings include:
•Unlimited changes and edits to website before and after launch;
•Responsive web design that works on every screen size (desktop and mobile);
•Custom content written for the specific business, industry and location; and
•Optimized keywords to improve rankings in Google and other search results.
We target SMBs outside the top 50 markets in the U.S., outside and within our 74 local media market footprint. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 61% of our total subscriber base was located in markets outside of our local media footprint. Our Townsquare Interactive sales team of approximately 200 sellers target private, independently owned SMBs outside of the top 50 markets, with less than 20 employees and less than $5 million of annual revenue. We believe this customer profile represents the ideal potential customer for our product, and we believe the addressable market for such potential subscribers of Townsquare Interactive is approximately 8.8 million SMBs which translates to a $32 billion Total Addressable Market (“TAM”) value. We also leverage our local sales teams in our 74 markets, who enjoy trusted and long-standing local relationships and heritage brand recognition, to sell Townsquare Interactive solutions within our market footprint.
Digital Advertising
Our Digital Advertising segment, marketed externally as Townsquare Ignite, is a combination of our owned and operated digital properties, our proprietary digital programmatic advertising platform, and an in-house demand and data management platform collecting valuable first party data. We generated Digital Advertising revenue of $140.4 million in 2022 and $116.9 million in 2021.
•Owned and Operated Platform. We connect local, regional and national advertisers to an audience of more than 70 million unique visitors on average per month in 2022, across our portfolio of over 400 local websites (many of which are companion websites to our local radio stations), 10 leading national music and entertainment websites and over 390 mobile apps. Our on-air personalities, or as we refer to them “the original social influencers” are also digital content creators, and create or curate approximately 20,000 pieces of content per month for our websites and apps, making Townsquare one of the largest producers of original local content in the United States. The content management system that powers our content platforms was built in-house by our product and technology team. In addition, we have more than 42 million social media followers and our YouTube platform has generated over 4.0 billion lifetime views.
•Digital Programmatic Advertising Platform. We offer precision customer targeting solutions to local, regional and national advertisers through our proprietary digital programmatic advertising platform. Combining first and 
third-party audience and geographic location data, we are able to hyper-target audiences for our advertisers, enabling them to reach a high percentage of their targeted online audience with the right message at the right time. We deliver these solutions across desktop, mobile, connected TV, email, paid search and social media platforms utilizing display, video and native executions. We have our own organically developed, in-house demand-side buying platform that is integrated with more than 10 digital advertising buying platforms with access to all major advertising exchanges and mobile apps, providing access to more than 250 billion impressions per day. This extensive access places us among the largest of the established in-house media trading desks. Additionally, we provide full-service design and creative services to assist clients in crafting the right marketing message and developing and building assets and creative for their campaign across the desired platform (i.e., display, social, video, or audio).
•Data Analytics and Management Platform. As a publisher, we are able to collect and analyze first-party data from our owned and operated portfolio of websites and apps, leading to detailed insights about consumer behaviors, audience interest and purchase intent. We use this data in our sales process, helping our sales team generate new business and upsell current clients, and to inform our client’s advertising campaigns, providing significant value to our clients.
Broadcast Advertising
Our primary source of Broadcast Advertising net revenue is the sale of advertising on our local radio stations to local, regional and national spot advertisers, and national network advertisers. Our Broadcast Advertising segment revenue was $223.8 million in 2022 and $215.5 million in 2021.
We believe we are the largest and best-capitalized owner and operator of radio stations focused solely on markets outside the top 50 markets in the United States. Our scale allows us to have greater relevance to, and recognition from, our advertising clients while sharing best practices for strategy and operations across our asset portfolio. As of December 31, 2022, we owned and operated 357 radio stations in 74 local markets, importantly all outside the top 50 markets across the United States. Our radio assets are geographically diversified, which helps to mitigate potential regional economic volatility and inclement weather events. By clustering our markets in the Northeast, Upper Midwest, Texas and Mountain West regions we are able to create compelling audience coverage for regional advertisers and benefit from economies of scale. As of March 7, 2023, we own 83 radio stations formatted with Country content, 77 formatted with News/Talk/Sports content and 64 formatted with Rock content, representing approximately 23%, 22%, and 18% of our radio stations, respectively. The majority of our local radio stations airing these formats capture the largest audience, and thus are market leaders, among radio stations airing similar content in their respective markets, as ranked by Nielsen Holdings N.V. (“Nielsen”) or other ratings services. We endeavor to develop strong audience loyalty and believe that the diversification of formats on our radio stations helps to insulate our radio stations from the effects of changes in musical tastes of the public.
Despite the growth of alternative media choices, terrestrial radio has experienced negligible audience fragmentation over the past 50 years and remains a significant component of daily media exposure. According to Nielsen, terrestrial radio broadcasts reached approximately 85% of American adults ages 18+ each week as of December 2022, a level that has remained largely consistent since 1970. Given the stability of radio listenership and the population growth in the U.S., more people listen to radio on a weekly basis today than 10, 20 and even 30 years ago. The challenge for the radio industry overall has been time spent listening to radio and, unlike the industry overall, Townsquare’s time spent listening to our radio stations has been stable. We believe that our ability to maintain stable audience and time spent listening levels to our radio stations is driven by our focus on markets outside of the Top 50, where there is less competition and less local content available in our communities, and our investment in our original content strategy, which takes the form of investing in local talent and resources to support our local talent.
Given the stability of radio’s audience, its broad reach and its relatively low cost as compared to competing advertising media such as television, we believe radio continues to offer an attractive value proposition to advertisers. The price point for radio advertising on a cost per thousand basis is lower than most other local media that deliver similar scale. This makes radio more affordable and accessible for the type of small and mid-sized businesses typically found in our local markets outside the top 50 markets in the U.S.
Other
We report the remainder of our revenue in the Other category, and it includes revenue from our live events, which includes concerts, expositions, and other experiential events. Our live events portfolio includes iconic local events such as WYRK’s Taste of Country, the Boise Music Festival, the Red Dirt BBQ & Music Festival and Taste of Fort Collins. Our primary source of live events net revenue is ticket sales. Our live events also generate revenue through the sale of sponsorships, food and other concessions, merchandise and other ancillary products and services. Our Other category revenue was $8.4 million in 2022 and $3.8 million in 2021.
Overall
In the year ended December 31, 2022, we generated approximately 83% of our net revenue from a broad array of local and regional advertisers in a number of industries, including automotive dealers, banking and mortgage service providers, furniture and home furnishings retailers, food and beverage service providers, healthcare service providers and media and telecommunications service providers. We generate a majority of our advertising revenue by selling directly to local advertisers, as well as to local and regional advertising agencies which affords us the opportunity to better present our products, cross-sell products and more directly influence their advertising and marketing expenditure decisions.
No single customer accounted for more than approximately 1% of revenue in any of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2022, no advertising category, market, or state represented more than 20% of revenue. A significant percentage of our advertising revenue is generated from the sale of advertising to the automotive, financial services, health services, entertainment, and retail industries.
Our most significant expenses are sales personnel, programming, digital, marketing and promotional, engineering, and general and administrative expenses. We strive to control these expenses by closely monitoring and managing each of our local markets and through efficiencies gained from the centralization of finance, accounting, legal and human resources functions and management information systems. We also use our scale and diversified geographic portfolio to negotiate favorable rates with vendors where feasible.
A portion of our expenses are variable. These variable expenses primarily relate to sales costs, such as commissions and inventory costs, as well as certain programming costs, such as music license fees, and certain costs related to production. Other programming, digital, engineering and general and administrative expenses are primarily fixed costs.
Our business enjoys strong cash flow generation owing to the relatively limited capital needs of our operations. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded $15.8 million of capital expenditures, which represented 3.4% of net revenue during the same period. In addition, we benefit from certain tax attributes that generate tax deductions which have historically limited the amount of cash taxes we pay.
Our Growth Strategy
The principal features of our growth strategy are:
Digital First - Invest in Our Digital Businesses to Drive Further Growth.
We plan to continue to invest in the personnel supporting our digital growth, including our digital product technology, sales, content, and support teams, specifically in our Townsquare Interactive and Townsquare Ignite businesses. We have continually grown our digital team, including during the COVID-19 pandemic, which has allowed us to grow the number of subscribers and advertising clients we support on our digital platforms. In 2022, we opened a second location for Townsquare Interactive in Phoenix, AZ to further support growth in that subscription business by accessing a new geographic talent pool and better aligning our subscribers with support personnel in a similar time zone. 
Given our local content contributors on-air and online generate digital content and digital revenue, we also plan to continue to invest in the hiring of local content contributors.
Deepen Relationships with Advertisers to Increase Share of Advertising Spend.
We are committed to growing our local sales force, training our sales personnel and investing in our business to allow us to deepen relationships with our advertisers, including developing new digital products that will allow our content, and our advertisers, to reach a broader audience more frequently and in more locations. Over time, we believe we can capture a greater share of the digital advertising expenditure in our markets across all mediums and across industries, including but not limited to, digital, radio, print, outdoor, direct mail, and broadcast and cable television.
Continue to Develop New Products That Foster Interaction with Our Audience Across Multiple Platforms and Increase Monetization Opportunities.
Our audience reach, our direct relationship with local advertisers in our markets, and our tech capabilities position us to launch and monetize new products and services, further diversifying and growing our digital revenue. We have invested in world-class technology and infrastructure to create best of breed products and services to serve our clients and engage our loyal audience. In the past, we have organically built and introduced a variety of new products, including our subscription digital marketing solutions platform (Townsquare Interactive), various new offerings for Townsquare Interactive, our programmatic digital advertising platform (Townsquare Ignite), as well as mobile applications for individual stations and brands. We have also organically built and introduced a data and analytics tool and a data management platform that enhance our ability to create and deliver effective targeted broadcast and digital advertising campaigns for our clients. In addition to delivering revenue growth, these products and services frequently appeal to potential customers in our markets who may not access our heritage radio products, thereby leveraging our digital solutions to increase our overall customer base and revenue market share. We intend to continue to develop new products and offerings over time and to better monetize our audiences.
Focus on Differentiated Live and Local Content.
We generally provide a larger proportion of live and local content on-air and more original local content online relative to other local media companies in our markets. We believe such live, local, and original content is more engaging to our audience and differentiates our offerings in an increasingly crowded media landscape, mitigating the threat of audience attrition. Many competing audio media offerings, including Spotify, Pandora and SiriusXM, do not offer any local content in our markets. We intend to continue providing audiences with this differentiated local content and enjoy the advantages it provides us with our audience and our advertisers.
Continue to Build Our Premium Portfolio of Brands Superserving Our Communities.
Our branding strategy is fundamental to growing our audience and revenue. Across our markets, we have a large portfolio of distinct local and national brands that resonate with and appeal to our audiences. Many of our brands have several decades of heritage in our markets. Consumers associate our brands with high quality, locally-relevant content and entertainment. We intend to continue to invest in marketing and promotions to support our brands and to actively participate in community events to increase our local market presence.
Leverage Scalable Infrastructure and Continue to Improve Operating Efficiencies Across Our Company.
Our various media products and marketing services offerings share common, largely fixed-cost operating infrastructure, resulting in significant economies of scale. We also negotiate vendor contracts with key suppliers on a centralized basis, which further reduces costs. As a result, as we grow our revenue, a significant majority of each incremental dollar of revenue is converted into incremental earnings and cash flow.
Prudently Pursue Attractively-Valued Acquisition Opportunities.
We have a successful track record of sourcing and integrating acquisitions. Since our Company’s founding in 2010, we have expanded our local radio station portfolio from 60 to 357 by completing more than 10 radio transactions. We successfully transformed traditional broadcast radio assets that began with almost 100% of revenue tied to broadcast into Digital First brands that now generate a significant and growing amount of digital revenue. In addition to our radio acquisition activity, since 2010 we have executed acquisitions of digital assets, which have further extended our multi-product, cross-platform offering and provided geographic and revenue diversification. The acquired assets included certain assets of AOL Music and XXL. We intend to continue to consider attractively-priced acquisitions of radio stations and digital properties. We target assets that have strong brands, enjoy leading market share positions, generate strong cash flow, and generally possess traits consistent with our existing assets. In addition, acquiring assets allows us to achieve additional economies of scale, share best practices across a broader platform, and further diversify our revenue base across our properties and geographies.
Competition
The local media industry is very competitive. The success of each of our digital and radio properties depends largely upon our ability to attract audiences, to develop competitive products and solutions, and to price our products attractively relative to our local media competitors, as well as our ability to attract and retain sales, digital, content and leadership talent, and the overall demand for advertising within individual markets. We compete directly for audiences and advertising revenue with other radio broadcasters, satellite radio, cable television, broadcast television, print, and digital media operators, streaming music and video service providers and podcasters, amongst others. In addition, we compete for advertising revenue with a broader set of competitors in the advertising industry, including search and social media companies. We attempt to improve our competitive position, maximize our audience and grow our revenue by focusing on high quality, differentiated original local content and by providing innovative and effective advertising integrations for our customers, many of whom we have supported for many years, and managing our sales efforts to attract a larger share of advertising and marketing dollars from each customer.
The market for digital marketing solutions is highly fragmented, dynamic and competitive. Our competitors for Townsquare Interactive include large internet marketing providers, web development and hosting providers, yellow page publishers, newspaper and television companies, as well as other local SMB marketing providers. While some of our competitors enjoy greater name recognition, longer operating histories and larger marketing budgets, as well as substantially greater financial, technical and other resources, we believe we compete favorably and our products meet and exceed customer requirements and provide a strong return on investment due to our secure, reliable and integrated technology platform, cost-effective customer acquisition strategies, customer service and support, brand awareness and reputation, and overall customer satisfaction.
We mitigate the competitive pressures by focusing on markets outside the top 50 in the United States, where there are fewer and less well-capitalized digital marketing solutions providers and local media competitors. For example, in 50 of our 74 local markets, we do not compete against any of the five largest English language national radio competitors, as measured by revenue. Many competing audio media offerings, including Spotify, Pandora and SiriusXM, do not offer local content in our markets or have any local sales personnel. We believe this competitive landscape contributes to our success as we operate strong brands with deep local heritage, allowing our brands to gain a greater share of the local audience, and greater share of advertising and digital marketing expenditures in our markets than what is generally achieved by local media companies operating in larger markets. In addition, the small and mid-sized markets we operate in are generally supported by stable, locally significant institutions such as universities, military bases, state capitals, regional medical centers and retail hubs. We believe these stabilizing institutions further reduce the volatility of advertising spending in our markets.
Another significant mitigant to the competitive pressures we face in our markets is our talented local leadership who have strong local roots, connection to our communities and multi-platform sales and content skills. We have built a team of in-house recruiters that is crucial to our ability to identify and recruit highly skilled employees to our Company. In addition, we invest a significant amount of resources in training our employees so that they are fully equipped to execute our Digital First strategy and grow market share.
Seasonality
Our revenue varies throughout the year. Typically, we expect that our first calendar quarter will produce the lowest net revenue for the year, as advertising expenditures generally decline following the winter holidays. During even-numbered years, net revenue generally includes increased advertising expenditures by political candidates, political parties and special interest groups. Political spending is typically highest during the fourth quarter. Our operating results in any period may be affected by the incurrence of advertising and promotion expenses that typically do not have an effect on net revenue generation until future periods, if at all.
Macroeconomic Indicators
The U.S. economy and financial markets may continue to experience volatility due to the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic began to impact our operations in early March 2020, and included significant advertising cancellations and material declines in the purchase of new advertising by our clients, impairments to the carrying values of our FCC licenses and the cancellation of live events. As local public health conditions improved, our advertising revenue also improved. 
Current economic challenges, including the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, high and sustained inflation, rising interest rates, and supply chain disruptions have caused and could continue to cause economic uncertainty and volatility. These factors could result in advertising cancellations, declines in the purchase of new advertising by our clients and increases to our operating expenses. We monitor economic conditions closely, and in response to observed or anticipated reductions in revenue, we may institute precautionary measures to address the potential impact to our consolidated financial position, consolidated results of operations, and liquidity, including wage reduction efforts and controlling non-essential capital expenditures.
The extent of the impact of current economic conditions will depend on future actions and outcomes, all of which remain fluid and cannot be predicted with confidence (including effects on advertising activity, consumer discretionary spending and our employees in the markets in which we operate). 
Human Capital
Our most important core value is “You Matter.” We are not just a company; we are a team. “You Matter” means that every employee has an impact on our success, and it is our obligation to provide each employee with the tools, resources and leadership required to succeed and achieve our goals. We believe that if we work together to train, develop and reward our employees in ways that acknowledge performance, abilities and contributions, we will all grow together and share our individual and collective success.
Our ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate and retain our talent is critical to the future success and continued growth of our business. As such, we seek to provide a desirable work environment with competitive compensation and benefits packages, and create a collaborative culture that is focused on a team mentality and gives each individual the means to succeed and contribute to the company’s overall success. In addition, we have built a team of in-house recruiters that is crucial to our ability to identify and recruit highly skilled employees to our company.
In addition to competitive compensation packages, we offer a variety of health and insurance benefits, including:
•Employer sponsored health insurance;
•Company provided life insurance;
•Pet insurance;
•Paid sick, holidays and vacation;
•Volunteer time off;
•401(k) plan, with matching reinstated in 2022;
•Non-qualified employee stock purchase plan (launched January 1, 2022);
•Employee Assistance Program; and
•Employee discount program.
 Race, background, age, gender, sexual orientation, religion, physical ability, perspective and life experience are all important elements of each and every one of our team members are. We embrace this diversity because we care about our team members and because these individual perspectives contribute a wealth of knowledge, talent and experience that ultimately benefit the company. We have work to do, but our goal is for everyone in the company to be seen, heard and valued. We will accomplish this through increased awareness and empathy around the challenges faced by one another and by making diversity part of our culture and not just an initiative. In 2022, a Black Employee Resource Group, or B.E.R.G., was created with the mission to foster networking, professional development, mentoring and leadership opportunities with a focus on recruitment, retention, learning and development of Black people at Townsquare. Townsquare has also instituted diversity trainings for newly hired employees as well as ongoing trainings during employment. Townsquare's mission is to enhance the communities we serve and use our influential voices to improve and support all members of those communities.
Our radio stations and local websites, together with our employees, play a vital role in the communities we serve. During weather and other emergencies, government officials rely on our radio stations to disseminate critical, occasionally life-saving, information. Our radio stations, local websites, and mobile apps also routinely support charity and community events through on-air and digital promotions to bolster fundraising activities and emergency relief efforts.
As of December 31, 2022, we employed 2,442 full and part-time employees. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements and we consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory.
We employ individuals in a large variety of roles. On occasion, in order to protect our interests, we enter into employment agreements with certain of our employees, including members of the senior management team, product leaders, local market presidents and selected sales personnel and local media personalities. We do not believe that the loss of any one these individuals, excluding certain key members of our senior management, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations, taken as a whole. Our risks related to losing key members of our senior management are more fully described in the section titled “Risk Factors.”
Federal Regulation of Radio Broadcasting
General
The ownership, operation and sale of radio stations, including those licensed to us, are subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC, which acts under authority of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the “Communications Act”). The Telecommunications Act of 1996 amended the Communications Act and directed the FCC to change certain of its broadcast rules. Among its other regulatory responsibilities, the FCC issues permits and licenses to construct and operate radio stations; assigns broadcast frequencies; determines whether to approve changes in ownership or control of radio station licenses; regulates transmission equipment, operating power and other technical parameters of radio stations; adopts and implements regulations and policies that directly or indirectly affect the ownership, operation and employment practices of radio stations; regulates some forms of radio broadcast content; and has the authority under the Communications Act to impose penalties for violations of its rules.
The following is a brief summary of certain provisions of the Communications Act and relevant FCC rules and published policies (collectively, the “Communications Laws”). This description does not purport to be comprehensive and reference should be made to the Communications Laws, public notices, and decisions issued by the FCC for further information concerning the nature and extent of federal regulation of radio stations. Failure to observe the provisions of the Communications Laws can result in the imposition of various sanctions, including monetary forfeitures and the grant of a “short-term” (less than the maximum term) license renewal. For particularly egregious violations, the FCC may deny a radio station’s license renewal application, revoke a radio station’s license, or deny applications in which an applicant seeks to acquire additional broadcast properties.
License Renewal
Radio broadcast licenses are generally renewed for terms of eight years. Licenses are renewed by filing an application with the FCC. Petitions to deny license renewal applications may be filed by interested parties, including members of the public. In the last renewal cycle, the FCC granted all of the license renewal applications that were filed for our radio stations, all for full eight-year terms. The next renewal cycle begins in 2027. While we are not currently aware of any facts that would prevent future renewal of our licenses to operate our radio stations, there can be no assurance that any of our licenses will be renewed for a full term.
Service Areas
Each class of FM station has the right to broadcast with a certain amount of power from an antenna located at a certain height. The most powerful FM radio stations are Class C FM radio stations, which may operate with the equivalent of up to 100 kilowatts of effective radiated power (“ERP”) at an antenna height of up to 1,968 feet above average terrain. These radio stations typically provide service to large areas that cover one or more counties. There are also Class C0, C1, C2 and C3 FM radio stations which may operate with progressively less power and/or antenna height. Class B FM stations operate with the equivalent of up to 50 kilowatts ERP at an antenna height of up to 492 feet above average terrain. Class B radio stations typically serve large metropolitan areas and their outer suburban areas. There are also Class B1 radio stations that can operate with up to 25 kilowatts ERP at an antenna height of up to 328 feet above average terrain. Class A FM radio stations may operate with the equivalent of up to 6 kilowatts ERP at an antenna height of up to 328 feet above average terrain, and generally serve smaller cities and towns or suburbs of larger cities.
The area served by an AM radio station is determined by a combination of frequency, transmitter power, antenna orientation and soil conductivity. The effective service area of an AM radio station is determined based on the radio station’s power, operating frequency, antenna patterns and its day/night operating modes. The area served by an FM radio station is determined by a combination of transmitter power and antenna height, with radio stations divided into eight classes according to these technical parameters, as set forth above.
The following table sets forth, as of March 7, 2023, the number of our owned and operated radio stations by market, excluding booster stations, FM translator stations, and stations operated under Time Brokerage Agreements (“TBAs”).

Regulatory Approvals
The Communications Laws prohibit the assignment or transfer of control of a broadcast license without the prior approval of the FCC. In determining whether to grant an application for assignment or transfer of control of a broadcast license, the Communications Act requires the FCC to find that the assignment or transfer would serve the public interest. The FCC considers a number of factors in making this determination, including (i) compliance with various rules limiting common ownership of media properties, (ii) the financial and “character” qualifications of the assignee or transferee (including those parties holding an “attributable” interest in the assignee or transferee), (iii) compliance with the Communications Act’s foreign ownership restrictions, and (iv) compliance with other Communications Laws, including those related to content and filing requirements.
As discussed in greater detail below, the FCC may also review the effect of proposed assignments and transfers of broadcast licenses on economic competition and diversity. See “Antitrust and Market Concentration Considerations.”
Ownership Matters
The Communications Act restricts us from having more than one-fourth of our equity owned or voted by non-U.S. persons, foreign governments or non-U.S. entities, without prior approval from the FCC.
The Communications Laws also restrict the number of radio stations one person or entity may own, operate or control in a local market.
None of these rules requires any change in our current ownership of radio stations. The Communications Laws could limit the number of additional radio stations that we may acquire in the future in our existing markets as well as new markets.
The FCC generally applies its rules and its broadcast multiple ownership rules by considering the “attributable” or cognizable interests held by a person or entity. With some exceptions, a person or entity will be deemed to hold an attributable interest in a radio station if the person or entity serves as an officer, director, partner, stockholder, member, or, in certain cases, a debt holder of a company that owns that station. Whether that interest is attributable and thus subject to the FCC’s multiple ownership rules is determined by the FCC’s attribution rules. If an interest is attributable, 
the FCC treats the person or entity who holds that interest as an “owner” of the radio station in question, and that interest thus counts against the person in determining compliance with the FCC’s ownership rules.
With respect to a partnership (or limited liability company), only the interest of a general partner (or managing member) is attributable if the entity’s organizational documents include certain terms. With respect to a corporation, officers, directors and persons or entities that directly or indirectly hold 5.0% or more of the corporation’s voting stock (20.0% or more of such stock in the case of insurance companies, investment companies, bank trust departments and certain other “passive investors” that hold such stock for investment purposes only) generally are attributed with ownership of the radio stations, television stations and daily newspapers owned by the corporation. As discussed below, participation in an LMA or a Joint Sales Agreement (“JSA”) also may result in an attributable interest. See “Local Marketing and Joint Sales Agreements.”
The following interests generally are not attributable:
1.debt instruments, non-voting stock, and options and warrants for voting stock, partnership interests, or membership interests that have not yet been exercised; Non-voting equity and debt interests which, in the aggregate, constitute more than 33.0% of a radio station’s “enterprise value” (which consists of the total equity and debt capitalization) are considered attributable in certain circumstances;
2.limited partnership or limited liability company membership interests where (a) the limited partner or member is not “materially involved” in the media-related activities of the partnership or limited liability company, and (b) the limited partnership agreement or limited liability company agreement expressly “insulates” the limited partner or member from such material involvement by inclusion of provisions specified in FCC rules; and
3.holders of less than 5.0% of an entity’s voting stock. 
In April 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the FCC’s 2017 decision to eliminate certain media ownership restrictions, including the ban on common ownership of newspapers and radio stations within the same market and the radio/television cross-ownership rule. On June 4, 2021, the FCC’s Media Bureau adopted an Order implementing these rule changes, which became effective June 30, 2021. On December 22, 2022, the FCC’s Media Bureau issued a Public Notice (“Notice”) announcing its 2022 proceeding to review the broadcast ownership rules. The Notice does not propose any new rules or the elimination of any existing rules. It asks commenters whether the current rules need to be changed and to provide empirical evidence supporting such proposals. The Notice also asks for information regarding the media marketplace, including ongoing trends or developments, and how the rules impact minority and female ownership of broadcast stations. The FCC’s 2018 proceeding remains pending. In that proceeding, the Bureau sought comment on a number of matters, including the local radio ownership rule, the local television ownership rule, and the dual network rule, and several diversity proposals. The comment period in that proceeding closed in August 2021.
Content and Operation
The Communications Act requires broadcasters to serve the “public interest.” To satisfy that obligation, broadcasters are required by the Communications Laws to present content that is responsive to community problems, needs and interests and to maintain certain records demonstrating such responsiveness. Complaints from audiences concerning a radio station’s content may be filed at any time and will be considered by the FCC both at the time they are filed and in connection with a licensee’s renewal application. FCC rules also require broadcasters to provide equal employment opportunities (“EEO”) in the hiring of new personnel, to abide by certain procedures in advertising employment opportunities, to make information available on employment opportunities on their websites (if they have one), and to maintain certain records concerning their compliance with EEO rules. The FCC will entertain individual complaints concerning a broadcast licensee’s failure to abide by the EEO rules and also conducts random audits on broadcast licensees’ compliance with EEO rules. We have been the subject of several EEO audits. To date, none of those audits has disclosed any major violation that would have a material adverse effect on our operations. Radio stations also must follow provisions in the Communications Laws that regulate a variety of other activities, including political advertising, the broadcast of obscene or indecent content, sponsorship identification, the broadcast of contests and lotteries, and technical operations (including limits on radio frequency radiation). In addition, there is new proposed federal legislation that would prohibit radio and other advertising of online sports gambling businesses. If the proposed legislation were to become law, this prohibition could have an adverse impact on our business.
Local Marketing and Joint Sales Agreements
A number of radio stations, have entered into LMAs (also known as Time Brokerage Agreements) or Joint Sales Agreements (“JSAs”). In a typical LMA, the licensee of a radio station makes available, for a fee, airtime on its radio station to a party which supplies content to be broadcast during that airtime and collects revenue from advertising aired during such content. A typical JSA authorizes one radio station to sell another radio station’s advertising time and retain the revenue from the sale of that airtime. A JSA typically includes a periodic payment to the radio station whose airtime is being sold (which may include a share of the revenue being collected from the sale of airtime). LMAs and JSAs are subject to compliance with the antitrust laws and the Communications Laws, including the requirement that the licensee must maintain independent control over the radio station and, in particular, its personnel, content and finances. The FCC has held that such agreements do not violate the Communications Laws as long as the licensee of the radio station receiving content from another station or whose time is being sold by another station maintains ultimate responsibility for, and control over, radio station operations and otherwise ensures compliance with the Communications Laws.
A radio station that brokers more than 15.0% of the weekly content hours, or sells more than 15.0% of the weekly advertising time of another radio station in its market, will be considered to have an attributable ownership interest in that radio station for purposes of the FCC’s ownership rules. In that situation, a radio station may not enter into a LMA that allows it to program more than 15.0% of the weekly content hours of another radio station that it could not own under the FCC’s multiple ownership rules. In addition, a station cannot have a JSA with another station in the same market if the FCC’s ownership rules would otherwise prohibit common ownership of the radio stations.
Antitrust and Market Concentration Considerations
Potential future acquisitions, to the extent they meet specified size thresholds, will be subject to applicable waiting periods and possible review under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the “HSR Act”), by the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) or the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), either of whom can be required to evaluate a transaction to determine whether that transaction should be challenged under the federal antitrust laws. Transactions are subject to the HSR Act only if the acquisition price or fair market value of the radio stations to be acquired is above $111.4 million, effective February 27, 2023. Our acquisitions have not met this threshold. Acquisitions that are not required to be reported under the HSR Act may still be investigated by the DOJ or the FTC under the antitrust laws before or after consummation. At any time before or after the consummation of a proposed acquisition, the DOJ or the FTC could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary, including seeking to enjoin the acquisition or seeking divestiture of the business acquired or certain of our other assets. The DOJ has reviewed numerous radio station acquisitions where an operator proposes to acquire additional radio stations in its existing markets or multiple radio stations in new markets and has challenged a number of such transactions. Some of these challenges have resulted in consent decrees requiring the sale of certain radio stations, the termination of LMAs or other relief. In general, the Department of Justice has more closely scrutinized radio mergers and acquisitions resulting in local market shares in excess of 35.0% of local radio advertising revenue, depending on format, signal strength and other factors. There is no precise numerical rule, however, and certain transactions resulting in more than 35.0% revenue shares have not been challenged, while certain other transactions may be challenged based on other criteria such as audience shares in one or more demographic groups as well as the percentage of revenue share. We estimate that we have more than a 35.0% share of radio advertising revenue in many of our markets.
The DOJ enforces the antitrust laws in the broadcasting industry and there can be no assurance that one or more of any future acquisitions will not be the subject of an investigation or enforcement action by the DOJ. Similarly, there can be no assurance that the DOJ, the FTC or the FCC will not prohibit such acquisitions, require that they be restructured, or require that we divest radio stations we already own in connection with an acquisition. In addition, private parties may under certain circumstances bring legal action to challenge an acquisition.
As part of its review of certain radio station acquisitions, the DOJ has stated publicly that it believes that commencement of operations under LMAs, JSAs and other similar agreements customarily entered into in connection with radio station ownership assignments and transfers prior to the expiration of the waiting period under the HSR Act could violate the HSR Act. Accordingly, our policy is not to commence operation under an LMA, a JSA, or similar agreement of any affected radio station to be acquired until the waiting period under the HSR Act has expired or been terminated.
Formation and Form of Organization
Townsquare Media, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, was formed on February 26, 2010. In connection with our initial public offering, on July 25, 2014, Townsquare Media, LLC, converted to Townsquare Media, Inc., a Delaware corporation.
SUMMARY RISK FACTORS
The following is a summary of the principal risks that make an investment in our company speculative or risky, all of which are more fully described in the Risk Factors section below. This summary should be read in conjunction with the Risk Factors section and should not be relied upon as an exhaustive summary of the material risks facing our business.
We are subject to risks and uncertainties related to general economic conditions and our business, some of which are beyond our control, including that:
•Decreased spending by advertisers, as a result of factors such as supply chain disruption, inflation and changes in the economy have had, and may continue to have a material adverse effect on our business. 
•The lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, or the impact of any future pandemic, are uncertain and difficult to predict, but the COVID-19 pandemic had a material adverse effect on our business and revenues and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, stock price, and liquidity in the future.
•Our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected if we are unable to acquire certain broadcast rights or our broadcast rights contracts are not renewed on sufficiently favorable terms.
•Our results are impacted by political advertising revenue, which can vary from even to odd-numbered years.
•If we are unable to retain our digital audience, our business may be adversely affected.
•To remain competitive, we must respond to changes in technology, services and standards that characterize our industry.
•The failure or destruction of transmitter and other facilities that we depend upon to distribute our content could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
•We are dependent on key personnel.
•Increases in or new royalties could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
•Our substantial indebtedness could have an adverse impact on us.
•Capital requirements necessary to operate our business or consummate acquisitions could pose risks.
We also face risks and uncertainties related to our industry and competition, including that:
•Our future revenue and earnings growth may be significantly impacted by our digital lines of business, which are subject to significant competition and rapidly changing technology.
•We may lose audience ratings, market share and advertising revenue to competing radio stations or other types of media competitors.
•Our success is also dependent upon audience engagement with our content, which is difficult to predict.
Additionally, we are subject to risks related to our acquisition strategy, such as:
•Due to various market and financial conditions, we may not be able to successfully complete future acquisitions or future dispositions of our radio stations, or achieve the related benefits we anticipate.
We are also subject to risks related to our financial reporting and accounting and the risks posed by potential future asset impairment of our FCC licenses and/or goodwill.
We are also subject to risks and uncertainties related to technology that may also affect our business, including that:
•New technologies could block our digital ads, and new restrictions on third party cookies could harm our digital advertising business.
•A security breach or a cyber-attack could adversely affect our business.
•Our engagement of third-party service providers increases our exposure to security and data privacy risks.
Our business depends upon licenses issued by and is subject to the rules and regulations of the FCC and other government entities, and our business is subject to risks associated therewith, including that:
•If licenses were not renewed or we were to be out of compliance with FCC regulations and policies, our business could be materially impaired.
•The FCC has been vigorous in its enforcement of its rules and regulations, including its indecency and sponsorship identification rules, violations of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Our status as a smaller reporting company may subject us and our stockholders to certain risks.
