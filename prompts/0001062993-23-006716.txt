 As used in this annual report, the terms "we", "us", "our company", "Wolverine", mean Wolverine Resources Corp., a Nevada corporation, unless otherwise indicated.
 Corporate History
 Our company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on February 23, 2006 and is quoted on the OTC Pink under the symbol WOLV.
 Since we began operations in 2006, the Company has been focused primarily on the exploration for and development of base and precious metal properties located in North America. The Company has two mineral properties located in Labrador, Canada, the Frog Property and the Cache River Property.
 On February 28, 2022, the Company entered into an agreement ("Agreement") with 86835 Newfoundland & Labrador Corp. ("86835"), a non-arm's length party, to acquire a 40% interest in the Frog Property (the "Property") located in Labrador, Canada. Under the terms of the Agreement the Company issued 28,500,000 common shares at a deemed price of $0.04 per share for a purchase price of $1,140,000. The deemed issue price of the acquisition was determined based on an equivalent price per share for a concurrent financing. For accounting purposes, the acquisition had a fair value $2,850,000 and a fair value of $0.10 per share based upon the closing market price of Wolverine on February 28, 2022.
 86835 is an Innu owned and operated private mineral exploration company which owns mineral properties in both Newfoundland and Labrador. Bruce Costerd and Luke Rich are officers, directors and shareholders of 86835 and Wolverine.
 On August 9, 2022, Wolverine entered into an Amended Purchase Agreement with 86835 Newfoundland & Labrador Corp. ("86835") relating to the acquisition of a 40% interest in the Frog Property located in Labrador, Canada. Under the terms of the Amended Purchase Agreement the number of shares issued pursuant to the acquisition was reduced from 28,500,000 common shares to 27,500,000 common shares and the number of claims was reduced from 315 claims to 262 claims.
 The Company also holds a 90% interest in the Cache River Property located in Labrador, Canada consisting of a total of 53 mineral claims and an area of 1320 hectares (3,262 acres). The Company is not currently conducting any exploration on the Cache River Property.

We have not yet determined whether the Frog Property or the Cache River Property contain mineral reserves that are economically recoverable.
 Our Current Business
 We are an exploration stage mining company engaged in the identification, acquisition, and exploration of metals and minerals with a focus on base and precious metals. Our current operational focus is to raise sufficient funds to continue exploration activities on our properties in Labrador, Canada, known as the Frog Property and the Cache River Property. We intend to conduct further exploration activities on the properties in 2022. We expect to review other potential exploration projects from time to time as they are presented to us.
 Our business is conducted by independent contractors all of which are officers and/or directors of the Company. As of May 31, 2022, the company had one full-time consultant, Bruce Costerd, the CEO and a director of the Company. The Company also has two consultants engaged on a non-exclusive, part time basis, Richard Haderer, the CFO and a director of the Company and Luke Rich, a director of the Company. Our business plan does not anticipate that we will hire a large number of employees or that we will require extensive office space. We have to date, and plan to continue to acquire most of the industry and geological expertise we require through third party contractual relationships with other companies, which will act as operators of our various interests. Although this exposes us to certain risks on behalf of those operators, it also allows us to participate in the often, unique experience and knowledge that local persons have related to certain properties.
 The Company's objective for the next twelve months on the Frog Property is that additional magnetics be completed expanding on the current grid to the north and south of anomalous readings encountered in 2022. This will be completed in fall 2022 , at which time prospecting should be completed expanding the 2021 range of coverage focusing on the large magnetic anomaly in the area as it extends beyond the valley bottom to the steep valley ridges where it is more likely to encounter outcroppings.
 We have suffered recurring losses from operations and anticipate generating losses for the foreseeable future. The continuation of our business is dependent upon obtaining further financing, completing a successful program of exploration and/or development, and, finally, achieving a profitable level of operations. The issuance of additional equity securities by us could result in a significant dilution in the equity interests of our current stockholders. Obtaining commercial loans, assuming those loans would be available, will increase our liabilities and future cash commitments.
 There are no assurances that we will be able to obtain further funds required for our continued operations. As noted herein, we are pursuing various financing alternatives to meet our immediate and long-term financial requirements. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us when needed or, if available, that it can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. If we are not able to obtain the additional financing on a timely basis, we will be unable to conduct our operations as planned, and we will not be able to meet our other obligations as they become due. In such event, we will be forced to scale down or perhaps even cease our operations.

Table 1: List of Mineral Licences
 Exploration Permits
 Exploration at the Frog property has been under Exploration Permit E220041.  This will expire shortly and a new application will need to be completed for 2023 exploration activities.  These will likely include exploration, fuel cache, and water permits. The extreme northern portion of the Property is located within the Labrador Inuit Settlement agreement area.  All exploration in Labrador requires approval from the Innu Nation as part of the permitting process.
 Mineralization
To date, no economic mineralization has been discovered on the Property. Several float samples taken on the Property were found to contain weak base metal mineralization up to 889 ppm copper and 171 ppm nickel. A sample, suspected to contain rare earth elements was sent for analyses and results are pending.
Exploration History
 In the fall of 2021, 86835 completed an initial exploration program on the Property consisting of prospecting, rock geochemistry, and ground magnetics.
 In February and March of 2022, the Company completed a ground magnetometer survey on the Property. A total of 28.5 line-km of surveying was completed on 30 - 100 m spaced lines encompassing an area of 350 ha. The survey was completed by indigenous workers employed by 86835 using an Overhauser GEM GSM-19 Magnetometer. The survey expanded on a preliminary survey completed late in 2021.

Although several small anomalous bodies were delineated in the eastern portion of the grid, a strongly magnetic body was outlined extending 1.4 km through the western portion of the grid and is open to the north and south. This magnetic feature is 180 to 360 m wide and shows a sharp contrast of up to 20,000 nT between the anomaly and country rock.
 Follow-up exploration, due to commence in summer/fall 2022, will target this area for prospecting and geochemistry. Additional ground magnetics will target the north and south extensions of the current magnetic anomaly.
 Recommendations
 The Property is currently at an early stage of exploration. Although rock samples anomalous in base metals have been discovered on surface, no source of the anomalous samples is currently evident. Magnetics on the Property have delineated several anomalous areas to date, the most prominent of which is in the western portion of the grid extending over a 1.4 km strike length and open to the north and south.
 It is recommended that additional magnetics be completed expanding on the current grid to the north and south of anomalous readings encountered in 2022. This can be completed after Spring thaw, at which time prospecting should be completed expanding the 2021 range of coverage focusing on the large magnetic anomaly in the area as it extends beyond the valley bottom to the steep valley ridges where it is more likely to encounter outcroppings.
 It is estimated that the next phase of exploration would cost $152,000, as itemized in Table 4.
 
Program | Description | | Cost 
-----------------+------------------------+---+--------
Ground Magnetics | 50 line-km | $ | 75,000 
Prospecting | 7 people x 14 days | $ | 24,500 
Mob/demob | Helicopter/Float Plane | $ | 25,000 
Analytical | 100 samples | $ | 5,000 
Camp | | $ | 9,000 
Contingencies | ~ 10% | $ | 13,500 
Total | | $ | 152,000
