ITEM 1. BUSINESS
The Company
JBG SMITH Properties ("JBG SMITH") is a real estate investment trust ("REIT") that owns, operates, invests in and develops real estate assets concentrated in leading urban infill submarkets in and around Washington, D.C. We own and operate a portfolio of high-quality commercial and multifamily assets, many of which are amenitized with ancillary retail. In addition, our third-party asset management and real estate services business provides fee-based real estate services to third parties and the legacy funds formerly organized by The JBG Companies ("JBG Legacy Funds"). References to "our share" refer to our ownership percentage of consolidated and unconsolidated assets in real estate ventures.
As of December 31, 2018, our Operating Portfolio consists of 62 operating assets comprising 46 commercial assets totaling approximately 12.9 million square feet (11.3 million square feet at our share) and 16 multifamily assets totaling 6,315 units (4,531 units at our share). Additionally, we have (i) nine assets under construction comprising five commercial assets totaling approximately 1.2 million square feet (927,000 square feet at our share) and four multifamily assets totaling 1,476 units (1,298 units at our share); and (ii) 41 future development assets totaling approximately 23.1 million square feet (19.6 million square feet at our share) of estimated potential development density. We present combined portfolio operating data that aggregates assets that we consolidate in our financial statements and assets in which we own an interest, but do not consolidate in our financial results. For more information regarding our assets, see Item 2 "Properties".
We define "square feet" or "SF" as the amount of rentable square feet of a property that can be rented to tenants, defined as (i) for commercial assets, rentable square footage defined in the current lease and for vacant space the rentable square footage defined in the previous lease for that space, (ii) for multifamily assets, management’s estimate of approximate rentable square feet, (iii) for assets under construction and near-term development assets, management’s estimate of approximate rentable square feet based on current design plans as of December 31, 2018, or (iv) for future development assets, management’s estimate of developable gross square feet based on its current business plans with respect to real estate owned or controlled as of December 31, 2018. "Metro" is the public transportation network serving the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area operated by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, and we consider "Metro-served" to be locations, submarkets or assets that are generally nearby and within walking distance of a Metro station, defined as being within 0.5 miles of an existing or planned Metro station.
Corporate Structure and Formation Transaction
JBG SMITH was organized by Vornado Realty Trust ("Vornado" or "former parent") as a Maryland REIT on October 27, 2016 for the purpose of receiving, via the spin-off on July 17, 2017 (the "Separation"), substantially all of the assets and liabilities of Vornado’s Washington, D.C. segment, which operated as Vornado / Charles E. Smith, (the "Vornado Included Assets"). On July 18, 2017, JBG SMITH acquired the management business and certain assets and liabilities (the "JBG Assets") of The JBG Companies ("JBG") (the "Combination"). The Separation and the Combination are collectively referred to as the "Formation Transaction." Unless the context otherwise requires, all references to "we," "us," and "our," refer to the Vornado Included Assets (our predecessor and accounting acquirer) for periods prior to the Separation and to JBG SMITH for periods after the Separation. Substantially all of our assets are held by, and our operations are conducted through, JBG SMITH Properties LP ("JBG SMITH LP"), our operating partnership.
Our Strategy
Our mission is to own and operate a high-quality portfolio of Metro-served, urban-infill office, multifamily and retail assets concentrated in downtown Washington, D.C., our nation’s capital, and other leading urban infill submarkets with proximity to downtown Washington, D.C. and to grow this portfolio through value-added development and acquisitions. We have significant expertise in office, multifamily and retail product types, our core asset classes. We believe we are known for our creative deal-making and capital allocation skills and for our development and value creation expertise across our core product types.
One of our approaches to value creation uses a series of complementary disciplines through a process we call "Placemaking." Placemaking involves strategically mixing high-quality multifamily and commercial buildings with anchor, specialty and neighborhood retail in a high density, thoughtfully planned and designed public space. Through this process, we create synergies, and thus value, across those varied uses and create unique, amenity-rich, walkable neighborhoods that are desirable and enhance significant tenant and investor demand. We believe that our Placemaking approach will increase occupancy and rental rates in our portfolio, particularly with respect to our concentrated and extensive land and building holdings in National Landing. National Landing is the newly defined interconnected and walkable neighborhood that encompasses Crystal City, the eastern portion of Pentagon City and the northern portion of Potomac Yard. It is situated across the Potomac River from Washington, D.C. and we 
3

believe it is one of the region’s best-located urban mixed-use communities. It is defined by its central and easily accessible location, its adjacency to Reagan National Airport, and its base of existing offices, apartments and hotels. 
Since mid-2017, we have been focused on a comprehensive plan to reposition our holdings in National Landing through a broad array of Placemaking strategies. Our Placemaking strategies include the delivery of new multifamily and office developments, locally sourced amenity retail and thoughtful improvements to the streetscape, sidewalks, parks and other outdoor gathering spaces. In keeping with our dedication to Placemaking, each new project is intended to contribute to authentic and distinct neighborhoods by creating a vibrant street environment with a robust offering of amenity retail and improved public spaces.
On November 13, 2018, Amazon.com, Inc. (“Amazon”) announced publicly the selection of sites that we own in National Landing as the location of an additional headquarters (“Amazon HQ2”), subject to negotiation and execution of definitive documentation between Amazon and JBG SMITH, and subject to the approval of tax incentives by the Commonwealth of Virginia and Arlington County. Earlier this month, the Commonwealth of Virginia enacted an incentives bill, which provides tax incentives to Amazon as it creates up to 37,850 full-time jobs with average salaries of $150,000 or higher in National Landing. As part of the incentive package, we expect $1.8 billion in infrastructure and education investments led by state and local governments.

Approximately 43% of the square feet of our total holdings is located within a ½ mile of Amazon HQ2, including 6.9 million square feet in our future development pipeline (in addition to the approximately 4.1 million square feet that we expect to develop on behalf of Amazon). We anticipate that we will enter into agreements with Amazon pursuant to which Amazon will engage us as its development manager, property manager, and retail leasing agent for Amazon HQ2. In addition, we granted Amazon the exclusive right for a limited time to lease approximately 500,000 square feet of existing office space at 241 18th Street S., 1800 South Bell Street and 1770 Crystal Drive, and the right to acquire the Pen Place and Met 6, 7 and 8 land in our future development pipeline with estimated potential development density of up to approximately 4.1 million square feet.
Our primary business objectives are to maximize cash flow and generate strong risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders. We intend to pursue these objectives through the following strategies:
Focus on High-Quality Mixed-Use Assets in Metro-Served Submarkets in the Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Area. We intend to continue our longstanding strategy of owning and operating assets within urban-infill, Metro-served submarkets in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area with high barriers to entry and key urban amenities, including being within walking distance of the Metro. These submarkets, which include the District of Columbia; National Landing, the Rosslyn-Ballston Corridor, Reston and Alexandria in Virginia; and Bethesda, Silver Spring and the Rockville Pike Corridor in Maryland, generally feature strong economic and demographic attributes, as well as superior transportation infrastructure that caters to the preferences of our office, multifamily and retail tenants. We believe these positive attributes will allow our assets located in these submarkets to outperform the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area as a whole.
Realize Contractual Embedded Growth. We believe there are substantial near-term growth opportunities embedded in our existing Operating Portfolio, many of which are contractual in nature, including the burn-off of free rent, contractual rent escalators in our non-GSA office and retail leases based on increases in CPI or a fixed percentage, and the commencement of signed but not yet commenced leases. "GSA" refers to the General Services Administration, which is the independent federal government agency that manages real estate procurement for the federal government and federal agencies.
Drive Incremental Growth Through Lease-up of Our Assets. We believe that we are well-positioned to achieve significant internal growth through lease-up of the vacant space in our Operating Portfolio, including certain recently developed assets, given our leasing capabilities and the tenant demand for high-quality space in our submarkets. As of December 31, 2018, we had 46 operating commercial assets totaling approximately 12.9 million square feet (11.3 million square feet at our share), which were 89.6% leased at our share, resulting in approximately 1.2 million square feet available for lease.
Deliver Our Assets Under Construction. As of December 31, 2018, we had nine high-quality assets under construction in which we expect to make an estimated incremental investment of $519.4 million at our share. Our assets under construction consist of five commercial assets totaling approximately 1.2 million square feet (927,000 square feet at our share) and four multifamily assets totaling 1,476 units (1,298 units at our share), all of which are Metro-served. We believe these projects provide significant potential for value creation. As of December 31, 2018, 53.5% (49.5% at our share) of our commercial assets under construction were pre-leased. Amazon is expected to lease 258,299 SF at 1770 Crystal Drive. With this expected lease with Amazon, the asset would be 97.8% pre-leased, and the pre-leased status of our total under construction portfolio would be 75.8% (77.4% at our share). We define "estimated incremental investment" to mean management’s estimate of the remaining cost to be incurred in connection with the development of an asset as of December 31, 2018, including all remaining acquisition costs, hard costs, soft costs, tenant improvements (excluding free rent converted to tenant improvement allowances), leasing costs and other similar costs to develop and stabilize the asset but excluding any financing costs, ground rent expenses and capitalized payroll costs.

Develop Our Significant Future Development Pipeline. We have a significant pipeline of opportunities for value creation through ground-up development, with the goal of producing favorable risk-adjusted returns on invested capital. We expect to be active in developing these opportunities while maintaining prudent leverage levels. Our future development pipeline consists of 41 assets. We estimate our future development pipeline can support over 23.1 million square feet (19.6 million square feet at our share) of estimated potential development density, with 96.8% of this potential development density being Metro-served based on our share of estimated potential development density. The estimated potential development densities and uses reflect our current business plans as of December 31, 2018 and are subject to change based on market conditions. We characterize our future development pipeline as our assets that are development opportunities on which we do not intend to commence construction within 18 months of December 31, 2018 where we (i) own land or control the land through a ground lease or (ii) are under a long-term conditional contract to purchase or enter into a leasehold interest with respect to land.
Our future development pipeline includes six parcels attached to assets in our Operating Portfolio that would require a redevelopment of approximately 349,000 office and/or retail square feet (251,000 square feet at our share) and 324 multifamily units (185 units at our share), which generated $4.9 million of annualized net operating income ("NOI") for the year ended December 31, 2018, in order to access approximately 3.8 million square feet (2.6 million square feet at our share) of total estimated potential development density.
Redevelop and Reposition Our Assets. We evaluate our portfolio on an ongoing basis to identify value-creating redevelopment and renovation opportunities, including the addition of amenities, unit renovations and building and landscaping enhancements. We intend to seek to increase occupancy and rents, improve tenant quality and enhance cash flow and value by completing the redevelopment and repositioning of certain of our assets, including the use of our Placemaking process. This approach is facilitated by our extensive proprietary research platform and deep understanding of submarket dynamics. We believe there will be significant opportunities to apply our Placemaking process across our portfolio.
Rigorous Approach to Capital Allocation. An important component of our focus on maximizing long-term net asset value ("NAV") per share, is prudent capital allocation. We evaluate development, acquisition and disposition decisions based on how they impact long-term NAV per share. Because distinct segments of our market present substantial downside risk while others offer attractive upside, our pursuit of long-term NAV growth takes many forms, some of which sit on opposite ends of the risk-taking spectrum. Where we see elevated asset pricing, potential excess supply, and limited prospects for future growth, we will likely sell assets. Given the attractive pricing of office assets and our long-term objective of shifting our portfolio towards a 50:50 mix of office and multifamily, we are currently targeting primarily office assets in submarkets where we have less concentration and where we anticipate lower growth rates going forward relative to other opportunities within our portfolio. We are also focused on opportunities to turn land assets into income streams or retained capital. 
The acquisitions market in the Washington, D.C. area continues to be competitive, and we remain cautious. We expect near-term acquisition activity to be focused on assets with redevelopment potential in emerging growth neighborhoods, as well as assets adjacent to our existing holdings where the combination of sites can add unique value to any new investment. Where there are opportunities to trade out of higher risk assets with extensive capital needs or those outside of our geographic footprint, we will consider Section 1031 exchanges under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). 
Third-Party Services Business
Our third-party asset management and real estate services platform provides fee-based real estate services to third parties, the JBG Legacy Funds and the Washington Housing Initiative ("WHI"), which intends to pursue a transformational approach to producing affordable workforce housing and creating sustainable, mixed-income communities in the Washington D.C. region. Although a significant portion of the assets and interests in assets formerly owned by certain of the JBG Legacy Funds were contributed to us in the Combination, the JBG Legacy Funds retained certain assets that are not consistent with our long-term business strategy, which were generally categorized as (i) condominium and townhome assets, (ii) hotels, (iii) assets that were likely to be sold by the JBG Legacy Funds in the near term as of the time of the Combination, (iv) assets located outside of our core markets or that are not Metro-served, (v) noncontrolling real estate venture interests and (vi) single-tenant leased GSA assets that are encumbered with long-term, hyper-amortizing bond financing that is not consistent with our financing strategy. With respect to the JBG Legacy Funds and for most assets that we hold through real estate ventures, we will continue to provide the same asset management, property management, construction management, leasing and other services that were provided prior to the Combination by the management business that we acquired in the Combination. Other than the WHI, we do not intend to raise any future investment funds, and the JBG Legacy Funds will be managed and liquidated over time. We expect to continue to earn fees from these funds as they are wound down, as well as from any real estate venture arrangements currently in place and any new real estate venture and/or development arrangements entered into in the future, including with Amazon. Certain individual members of our management team own direct equity co-investment and promote interests in the JBG Legacy Funds that were not contributed to us. As the JBG Legacy Funds are wound down over time, these economic interests will decrease and be eventually eliminated.
5

We believe that the fees we earn in connection with providing these services will enhance our overall returns, provide additional scale and efficiency in our operating, development and acquisition businesses and generate capital which we can use to absorb overhead and other administrative costs of the platform. This scale provides competitive advantages, including market knowledge, buying power and operating efficiencies across all product types. We also believe that our existing relationships arising out of our third-party asset management and real estate services business will continue to provide potential capital and new investment opportunities. 
Competition
The commercial real estate markets in which we operate are highly competitive. We compete with numerous acquirers, developers, owners and operators of commercial real estate including other REITs, private real estate funds, domestic and foreign financial institutions, life insurance companies, pension trusts, partnerships and individual investors, many of which own or may seek to acquire or develop assets similar to ours in the same markets in which our assets are located. These competitors may have greater financial resources or access to capital than we do or be willing to acquire assets in transactions which are more highly leveraged or are less attractive from a financial viewpoint than we are willing to pursue. Leasing is a major component of our business and is highly competitive. The principal means of competition in leasing are lease terms (including rent charged and tenant improvement allowances), location, services provided and the nature and condition of the asset to be leased. If our competitors offer space at rental rates below current market rates, below the rental rates we currently charge our tenants, in better locations within our markets, in higher quality assets or offer better services, we may lose potential tenants and we may be pressured to reduce our rental rates below those we currently charge to retain tenants when our tenants’ leases expire.
Seasonality
Our revenues and expenses are, to some extent, subject to seasonality during the year, which impacts quarterly net earnings, cash flows and funds from operations that affects the sequential comparison of our results in individual quarters over time. We have historically experienced higher utility costs in the first and third quarters of the year. 
Segment Data
We operate in the following business segments: commercial, multifamily and third-party asset management and real estate services. Financial information related to these business segments for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018 is set forth in Note 18 to our consolidated and combined financial statements included herein.
Tax Status
We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856-860 of the Code. Under those sections, a REIT which distributes at least 90% of its REIT taxable income as dividends to its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions will not be taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders. Prior to the Separation, Vornado operated as a REIT and distributed 100% of its REIT taxable income to its shareholders; accordingly, no provision for federal income taxes has been made in the accompanying financial statements for the periods prior to the Separation. We currently adhere and intend to continue to adhere to these requirements and to maintain our REIT status in future periods.
As a REIT, we can reduce our taxable income by distributing all or a portion of such taxable income to shareholders. Future distributions will be declared and paid at the discretion of our Board of Trustees and will depend upon cash generated by operating activities, our financial condition, capital requirements, annual dividend requirements under the REIT provisions of the Code and such other factors as our Board of Trustees deems relevant.
We also participate in the activities conducted by our subsidiary entities that have elected to be treated as taxable REIT subsidiaries ("TRS") under the Code. As such, we are subject to federal, state, and local taxes on the income from these activities. Income taxes attributable to our TRSs are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Under the asset and liability method, deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements, which will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future.
Significant Tenants
Only the U.S. federal government accounted for 10% or more of our rental revenue, which consists of property rentals and tenant reimbursements, as follows:

Sustainable Business Strategy
Our business model prioritizes long-term growth. By investing in urban infill and transit-oriented development and strategically mixing high-quality multifamily and commercial buildings with public areas, retail spaces, and walkable streets, we are working to define neighborhoods that deliver benefits to the environment and our community, as well as long-term value to our shareholders.
We remain committed to transparency in our strategy and performance with a focus on operating efficiency, responding to evolving environmental and social trends, and delivering on the needs of our tenants and communities. This year we demonstrated this by: 

• | Achieving a 4-star rating in the Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark (GRESB) Real Estate Assessment, ranking second in our peer group and in the top 10 of all North American REITs


• | Adding oversight of environmental and social matters to the Board of Trustees' Corporate Governance & Nominating Committee’s charter

Our sustainability team works directly with individual departments to integrate our environmental sustainability, social responsibility and corporate governance ("ESG") principles throughout our operations and investment process. The sustainability team includes our Director of Sustainability and a Sustainability Analyst. The team is responsible for annual ESG reporting, maintaining building certifications and coordinating with industry and community partners.
To ensure that our ESG principles are fully integrated into our business practices, Steering Committees, including members of our management team, provide top-down support for the implementation of ESG initiatives. The ESG team provides our Board of Trustees Corporate Governance & Nominating Committee with periodic updates on ESG strategy.
Environmental 
We believe that the efficient use of resources will result in sustainable long-term growth. Our portfolio of LEED and ENERGY STAR certified properties demonstrates our commitment to sustainable design and performance. As of December 31, 2018:

• | 74% of all operating assets, based on square footage, have earned at least one green certification:


◦ | 6.6 million square feet of LEED Certified Commercial Space (59%)


◦ | 1.4 million square feet of LEED Certified Multifamily Space (36%)


◦ | 7.4 million square feet of ENERGY STAR Certified Commercial Space (65%)


◦ | 1.9 million square feet of ENERGY STAR Certified Multi-family Space (48%)

We have committed to improve the energy efficiency of our commercial operating portfolio by at least 20% over the next 10 years through the Department of Energy Better Buildings Challenge. Our 2017 data demonstrate improved energy performance by an average of 3.4% each year since 2014, which is consistent with a cumulative improvement of 10%, and is on track to meet or exceed the improvement goal by 2024.
We were named a 2018 Green Lease Leader by the Institute for Market Transformation (IMT) and the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Better Buildings Alliance. Green Lease Leaders recognizes companies who utilize the leasing process to achieve better collaboration between landlords and tenants with the goal of reducing building energy consumption and operating costs. Our standard lease contains a cost recovery clause for resource efficiency-related capital improvements and requires tenants to provide data for measuring, managing, and reporting sustainability performance.
We take climate change, and the risks associated with climate change seriously, and we are committed to aligning our investment strategy with science. We stand with our communities, tenants, and fellow shareholders in supporting meaningful solutions that address this global challenge. To develop a more informed view of future climate conditions and further our understanding of the direct physical risks to our properties, we are conducting a climate risk assessment, which will include operating assets and land holdings in our future development pipeline. The results of this assessment will be presented to senior management, and we expect it will inform our investment strategy moving forward.

Social Responsibility
We believe the strength of our entire community is central to sustaining the long-term value of our portfolio. We are committed to the economic development of the Washington region through continued investment in our projects and local communities. We recognize, however that new development also fosters challenging growth dynamics, with issues of social equity at the forefront. We strive to work alongside community members, leaders, and local and federal governments to appropriately respond to these challenges. The most recent example of our commitment is the WHI, which we launched in partnership with the Federal City Council. We have initially committed to make up to a $10.0 million investment in WHI projects and added an Executive Vice President of Social Impact Investing to help manage these activities.
The WHI is a transformational market-driven approach to producing affordable workforce housing and creating sustainable, mixed-income communities. The WHI intends to bring together capital from private and philanthropic sources to preserve or build affordable housing in mixed-income communities. The initiatives’ goals include:

• | Preserving or building between 2,000 and 3,000 units of affordable workforce housing in the Washington D.C. region over the next decade; and


• | Delivering triple bottom line results consisting of environmental and social objectives in addition to financial returns.

We recognize that diversity in our workforce brings valuable perspectives, views and ideas to our organization. We pride ourselves on our strong, collaborative culture, and we strive to create an inclusive and healthy work environment for our employees, which allows us to continue to attract innovative thinkers to our organization. Our workforce comprises 38% females and 52% minorities, and our senior leadership has 33% female representation. Our Board of Trustees comprises 17% females. Our Board of Trustees has made a long‑term commitment to evolve in a direction that reflects the strength and diversity of our national labor force and establish an equal balance between men and women and one that reflects the diversity of our country.

Environmental Matters
Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, an owner of real estate is liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances on such real estate. These laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. The costs of remediation or removal of such substances may be substantial and the presence of such substances, or the failure to promptly remediate such substances, may adversely affect the owner’s ability to sell such real estate or to borrow using such real estate as collateral. In connection with the ownership and operation of our assets, we may be potentially liable for such costs. The operations of current and former tenants at our assets have involved, or may have involved, the use of hazardous materials or generated hazardous wastes. The release of such hazardous materials and wastes could result in us incurring liabilities to remediate any resulting contamination. The presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination at our properties may (1) expose us to third-party liability (e.g., for cleanup costs, natural resource damages, bodily injury or property damage), (2) subject our properties to liens in favor of the government for damages and costs the government incurs in connection with the contamination, (3) impose restrictions on the manner in which a property may be used or businesses may be operated, or (4) materially adversely affect our ability to sell, lease or develop the real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral. In addition, our assets are exposed to the risk of contamination originating from other sources. While a property owner may not be responsible for remediating contamination that has migrated onsite from an identifiable and viable offsite source, the contaminant’s presence can have adverse effects on operations and the redevelopment of our assets. To the extent we send contaminated materials to other locations for treatment or disposal, we may be liable for cleanup of those sites if they become contaminated.
Most of our assets have been subject, at some point, to environmental assessments that are intended to evaluate the environmental condition of the subject and surrounding assets. These environmental assessments generally have included a historical review, a public records review, a visual inspection of the site and surrounding assets, visual or historical evidence of underground storage tanks, and the preparation and issuance of a written report. Soil and/or groundwater subsurface testing is conducted at our assets, when necessary, to further investigate any issues raised by the initial assessment that could reasonably be expected to pose a material concern to the property or result in us incurring material environmental liabilities as a result of redevelopment. They may not, however, have included extensive sampling or subsurface investigations. In each case where the environmental assessments have identified conditions requiring remedial actions required by law, we have initiated appropriate actions. The environmental assessments did not reveal any material environmental contamination that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our overall business, financial condition or results of operations, or that have not been anticipated and remediated during site redevelopment as required by law. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that the identification of new areas of contamination, changes in the extent or known scope of contamination, the discovery of additional sites or changes in cleanup requirements would 
8

not result in significant cost to us.
