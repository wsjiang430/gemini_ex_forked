About Skye Bioscience, Inc.
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on March 16, 2011. We are a clinical stage pharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of a novel class of cannabinoid derivatives to modulate the endocannabinoid system, which has been shown to play a vital role in overall human health and, notably, in multiple ocular indications. We are developing novel cannabinoid derivatives through our own directed research efforts and multiple license agreements. We have retained Novotech as our contract research organization ("CRO") in Australia and commenced our Phase 1 trial in December 2022. We have also filed our IND for SBI-100 OE in the United States in anticipation of the start of our Phase 2 clinical trial in 2023, which we expect to commence in mid 2023.
Effective January 19, 2021, we changed our name from Emerald Bioscience, Inc. to Skye Bioscience, Inc. Our common stock is quoted on the OTCQB, under the symbol "SKYE". Previously, it traded under the symbol EMBI.
In August 2019, we formed a new subsidiary in Australia, SKYE Bioscience Australia, in order to qualify for the Australian government’s research and development tax credit for research and development dollars spent in Australia. The primary purpose of SKYE Bioscience Australia is to conduct clinical trials for our drug product candidates. SKYE Bioscience Australia is currently conducting our Phase 1 clinical study in Australia. We expect to report final data from this study in the fourth quarter of 2023.
As described in more detail in the section below titled “Liquidity and Going Concern”, without additional funding during the second quarter of 2023, management believes that the Company will not have enough funds to meet its obligations and continue pre-clinical and clinical studies beyond the one year date the consolidated financial statements are issued. If we do not receive additional funding during of the second quarter of 2023, we likely cannot continue operations. 
EHT Acquisition
On May 11, 2022, we entered into an Arrangement Agreement (as amended, the “Arrangement Agreement”) with EHT, pursuant to which we agreed to acquire all of the issued and outstanding common shares of EHT pursuant to a plan of arrangement under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) (the “Acquisition”). The Acquisition was consummated on November 10, 2022. Under the terms of the Arrangement Agreement and the Plan of Arrangement, on November 10, 2022, each share of EHT common stock (“EHT Shares”) outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Acquisition (the “Effective Time”) was transferred to the Company in exchange for 1.95 shares (the “Exchange Ratio”) of Company common stock. The cash and assets of EHT and its subsidiaries acquired in the Acquisition are being used to fund our Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials. EHT and its subsidiaries are currently in the final stages of its realization process to wind down all prior operations and liquidate substantially all of its remaining assets. 
As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10K, we have divested both of EHT's former operating subsidiaries, VDL and Emerald Health Therapeutics Canada, Inc., and are in the process of resolving EHT's legacy tax matters with the Canadian tax authorities. In February 2023, the closing payment from the sale of VDL provided the Company with $5,547,000. This Acquisition has been a pivotal financing event for our business, allowing us to extend our cash runway into the second quarter of 2023 and will provide us with future funding as we collect the remaining receivables. In addition, EHT has a vacant lab facility which we are currently evaluating to determine whether it is practical to bring certain aspects of our research and development activities in house or to divest to generate additional corporate funding.

Our Product Candidates and Significant Contracts. 
UM 5050 and UM 8930 License Agreements
We have license agreements with University of Mississippi ("UM") for UM 5050 and UM 8930 for "all fields of use" (each, a "License Agreement" and, collectively, the “License Agreements”). Pursuant to the License Agreements, UM granted us an exclusive license including, with the prior written consent of UM, the right to sublicense the intellectual property related to UM 5050 (referred to by Skye as SBI-100) and UM 8930 (referred to by Skye as SBI-200) for all fields of use. All fields of use means no restrictions on use of the underlying inventions, including developing UM 5050 and UM 8930 to treat any disease through any form of delivery under the License Agreements.
The exclusive license for our lead molecule, SBI-100, a cannabinoid receptor type 1 ("CBR1") agonist, under the License Agreement for UM 5050 is expected to allow us to explore related uses for the active moiety of SBI-100. Independent in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated the potential use of SBI-100 in a variety of potential indications based on the ability of CBR1 agonists to act as an anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic and/or inhibitor of neovascularization. The Company has generated data related to these effects using an ex vivo human tissue model of the eye. While earlier third party research validated the utility of a cannabinoid to provide therapeutic utility against diseases such as glaucoma, available methods of administration were burdened with their own side effects and limitations. Notably, it is difficult to topically deliver a natural cannabinoid molecule into the eye due to its lipophilic nature. SBI-100 is a natural cannabinoid that has been chemically modified to reduce the lipophilic nature of the original molecule and enhance the ability to administer the molecule on and through the eye. It is designed such that after it is introduced into the body, enzymes convert it back to its original active ingredient and enable its beneficial mechanisms of action to be unlocked. The Company's development team is also considering various routes of administration for SBI-100 into the body for different potential disease applications.
The exclusive license of SBI-200, a novel cannabinoid receptor ("CBR") modulator, under the License Agreement for UM 8930, allows us to explore uses in ophthalmic disorders as well as expanded research and development into organ systems outside of ophthalmology. Potential therapeutic areas beyond ophthalmic indications for SBI-200 may include the central nervous system, gastrointestinal tract, endocrine/metabolic system, reproductive system, or as yet unrecognized opportunities. We have developed strategic collaborations to identify and advance these applications.
SBI-100 OE
Our lead product, SBI-100 OE, is initially being developed to treat glaucoma and ocular hypertension. SBI-100 OE is comprised of the molecule licensed from UM, SBI-100, plus a proprietary nanoemulsion formulation. The first-in-human Phase 1 trial of SBI-100 OE is currently being conducted in healthy volunteers in Australia to evaluate this drug candidate's safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. We are eligible under the AusIndustry research and development tax incentive program to obtain a cash incentive from the Australian Taxation Office. The tax incentive is available to us based on specific criteria with which we must comply and is based on our eligible research and development spend in Australia. The Company is currently eligible for a 48.5% refundable tax offset as long as it has aggregate turnover of less than $20 million per annum. 
SBI-100 OE targets the CB1 receptor, which plays a key role in managing intraocular pressure associated with glaucoma. Glaucoma is an ocular neuropathy associated with the initiation of programmed cell death, known as apoptosis, of retinal ganglion cells ("RGCs") of the optic nerve, resulting in progressive and irreversible loss of vision. Intraocular pressure ("IOP") has been identified as an important risk factor in the pathogenesis of this disease. Elevated IOP can lead to damage of RGC axons through vascular ischemia, by compromising blood flow to the cells, and physical crush injury as the elevated ocular pressure compresses these delicate cells. Cannabinoid receptors are highly concentrated in the eye, especially in the anterior compartment that helps regulate IOP, and the posterior compartment in the area of the retina and optic nerve. Stimulation of CBR1 has been previously shown to lower IOP in both animal and human studies.
In 2019, UM completed experiments showing that SBI-100 was statistically superior in lowering IOP compared to the prostaglandin-based therapy latanoprost, the current standard-of-care for treating glaucoma. Statistical significance was reached across multiple time points during a seven-day course of dosing using a validated rabbit normotensive ocular model and SBI-100 exerted pharmacologic activity consistent with once-daily to twice-daily dosing. Skye has since completed the development of a proprietary nanoemulsion formulation to optimize the amount of SBI-100 that can be delivered to the eye in a single drop while also improving the duration of activity. Importantly, this formulation can be sterilized by filtration without impacting the attributes of SBI-100. This final formulation of the API, known as SBI-100 Ophthalmic Emulsion, significantly reduced IOP compared to other commercially available ophthalmic solutions and is now being evaluated in clinical trials.

We evaluated the mechanism of action and IOP-lowering ability of the active moiety of SBI-100 when administered into an ex vivo model of a 3D-human trabecular meshwork using both healthy and glaucomatous-induced tissues. The trabecular meshwork plays a key role in removing a vital functional liquid in the eye, called aqueous humor, in order to maintain a healthy balance of pressure in the eye (an imbalance can lead to a detrimental increase in IOP). This study validated the mechanism of action of SBI-100 in lowering IOP, a defining disease process of hypertensive glaucoma. Moreover, biomarkers associated with inflammation and fibrosis in both normal tissue and tissues affected by glaucoma were significantly decreased, pointing to anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic activities often associated with cannabinoids in other disease states. Data also revealed that biomarkers associated with neovascularization, a disease process of new blood vessel formation that can damage the retina in a variety of ocular diseases, was also inhibited by the active moiety, prompting further study for the utility of this drug in diseases of the retina.
Manufacturing of SBI-100 OE has been conducted in the United States. We completed the manufacture of the clinical trial material for our Phase 1 clinical trial in September 2022. We rely on compendial excipients that can be sourced from countries outside the United States, such as China. 
In June 2022, we received approval from Belberry Limited, a certified Australian Human Research Ethics Committee, to begin our Phase 1 clinical trial for the study of our lead product candidate, SBI-100 OE. We subsequently notified the Australian Therapeutics Goods Administration of our intent to initiate our Phase 1 clinical trial through the Clinical Trial Notification scheme. In connection with this marketing approval to initiate the first-in-human trial for SBI-100 OE, we triggered the first milestone payment under our License Agreement for UM 5050 with UM. We commenced enrollment and dosing of the Phase 1 in November and December 2022. We expect our Phase 1 study to complete enrollment in the first half of 2023. The Company has announced that the safety review committee ("SRC") for this study reviewed safety data from the first and second cohorts of the single ascending dose arm of the Phase 1 and recommended advancing to the next cohort. After the review of the second cohort of safety data, the SRC also provided its recommendation that the study progress to the second arm of the Phase 1 study. 
During the third and fourth quarter of 2022, we manufactured the active pharmaceutical ingredient to be used in our Phase 2 clinical trial. The formulation and packaging of SBI-100 OE for its planned Phase 2 trial will be conducted by NextPharma Oy at its Finnish facility. NextPharma is a contract manufacturing organization with strong capabilities in preservative-free multi-dose and blow-fill-seal packaging of eye drop dispensers.
In December 2022 we obtained FDA clearance of our Investigational New Drug application to conduct clinical studies in the US, clearing the path to commence our Phase 2 trial in the United States without having to first complete our Phase 1 study. We expect to begin our Phase 2 trial in the middle of 2023. The Phase 2 study will be a randomized, controlled, double-masked clinical trial in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension to obtain additional data to determine whether the topical delivery of SBI-100 OE is safe and well-tolerated, and whether the IOP is markedly different between SBI-100 OE and the placebo.
In January 2023, our Phase 2 clinical trial protocol received study level approval from a central institutional review board (“IRB”). Additionally, in February 2023 we announced an agreement with Lexitas Pharma Services, Inc. (“Lexitas”), a leading full-service ophthalmic-focused contract research organization (“CRO”), to conduct our Phase 2a study for glaucoma and ocular hypertension. 
SBI-200
We have initiated research activities to explore the utility of SBI-200. Early studies of SBI-200 demonstrated analgesic, anti-inflammation, anti-fibrotic and anti-seizure properties, including the potential treatment and management of several eye diseases, such as uveitis, dry eye syndrome, macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy. Data we presented at the American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists ("AAPS") meeting held in November 2017 revealed that an early ocular formulation of SBI-200 was able to penetrate multiple compartments of the eye, including reaching the retina and the optic nerve. We are further evaluating the possible utility and development of this compound as a therapeutic agent. 
Cannabinoid Pharmaceutical Innovation Program (CPIP)
We are focused on the development of proprietary, synthetic cannabinoid derivatives that have been designed to improve the solubility, bioavailability and pharmacology of cannabinoids, with the goal of providing therapeutic benefits to fulfill unmet needs, while also providing the Company with strong intellectual property protection. At the end of 2021, we announced that the Company would establish the Cannabinoid Pharmaceutical Innovation Program, or CPIP, to focus on targeting important signaling pathways in the endocannabinoid system ("ECS") which are relevant to various ocular pathologies and to identify possible new drug candidates to add to our development pipeline. Moreover, new research continues to demonstrate that this cell signaling network can impact fundamental processes including synaptic plasticity, pain control, metabolism and immunity, highlighting that the ECS may be central to a wide range of diseases settings. Thus, while our pipeline remains grounded in ophthalmology, the company may additionally explore ECS-modulating therapeutics to address pathologies beyond ocular disease.

The CPIP reflects the Company’s continued commitment to expand its leadership in cannabinoid-based science and cutting-edge research that can be commercialized through new and existing technologies. It leverages R&D initiatives with key opinion leaders with specialized research centers in the US and internationally, such as UM, University of Cordoba and University of Eastern Piedmont. As a first step in building the CPIP in October 2021, we announced the establishment of a new Exclusive Sponsored Research Agreement ("ESRA") with VivaCell Biotechnology España, S.L.U ("VivaCell"), (formerly known as Emerald Health Biotechnology España, S.L.U), focused on developing and characterizing novel molecules that can affect the ECS for therapeutic benefit. This agreement deepens the commitment of Dr. Eduardo Munoz, Professor of Immunology, Department of Cell Biology, Physiology and Immunology of the University of Córdoba, Spain, and Director of the inflammation and cancer research group at the Institute Maimonides for Biomedical Research Córdoba, and Dr. Giovanni Appendino, Professor of Organic Chemistry, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences at the University of Eastern Piedmont, Novara, Italy, who are the principal investigators and continue to lead our scientific advisory board. Under the terms of the ESRA the Company will approve and fund designated projects and have exclusive rights to all data and products, and any intellectual property resulting from this research collaboration will be owned by the Company. Vivacell will receive a single digit royalty on all licensing revenue or other consideration paid to the Company by a third-party licensee, assignee or purchaser related to any product commercialized as part of designated projects. Through the CPIP the Company intends to expand its relationships with other investigators and institutions who are leaders in the field of cannabinoid research. 
Our Competitive Strengths
We are developing novel, proprietary cannabinoid derivatives that have the potential to treat ophthalmic disorders and other diseases with unmet needs. Our lead product candidate, SBI-100 OE, is being developed for the treatment of glaucoma and ocular hypertension. Currently, most approved drugs for glaucoma target similar molecular receptors and have similar mechanisms of action. As a result there is a significant unmet medical need to develop new drugs that target different receptors using novel mechanisms of action. SBI-100 OE has the potential to meet these needs. The eye is rich in cannabinoid receptors, including CBR1, which is the main target for SBI-100 OE. Our studies, along with multiple studies from other institutions, have demonstrated that activation of CBR1 can not only result in reduction of IOP, but also have anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic and anti-neovascular effects, which may offer potential benefits in other eye diseases beyond glaucoma. As a novel agent for the potential treatment of glaucoma and ocular hypertension, SBI-100 OE may represent a new treatment opportunity for physicians and patients and we are leading the field in this area of research.
With the implementation of the CPIP, we intend to leverage the potential success of SBI-100 OE to discover and develop additional novel cannabinoid derivatives capable of targeting multiple cannabinoid receptors in the eye for the treatment of ocular diseases. The combined experience of our board of directors, management team, scientific and clinical advisors provides a significant strategic capability as we work to define and build our competitive advantage.
Our Business Strategy
Our goal is to become a premier developer of synthetic cannabinoid derivatives for global markets to treat significant unmet medical needs. Our current operating strategy includes:
•selection and licensing of potential clinical targets based on internal and external published data, access to appropriate cannabinoids, and the impact of both developmental and market conditions;
•prioritization of product candidates based on their potential clinical utility and the market and competitive dynamics of the associated target indications;
•development and execution of an intellectual property strategy;
•clinical development and advancement of our current product pipeline;
•outsourcing activities such as clinical trial management and drug manufacturing via clinical research organizations ("CROs") and contract manufacturers, where possible and cost effective;
•obtaining regulatory direction and approval from the FDA, European Medicines Agency ("EMA"), and other regulatory agencies for our product candidates;
•discovery, research and development of additional novel cannabinoid-based molecules for future product candidates; and
•partnering, out-licensing, or selling our product candidates to pharmaceutical companies to focus on core strengths, maximize profits, and to bring our state-of-the-art therapeutics to patients in need.

Sales and Marketing
We have not established a sales, marketing or product distribution infrastructure because our lead product candidates are still in research, discovery, pre-clinical or clinical development stages. We are evaluating what we believe to be the optimal commercialization path for the Company, our product candidates, and patients. Commercialization paths may include licensing/partnering with or selling assets to other commercial enterprises. 
Manufacturing
We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities for final manufacture. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacture of any products that we may commercialize.
For all of our future product candidates, we aim to identify and qualify manufacturers to provide the active pharmaceutical ingredient ("API"), formulation, and fill-and-finish services prior to submission of a New Drug Application ("NDA") to the FDA. We expect to continue to develop drug candidates that can be produced cost-effectively at contract manufacturing facilities.
Intellectual Property
The success of most of our product candidates will depend in large part on our ability to:
•obtain and maintain patent and other legal protections for the proprietary technology, inventions and improvements we consider important to our business;
•prosecute our patent applications and defend any issued patents we obtain;
•preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and
•operate without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of third parties.
We intend to continue to seek patent protection for certain of our product candidates, drug delivery systems, molecular modifications, as well as other proprietary technologies and their uses by filing patent applications in the United States and other selected global territories. We intend for these patent applications to cover, where possible, claims for composition of matter, medical uses, processes for isolation and preparation, processes for delivery and formulations.
As of the date of this Annual Report, we have licensed two inventions from UM which include U.S. patents as well as a number of foreign counterparts, including the European Union, Japan, Canada and Australia. The patents that we license cover composition of matter and preparation of SBI-100 and other cannabinoid receptor modulators, and their methods of use. The US patent for SBI-100 is expected to expire in 2029. Additionally, in July 2020 the United States Patent and Trademark Office granted a patent for SBI-200. The expiration date of the US patent for SBI-200 is January 2037. Under our license agreements, UM retains ownership over the licensed patents and control over the maintenance and prosecution of the licensed patents and patent applications. 
We also rely upon trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our proprietary and intellectual property position. We seek to protect our proprietary information in part using confidentiality agreements with our collaborators, scientific advisors, employees and consultants, and invention assignment agreements with our employees and selected consultants, scientific advisors and collaborators. The confidentiality agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of agreements or clauses requiring invention assignment, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party.
Competition
Our industry is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. We face potential competition from many different sources, such as pharmaceutical companies, including generic drug companies, biotechnology companies, drug delivery companies, and academic and research institutions. Many of our potential competitors may have substantially greater financial, scientific, technical, intellectual property, regulatory and human resources than we do, and greater experience than we do commercializing products and developing product candidates, including obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals for product candidates. Consequently, our competitors may develop products for indications we pursue that are more effective, better tolerated, more widely prescribed or accepted, more useful and less costly, and they may also be more successful in manufacturing and marketing their products. We also face competition from third parties in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and enrolling patients for clinical trials, and in identifying and acquiring or in-licensing new products and product candidates.

Government Regulation
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, import and export of pharmaceutical products such as those we are developing. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. A failure to comply with such laws and regulations or prevail in any enforcement action or litigation related to noncompliance could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.
Regulation of Controlled Substances
Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) Regulation
Certain cannabinoids are regulated as “controlled substances” as defined in the Controlled Substances Act (the “CSA”), which establishes registration, security, recordkeeping, reporting, storage, distribution and other requirements administered by the DEA. The DEA is concerned with the control of handlers of controlled substances (and with the equipment and raw materials used in their manufacture and packaging) of controlled substances in order to prevent loss and diversion into illicit channels of commerce.
The DEA regulates controlled substances as Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances. Schedule I substances by definition have no established medicinal use and may not be marketed or sold in the United States. A pharmaceutical product may be listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V, with Schedule II substances considered to present the highest risk of abuse and Schedule V substances the lowest relative risk of abuse among such substances. Certain cannabinoids are listed by the DEA as Schedule I controlled substances under the CSA. Consequently, their manufacture, shipment, storage, sale and use are subject to a high degree of regulation. Annual registration is required for any facility that manufactures, distributes, dispenses, imports or exports any controlled substance. The registration is specific to the particular location, activity and controlled substance schedule. For example, separate registrations are needed for import and manufacturing, and each registration will specify which schedules of controlled substances are authorized.
The DEA typically inspects a facility to review its security measures prior to issuing a registration. Security requirements vary by controlled substance schedule, with the most stringent requirements applying to Schedule I and Schedule II substances. Required security measures include background checks on employees and physical control of inventory through measures such as cages, surveillance cameras and inventory reconciliations. The registered entity must maintain records for the handling of all controlled substances and must make periodic reports to the DEA. These include, for example, distribution reports for Schedule I and II controlled substances, Schedule III substances that are narcotics, and other designated substances. The registered entity must also report thefts or losses of any controlled substance and obtain authorization to destroy any controlled substance. In addition, special authorization and notification requirements apply to imports and exports.
In addition, a DEA quota system controls and limits the availability and production of controlled substances in Schedule I or II. Distributions of any Schedule I or II controlled substance must also be accompanied by special order forms, with copies provided to the DEA. The DEA may adjust aggregate production quotas and individual production and procurement quotas from time to time during the year, although the DEA has substantial discretion in whether or not to make such adjustments. To meet its responsibilities, the DEA conducts periodic inspections of registered establishments that handle controlled substances. In the event of non-compliance, the DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations, or initiate proceedings to revoke those registrations. In certain circumstances, violations could lead to criminal prosecution.
The DEA has conducted a scientific review of the chemical structure of SBI-200 and determined that SBI-200 is not a regulated chemical nor controlled substance under the CSA. This decision by the DEA should help the Company expand the network of clinical testing sites, permit a greater cross-section of patients to participate in studies of this drug, as well as speed the initiation of clinical trials for SBI-200. SBI-100 remains a Schedule I controlled substance, pending a request to re-schedule SBI-100 after marketing authorization by the FDA.
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The FDA regulates drugs under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act ("FDCA") and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject us to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending NDAs, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical 
Table of Contents

hold, issuance of warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties.
The process required by the FDA before a drug may be legally marketed in the United States, generally involves the following:
•completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with GLP regulations;
•submission of an Investigational New Drug application ("IND") to the FDA , which must be authorized as open before clinical trials may begin;
•approval and oversight of each study by an institutional review board ("IRB") before each clinical site may initiate the trial(s);
•conduct of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practice ("GCP") requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for each indication;
•submission of an NDA to the FDA;
•satisfactory development and completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity; 
•satisfactory development and completion of an FDA BioResearch Monitoring (BIMO) inspection of the clinical study sites which participated in the studies supporting the NDA application; and
•FDA review and approval of the NDA.
Preclinical Studies
Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some nonclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. An IND generally becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless, before that time, the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA work to resolve any outstanding concerns before the hold can be lifted and the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND does not always result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
Clinical Trials
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug candidate to humans under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects/patients provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the NIH for public dissemination on their www.clinicaltrials.gov website.
Before marketing authorization, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:
•Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.
•Phase 2: The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
•Phase 3: The drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.
Table of Contents

Reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or due to a business decision. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
Marketing Approval
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the nonclinical and clinical studies, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the submission of an NDA is subject to a substantial application user fee. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act ("PDUFA") guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of reviewing and responding to a submission within ten months from the date of “filing” of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity. This review typically takes at least twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to the FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a “filing” decision. However, if issues arise during the review, the FDA may request additional information and the review period may be extended to permit the applicant to provide and the FDA to review that information, which may significantly extend this time period.
In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003 ("PREA"), as amended and reauthorized, certain NDAs or supplements to an NDA must contain data that is adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements.
The FDA also may require submission of REMS plan to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and/or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk minimization tools.
The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information requested. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity.
The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug and/or first-in-class product to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements.
The testing and approval process for an NDA requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and each may take several years to complete. Data obtained from nonclinical and clinical testing are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all.
After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or nonclinical testing in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. For some products, such as our product candidates, an additional step of DEA review and scheduling is required.

Post-Approval Requirements
Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion, and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.
The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP requirements and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market.
Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. 
Other potential consequences include, among other things: 
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
•fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
•refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
•product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
•injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. 
In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act ("PDMA"), which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution. 
Exclusivity and Approval of Competing Products
Hatch Waxman Act
Section 505 of the FDCA describes three types of marketing applications that may be submitted to the FDA to request marketing authorization for a new drug. A Section 505(b)(1) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and efficacy. A 505(b)(2) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and efficacy but where at least some of the information required for approval comes from investigations that were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted. This regulatory pathway enables the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA’s prior findings of safety and efficacy for an existing product, or published literature, in support of its application. Section 505(j) establishes an abbreviated approval process for a generic version of approved drug products through the submission of an Abbreviated New Drug Application ("ANDA"). An ANDA provides for marketing of a generic drug product that has the same active ingredients, 
Table of Contents

dosage form, strength, route of administration, labeling, performance characteristics and intended use, among other things, to a previously approved product. ANDAs are termed “abbreviated” because they are generally not required to include preclinical (animal) and clinical (human) data to establish safety and efficacy. Instead, generic applicants must scientifically demonstrate that their product is bioequivalent to, or performs in the same manner as, the innovator drug through in vitro, in vivo, or other testing. The generic version must deliver the same amount of active ingredients into a subject’s bloodstream in the same amount of time as the innovator drug and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the reference listed drug. 
Hatch Waxman Patent Exclusivity
In seeking approval for a drug through a NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant’s product or a method of using the product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA. 
The ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Orange Book, except for patents covering methods of use for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval. Specifically, the applicant must certify with respect to each patent that: 
•the required patent information has not been filed;
•the listed patent has expired;
•the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or
•the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the new product.
Generally, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA cannot be approved until all listed patents have expired, except when the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant challenges a listed drug. A certification that the proposed product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or indicate that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. 
If the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the application has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of notice of the Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant. 
Hatch Waxman Non-Patent Exclusivity
In addition to patent issues, market and data exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications for competing products. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent data exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of a NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the activity of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company that references the previously approved drug. However, an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA may be submitted after four years if it contains a Paragraph IV certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for a NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA or 505(b)(2) NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant, are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application or supplement. Three-year exclusivity may be awarded for changes to a previously approved drug product, such as new indications, dosages, strengths or dosage forms of an existing drug. 
This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and, as a general matter, does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for other versions of a drug. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.

Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a product as an orphan drug if it is a drug intended to treat a disease or condition that affects populations of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States or, if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting a NDA. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. 
If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity or inability to manufacture the product in sufficient quantities. The designation of such drug also entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the same indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication than that for which the orphan product has exclusivity. 
Federal and State Fraud and Abuse Data Privacy and Security Laws and Regulations
In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, federal and state fraud and abuse laws restrict business practices in the pharmaceutical industry. These laws include anti-kickback and false claims laws and regulations as well as data privacy and security laws and regulations. 
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease, or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not meet the requirements of a statutory or regulatory exception or safe harbor. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. 
The federal False Claims Act prohibits any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. A violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute also constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act. 
Several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of products for unapproved, and thus non-covered, uses. In addition, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. 
The federal HIPAA also created federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. 
Pharmaceutical companies are also subject to the civil monetary penalties statute, which imposes penalties against any person who is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. 
In addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and other health care providers. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the ACA, signed into law on March 2010, created new federal requirements for reporting, by applicable manufacturers of covered drugs, payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals. Applicable manufacturers are also required to report annually to the government certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. In addition, 
Table of Contents

certain states require implementation of commercial compliance programs and compliance with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, impose restrictions on marketing practices, and/or tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration or items of value provided to physicians and other health care professionals and entities. 
We may also be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act ("HITECH") and its implementing regulations, imposes specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same requirements, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
To the extent that any of our product candidates, once approved, are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or other transfers of value to healthcare professionals. 
The shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust systems to comply with different compliance and/or reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions increase the possibility that a healthcare company may violate one or more of the requirements. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.
Coverage and Reimbursement
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any drug products for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third party payors. Third party payors include government authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product. Third party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. A decision by a third party payor not to cover our products, if approved, could reduce physician utilization of our products once approved and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. By way of example, in the United States, the ACA contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products, including, for example, increased rebates for drugs sold to Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries, and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs. In addition, recently there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, reform government program reimbursement methodologies. For example, on August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA, was signed into law. Among other things, the IRA requires manufacturers of certain drugs to engage in price negotiations with Medicare (beginning in 2026), with prices that can be negotiated subject to a cap; imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation (first due in 2023); and replaces the Part D coverage gap discount program with a new discounting program (beginning in 2025). The IRA permits the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to implement many of these provisions through guidance, as opposed to regulation, for the initial years. For that and other reasons, it is currently unclear how the IRA will be effectuated. Additional state and federal healthcare reform measures 
Table of Contents

may be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products once approved or additional pricing pressures.
Foreign Regulation
In order to market any product outside of the United States, we must comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products. While our management and many of our consultants are familiar with and have been responsible for gaining marketing approval in many countries, we have not reviewed the specific regulations in countries outside of the United States, as it pertains to cannabinoids. 
Additional Regulation
We are a reporting company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), and, therefore, subject to the information and reporting requirements of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") and other federal securities laws, and the compliance obligations of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 ("Sarbanes-Oxley Act"). In addition, our financial reporting is subject to United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"), and GAAP is subject to change over time.
We are also subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations applied to businesses generally. We believe that we are in conformity with all applicable laws in all relevant jurisdictions.
Employees
As of the date of this Annual Report, we have a total of eleven full-time employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relations with our employees to be good. 
We anticipate that we will need to hire additional employees or independent contractors for our continued development efforts. We also intend to utilize independent contractors and outsourced services, such as CROs, and third party manufacturers, where possible and appropriate.
