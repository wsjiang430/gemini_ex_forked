Item 1.  BUSINESS.
General
 
Spherix Incorporated is a technology development company committed to the fostering of innovative ideas. Spherix Incorporated was formed in 1967 as a scientific research company and for much of our history pursued drug development, including through Phase III clinical studies, which were largely discontinued in 2012.  In 2012 and 2013, we shifted our focus to being a firm that owns, develops, acquires and monetizes intellectual property assets. Such monetization included, but was not limited to, acquiring IP from patent holders in order to maximize the value of the patent holdings by conducting and managing a licensing campaign, commercializing the IP, or through the settlement and litigation of patents.  
 
Since March 1, 2013, the Company has received limited funds from its IP monetization. In addition to our patent monetization efforts, since the fourth quarter of 2017, we have been transitioning to a technology development company. The Company made no investments in new IP during 2017 and 2018 and started the transition with its investment in Hoth Therapeutics, Inc. during the 3rd quarter of 2017, with its agreement with DatChat, Inc. in March 2018 and with its agreement with CBM Biopharma, Inc. in October 2018.
 
CBM Biopharma, Inc. Transaction
 
In October 2018, the Company entered into an agreement and plan of merger, subject to shareholder approval, with CBM BioPharma, Inc. (“CBM”), a pharmaceutical company focusing on the development of cancer treatments, pursuant to which all shares of capital stock of CBM will be converted into the right to receive an aggregate of 15,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock with CBM continuing as the surviving corporation in the merger.
DatChat Securities Purchase Agreement
 
In March 2018, the Company entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the “Merger Agreement”), subject to shareholder approval, with DatChat, Inc. (the “DatChat Merger”), a secure messaging application that utilizes blockchain technology, as amended on May 3, 2018. After further negotiations, the Company determined not to pursue a merger with DatChat and on August 8, 2018, entered into a securities purchase agreement (the “Securities Purchase Agreement”) with DatChat pursuant to which the Company and DatChat agreed to terminate the DatChat Merger and each of the parties to the Merger Agreement agreed to release and discharge and hold harmless each of the other parties with respect to the transaction contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
 
In addition to the termination, under the Securities Purchase Agreement, the Company agreed to make a $1,000,000 strategic investment in DatChat which consisted of (a) a cash payment of $500,000, (b) the forgiveness of prior advances made to DatChat by the Company, and (c) an obligation of the Company to pay certain specific future compensation expenses of DatChat (amounts in clauses (b) and (c) not to exceed a maximum of $500,000 in the aggregate); in exchange for $1,000,000 of restricted shares of DatChat common stock which is equal to 4.37% of the issued and outstanding common stock of DatChat. In the event that DatChat completes a public offering of its securities pursuant to an effective registration statement or a merger, consolidations, transfer or share exchange transaction to pursuant to which DatChat becomes subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, DatChat agreed to certain covenants in connection with certain reporting and information disclosure requirements.

Patent Monetization Activities
 
In July 2013, we acquired 7 patents in the field of mobile communications from Rockstar Consortium US LP (“Rockstar”), which was launched in 2011 by Apple, Inc., Microsoft Corporation, Sony Corporation, Blackberry Limited and LM Ericsson Telephone Company as an intellectual property licensing company to manage a patent portfolio related to the pre-bankruptcy technology and businesses of Nortel Networks (“Nortel”).  
 
In September 2013, we acquired North South Holdings, Inc. (“North South”) and its 222 patents in the fields of wireless communications, satellite, solar, and radio frequency and 2 patents in the field of pharmaceutical distribution. The 222 patents were originally developed by Harris Corporation, a leader in defense communications and electronics.
 
In December 2013, we acquired an additional 101 patents and patent applications covering, among other things, internet access and video and data transmission, from Rockstar in consideration for approximately $60 million of our securities consisting of common stock and preferred stock.  
 
We have not generated any significant revenues from our intellectual property monetization platform. We have incurred losses from operations for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 of $6.9 million and $3.8 million, respectively.  Our accumulated deficit was $140.1 million at December 31, 2018.  In 2018, the Company took a $1,405,000 amortization expense on its patent portfolio and patent rights and an impairment loss of $2,173,000. Therefore, at December 31, 2018, the value of the Company’s patent portfolio and patent rights was zero.
 
Acquisition of shares of Hoth Therapeutics, Inc.
 
On June 30, 2017, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Hoth Therapeutics, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“Hoth”), for the purchase of an aggregate of 1,700,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 (the “Shares”), of Hoth, for a purchase price of $675,000. As of December 31, 2018, Hoth had approximately 5 million shares of common stock issued and outstanding, which has been retroactively restated to reflect the 1-for-4 reverse stock split effected by Hoth on December 6, 2018. Hoth is a development stage biopharmaceutical company focused on unique targeted therapeutics for patients suffering from indications such as atopic dermatitis, also known as eczema. Hoth’s primary asset is a sublicense agreement with Chelexa Biosciences, Inc. (“Chelexa”) pursuant to which Chelexa has granted Hoth an exclusive sublicense to use its BioLexa Platform, a proprietary, patented, drug compound platform developed at the University of Cincinnati. Hoth intends to develop BioLexa’s applications in the aesthetic dermatology field to help treat and reduce post-procedure infections, accelerate healing and improve clinical outcomes for patients undergoing procedures. Hoth will be implementing FDA testing procedures for BioLexa. In addition to the Purchase Agreement, the Company and Hoth entered into a Registration Rights Agreement, pursuant to which Hoth is obligated to register for resale on a registration statement on Form S-1 under the Securities Act, all of the shares. Further, the Company, Hoth and Hoth’s existing shareholders have entered into a Shareholders Agreement, pursuant to which Spherix shall have a right to appoint one director to the board of directors of Hoth for so long as the Company holds at least 10% of the issued and outstanding common stock of Hoth.
 
On February 14, 2019, the Company purchased an aggregate of 35,714 shares of the common stock of Hoth in connection with Hoth’s initial public offering, which was consummated on February 20, 2019, at a purchase price of $5.60 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $200,000. Hoth’s common stock commenced trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market, on February 15, 2019 under the ticker symbol “HOTH”. The Company entered into a lock-up agreement with Hoth pursuant to which the Company has agreed not to sell any shares of Hoth common stock or common stock equivalents until February 20, 2022, which is the 36 month anniversary of the consummation of Hoth’s initial public offering, (the “Spherix Securities”) until February 20, 2022, which is the 36 month anniversary of the consummation of Hoth’s initial public offering, provided, however (i) Spherix may offer, sell, contract to sell, hypothecate, pledge, dividend or distribute to its shareholders or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, up to an aggregate of 10% of the initially issued Spherix Securities, provided further that the recipients of the Spherix Securities shall not be permitted to resell such Spherix Securities until six months after the date of the Initial Public Offering, (ii) beginning 12 months after the date of Hoth’s initial public offering, Spherix may offer, sell, contract to sell, hypothecate, pledge, dividend or distribute to its shareholders or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, up to an additional 10% of the initially issued Spherix Securities, (iii) beginning 24 months after the date of Hoth’s initial public offering, Spherix may offer, sell, contract to sell, hypothecate, pledge, dividend or distribute to its shareholders or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, up to an additional 10% of the initially issued Spherix Securities and (iv) beginning 36 months after the date of the Hoth initial public offering, Spherix may offer, sell, contract to sell, hypothecate, pledge, dividend or distribute to its shareholders or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, the Spherix Securities without any restrictions.

Competition
 
We encounter significant competition from others seeking to target development stage technology companies in order to acquire interests in intellectual property assets and monetize such assets. This includes an increase in the number of competitors seeking to acquire the same or similar patents and technologies that we may seek to acquire.  Most of our competitors have much longer operating histories, and significantly greater financial and human resources, than we do.
 
We also compete with venture capital firms, strategic corporate buyers and various industry leaders for identifying and targeting technology acquisitions and licensing opportunities.  Many of these competitors may have more financial and human resources than we do.  As we become more successful, we may find more companies entering the market for similar technology opportunities, which may reduce our market share in one or more technology industries that we currently rely upon to generate future revenue.

Other companies may develop competing technologies that offer better or less expensive alternatives to the patented technologies that we may acquire and/or out-license.  Many potential competitors may have significantly greater resources than we do.  Technological advances or entirely different approaches developed by one or more of our competitors could render certain of the technologies owned or controlled by our operating subsidiaries obsolete and/or uneconomical.
 
Intellectual Property and Patent Rights
 
Our intellectual property is primarily comprised of trade secrets, patented know-how, issued and pending patents, copyrights and technological innovation relating to our past business of patent monetization through litigation activities.
 
The portfolio we were working with Equitable to monetize pursuant to the Monetization Agreement is comprised of over 290 patents and patent applications (the “Portfolio”).  The Portfolio includes both U.S. and foreign patents and pending patent applications in the wireless communications and telecommunication sectors including data, optical and voice technology, antenna technology, Wi-Fi, base station functionality, and cellular.  
 
Most of the patents in the Portfolio are publicly accessible on the Internet website of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office at www.uspto.gov.
 
The lives of the patent rights in the Portfolio have a wide duration ranging from 2019 to 2026.  
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, we have six full-time employees, none of which are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
