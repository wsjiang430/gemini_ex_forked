OVERVIEW
 Who We Are
Angi Inc. connects quality home service professionals with consumers across more than 500 different categories, from repairing and remodeling homes to cleaning and landscaping. During the year ended December 31, 2022, over 220,000 domestic service professionals actively sought consumer leads, completed jobs or advertised work through Angi Inc. platforms. Additionally, consumers turned to at least one of our businesses to find a service professional for approximately 29 million projects during the year ended December 31, 2022. 
In the fourth quarter of 2022, our segment presentation was changed to reflect out four operating segments, which now include: (i) Ads and Leads, (ii) Services, (iii) Roofing, and (iv) International (includes Europe and Canada), and the various businesses within those segments operate under multiple brands, including Angi, HomeAdvisor, Handy, Total Home Roofing, Angi Roofing, MyBuilder, and Travaux.com. Our financial information for prior periods has been recast to conform to the current period presentation.
Angi is a public company controlled by IAC Inc. (formerly known as IAC/InterActiveCorp (“IAC”)). As of December 31, 2022, IAC’s economic and voting interest in Angi were 84.1% and 98.1%, respectively.
As used herein, “Angi,” the “Company,” “we,” “our,” “us,” and similar terms refer to Angi Inc. and its subsidiaries (unless the context requires otherwise).
 History
We were incorporated in the State of Delaware as ANGI Homeservices Inc. in 2017 in connection with the combination of IAC’s HomeAdvisor business and Angie’s List, Inc. (the “Combination”), which was completed in September 2017.
In 2018, we acquired Handy Technologies, Inc., a leading platform in the United States for connecting consumers looking for household services with top-quality, pre-screened independent service professionals.
In March 2021, we changed our name to Angi Inc. in connection with an update to one of our leading websites and brands (Angie’s List) to Angi and the concentration of our marketing investment in the Angi brand in order to focus marketing, sales, and branding efforts on a single brand.
DESCRIPTION OF OUR BUSINESSES
Our Domestic Businesses
In the United States, the Company, through several differentiated experiences, provides consumers with tools and resources to help them find local, pre-screened and customer-rated service professionals, matching consumers with independently established home services professionals engaged in a trade, occupation and/or businesses that customarily provides such services and provides consumers with tools to communicate with service professionals and pay for related services:
•an Ads and Leads experience where service professionals pay for connections to consumers;
•a Services experience where consumers make payment through the Angi platform for a specific job and the Angi platform assigns that job to a service professional who completes it and receives a portion of the job fee; and
•a Roofing business that provides roof replacement and repair services directly to consumers.
Ads and Leads Overview
This business connects consumers with service professionals for local services through our nationwide online directory of service professionals across more than 500 service categories, as well as provides consumers with valuable tools, services and content (including verified reviews of local service professionals), to help them research, shop and hire for local services. Consumers can access our nationwide online directory and related basic tools and services free of charge upon registration, as well as by way of purchased membership packages. Our Ads business also sells term-based website and mobile and digital magazine advertising to service professionals, as well as provides them with quoting, invoicing, and payment services. Our Leads digital marketplace service connects consumers with service professionals nationwide for home repair, maintenance, and improvement projects. Our Leads business provides consumers with tools and resources to help them find local, pre-screened and customer-rated service professionals, as well as instantly book appointments online, connect with service professionals

instantly by telephone, and access several home services-related resources, such as cost guides for different home services projects.
Consumer Services
Consumers can search for a service professional in our nationwide online directory and/or be matched with a service professional through our digital marketplace and certain third-party affiliate platforms. They also have access to related basic tools and services, ratings, reviews, and certain promotions. This includes consumers access to Angi’s online True Cost Guide, which provides project cost information for more than 400 project types nationwide, as well as a library of home services-related content consisting primarily of articles about home improvement, repair and maintenance, tools to assist consumers with the research, planning and management of their projects and general advice for working with service professionals.
Matches are made by way of our proprietary algorithm, based on several factors (including the type of services desired, location and the number of service professionals available to fulfill the request). Depending on the nature of the service request and the path through which it was submitted, consumers are generally matched with service professionals from the Leads digital marketplace, a Services service professional or a combination of Ads and Leads service professionals (as and if available for the given service request). In all cases, service professionals may contact consumers with whom they have been matched with directly and consumers can generally review profiles, ratings and reviews of presented service professionals and select the service professional whom they believe best meets their specific needs. Consumers are under no obligation to work with any service professional(s) referred by or found through any Angi branded or third-party affiliate platform. Consumers are responsible for booking the service and for paying the service professional directly, which can be done by consumers independently.
Consumers can rate Angi service professionals listed in our nationwide directory on a one- to five- star rating scale based on a variety of criteria, including overall experience, availability, price, quality, responsiveness, punctuality and professionalism and other criteria, depending on the type of service provided. Ratings on each applicable criterion are weighted across all reviews submitted for the service professional to produce such professional’s overall rating on Angi. Consumers can also provide a detailed description of their experiences with service providers. Ratings and reviews cannot be submitted anonymously, and there are processes in place to prevent service professionals from reporting on themselves or their competitors, as well as to detect fraudulent or otherwise problematic reviews.
Service Professional Services
Our Ads and Leads business sells term-based website, mobile, and magazine advertising to certified service professionals, as well as provides them with a variety of services and tools, including quoting, invoicing, and payment services. In order to become a certified service professional in the Angi network, service professionals must satisfy certain criteria. Generally, service professionals with an average consumer rating below a “3” are not eligible for certification. In addition to retaining the requisite member rating, service professionals must validate their home services experiences and the owners or principals of businesses affiliated with service professionals must pass certain criminal background checks and attest to applicable state and local licensure requirements.
Once eligibility criteria are satisfied, service professionals become certified and can purchase term-based advertising contracts and be matched with consumers. If a certified service professional fails to meet any eligibility criteria during the applicable contract term, refuses to participate in our complaint resolution process, and/or engages in what we determine to be prohibited behavior through any Angi platform, existing advertising and exclusive promotions will be suspended, and the related advertising contract will be subject to termination.
Certified service professionals rotate among the first service professionals listed in our nationwide online directory search results for an applicable category (together with their company name, overall rating, number of reviews, certification badge and basic profile information), with non-certified service professionals appearing below certified service professionals in directory search results. Certified service professionals can also provide exclusive promotions to members. When consumers choose to be matched with a service professional, our proprietary algorithm will determine where a given service professional appears within related results.
Service professionals pay fees for consumer matches, at their election, and subscription fees for Leads memberships, which are available for purchase through our sales force. The basic annual membership package includes membership in our digital marketplace, as well as access to consumer matches (for which additional fees are generally paid) and a listing in our online directory and certain other affiliated directories. Basic annual membership also includes a business profile page on HomeAdvisor.com and Angi.com, a mobile application and access to various online tools designed to help service professionals more effectively market to, manage and connect with, consumers with whom they have been matched. 
Once a member, service professionals must maintain at least a three-star customer rating. If a service professional fails to meet any eligibility criteria during the membership term, refuses to participate in the complaint resolution process, or engages

in what we determine to be prohibited behavior through any Angi platform, the service professional is subject to being removed from the Angi network.
Services Overview
Through our Services business, we provide a pre-priced offering service, pursuant to which consumers can request services through Angi and Handy branded platforms and pay for such services on the applicable platform directly. When consumers request household services directly through Services platforms, requests are fulfilled by independently established home services providers engaged in a trade, occupation and/or business that customarily provide such services.
Consumer Services
Consumers can submit requests for work to be done on the Handy and Angi platforms and referrals will be made based on the type of service desired, location and the date and time the consumer wants the service to be provided. In addition, consumers who purchase furniture, electronics, appliances and other home-related items from select third-party retail partners online (and in certain markets, in store) can simultaneously purchase assembly, installation and other related services to be fulfilled by Services service professionals, which are then paid for by the consumer directly through the applicable third-party retail partner platform.
Service Professional Services
Services service professionals are provided with access to a pool of consumers seeking service professionals and must validate their home services experiences, as well as attest to holding the requisite license, and maintain an acceptable rating to remain on Services platforms. In addition, the owner(s) or principal(s) of such service provider must pass certain criminal background checks. Access to Service platforms will be revoked for service professionals that repeatedly receive low customer satisfaction ratings.
Roofing Overview
The business within our Roofing segment provides roof replacement and repair services, primarily in Florida (and, to a lesser extent, in Arizona and Texas). Requests for roof replacement and repair services are currently fulfilled via Angi Roofing, LLC, the entity that was formed by Angi Inc. in July 2021 to acquire certain assets and liabilities of Total Home Roofing, LLC.
Consumer Services
Roofing consumers are identified through lead generation services, as well as organically through consumers that reach out directly, who are able to receive roof replacement services.
Service Professional Services
Angi Roofing contracts with independent roofing professional in each market to fulfil the services.
Our International Businesses
 Through the International (Europe and Canada) segment, Angi Inc. also operates several international businesses that connect consumers with home service professionals, including: (i) Travaux, MyHammer and Werkspot, leading home services marketplaces in France, Germany and the Netherlands, respectively, (ii) MyBuilder, one of the leading home services marketplaces in the United Kingdom, (iii) the Austrian operations of MyHammer, (iv) the Italian operations of Werkspot and (v) Homestars, a leading home services marketplace in Canada. Angi Inc. owns controlling interests in Travaux, MyHammer, Werkspot and MyBuilder and wholly owns Homestars. The business models of the international businesses vary by jurisdiction and differ in certain respects from the business models of Angi Inc.’s various domestic businesses.
Revenue
Ads and Leads Revenue is primarily derived from (i) consumer connection revenue, which is comprised of fees paid by service professionals for consumer matches (regardless of whether the service professional ultimately provides the requested service), (ii) advertising revenue, which includes revenue from service professionals under contract for advertising, and (iii) membership subscription revenue from service professionals and consumers. Consumer connection revenue varies based upon several factors, including the service requested, product experience offered, and geographic location of service. Services is primarily comprised of revenue from jobs sourced directly through the platform and through retail partnerships and completed by a service professional assigned by our platform. Roofing is comprised of revenue from roofing projects. International is primarily comprised of revenue from consumer connection revenue for consumer matches and membership subscription from service professionals and consumers.
Marketing
Table of Contents

In March 2021, the Company changed its name to Angi Inc. and updated one of its leading websites and brands, Angie’s List, to Angi, and concentrated its marketing investment in the Angi brand in order to focus its marketing, sales, and branding efforts to a single brand.
We market our various products and services to consumers primarily through digital marketing (primarily paid and free search engine marketing, display advertising and third-party affiliate agreements) as well as through traditional offline marketing (national television and radio campaigns), and e-mail. Pursuant to third-party affiliate agreements, third parties agree to advertise and promote our various products and services (and those of our various service professionals) on their platforms. In exchange for these efforts, these third parties are paid a fixed fee when visitors from their platforms click through and submit a valid service request through our platforms, or when visitors submit a valid service request on the affiliate platform and the affiliate transmits the service request to us. We also market our various products and services to consumers through relationships with select third-party retail partners and, to a lesser extent, through partnerships with other contextually related websites and direct mail.
We market our term-based advertising and related products offered by our Ads business and the matching services and membership subscriptions offered by our Leads business to service professionals primarily through our sales force. These products and services are also marketed together with our Services products and various directories, through paid search engine marketing, digital media advertising and direct relationships with trade associations and manufacturers.
Both generally, and in connection with the brand integration initiative, we have made (and expect we will continue to make) substantial investments in digital and traditional offline marketing (with continued expansion into new and existing digital platforms) to consumers and service professionals to promote our products and services and drive visitors to our various platforms and service professionals.
Technology
Each of our brands and businesses develops its own technology to support its products and services, leveraging both open-source and vendor supported software technology. We have dedicated engineering teams for our domestic and certain international businesses responsible for software development and the creation of new features to support our products and services across a full range of existing, new, and emerging devices and platforms. Our engineering teams use an agile development process that allows us to deploy frequent iterative releases for product and service features.
Competition
The home services industry is highly competitive and fragmented, and in many important respects, local in nature. We compete with, among others: (i) search engines and online directories, (ii) home and/or local services-related platforms, (iii) providers of consumer ratings, reviews and referrals and (iv) various forms of traditional offline advertising (primarily local in nature), including radio, direct marketing campaigns, yellow pages, newspapers and other offline directories. We also compete with local and national retailers of home improvement products that offer or promote installation services. We believe our biggest competition comes from the traditional methods most people currently use to find service professionals, which are by word-of-mouth and through referrals.
We believe that our ability to compete successfully will depend primarily upon the following factors:
•our ability to continue to build and maintain awareness of, and trust in and loyalty to, the Angi brand; and
•the functionality of our websites and mobile applications and the attractiveness of their features and our products and services generally to consumers and service professionals, as well as our continued ability to introduce new products and services that resonate with consumers and service professionals generally;
•the ability of the Services business to expand pre-priced booking services, while balancing the overall mix of service requests and directory services on our platforms generally;
•the size, quality, diversity and stability of our network of service professionals and the breadth of our online directory listings;
•our ability to consistently generate service requests and pre-priced bookings through our platforms that convert into revenue for our service professionals in a cost-effective manner; 
•our ability to continue to attract (and increase) traffic to our brands and platforms through search engines, including the ability to ensure that information from such brands and platforms and related links are displayed prominently in free search engine results and that paid search marketing efforts are cost-effective, as well as the ability to respond to changes in the usage and functioning of search engines;
•our ability to increasingly engage with consumers directly through our platforms, including our various mobile applications (rather than through search engine marketing or via free search engine referrals); and
Table of Contents

•the quality and consistency of our service professional pre-screening processes and ongoing quality control efforts, as well as the reliability, depth and timeliness of customer ratings and reviews.
Intellectual Property 
We regard our intellectual property rights as critical to our success in the United States, with our trademarks, service marks and domain names being especially critical to the continued development and awareness of our brands and our marketing efforts.
We protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of registered copyrights, trademarks, and domain name registrations, trade secrets and patent applications, as well as through contractual restrictions and reliance on federal, state and common law. We also enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with employees, consultants, contractors and business partners, and employees and contractors are also subject to proprietary information and invention assignment provisions.
We have several registered trademarks in the United States (the most significant of which relate to our Angi and HomeAdvisor brands), as well as other trademarks in Europe and Canada, and several pending trademark applications in the United States and certain other jurisdictions. We have also registered a variety of domestic and international domain names, the most significant of which relate to our Angi brand. In addition, we have one patent that expires in November 2035 and three patent applications pending. 
Government Regulation 
We are subject to laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the Internet generally and through mobile applications, including laws relating to the liability of providers of online services for their operations and the activities of their users. As a result, we could be subject to claims based on negligence, various torts and trademark and copyright infringement, among other actions.
In addition, because we receive, transmit, store and use a substantial amount of information received from or generated by consumers and service professionals, we are also impacted by laws and regulations governing privacy, the storage, sharing, use, processing, disclosure and protection of personal data and data breaches. See “Item 1A-Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business and Industry-The processing, storage, use and disclosure of personal data could give rise to liabilities and increased costs.”
We are particularly sensitive to laws and regulations that adversely impact the popularity or growth in use of the Internet and/or online products and services generally, restrict or otherwise unfavorably impact the ability or manner in which we provide our products and services, regulate the practices of third parties upon which we rely to provide our products and services and undermine open and neutrally administered Internet access. For example, the Digital Markets Act and the Digital Services Act (which both came into force in November 2022) form a single set of new rules that will be applicable to online intermediaries and platforms across the whole EU to seek to create a safer and more open digital space. Failure to comply with the Digital Services Act could result in the imposition of fines in an amount of up to 6% of a given online intermediary or platform’s annual worldwide turnover in the preceding fiscal year. Further, the United Kingdom is expected to enact in 2023 the Online Safety Bill that would significantly increase responsibilities of online platforms to control illegal or harmful activity and grant broad authority to the UK communications regulator to enforce its provisions. And as proposed, failure to comply with the Online Safety Bill could result in significant fines, blocking of services and personal liability for senior management. To the extent our businesses are required to implement new measures and/or make changes to our products and services to ensure compliance, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Compliance with this legislation or similar or more stringent legislation in other jurisdictions could be costly, and the failure to comply could result in service interruptions and negative publicity, any or all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, in December 2017, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (the “FCC”) adopted an order reversing net neutrality protections in the United States, including the repeal of specific rules against blocking, throttling or “paid prioritization” of content or services by Internet service providers. In the wake of the FCC’s repeal of its net neutrality laws, many states, including California and New York, have adopted their own neutrality laws imposing some degree of regulation on internet service providers operating in those states. Many of these regulations remain subject to legal challenge in the courts, although some, including California’s have been allowed to take effect while those challenges are concluded. To the extent Internet service providers take such actions, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Similarly, there have been various legislative efforts to restrict the scope of the protections available to online platforms under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, and our current protections from liability for third-party content in the United States could decrease or change as a result. Any future adverse changes to Section 230 could result in additional compliance costs for us and/or exposure for additional liabilities.
We are also subject to laws governing marketing and advertising activities conducted by/through telephone, e-mail, mobile devices and the Internet, including the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, the Telemarketing Sales Rule, the CAN-
Table of Contents

SPAM Act and similar state laws, as well as federal, state, and local laws and agency guidelines governing background screening.
In addition, we also are subject to various other federal, state, and local laws, rules and regulations focused on consumer protection. These laws, rules and regulations are enforced by governmental entities such as the Federal Trade Commission and state Attorneys General offices and may confer private rights of action on consumers as well. Changes in these laws, or a proceeding of this nature, could have an adverse effect on us due to legal costs, impacts on business operations, diversion of management resources, negative publicity, and other factors. See “Item 3-Legal Proceedings-FTC Administrative Proceeding against HomeAdvisor.”
We are also generally sensitive to the adoption of new tax laws. The European Commission and several European countries have recently adopted (or intend to adopt) proposals that would change various aspects of the current tax framework under which our European businesses are taxed, including proposals to change or impose new types of non-income taxes (including digital services taxes based on a percentage of revenue). For example, we are subject to and pay the Digital Services Tax in the United Kingdom, France, and Italy. Certain of our businesses are subject to digital services taxes in one or more of the jurisdictions listed above and similar proposed tax laws could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
As a provider of products and services with a membership-based element, we are also sensitive to the adoption of laws and regulations affecting the ability of our businesses to periodically charge for recurring membership or subscription payments. For example, many U.S. states have considered enacting legislation that could impact the ability of our businesses to efficiently process auto-renewal payments for, as well as offer promotional or differentiated pricing. The adoption of any law that adversely affects revenue from recurring membership or subscription payments could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We are particularly sensitive to laws and regulations related to the adoption and interpretation of worker classification laws, specifically, laws that could effectively require us to change our classification of certain of our service professional from independent contractors to employees. See “Item 1A-Risk Factors-Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business and Industry-There may be adverse tax, legal and other consequences if the contractor classification or employment status of the service professionals who use our platform is challenged.”
Human Capital Management
As of December 31, 2022, we employed approximately 4,600 employees worldwide, the substantial majority of which provided services to our brands and businesses located in the United States. From time to time, we also retain consultants and independent contractors. 
Talent and Development
The development, attraction and retention of employees is critical to our success. We strive to provide an atmosphere that fosters teamwork and growth. We continue to invest in a more productive, engaged, diverse and inclusive workforce. To support the advancement of our employees, we offer training and development programs and encourage advancement from within. In 2020, we launched a learning management system for broader facilitation of training resources. We leverage both formal and informal programs designed to identify, foster, and retain top talent. We believe that our culture enables us to create, develop and fully leverage the strengths of our workforce to exceed consumer expectations and meet our growth objectives. We also place a high value on inclusion, engaging employees in our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Council, or DEI, which is staffed by employees with diverse backgrounds, experiences and/or characteristics who share a common interest in professional development, improving corporate culture and delivering sustained business results. Recent DEI initiatives include unconscious bias training, a women in leadership program, and employee resources groups to promote community and inclusion.
Total Rewards and Benefits
As part of our compensation philosophy, we believe that we must offer and maintain market competitive total rewards programs for our employees in order to attract and retain superior talent. These programs include base wages and incentives in support of our pay for performance culture, as well as health, welfare, and retirement benefits, vision, dental, life, prescription, and long-term disability insurance plans. We also provide employee paid supplemental life and accident insurance plans. To help employees cover medical expenses pre-tax, we offer employees a Flexible Spending Account. We also focus many programs on employee wellness and have implemented solutions including mental health support access, telemedicine, meditation, and fitness programs. We also offer our US-based full-time employees a 401(k) retirement plan with a Company match.
Community
Table of Contents

We encourage our employees to become involved in their communities by providing full-time employees with paid-time off each year to volunteer in local community-based programs. 
COVID Response
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we quickly implemented safety and health standards and protocols for our employees to ensure a safe work environment. Employees in our offices have been working remotely since March 2020 and we have moved our sales employees to work fully remotely. Our corporate employees near our Denver, Colorado, New York City and Indianapolis, Indiana offices returned to the office in mid-2022 and continued to adhere to the recommended protocols of the Centers for Disease Control or local regulations. We have offered paid leave for COVID-related illness that meet local requirements.
Code of Business Conduct and Ethics
Our US-based employees are required to annually certify to their familiarity and compliance with our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. We also maintain an ethics hotline that is available to all of our employees to report (anonymously, if desired) any general ethics-related matter of concern. Communications to this hotline (which is facilitated by an independent third party) are routed to appropriate functions (whether Human Resources or Legal) for investigation and resolution. In addition, as required by law, we also maintain a hotline for employees to anonymously report complaints or concerns related to accounting and auditing matters.
Additional Information
Company Website and Public Filings
We maintain a website at www.angi.com. Neither the information on this website, nor the information on the websites of any of our brands and businesses, is incorporated by reference into this annual report, or into any other filings with, or into any other information furnished or submitted to, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).
We also make available, free of charge through our website, our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K (including related amendments) as soon as reasonably practicable after they have been electronically filed with (or furnished to) the SEC. These reports (including related amendments) are also available at the SEC’s website, www.sec.gov.
Code of Business Conduct and Ethics
Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics applies to all of our employees (including our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer) and directors and is posted on the Investor Relations section of our website at ir.angi.com under the heading “Code of Ethics.” This code complies with Item 406 of SEC Regulation S-K and the rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC. Any changes to this code that affect the provisions required by Item 406 of Regulation S-K (and any waivers of such provisions for our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer, and directors) will also be disclosed on our website.
RELATIONSHIP WITH IAC
Equity Ownership and Vote
We have two classes of capital stock outstanding, Class A common stock and Class B common stock, with one vote and ten votes per share, respectively.

Table of Contents

Investor Rights Agreement
Under the investor rights agreement, IAC has certain registration, preemptive and governance rights related to us and the shares of our capital stock it holds. The investor rights agreement also provides certain governance rights for the benefit of stockholders other than IAC.
Services Agreement
The services agreement currently governs services that IAC has agreed to provide to us through September 29, 2021, with automatic renewal for successive one-year terms, subject to IAC’s continued ownership of a majority of the total combined voting power of our voting stock and any subsequent extension(s) or truncation(s) agreed to by us and IAC. The services agreement has been renewed through September 29, 2023. Services currently provided to us by IAC pursuant this agreement include: (i) assistance with certain legal, M&A, finance, risk management, internal audit and treasury functions, health and welfare benefits, information security services and insurance and tax affairs, including assistance with certain public company and unclaimed property reporting obligations and (ii) accounting, investor relations, and tax compliance services. The scope, nature and extent of services may be changed from time to time as we and IAC may agree.
Tax Sharing Agreement
The tax sharing agreement governs our and IAC’s rights, responsibilities and obligations with respect to tax liabilities and benefits, entitlements to refunds, preparation of tax returns, tax contests and other tax matters regarding U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income taxes. Under the tax sharing agreement, we are generally responsible and required to indemnify IAC for: (i) all taxes imposed with respect to any consolidated, combined or unitary tax return of IAC or its subsidiaries that includes us or any of our subsidiaries (to the extent attributable to us or any of our subsidiaries, as determined under the tax sharing agreement) and (ii) all taxes imposed with respect to any consolidated, combined, unitary or separate tax returns of us or our subsidiaries.
Employee Matters Agreement
The employee matters agreement addresses certain compensation and benefit issues related to the allocation of liabilities associated with: (i) employment or termination of employment; (ii) employee benefit plans and (iii) equity awards. Under the employee matters agreement, our employees participate in IAC’s U.S. health and welfare plans, 401(k) plan and flexible benefits plan and we reimburse IAC for the costs of such participation. In the event IAC no longer retains shares representing at least 80% of the aggregate voting power of shares entitled to vote in the election of our board of directors, we will no longer participate in IAC’s employee benefit plans, but will establish our own employee benefit plans that will be substantially similar to the plans sponsored by IAC.
In addition, under the employee matters agreement, we are required to reimburse IAC for the cost of any IAC equity awards held by our current and former employees, with IAC having the ability to elect to receive payment either in cash or shares of our Class B common stock.

To the extent that shares of IAC common stock are issued in settlement of these awards, we are obligated to reimburse IAC for the cost of those shares by issuing shares of our Class A common stock in the case of stock appreciation rights granted prior to the closing of the Combination and shares of our Class B common stock in the case of equity awards denominated in shares of our subsidiaries.
Lastly, pursuant to the employee matters agreement, in the event of a distribution of Angi Inc. capital stock to IAC stockholders in a transaction intended to qualify as tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Compensation and Human Resources Committee of the IAC board of directors has the exclusive authority to determine the treatment of outstanding IAC equity awards. Such authority includes (but is not limited to) the ability to convert all or part of IAC equity awards outstanding immediately prior to the distribution into equity awards denominated in shares of our Class A Common Stock, which we would be obligated to assume and which would be dilutive to our stockholders.
