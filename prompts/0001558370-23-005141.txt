Overview
We are a clinical stage global biopharmaceutical company aiming to develop and deliver novel oral therapeutics to treat a wide range of chronic diseases with unmet medical needs. Our differentiated technology platform leverages structure-based drug discovery and computational chemistry expertise and enables us to develop oral small molecule therapeutics for the treatment of various diseases including those impacting the metabolic, cardiovascular, and pulmonary systems. In February 2023, we completed our Initial Public Offering (“IPO”) for net proceeds of $166.7 million, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.
Our initial focus is on G-protein-coupled receptors (“GPCRs”) as a therapeutic target class. GPCRs regulate numerous diverse physiological and pathological processes, and approximately one in every three marketed medicines targets GPCR-associated pathways. By leveraging our world-class GPCR know-how, we aim to design differentiated small molecule therapies to overcome the limitations of biologics and peptide therapies targeting this family of receptors. We are developing GSBR-1290, our oral small molecule product candidate targeting the validated glucagon-like-peptide-1 receptor (“GLP-1R”) for the treatment of type-2 diabetes mellitus (“T2DM”) and obesity. We completed our Phase 1 single ascending dose (“SAD”) study of GSBR-1290 in September 2022. GSBR-1290 was generally well tolerated and demonstrated dose-dependent pharmacokinetics (“PK”) and pharmacological (“PD”) activity. We submitted an Investigational New Drug application (“IND”) to the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) to support initiation of a Phase 1b study in T2DM and obesity and received FDA allowance in September 2022. We initiated the Phase 1b multiple ascending dose (“MAD”) study in January 2023 and completed dosing in healthy overweight subjects

in March 2023. We plan to submit a protocol amendment to the FDA to transition to a Phase 2a proof-of-concept study in T2DM and obesity with the expected initiation in the second half of 2023. We expect to report topline data for the Phase 1b study and Phase 2a study in the second half of 2023. Beyond GSBR-1290, we are developing next generation GLP-1R candidates, including dual GLP-1R/GIPR agonists, each designed with customized properties to achieve additional benefit. In September 2022, we completed a Phase 1 SAD and MAD study evaluating ANPA-0073, our small molecule product candidate targeting the apelin receptor (“APJR”) in which it was generally well tolerated in healthy human volunteers. ANPA-0073 is in development for the treatment of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (“IPF”) and pulmonary arterial hypertension (“PAH”). We expect to conduct additional preclinical studies to be followed by a Phase 1 formulation bridging PK study in Australia. Moreover, we are advancing a differentiated lysophosphatidic acid 1 receptor (“LPA1R”) antagonist for the treatment of IPF. We selected a development candidate in January 2023 and expect to initiate a first-in-human study in 2024.
A number of GPCR properties contribute to its importance as a drug target class, including interaction with a diverse set of signaling molecules, involvement in a vast array of physiological and pathological processes, and cell surface expression that enables extracellular drug binding. As such, GPCRs have emerged as the largest family of targets for approved drugs, have provided significant benefit to patients and have achieved blockbuster sales in a number of therapeutic indications, including diabetes (Victoza), bipolar disorders (Abilify, Seroquel), asthma (Singulair), hypertension (Diovan, Lopressor), and cardiovascular disease (Plavix). Despite this success, there remain a number of challenges to continued innovation in this target class, including (i) low expression levels on cell surfaces, (ii) the complexity of the multi-subunit peptide GPCR receptor, (iii) difficulties in obtaining relevant crystal structures as a basis for drug design, and (iv) non-specific signaling through multiple intracellular signaling pathways, a concept known as non-biased signaling, which can limit activity and increase side effects. We have developed a platform designed to address these key challenges, enabling us to discover small molecule drugs to effectively target GPCRs. Further, our platform has been designed to develop novel drugs against other targets where traditional drug discovery methods have not been adequate.
Our next generation structure-based drug discovery platform is based on techniques that our founders have evolved for over 25 years, which enables us to generate small molecule product candidates designed to overcome the historical limitations of GPCR drug development. As shown below, we believe our insights and capability to visualize the three-dimensional protein structures of the target and the ligands combined with the computational chemistry capabilities of our co-founder and strategic partner, Schrödinger, give us significant competitive advantages in highly efficient and rational drug design. We design our novel compounds by combining our knowledge of GPCR structures together with advanced physics-based computational methods, which we believe allows us to predict the binding affinity of molecules to the target site with a high degree of accuracy.

​
We believe the strengths of our platform position us to develop oral small molecule drugs that can deliver biologic-like activity and specificity. Oral small molecules can address many of the key limitations of biologic and peptide drugs, thereby significantly improving patient access. We believe this is particularly important for the most prevalent chronic diseases including those involving the metabolic, cardiovascular, and pulmonary systems.
Our lead product candidate, GSBR-1290, is an oral and biased small molecule agonist of GLP-1R, a validated GPCR drug target for T2DM and obesity. There are currently five marketed peptide molecules that target GLP-1R; collectively, these peptide therapies generated worldwide sales of $13.2 billion in 2020. However, there are currently no approved oral small molecule therapies targeting GLP-1R. In non-human primate (“NHP”), studies, GSBR-1290 demonstrated glucose-dependent insulin secretion and suppressed food intake, resulting in weight reduction. Given these findings and other compelling preclinical data, we completed a Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers for GSBR-1290 in September 2022. GSBR-1290 was generally well tolerated and demonstrated dose-dependent PK and PD related activity. We submitted an IND to the FDA to support initiation of a Phase 1b study in T2DM and obesity and received FDA allowance in September 2022. We initiated the Phase 1b MAD study in January 2023 and completed dosing in healthy overweight subjects in March 2023. We plan to submit a protocol amendment to the FDA to transition to a Phase 2a proof-of-concept study in T2DM and obesity with the expected initiation in the second half of 2023. We expect to report topline data for the Phase 1b study and Phase 2a study in the second half of 2023. Beyond GSBR-1290, we are developing next generation GLP-1R candidates, including dual GLP-1R/GIPR agonists, each designed with customized properties to achieve additional benefit.
We are also developing oral small molecule therapeutics targeting other GPCRs for the treatment of pulmonary and cardiovascular diseases. Specifically, we are advancing ANPA-0073, our biased agonist, targeting APJR, a GPCR that has been implicated in IPF and PAH. In September 2022, we completed a Phase 1 SAD and MAD study evaluating ANPA-0073 in healthy human volunteers, in which it was generally well tolerated. Additionally, we are developing an antagonist that targets LPA1R, a GPCR implicated in responses to tissue injury and pro-fibrotic processes. We have demonstrated substantial anti-fibrotic activity of our LPA1R antagonists in mouse models of fibrotic lung disease and we selected a development candidate (LTSE-2578) in January 2023 and expect to initiate a first-in-human study in 2024.
At Basecamp Bio Inc. (“Basecamp Bio”), our wholly owned subsidiary dedicated to fueling our pipeline and pursuing drug discovery partnerships, we leverage the power of cryo-electron microscopy (“cryo-EM”) machine learning and X-ray crystallography, as the basis for our molecular designs. We employ state-of-the-

drugs targeting chronic diseases with unmet medical need and commercial potential. Our initial focus is in areas of metabolic, cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases.
The following table summarizes key information on our current product candidates:

Metabolic
We are initially advancing our GLP-1R franchise as a treatment for T2DM and obesity, conditions affecting approximately 537 million and 764 million people worldwide, respectively. We believe our GLP-1R programs have demonstrated qualities that offer the potential to differentiate them versus current approved and in development programs.

● | GSBR-1290. GSBR-1290 is a biased GLP-1R agonist which has demonstrated dose-dependent activation of the G-protein pathway. GSBR-1290 has also demonstrated glucose-dependent insulin secretion and suppressed food intake with similar activity to an approved injectable peptide GLP-1R agonist in preclinical models.

● | Next generation. Our next generation small molecule program is focused on GLP-1R/GIPR modulation with the potential for enhanced metabolic control.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pulmonary and Cardiovascular
Our APJR agonist program is being evaluated for IPF and PAH. In another program, we are evaluating LTSE-2578 for IPF.
Our APJR product candidate, ANPA-0073, is a G-protein biased APJR agonist for which we completed a Phase 1 SAD and MAD study, in which it was generally well tolerated as a single dose from 2mg to 600 mg, and at doses from 75 mg to 500 mg once daily dosing for seven days, with no serious adverse events (“SAEs”) reported.
GPCRs as a Therapeutic Target Family
GPCRs form the largest human membrane protein family, consisting of approximately 800 identified members as illustrated below. GPCRs are involved in several vital physiological functions, such as immune system 

10



regulation and inflammation, autonomic nervous system transmission, behavioral and mood regulation, sensory transmission, and maintenance of homeostasis, making them important targets for numerous therapeutics. To date, there are approximately 475 drugs on the market acting at over 100 unique GPCRs. Additionally, more than 220 GPCRs have not yet been explored as clinical targets, hence representing broad untapped therapeutic potential for addressing global healthcare needs.
Phylogenetic tree of GPCR targets
GPCR targeting drugs have successfully delivered significant patient benefit resulting in large market opportunities in many therapeutic areas. Examples include liraglutide (Victoza for T2DM), aripiprazole (Abilify for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and depression), montelukast (Singulair for asthma), valsartan (Diovan for hypertension), metoprolol (Lopressor for hypertension, angina, and myocardial infarction), and clopidogrel (Plavix for myocardial infarction and stroke). GPCR related drugs are the largest drug class accounting for approximately 27% of global pharmaceutical sales with estimated aggregate sales of $890 billion between 2011 and 2015.
GPCRs are proteins that span the entire width of cell membranes. Their primary function is to recognize extracellular substances, primarily ligands, and transmit signals across the cell membrane to the inside of the cell.

11



Schematic of a GPCR
As shown above, the binding of extracellular ligands to GPCRs elicits conformational changes that impact the intracellular side of the receptor, resulting in the formation of a GPCR complex with signal transducers, particularly G-proteins. These signal transducers go on to interact with second messengers, ultimately either stimulating or inhibiting certain cellular processes.
GPCRs signal not only through G-proteins, but also through β-arrestins and other non-G-protein transducers. β-arrestins play an essential role in many physiological and pathological processes, and are involved in the desensitization, internalization, sequestration, and trafficking of GPCRs. Certain GPCR ligands are capable of simultaneously activating both G-protein and non-G-protein mediated signaling pathways, which can lead to a variety of physiologic as well as pathologic effects.
Challenges of GPCR Therapeutic Discovery and Development
Despite tremendous advancements in structure-based drug design and development, GPCR drug discovery and development remains challenging.

● | Similarity between the binding sites of GPCRs and related receptors can cause off-target toxicities: All GPCRs have the same overall three-dimensional architecture but the specific endogenous binding site is unique due to the placement of amino acid side chains shaping the binding site. For instance, the early sphingosine-1-phosphate 1 receptor (“S1P1R”) agonist Gilenya led to the development of a new class of therapy for the treatment of multiple sclerosis, but had exhibited bradycardia as a side effect due in part to sphingosine-1-phosphate 3 receptor (“S1P3R”) activity, a very closely related S1P1 receptor subtype. The next generation S1P1R agonist Zeposia was designed using structural information by Receptos, Inc. to remove the S1P3 and other activities and therefore did not have the same side effect profile as Gilenya.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | GPCRs are involved in diverse downstream signaling pathways which can result in side effects: GPCRs interact with a range of molecules, including G-protein and non-G-protein transducers including β-arrestin. Signaling pathway selectivity results from agonist-induced specific receptor conformation and when targeting GPCRs involved in multiple signaling pathways, both therapeutic benefits and side effect issues may arise.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

12




● | Expression levels of GPCRs are low and create significant hurdles to structural and PD characterization: Recombinant protein expression of GPCRs remains extremely challenging. Expression levels of GPCRs are low and improvement of expression level continues to be mainly empirical and resource-consuming. GPCRs are complex membrane proteins that require a stable membrane environment throughout the purification process to avoid destabilization and aggregation. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | GPCR structural visualization is complex making GPCR structure-based drug discovery challenging: Structure-based drug design requires rapid iterations of GPCR structures in complex with specific new ligands to determine their effects on conformation. This is well established through robust crystallography platforms for soluble drug targets. Cryo-EM has helped accelerate the membrane protein field, but the methods still require substantial expertise and execution.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Drug discovery approaches targeting GPCRs have evolved from traditional approaches including high throughput screening to rational design for enhanced activity, tailor-made signaling response, and improved selectivity, which leads to improved safety and tolerability profiles.
Our Platform and Approach
Our platform is based on techniques that our founders have been evolving for over 25 years, which have enabled them to deliver multiple marketed medicines. Our approach enables us to generate small molecule product candidates that are designed to overcome the historical limitations of GPCR drug development.
Our insights and capabilities enable us to visualize the three-dimensional protein structures of the target and the ligands. We believe this visualization combined with the computational chemistry capabilities of Schrödinger gives us significant competitive advantages in highly efficient and rational drug design. We design our novel compounds by combining our knowledge of GPCR structures together with advanced physics-based computational methods, which we believe allows us to predict the binding affinity of molecules to the target site with a high degree of accuracy.
As shown below, our technology platform allows us to determine feasibility, optimize the design of, and efficiently generate families of potent and highly selective small molecule candidates.

Oral small molecules have the potential to address the key limitations of biologic and peptide drugs, such as high cost and patient inconvenience, thereby significantly improving patient access. We believe this is particularly important for the most prevalent chronic diseases including those involving the endocrine, cardiovascular, and pulmonary systems. We believe the strengths of our technology platform will enable us to develop oral small molecule drugs that can deliver biologic-like activity and specificity.
Strategic GPCR Target Prioritization
We start with target prioritization by focusing on validated GPCR targets that do not have attractive small molecule solutions. We then prioritize by assessing the feasibility of a small molecule solution for these targets and market opportunities of their respective target indication.
Expertise in GPCR Structure-Based Drug Discovery
GPCRs are difficult to characterize structurally because they are composed of seven transmembrane domains, have low expression, and are unstable outside of the cell membrane environment. While structure-based approaches have been utilized for decades in soluble protein drug discovery, recent breakthrough advancements in computational chemistry, artificial intelligence, machine learning and electron microscopy are redefining the field of GPCR structure-based drug discovery.
Visualization of GPCR Structure and binding site interactions
As shown above, our structure-based technology platform combines direct visualization of protein receptor binding interactions with advanced simulation of molecular motion and signal transduction. Site 1 is considered to be the orthosteric or primary binding site for receptor activation. Site 2 is on the surface of the receptor, often referred to as the allosteric site and may potentially regulate receptor activation signaling. By visualizing and analyzing how different ligands bind to a particular target and specific sites and affect their conformational dynamics, we believe we are able to efficiently convert biologics and peptides into more accessible, patient-accommodating oral small molecules. In addition, we can enhance the pharmaceutic properties of our small molecules with the aim to elicit the desired function while maintaining superior pharmaceutical properties.

14



Non-biased vs biased GPCR agonists
Additionally, GPCR signaling can follow several pathways and molecules can be designed such that their pharmacology is selected to create “biased signaling” as illustrated above. GPCRs are known to signal not only through G-proteins, but also through β-arrestins, intracellular proteins that “arrest” the signal and stop the receptor from becoming over-stimulated through a receptor internalization mechanism. Using the three-dimensional structures of GPCRs and selection methods, we can potentially design highly selective “biased” molecules that preferentially activate G-protein and not β-arrestin pathways, which could lead to enhanced clinical activity as well as an improved safety profile due to lower dosage requirements.
GPCR Experience
Robust and Integrated Medicinal Chemistry to Generate and Optimize Hits on GPCR Targets
We have extensive medicinal chemistry know-how on the discovery and development of novel molecules that target GPCRs. When coupled with our deep understanding of GPCR biology, we have the potential to design appropriate chemotypes for each GPCR function as illustrated below.

Partnership with Schrödinger Leveraging its Cutting-Edge Computational Chemistry Capability
We have a collaboration with Schrödinger on the iteration and optimization of GPCR lead compounds using various next-generation physics-based computational technologies. Schrödinger is a scientific leader in chemical simulation, accurate physics-based methods, which includes among many technologies, Free Energy Perturbation (“FEP”) and in silico drug discovery. Its computational platforms integrate predictive physics-based methods with machine learning to evaluate billions of compounds in silico, achieving experimental accuracy on properties such as binding affinity and solubility. Through this iterative process, we can accelerate evaluation and optimization of molecules in silico ahead of synthesis and assay, and then further optimize them through additional cycles of computation analysis.

As shown above, our collaboration with Schrödinger in our computational and chemistry module enables us to accelerate our lead optimization drug discovery process and reduce development costs. In our partnership with Schrödinger on GPCR drug discovery, we retain the full product rights on the compounds under development.
Safety Assays
We have proactively used cell and animal-based safety assays to better screen out unwanted side effects, such as liver, cardiovascular and central nervous system toxicity at the initial stages of lead optimization, and we have designed molecules to help minimize safety risks at every step. Our in-depth understanding of GPCR signaling pathway provide us insights to design biased molecules when necessary to mitigate any unwanted liabilities while maintaining the desired activities.

In addition to our robust iterative structure-based drug discovery platform shown above, Basecamp Bio is optimizing proprietary in-house drug discovery tools including DNA-Encoded Library technology and Affinity Mass Spectrometry technology to enable the synthesis and screening of vast numbers of small molecule product candidates at a scale that is not possible to achieve by traditional methods.
Our Lead GPCR Programs
By leveraging our unique platform capabilities, we are building a pipeline of oral small molecule product candidates designed to have patient impact and broad commercial opportunity in therapeutic areas traditionally dominated by biologics and peptide medicines. We are initially focusing on chronic metabolic, cardiovascular, and pulmonary diseases with unmet medical need.
Our GLP-1R Focused Franchise for Metabolic Disorders
To unlock the full potential of our drug discovery platform across a broad range of metabolic indications, we intend to build out our franchise approach for GLP-1R. Our franchise approach involves developing next generation GLP-1R candidates, with each exhibiting customized properties to achieve additional benefit. Our lead GLP-1R product candidate, GSBR-1290, has the potential to be a differentiated treatment for T2DM and obesity based on preclinical data.
GSBR-1290 is an oral and biased agonist of the GLP-1R, a validated GPCR drug target involved in a variety of metabolic conditions. We completed a Phase 1 SAD study for GSBR-1290 in healthy volunteers in September 2022. We initiated the Phase 1b MAD study in January 2023 and completed dosing in healthy overweight subjects in March 2023. We plan to submit a protocol amendment to the FDA to transition to a Phase 2a proof-of-concept study in T2DM and obesity with the expected initiation in the second half of 2023. Based on our preclinical data, we believe that GSBR-1290 and our next-generation product candidates have the potential to have highly differentiated profiles versus currently approved therapies and those in development.

Diabetes Disease Background
Diabetes mellitus (“DM”) is an endocrine related disorder of glucose regulation with subsequent hyperglycemia, or high blood sugar, which develops following pancreatic β-cell destruction or dysfunction resulting in severe loss of insulin production, also known as type 1 diabetes, or β-cell dysfunction and loss of insulin sensitivity, also known as T2DM. T2DM is more common in adults and accounts for around 90% of all diabetes cases. In T2DM, the loss of insulin sensitivity is often preceded by being overweight or obese, and manifests along with hypertension and dyslipidemia. Regardless of etiology, once hyperglycemia develops, patients with diabetes share a common disease course characterized by atherosclerotic diseases such as coronary heart disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease and/or, microvascular diseases such as nephropathy, retinopathy, and neuropathy. Additionally, hyperglycemia is associated with metabolic dysfunction, chronic inflammation, and an increase in infections.
According to the 2021 International Diabetes Federation Diabetes Atlas, more than one in ten adults are now living with diabetes globally. The estimated prevalence of diabetes in adults aged 20 to 79 years has more than tripled since 2000, from an estimated 151 million (4.6% of the global population in this age group at the time) to 537 million (10.5%) today. If trends continue, the number will jump to a staggering 783 million (12.2%) by 2045. The number of adults with diabetes in the United States reached 32.2 million in 2021, while China has the largest numbers of adults with diabetes at 140.9 million. In 2021, approximately 6.7 million adults aged 20 to 79 are estimated to have died as a result of diabetes or its complications. According to American Diabetes Association (“ADA”), the total estimated cost of diagnosed diabetes in the United States increased to $327 billion in 2017, which included $237 billion in direct medical costs and $90 billion in reduced productivity.
In newly diagnosed T2DM patients, treatment is focused on improving modifiable risk factors such as obesity, low physical activity and high caloric diet through patient education that includes instruction on maintaining a healthy lifestyle including nutritional counseling, avoiding excessive calories and rapidly absorbed carbohydrates, and physical exercise. Patients who are unable to achieve glycemic control through weight loss and/or lifestyle modifications should be started on single or combination glucose-lowering medications to lower their glycemic burden and reduce the risk of cardiovascular and other complications.
Obesity Disease Background
Obesity, defined as a body mass index (“BMI”) of > 30 kg/m2, is a major independent risk factor for T2DM. Approximately 90% of T2DM patients are considered either overweight with a BMI between 25.0 kg/m2 and 29.9 kg/m2, or obese with a BMI of 30 kg/m2 or greater. Worldwide obesity has nearly tripled between 1975 and 2016. As of 2020, 1.9 billion (39%) adults were overweight, including over 764 million (15%) adults who were obese. In men, being slightly overweight increased diabetes risk seven-fold and in women, being slightly overweight increased diabetes risk twelve-fold. Being obese increased the risk to 60-fold.
Obesity affects nearly one third of all adults in the United States and is associated with a range of comorbidities, such as T2DM, cardiovascular disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and cancer. Importantly, even modest weight reduction, on the order of five to ten percent, can significantly reduce comorbidities and improve health-related outcomes and has been recently recommended by the major scientific societies (European Association of the Study of Diabetes (“EASD”) and ADA). Obesity therefore represents an immense commercial opportunity with very few approved therapies on the market. The GLP-1R agonist semaglutide, approved for use in T2DM, has also been approved for weight management for which it is marketed under the brand name Wegovy, which is estimated to reach peak sales of $6.7 billion in 2026.
Relationship Between T2DM and Obesity
T2DM and obesity are not independent conditions, as the majority of patients with T2DM are obese. Observed increases in the prevalence of T2DM are related to the increasing prevalence of obesity and multiple mechanisms have been proposed through which they may be linked pathophysiologically. Upper 

19



body and visceral fat are associated with T2DM, metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease. Obesity is a major contributor to poor metabolic control in patients with T2DM.
Increasingly, weight reduction is seen as an important goal of therapy for patients with T2DM. Weight loss in the first year of treatment of T2DM has been associated with an increase in life expectancy. According to the ADA Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes—2022, management of obesity is an important factor in the treatment of diabetes since even a small degree of weight loss can improve control of blood sugar levels, resulting in a decreased need for glucose-lowering medications. Given this information, a therapy that can both lower blood glucose and help with weight management in T2DM could have near-term benefits in glycemic control and longer-term benefits in increased insulin sensitivity and reduction of cardiovascular risk.
Current Treatments for T2DM
First-line treatment for patients with T2DM involves lifestyle modifications and metformin. If glycemic control remains inadequate, an additional oral glucose lowering medication should be added. Options include sodium-glucose transport protein 2 inhibitors, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, and GLP-1R agonists. Current treatment algorithms suggest that GLP-1R agonists should be preferentially used after metformin failure in patients who are at high risk for, or who have established, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Several scientific societies, including the EASD and ADA, recommend GLP-1R agonists as first line therapy in patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or in those at high risk of developing disease. According to Global Data, Eli Lilly and Company (“Eli Lilly”), Novo Nordisk, Merck and Sanofi S.A. (“Sanofi”), have captured significant market share in the approximately $46.6 billion market for glucose-lowering agents in 2021, which is projected to grow to $60.5 billion by 2027 as depicted below.

Overview of GLP-1R Signaling Pathway and Target Biology
GLP-1 is an incretin peptide secreted in the intestinal tract in response to food intake. GLP-1 stimulates insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells and inhibits glucagon secretion from pancreatic α-cells. GLP-1 receptors are located on various cell and tissue types including pancreatic β-cells, central and peripheral neurons, cells of the intestinal tract, vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells, coronary arteries, and the sino-atrial node of the heart. Through actions at these receptors, GLP-1 and GLP-1R agonists have demonstrated widespread therapeutic effects in patients with diabetes, including stimulating insulin secretion and lowering blood glucose levels, slowing gastric emptying, reducing caloric intake, promoting weight loss, improving lipoprotein metabolism, lowering systolic blood pressure, improving complications from arteriosclerotic cardiovascular diseases, and reducing cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality, as illustrated below.

20



GLP-1R pathway and target biology
Endogenous GLP-1 is rapidly degraded in vivo by DPP-4, with a half-life of one to two minutes. The development of GLP-1R agonists for the treatment of diabetes and obesity has involved modifications to the GLP-1 peptide and/or conjugation to carrier compounds or matrices that delay degradation after subcutaneous administration.
The five marketed GLP-1R agonists are synthetic peptides and include liraglutide and semaglutide marketed by Novo Nordisk; dulaglutide marketed by Eli Lilly; exenatide marketed primarily by AstraZeneca plc (“AstraZeneca”); and lixisenatide marketed by Sanofi. According to Global Data, these five GLP-1R peptides approved for T2DM and/or obesity collectively generated approximately $13.2 billion in worldwide sales in 2020, which is projected to reach $36.4 billion by 2026.
Rybelsus is an oral formulation of semaglutide co-formulated with sodium N-8-(2-hydroxybenzoyl) amino caprylate to limit degradation and improve oral absorption. To date, there are no approved oral small molecule therapies targeting this pathway.
Common side effects of GLP-1R agonists include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, which are most pronounced when starting therapy or increasing the dose. Generally, these effects correlate with times of maximum drug concentrations and ameliorate with continued therapy. Typically, slow up-titration to the desired dose can mitigate these side effects. However, once-weekly injectable GLP-1R agonists typically require a long titration period to achieve an optimal dose, potentially delaying therapeutic benefit. Once-daily therapy with an oral small molecule may provide flexibility in titration and allow a combined approach with other oral therapies.
The Unmet Medical Need for Improved GLP-1R Therapeutics in Diabetes and Obesity
GLP-1R agonists provide multiple beneficial effects in patients with T2DM, including excellent glycemic control with low risk of hypoglycemia, weight loss and protection against cardiovascular and renal complications. However, we believe approved GLP-1R agonists have shortcomings in terms of patient convenience, ease of dosing, and cost.
Injectable peptide GLP-1R agonist peptides require patients to self-inject, require inconvenient refrigerated storage and are costly. In addition, long acting GLP-1R agonists typically require long titration periods to 

21



reach an optimal dose for disease management in order to avoid treatment-associated gastrointestinal side effects.
Oral semaglutide (Rybelsus), the first approved oral GLP-1R peptide agonist, provides an option for patients who are unable or unwilling to self-administer. However, Rybelsus requires a stringent dosing protocol and dosing with up to four ounces of water with no food or beverage within 30 minutes. Additionally, the product’s absorption enhancer may affect the absorption of other concomitantly administered oral medications.
We believe there is an unmet medical need for orally administered GLP-1R agonists that meet or exceed efficacy and safety parameters of available drugs with less stringent preparation requirements. Such existing constraints include restrictive food or fluid dosing protocols, refrigeration, maintenance of effective concentrations throughout the dosing interval, without interfering with the absorption of concomitant medications and that offer the potential for combination products with other glucose lowering agents or other commonly co-administered therapies.
In addition to glycemic control, weight management is increasingly viewed as important to the management of T2DM. Injectable GLP-1R agonists, liraglutide and semaglutide result in weight loss at doses approved for treatment of T2DM, while higher doses of each drug, indicated for chronic weight management, result in greater weight loss. At an appropriate dose, an oral GLP-1R agonist may play a role in managing both blood glucose and weight.
Our Solution: Small Molecule GLP-1R Agonist
GLP-1, along with GIPR, comprise the incretin family, peptide hormones secreted into the blood by enteroendocrine cells in the gut, which play a role in glycemic control. We are taking a franchise approach to our GLP-1R programs by developing next generation GLP-1 agonists and potential GIPR modulators. Leveraging the depth of our GLP-1R/GIPR structure platform, proprietary compound library and deep biology and disease insights, we are advancing multiple generations of structurally distinct GLP-1R agonist molecules through lead optimization. Each molecule is designed to have a different tissue penetration profile and other incretin activities in order to maximize the value and/or realize the full potential offered by our in-house platform.
GSBR-1290
We are developing GSBR-1290, a biased orally-available small molecule GLP-1R agonist, initially as a treatment for T2DM and obesity. Due to its significant preclinical activity and oral availability, we believe that GSBR-1290 has the potential to be a differentiated treatment with no restrictions on diet or concomitant therapies.

22



GSBR-1290 analog bound GLP-1R cryo-EM structure
GSBR-1290 was designed through our internal structure-based drug discovery platform. As shown above, multiple small molecules bound to GLP-1R structures have been generated to guide iterative chemistry design efforts. GSBR-1290 is also designed to be a biased GPCR agonist, which only activates the G-protein pathway without β-arrestin signaling at therapeutic doses, thereby avoiding receptor internalization and de-sensitization. In an intravenous glucose tolerance test (“ivGTT”) in NHPs, GSBR-1290 increased glucose-dependent insulin secretion to a similar level achieved by liraglutide, an approved injectable GLP-1R agonist. In a repeat food intake study in NHPs, GSBR-1290 showed a significant decrease in body weight relative to the placebo and surpassed that seen with liraglutide.
Preclinical Data, Pharmacology, and Biomarker Data
In NHP ivGTT studies, glucose was injected five minutes following intravenous administration of either GSBR-1290 (0.05 mg/kg) or liraglutide (0.1 mg/kg). Plasma samples were taken at indicated timepoints to evaluate insulin and glucose levels. GSBR-1290 demonstrated statistically significant decreases in blood glucose concentration via stimulation of insulin secretion in a glucose-dependent manner, similar to liraglutide which was dosed at an equivalent approved human dose.

Data were presented as mean ± standard error of the mean (“SEM”); one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test. *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001 vs vehicle
As shown below, in a seven day repeat oral dosing study in NHPs, GSBR-1290 was evaluated at once-daily oral doses of 2 mg/kg, 6 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg and compared to placebo and liraglutide. Food intake was measured each day over the first six days of the study and reported as an average of these measurements. ivGTT and body weight were performed before dosing and on the sixth day (body weight) or seventh day (ivGTT) of post-dosing. At all doses of GSBR-1290, glucose reduction was shown to be statistically significantly different versus vehicle and comparable to liraglutide. Similarly, all doses increased insulin secretion significantly except at 6 mg/kg dose, which only achieved statistical p value at 0.055 due to a slightly greater data variability. At 6 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, a statistically significant reduction of average food intake measured over the first six days of the study compared to vehicle was observed. At 10 mg/kg of GSBR-1290, the average food intake from Day 1 to Day 6 was only 59% relative to liraglutide group. GSBR-1290 at 6 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg also showed a significant decrease in body weight relative to placebo and surpassed liraglutide, with the highest dose of GSBR-1290 achieving more than eight percent reduction in average body weight versus baseline in one week.
Seven day repeat oral dosing study in non-human primates
Data were presented as mean ± SEM; one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test.
*p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001 vs vehicle
In the description of our clinical trials and preclinical studies below and elsewhere in this Annual Report, n represents the number of participants in a particular group and p or p-values represent the probability that random chance caused the result (e.g., a p-value of 0.01 means that there is a 0.1% probability that the difference between the placebo group and the treatment group is purely due to random chance). A p-value of less than or equal to 0.05 is a commonly used criterion for statistical significance, and may be supportive of a finding of efficacy by regulatory authorities.
GSBR-1290 was demonstrated to be generally well tolerated based on its 28-day GLP toxicology studies with no-observed-adverse-effect level (“NOAEL”) dose at 1000 mg/kg/day in rats. The estimated therapeutic window is more than 1000-fold based in rats based on its 28-day GLP toxicology studies.
In addition, we conducted a preclinical comparison study of GSBR-1290 and PF-06882961, a clinical stage compound in development by Pfizer. Unlike GSBR-1290, PF-06882961 is a partially biased GLP-1R agonist, which could lead to de-sensitization of the receptor in vivo. In an experiment conducted in-house, GSBR-1290 demonstrated comparable in vivo activity to PF-06882961 at a lower exposure. In the acute ivGTT studies, GSBR-1290 achieved similar activity to liraglutide at average concentration around 34 nanomolar (“nM”) (0.05 mg intravenous), comparing to a similar activity achieved by PF-06882961 in an in-house experiment at an 

24



average concentration around 442 nM (0.3 mg intravenous). This suggests that the concentration needed to achieve full activity for GSBR-1290 is at a level much lower than that for PF-06882961. PF-06882961 has been studied in SAD and MAD studies with a maximum dose of 200 mg/BID to achieve maximum HbA1c activity and weight management.
In-house data showed that PF-06882961 was positive in a glutathione trapping assay. GSBR-1290 was inactive in this assay, suggesting reduced risks with long-term use. In addition, GSBR-1290 also did not show activity as a time dependent inhibitor (“TDI”) for cytochrome P450 3A4, or CYP3A4. PF-06882961 was reported as a CYP3A4 TDI, which, if confirmed in clinical trials, suggests the potential for interactions with the 30–50% of marketed drugs metabolized through this pathway.
Phase 1 Healthy Volunteer Trial
In September 2022, we completed a first-in-human Phase 1 SAD study for GSBR-1290 in 48 healthy adult volunteers between the ages of 18 and 55. The objective was to assess drug safety, tolerability and PK. The study enrolled six cohorts of eight participants assigned to receive a single dose of GSBR-1290 or placebo in a 3:1 ratio. Doses ranged from 1 mg to 90 mg across the six cohorts. The fourth cohort received 15 mg administered either under a fed condition, which consisted of a standardized high fat breakfast, and under a fasted condition, in each case to characterize the effect of food on the PK of GSBR-1290. A schema of our Phase 1 SAD study is presented below:
Schema of our GSBR-1290 Phase 1 SAD study in healthy volunteers
Phase 1 PK and PD Data in Healthy Volunteers
In the study, PK parameters of systemic exposure, Cmax and AUC, increased with doses of GSBR-1290 across the dose range from 1 mg to 90 mg GSBR-1290. GSBR-1290 exhibited supra dose proportionality from 1 mg to 30 mg followed by less than dose-proportional from 30 mg to 90 mg.
The 30mg dose AUC provided more than double the effective AUC0-24h required for glycemic control, derived from non-human primate PK/PD data. Food intake (high fat meal) was associated with a ~36% 

25



decrease in the geometric mean Cmax but no significant change in mean AUC value, with 80% relative bioavailability, based on AUC compared with the fasted state.
Phase 1 Safety Data in Healthy Volunteers
GSBR-1290 was shown to be generally well tolerated at all dose levels administrated in this Phase 1 SAD study.
No SAEs and no adverse changes in laboratory tests (including hematology, chemistry and coagulation) were observed. No trial stopping criteria were met. Adverse events (“AEs”) did not result in any early terminations or subject discontinuations from participation in this study.
Treatment-emergent AEs (“TEAEs”) were reported for 32 of 36 participants (89%) following fasted administration of GSBR-1290 and for 7 of 12 participants (58%) following administration of placebo, with a total of 109 TEAEs.
Following administration of GSBR-1290 in the fasted state, most TEAEs were classified as mild (69 of 109, or 63% of all TEAEs) in severity, with 34 TEAEs (31% of all TEAEs) classified as moderate in severity. Six TEAEs (6%) were classified as severe, including four events of vomiting, one event of nausea and one event of catheter site infection. There was an apparent dose-related trend in the severity of TEAEs following single doses of GSBR-1290, with severe TEAEs reported following the 60 mg and 90 mg doses of GSBR-1290, but not following low doses (1 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg). Occurrences in TEAEs of moderate intensity were also higher following higher dose range of GSBR-1290.
The following table shows an overall summary of TEAEs that were reported in the study.


26



Low dose GSBR-1290 includes 1 mg, 10 mg and 15 mg fasted and high dose GSBR-1290 includes 30 mg, 60 mg and 90 mg fasted.
If a participant had multiple occurrences of a TEAE, the participant was presented only once in the Participant count for a given Preferred Term. Occurrences were counted each time.
There was no notable difference in the overall incidence or severity of treatment-related AEs under fasted and fed administration of GSBR-1290 at a dose level of 15 mg. There was a higher incidence of related TEAEs of vomiting and headache following fasted administration (three of six participants, or 50%) compared to fed administration (one of six participants, or 17%).
The most common TEAEs reported in at least four of 36 participants (>10%) who received GSBR-1290 were nausea, headache, vomiting, dehydration, decreased appetite, dizziness, and diarrhea.
Across the various dose levels, there were apparent dose-related trends in the overall incidence of common TEAEs. The incidence of the TEAEs described above was notably higher following fasted administration of the high dose GSBR-1290 treatments (30 mg, 60 mg, 90 mg) than the low dose GSBR-1290 treatments (1 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg) and placebo, with a similar observation in treatment-related AEs of nausea, vomiting, dehydration, and headache of at least moderate severity.
We believe all TEAEs observed during the study are in line with the proposed treatment mechanism and typically derive from impacts on appetite, nausea, and vomiting. There was an apparent increasing trend in heart rate over time in both low (1 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg) and high dose (30 mg, 60 mg, 90 mg) GSBR-1290 groups. This increase appeared to peak at 12 hours post-dose and was notably larger in the high dose GSBR-1290 groups. Increases in heart rate over time were observed in the pooled placebo group but to a much lesser extent.
In summary, GSBR-1290 was shown to be generally well tolerated when administered as a single dose of up to 90 mg. However, there were dose-related trends in the incidence, severity and causality of TEAEs, particularly GI related TEAEs, consistent with what has been previously reported in clinical trials involving the GLP-1RA class of drugs. There were no treatment-related AEs reported in patients who received placebo.
PK parameters of systemic exposure increased with dose of GSBR-1290 across the dose range from 1 mg to 90 mg GSBR-1290.
Non-clinical Safety Pharmacology and Toxicology Studies
A standard battery of nonclinical safety pharmacology studies (central nervous system, cardiovascular and respiratory) has been completed with GSBR-1290 with no findings anticipated to be of clinical relevance. Genotoxicity assessments demonstrated an absence of genotoxicity potential.
In the 4-week and 13-week GLP toxicology study in rats, the NOAEL dose was considered to be 1000 mg/kg/day, the highest dose tested. In the 4-week and 13-week GLP toxicology study in NHPs, GSBR-1290 showed pharmacologically related events such as inappetence and bodyweight loss, which were reversible with sufficient recovery periods. There were no GSBR-1290-related deaths during the course of study and no GSBR-1290-related changes in organ weights, gross and histopathology examinations at the end of the dosing and recovery periods. In the 13-week study, NHPs of both sexes in all dose groups, including in the control group, had minimal to moderate multifocal necrosis/infiltration in the liver. The root cause of these liver abnormalities was not determined, but these findings were considered unrelated to GSBR-1290. The FDA reviewed our 13-week GLP toxicology studies in rats and NHPs and agreed that these liver abnormalities were not considered a new non-clinical safety signal related to GSBR-1290.
In nonclinical animal models, GSBR-1290 demonstrated statistically significant decreases in blood glucose concentration and increases of insulin secretion.

27



We have initiated the 26-week chronic toxicology studies in rats and 39-week studies in NHP and embryo-fetal development studies that we believe will be required by regulatory agencies to continue dosing beyond 13 weeks in Phase 2b.
Phase 1b MAD study
We submitted an IND to the FDA to support initiation of a GSBR 1290 Phase 1b MAD study and received FDA allowance in September 2022. After initiation in January 2023, we enrolled 24 healthy overweight or obese subjects between the ages of 18 and 55. The primary objective is to assess drug safety and tolerability. The secondary objectives are to evaluate PK and PD and determine the starting dose for titration and help define the titration scheme including the dose level and duration of steps. The study enrolled three cohorts of eight participants who received multiple ascending doses of GSBR 1290 or placebo in a 6:2 ratio. We completed dosing of Cohorts 1 through 3 in March 2023. Cohort 1 doses started at 5 mg daily and escalated up to 60 mg weekly over four weeks. Cohort 2 doses started at 10 mg and escalated up to 90 mg daily over four weeks. Cohort 3 doses started at 10 mg for two weeks and escalated to 30 mg for an additional two weeks. A schema of our Phase 1b MAD study is presented below:
Schema of our GSBR-1290 Phase 1b MAD study in healthy overweight/obese subjects
Phase 2a proof-of-concept study
We plan to submit a protocol amendment to initiate a Phase 2a proof-of-concept portion of the study in T2DM and healthy overweight or obese subjects and expect to report initial data in the second half of 2023. The primary objective is to assess safety and tolerability of GSBR 1290 in healthy obese subjects and T2DM subjects. Secondary objectives include assessing changes in body weight, HbA1c and other PD measures in T2DM subjects as well as changes in body weight in healthy overweight or obese subjects. The exploratory objectives are to assess metabolite formation.
The Phase 2a part of the study will enroll at least 69 subjects, which number may increase based upon the final study design. Approximately 54 T2DM subjects will be randomized in three groups to receive GSBR 1290 45 mg or 90 mg or placebo. There will be a four week titration period followed by eight weeks of daily treatment at the target dose.
In addition, at least 15 healthy overweight or obese subjects will receive GSBR 1290 or placebo or, after a four week titration period, GSBR 1290 90 mg daily for two to four weeks followed by 120 mg daily for four to 

28



six weeks, depending on the final study design. We may make additional modifications to the initial study design when we submit our final protocol amendment to the FDA. 
We also anticipate initiating a Phase 2b study in 2024, subject to favorable results in the Phase 2a study. A schema of our Phase 2a proof-of-concept study is presented below:
Schema of our GSBR-1290 Phase 2a proof-of-concept study in T2DM and healthy overweight/obese subjects
Next Generation GLP-1R Program
In our next generation GLP-1R program, we have identified hits for small molecule dual GLP-1R/GIPR modulation and we are planning to select a development candidate in 2024. We believe GLP-1R/GIPR modulation has the potential to provide a differentiated treatment in diabetes and obesity.
Recent third-party clinical data showed tirzepatide, a GLP-1R/GIPR modulator, was superior to semaglutide with respect to glycemic control. The glycated hemoglobin level target of less than 5.7% (normoglycemia) was met in 27 to 46% of the T2DM patients who received tirzepatide compared to 19% of those who received semaglutide. The body weight reduction and gastrointestinal related side effects were similar to the GLP-1R agonists. In addition, many patients who received tirzepatide were noted to have improved biomarkers of insulin sensitivity.
We have obtained both GIP and tirzepatide bound GIPR structures along with GLP-1R structures to guide our small molecular design.
Multiple Structures of ligand bound GLP-1R, GIPR, GCGR

29



As shown above, representative three-dimensional structures of the incretin GPCRs (e.g., GIPR, GLP-1R, Glucagon receptor) are available for structure-based drug discovery. This structural data enables the ability to design dual and tri modulators of this important class of metabolic GPCRs. The GIPR model shown below suggests that one of our dual GLP-1/GIPR agonists may extend to fill the pocket (highlighted in color) occupied by our GLP-1/GIPR agonist hits. Multiple approaches were applied for hit identification, including a screen of our proprietary incretin compound library. Weak antagonists and agonists were identified. After several rounds of structure activity relationship evolution, a full potential GLP-1R/GIPR antagonist and initial dual GLP-1R/GIPR agonist hit leading to the discovery of an optimized dual GLP-1R/GIPR agonist hit. While displaying different GIPR activity, both compounds still maintained certain levels of GLP-1R activities.
Next generation dual incretin GLP-1R/GIPR agonist hits identified
Our LPA1R and APJR Program for the Treatment of IPF
We are developing LTSE-2578, an investigational oral small molecule LPA1R antagonist for the treatment of IPF. We believe LTSE-2578 is a differentiated molecule because it demonstrated potent in vitro and in vivo activity in preclinical IPF models and dose dependent inhibition of histamine release as the pharmacodynamic marker. In addition, we are developing ANPA-0073, an investigational oral small molecule APJR agonist, for the treatment of IPF. When compared to a non-biased APJR agonist (Apelin-12) in a preclinical study, ANPA-0073 avoided hypotension. In September 2022, we completed a Phase 1 SAD and MAD study evaluating ANPA-0073, in which it was generally well tolerated in healthy human volunteers. We expect to conduct additional preclinical studies to be followed by a Phase 1 formulation bridging PK study in Australia. We also plan to initiate a Phase 2 study in 2024 in the United States.
IPF Disease Background
IPF is a life-threatening chronic interstitial lung disease characterized by progressive fibrosis of lung tissue leading to impaired blood oxygenation, progressive deterioration in lung function, and ultimately respiratory failure. IPF occurs primarily among patients between the ages of 50 and 70 years and is associated with high mortality, with median survival time between three- and five-years following diagnosis. Estimated prevalence of IPF is 13 to 20 per 100,000 people worldwide. In the United States, approximately 100,000 people are affected, and 30,000 to 40,000 new cases are diagnosed each year.

30



Normal lungs (A) and lungs with IPF (B)
The etiology of IPF remains unknown. IPF is a progressive disease, beginning with inflammation followed by fibrotic buildup as damaged epithelial cells surrounding the alveoli are replaced by fibroblasts, as shown above. Buildup of fibroblasts cause the lungs to thicken over time, becoming stiff and unable to properly function. In addition to complications from the disease itself, IPF can lead to other severe co-morbidities, including lung cancer, pulmonary embolisms, pneumonia or PH.
The most common symptoms of IPF are shortness of breath, persistent cough, fatigue, and weight loss, severely impacting quality of life. Given the non-specific nature of these symptoms, IPF is challenging to diagnose, particularly in the early stages of disease.
Current Treatments for IPF and Unmet Medical Need
Currently, there are two FDA-approved drugs for the treatment of IPF, Esbriet (pirfenidone) and Ofev (nintedanib).
Pirfenidone exhibits anti-fibrotic, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties through down-regulation of key pro-fibrotic growth factors including TGF-β, inhibition of inflammatory cytokines production and release and reduction of lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress. In Phase 3 trials, pirfenidone slowed disease progression and functional decline in patients with IPF and showed a reduced risk of mortality. Common adverse effects of pirfenidone include gastrointestinal intolerance such as nausea, diarrhea and dyspepsia and skin reactions, including rash and photosensitivity.
Nintedanib is an intracellular inhibitor that targets multiple tyrosine kinase growth factor receptors (vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1-3, fibroblast growth factor receptors 1-3, and platelet-derived growth factor receptors α and β). By inhibiting these receptors, nintedanib interferes with processes implicated in IPF pathogenesis, including proliferation and migration of lung fibroblasts, and differentiation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts. Nintedanib may also have a mortality benefit. Its most frequent side effects are diarrhea and nausea.
Both drugs are recommended by the most recent treatment guidelines from 2015. These therapeutics slow disease progression, but do not offer a cure. The two-year mortality rate is 36% and 39% after treatment of nintedanib and pirfenidone respectively. Safety and tolerability concerns, which resulted in a 20% to 30% discontinuation rate due to side effects, limit therapeutic usage and there remains an unmet medical need for IPF patients. Despite these limitations, these two drugs have generated total sales of $3.6 billion in 2020.
Overview of LPA1R Pathway and Target Biology
Lysophosphatidic acid (“LPA”) is a bioactive lipid which exerts potent extracellular signaling through its interaction with several GPCRs, mediating important cellular responses, such as proliferation, migration, and cytoskeletal reorganization.

31



LPA/LPA1R in IPF pathogenesis
As shown above, upon injury to certain cells in the lung, LPA levels increase and activate LPA1R. In published third-party preclinical studies, LPA1R activation promoted pro-fibrotic processes, including accumulation of fibroblasts; genetic or PD inhibition of LPA1R attenuated bleomycin induced lung fibrosis by mediating fibroblast recruitment and vascular leak.
We believe that LPA1R has been clinically validated as a potential target based on proof-of-concept data from a third-party, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 trial of an LPA1R antagonist (BMS-986020) in patients with IPF. Patients in the 600mg BID cohort exhibited significantly slower rates of forced vital capacity decline from baseline to 26 weeks versus placebo. Although the compound was generally well tolerated, dose-related hepatobiliary toxicity in some patients led to early termination of the trial. After conducting additional toxicology investigations, BMS reported that hepatobiliary toxicity was likely caused by inhibition of bile acids efflux transporters such as Bile Salt Export Pump (“BSEP”). Second generation LPA1R antagonists (BMS-986278) with minimal BSEP inhibition by BMS are currently in clinical development.
As illustrated below, we utilized the available protein structural information to collaborate with Schrödinger. After validation and customization with an initial set of compounds for retrospective analysis, Schrödinger’s FEP was utilized and suggested potency in the prospective analysis. This customized model greatly expedited the iterative lead optimization process and helped us to achieve candidate selection efficiently.

32



Iterative LPA1R Structure-Based Drug Discovery
Preclinical Data
In an in vivo PK and PD study, mice were orally dosed with LTSE-2578 and challenged by LPA at one hour and at 12 hours after dosing. Plasma was collected at two minutes post-LPA challenge and histamine level was measured as a pharmacodynamics biomarker. As shown below, LTSE-2578 demonstrated reductions in histamine release at doses ≥ 0.06 mg/kg, as compared to approximately 45 ng/mL and approximately 201 ng/mL for BMS’s first generation (BMS-986020) and second generation (BMS-986278) LPA1R antagonists, respectively.
LTSE-2578 demonstrated dose dependent inhibition of histamine release

33



LTSE-2578 showed limited inhibition (IC50 > 50 μ M) of efflux transporters including BSEP, MRP3 and MRP4, potentially reducing the likelihood of hepatobiliary toxicity caused by efflux transporter inhibition. IND-enabling studies of LTSE-2578 are ongoing with data expected in the second half of 2023.
Overview of APJR Pathway and Target Biology
The apelinergic system plays a key role in the maintenance of vascular health and function through regulation of fibrosis, cell proliferation and inflammation. APJR is highly expressed in the pulmonary vascular endothelium and is upregulated on endothelial cells in IPF patients. Further, activation of the apelinergic system through APJR has been shown to protect endothelial cell survival, and is critical for regeneration of the small capillary blood vessels. These findings support the possibility that an APJR agonist may play a beneficial role in interstitial lung disease.
Apelin binding to APJR activates G-protein second messenger signaling and leads to reduced production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (“cAMP”). Apelin binding to APJR also initiates a feedback loop that eventually downregulates apelin-APJR signaling by recruitment of β-arrestin and subsequent internalization of APJR. In addition, recruitment of β-arrestin triggers downstream pathways that induce vasorelaxation and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Therefore, the degree of activation by designed ligands of G-protein and β-arrestin signaling pathway may lead to both therapeutic benefit and undesirable effects.
Importance of endothelial cells on pulmonary fibrosis
As shown above, while epithelial cell damage and the inflammatory response are known contributors to fibrosis, recent studies have highlighted the importance of endothelial cells on pulmonary fibrosis. Microvascular injuries are observed in patients with pulmonary fibrosis. Persistent vascular leak may support a pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic environment. Endothelial senescence is found in the lung of IPF patients. Senescent endothelial cells could secrete factors that directly stimulate fibroblast activation. Targeting apelin pathway may promote capillary regeneration, ameliorate the inflammatory environment, and reduce endothelial senescence, in this way reducing lung fibrosis. Since an APJR agonist mainly targets endothelial cells, we believe it could be easily combined with the current standard of care, pirfenidone and ninetedanib, which do not target the anti-fibrosis pathway from endothelial cells.

34



ANPA-0073
We are developing ANPA-0073, an investigational, oral, small molecule APJR agonist, for the treatment of IPF. ANPA-0073 is designed to suppress cAMP production through activation of a G-protein-mediated signaling without significant activation of the β-arrestin pathway in order to avoid APJ internalization, and thereby potentially avoid any desensitization effects of an unbiased APJR agonist. We conducted preclinical in vitro studies on our compounds and third-party compounds to assess arrestin signaling and internalization. As shown below, apelin peptide and clinically tested competitor compounds including AMG-986 and BMS-986224 are all non-biased APJR agonists in these in vitro studies, with low β-arrestin/cAMP and internalization/cAMP ratios. Our molecules, such as ANPA-0073 and ANPA-137, are designed to be biased with much higher β-arrestin/cAMP and internalization/cAMP ratios than apelin peptide and the competitor compounds shown below.

Preclinical Data
In an in vitro study, ANPA-0073 demonstrated high potency in suppressing cAMP production through the G-protein-mediated signaling pathway with a half maximal excitatory concentration (EC50) value of less than 10 nM (n=15), but less potency in triggering the β-arrestin pathway and APJR internalization respectively. These data suggest ANPA-0073 is highly biased. The G-protein agonist potency of ANPA-0073 was similar across different species (rat, dog and monkey).
Anti-fibrosis effect of an APJ agonist ANPA-0137 was evaluated in bleomycin induced lung fibrosis model. Seven days after bleomycin challenges, mice received oral ANPA-137 for two weeks. ANPA-137 significantly reduced lung fibrosis Ashcroft scores and inflammatory cells infiltration into lung as quantified by inflammatory score as shown below.

Furthermore, ANPA-137 also demonstrated anti-fibrotic activity in an in vivo bleomycin-induced rat lung fibrosis model. Similar to mouse bleomycin study design, seven days after bleomycin challenges, rats received 15 mpk of oral ANPA-137 for two weeks. ANPA-137 significantly reduced lung fibrosis as quantified by Ashcroft score as shown below.

Phase 1 Healthy Volunteer Trial Design
In September 2022, we completed a two-part, 96 subject, first-in-human Phase 1 SAD and MAD study for ANPA-0073 in 48 healthy adult volunteers between the ages of 18 and 55. The objective was to assess drug safety and PK. The first part of this study was a SAD study, involving eight cohorts of eight participants assigned to receive a single dose of ANPA-0073 or placebo in a 3:1 ratio. Doses from 2 mg to 600 mg across the eight cohorts were evaluated. The second part of the trial was a MAD study, including four cohorts of 

36



eight subjects receiving sequential ascending doses of ANPA-0073 daily for seven days, increasing from 75 mg to 500 mg once daily. A schema of our Phase 1 study is presented below:
Schema of our ANPA-0073 Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers
ANPA-0073-01 Part A SAD Schema

ANPA-0073-01 Part B MAD Schema
Phase 1 Safety Data in Healthy Volunteers
ANPA-0073 was generally well tolerated at all dose levels administrated in the SAD and MAD parts of this Phase 1 study.
In the study, PK parameters of systemic exposure, Cmax and AUC, increased with doses of ANPA-0073 across the dose range from 75 mg to 500 mg.

37



In the SAD cohorts, no SAEs and no adverse changes in laboratory tests were observed. Among the AEs reported, five were considered moderate treatment emergent adverse events and the remaining were mild in severity. AEs did not result in any early terminations or subject discontinuations from participation in this study. No trial stopping criteria were met and no significant changes or trends in hematology, blood chemistries, vital signs or electrocardiogram (“ECG”) measurements were noted. The following table shows all TEAEs that were reported:

A Phase I, Open-label Study to Evaluate the Relative Bioavailability of ANPA-0073 Capsule versus Tablet
We are planning to conduct a Phase 1 study to evaluate the relative oral bioavailability of two formulations of ANPA-0073 (tablet and capsule) using a 2-period, 2-sequence, 2-way crossover design. We expect this study to be an open-label study in 16 healthy male and female volunteers, aged 18 to 55 in Australia. After screening, we plan for subjects to be confined in the clinical unit from Day-1 to Day 10, and that each study subject will be enrolled and randomized into one of two treatment arms (n=8 per arm). Capsule and tablet formulations of ANPA-0073 will be administered as a single 200 mg (2 x 100 mg) dose in a fasted manner in two separate treatment periods: Day 1 (Period 1) and Day 7 (Period 2). We expect the sequence of administration (capsule → tablet vs. tablet → capsule) will differ between each treatment arm and that each treatment period will be separated by a 6-day washout interval.
Our APJR Program for the Treatment of PAH
We are evaluating ANPA-0073 for the treatment of PAH. Despite existing treatment options for PAH, five-year mortality remains high. In a third-party clinical proof-of- concept study an acute infusion of an apelin agonist intravenously was shown to improve cardiac output. In our preclinical rat models, ANPA-0073 has shown increased cardiac output and mitigated the vascular remodeling that is characteristic of PAH. We believe that oral ANPA-0073 has the potential to provide therapeutic benefit through its novel mechanism of action, infrequent dosing, and lack of stringent administration requirements.
PAH Overview
PAH Background
Pulmonary hypertension (“PH”) is a group of diseases characterized by remodeling of the pulmonary vasculature that leads to a progressive elevation of blood pressure in the pulmonary circulation from a variety of causes. The World Health Organization (“WHO”) has divided PH into five groups based on similarities in pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and therapeutic options as shown below.

39



WHO classification of pulmonary hypertension

​ | ​ | ​ 
--+---+---------------------------------------------------------------------
1 | | Pulmonary arterial hypertension 
2 | ​ | Pulmonary hypertension secondary to left heart disease 
3 | ​ | Pulmonary hypertension from chronic lung diseases and/or hypoxia 
4 | ​ | Pulmonary hypertension due to pulmonary artery obstruction 
5 | ​ | Pulmonary hypertension from unexplained or multifactorial mechanisms
​ | ​ | ​ 

​
PAH is a rare, progressive life-threatening disease characterized by elevated pressures in the pulmonary arteries, the blood vessels responsible for carrying deoxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs. This increase in pressure results from disordered proliferation of endothelial cells lining the lumen of pulmonary arteries, which causes a narrowing in blood vessel diameter and a consequent slowing of blood flow to the lungs. Over time, recruitment of inflammatory cells and cytokines stimulates fibrosis and further blood vessel remodeling, ultimately causing severe restrictions in blood flow. To overcome increased pulmonary arterial pressures, the right side of the heart must work harder in order to circulate blood through the lungs, causing excessive strain on the right ventricle. Left untreated, this leads to right ventricular hypertrophy and ultimately right heart failure, which can present with symptoms such as breathlessness, fatigue, chest pain, and abdominal distension.
Right ventricular hypertrophy and pulmonary arterial hypertension
As shown in the schematic of PAH pathology above, increased pulmonary vascular resistance is caused by cell proliferation in the pulmonary vessels that obstructs blood flow. Ultimately, this disease leads to right heart failure, resulting eventually in death. Therefore, treatments that can increase right heart contractility may have benefit.
In addition to the above classification based on physiologic mechanisms of PH, the WHO has also developed a functional classification of PH patients, including those with PAH, as shown below. Four functional classes categorize patient symptom severity and ability to carry out physical activity. Higher numbered functional classes indicate worsening symptoms and are associated with higher mortality. As patients in Class I are asymptomatic and generally not diagnosed and also cannot show clinical improvement, patients in Classes II–IV are generally studied in clinical trials of new therapeutic agents.

40



WHO functional classification of pulmonary hypertension

WHO CLASS | | DESCRIPTION 
----------+---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Class I | ​ | Patients with pulmonary hypertension but without resulting limitation of physical activity. Ordinary physical activity does not cause undue dyspnea or fatigue, chest pain or near syncope. 
Class II | ​ | Patients with pulmonary hypertension resulting in a slight limitation of physical activity. They are comfortable at rest. Ordinary physical activity causes undue dyspnea or fatigue, chest pain or near syncope. 
Class III | ​ | Patients with pulmonary hypertension but without resulting limitation of physical activity. Ordinary physical activity does not cause undue dyspnea or fatigue, chest pain or near syncope. 
Class IV | ​ | Patients with pulmonary hypertension with inability to carry out any physical activity without symptoms. These patients manifest signs of right heart failure. Dyspnea and/or fatigue may even be present at rest. Discomfort is increased by any physical activity.

​
Prevalence of PAH and Unmet Medical Need
It is estimated that between 40,000 and 100,000 patients suffer from PAH worldwide, though the actual number is likely higher given underdiagnosis in developing countries. In the United States, the prevalence of PAH is 12 to 30 per million, and incidence is approximately 2.3 per million diagnosed annually.
Combined global sales for approved drugs for the treatment of PAH totaled approximately $5.4 billion in 2020. While advances in the treatment of PAH have markedly improved median survival over the past two decades, patients still face significant disease burden and premature death. Patient survival of PAH remains poor at five years despite treatment advances and there is unmet medical need for new therapies beyond the standard of care.
Our current and future pipeline candidates could have broad applicability in other PH groups as well as more broadly in heart failure, which is estimated to affect approximately 26–64 million people worldwide.
Limitations of Current Treatments and Unmet Medical Need
The current standard of care for patients with PAH consist of three classes of vasodilators including phosphodiesterase 5 (“PDE5”) inhibitors, endothelin receptor antagonists, and prostanoids. PDE5 inhibitors are often used in combination with ERAs as an early treatment strategy. In patients who fail to respond to combination therapy of an ERA and a PDE5 inhibitor, it is common practice to add a prostanoid which is also commonly used to treat patients with evidence of right heart failure. While existing treatments have led to significant improvements in time to clinical worsening and other composite endpoints in PAH patients, none directly alter the underlying disease process. The effect of vasodilation, while improving blood flow through the lungs, may eventually be overtaken by the worsening cellular proliferation and arterial remodeling underlying the condition.
Accordingly, we believe there is unmet medical need for therapies that are disease modifying and address more fundamental aspects of the disease.
Apelin Receptor is a Clinically Validated and Highly Druggable Target
APJR is a GPCR with wide distribution throughout the human body.
The expression patterns of apelin and APJR are consistent with their importance in cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases such as PAH. Apelin and APJR are expressed in several tissues, including those in the heart, lung, and blood vessels with expression observed in endothelial cells lining the blood vessels.

41



Activation of APJR pathways by its cognate peptide ligand, apelin, exerts pleiotropic effects in human biology, including inducing diverse physiological effects such as strengthening of cardiac contractility, vasodilation, angiogenesis, reducing vascular remodeling and regulation of energy metabolism and fluid homeostasis as shown below. We believe that the apelinergic signaling pathway will provide disease modifying effects in PAH through right ventricular protection and anti-pulmonary vessel remodeling.
Apelin Biology in human makes APJR an attractive target for PAH
Apelin mRNA and protein levels in control and PAH lung samples
As shown above, the apelin expression level in the lung of PAH patients (IPAH) was dramatically reduced compared to the non-PAH (C) lung samples. Apelin signaling is implicated in PAH which can be induced in animal models by hypoxia, a condition which temporarily induces apelin expression.

42



Apelin peptide reduced PVR and increased cardiac output without a change in
heart rate or mean arterial pressure
As shown above, apelin has a role in cardiac function. In a published third-party clinical proof-of-concept study, intravenous infusion of apelin peptide in PAH patients provided a significant reduction in pulmonary vascular resistance and an increase in cardiac output without a change in heart rate or systemic vascular resistance. It was also observed that the effect was most prominent in the subgroup of patients receiving concomitant PDE5 inhibition.
Both biased and non-biased apelin analogs could increase cardiac contraction, while biased apelin analogs have limited effects on vasorelaxation and systemic blood pressure reduction. These suggest that the inotropic efficacy mainly signals through G-protein pathway, while β-arrestin signaling pathway correlates with hypotensive effect as shown below.
APJR agonist activity on β-arrestin recruitment and its correlation with hypotensive effect.

43



We believe that a biased APJR agonist as compared to a non-biased agonist has the potential to maintain long-term cardiac output and stroke volume improvement while avoiding β-arrestin related hypotensive effect and mechanical stress induced cardiac hypertrophy.
Our Solution: Small Molecule Biased APJR Agonist
As described above, we are developing ANPA-0073, a novel orally-available biased APJR agonist which is designed to suppress cAMP production through activation of a G-protein-mediated signaling without significant activation of the β-arrestin pathway in order to avoid APJR internalization.
We believe that ANPA-0073 has the potential to be a differentiated and disease-modifying therapeutic agent and it is designed to provide the following potential advantages:

● | Orally-available with improved cardiac contractility, increased stroke volume and right ventricular cardiac output leading to increased survival;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Biased agonism that avoids down regulation due to APJR internalization;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Disease-modifying effect through decreased vascular remodeling; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Limited effect on systemic blood pressure, avoiding hypotension.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------

ANPA-0073 did not change mean arterial blood pressure in a rat telemetry study
One way ANOVA analysis; **** p<0.0001 compared to vehicle
As shown above, in a rat telemetry model, a non-biased apelin peptide demonstrated an acute decrease in mean arterial pressure as expected, whereas the biased molecule, ANPA-0073, did not.
ANPA-0073 has demonstrated promising activity in multiple animal models. In five different studies using monocrotaline (“MCT”) induced rat models of PAH, daily oral doses of ANPA-0073 reduced right ventricular systolic pressure, right ventricular hypertrophy index, and percentage of pulmonary artery wall thickness (“PAWT”), but increased right ventricular ejection fraction. As shown below, ANPA-0073 treatment resulted in reduced pulmonary artery pressure and increased cardiac function.

44



Treatment with sildenafil or an ANPA-0073 in an MCT rat model of PAH
One way ANOVA analysis; *p<0.05, **p<0.01, **** p<0.0001 compared to vehicle
In summary, in a published third-party clinical proof-of-concept study, an intravenous infusion of apelin has demonstrated increased cardiac output, especially in combination with the PAH standard of care therapy, sildenafil. In the MCT rat model of PAH, our biased apelin agonists showed increased cardiac stroke volume and cardiac output without impacting heart rate, and also mitigation of PAH-induced vascular remodeling. Together, these data suggest that an orally-available, biased apelin agonist, such as ANPA-0073, may have potential as a treatment for PAH, providing benefits differentiated from current standard of care therapies.

Lhotse Collaboration Agreement with Schrödinger, LLC
In October 2020, Lhotse, our wholly-owned subsidiary, entered into a collaboration agreement with Schrödinger (the “Lhotse-Schrödinger Agreement”) to discover and develop novel, orally bioavailable, small molecule inhibitors of LPA1R. Under the Lhotse-Schrödinger Agreement, Schrödinger is obligated to provide computational modeling and design support, including by using its technology platform to perform virtual screens, and Lhotse is obligated to provide day-to-day chemistry and biology support. Pursuant to the Lhotse-Schrödinger Agreement, a joint steering committee comprised of representatives from both parties oversees the research performed under the agreement. During the term of the Lhotse-Schrödinger Agreement and for a specified period thereafter while Lhotse is engaged in active development of any compound having activity against LPA1R that is discovered or developed under the Lhotse-Schrödinger Agreement, Schrödinger is obligated to work exclusively with Lhotse on the design, research, development and commercialization of compounds that inhibit LPA1R. Lhotse will solely own the research results, work product, inventions and other intellectual property generated under the Lhotse-Schrödinger Agreement that are directed to LPA1R.
Under the Lhotse-Schrödinger Agreement, Lhotse is obligated to pay Schrödinger a quarterly active program payment in the low six digits for each successive three-month period during which Schrödinger continues to perform research work as agreed by the parties, and as of December 31, 2022, we have paid to Schrödinger an aggregate of $0.8 million. If Lhotse develops and commercializes a product containing a compound (“Collaboration Compound”) that is discovered or developed under the Lhotse-Schrödinger Agreement (“Collaboration Product”), Lhotse is obligated to pay Schrödinger development and regulatory milestone payments of up to an aggregate of $17.0 million, regardless of the number of Collaboration Products that reach such milestones. Lhotse will also be obligated to pay Schrödinger tiered royalties in the low single digit range on aggregate worldwide net sales of all Collaboration Products, subject to specified reductions and offsets. Lhotse’s obligation to pay royalties to Schrödinger will expire on a Collaboration Product-by-Collaboration Product and country-by-country basis on the later of (i) the expiration of the last-to-expire Lhotse owned patent claim covering the composition of matter of the Collaboration Compound contained in such Collaboration Product in such country, (ii) the expiration of regulatory, pediatric, orphan drug, or data exclusivity with respect to such Collaboration Product in such country, and (iii) ten years after the first commercial sale of such Collaboration Product in such country (“Royalty Term”).

46



Agreement for the other party’s uncured material breach, subject to certain notice and cure periods, or for the other party’s bankruptcy or insolvency. Lhotse’s obligation to make milestone and royalty payments (subject to the Royalty Term) to Schrödinger continues after the expiration or termination of the Lhotse-Schrödinger Agreement.
Manufacturing
We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of our product candidates and currently have no immediate plans to build our own clinical or commercial scale manufacturing capabilities. We currently engage with third-party contract manufacturing organizations (“CMOs”) for the manufacture of our product candidates. We rely on and expect to continue to engage third-party manufacturers for the production of both drug substance and finished drug product. We currently obtain our supplies from these manufacturers on a purchase order basis and do not have long-term supply arrangements in place. Should any of these manufacturers become unavailable to us for any reason, we believe that there are a number of potential replacements, although we may incur some delay in identifying and qualifying such replacements.
Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapid evolution of technologies, fierce competition and strong defense of intellectual property. While we believe that our platform and our knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face competition from major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions, among others.
If any of our product candidates are approved for the indications for which we expect to conduct clinical trials, they will compete with the foregoing therapies and currently marketed drugs, as well as any drugs potentially in development. It is also possible that we will face competition from other pharmaceutical approaches as well as other types of therapies. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all our programs, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, level of generic competition, and availability of reimbursement.
Despite significant biopharmaceutical industry investment, no oral small molecule therapy targeting GLP-1R has been approved for the treatment of diabetes or obesity. We are aware of GLP-1R small molecules in development by Pfizer, Eli Lilly, and Qilu Regor Therapeutics Inc. There are currently approved GLP-1R peptides for the treatment of diabetes and obesity marketed by Novo Nordisk, Eli Lilly, AstraZeneca, and Sanofi. We are aware of other GLP-1R plus dual/tri incretin targeting peptides in development by Eli Lilly, Jiangsu Hansoh Pharmaceutical Group Co., Ltd., Boehringer Ingelheim, Altimmune, Inc., Carmot Therapeutics, Inc., and Sciwind Biosciences Co., Ltd. In addition, there are a number of companies developing product candidates for diabetes and obesity utilizing approaches with different mechanisms of action, including but not limited to sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors.
We are aware of APJR targeted product candidates in development for COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome by CohBar, Inc.; IPF, systemic sclerosis interstitial lung disease, and kidney nephrotic syndrome by Apie Therapeutics; and muscle atrophy by BioAge Labs, Inc. Both Amgen and Bristol Myers Squibb (“BMS”) have APJR targeted product candidates for heart failure. In addition, there are a number of companies developing product candidates for PAH utilizing approaches with different mechanisms of action, including but not limited to FibroGen, Inc., Galapagos NV, Galecto, Inc., Pliant Therapeutics, Inc., Gilead Sciences, Inc., Roche Holding AG and Boehringer Ingelheim.
We are aware of LPA1R targeted product candidates in development for IPF by BMS, Horizon Therapeutics plc, and DJS Antibodies Ltd; and myelin restoration and neuroinflammation by Pipeline Therapeutics. In addition, there are a number of companies developing product candidates for IPF utilizing approaches with different mechanisms of action, including Roche Holding AG and Boehringer Ingelheim.

47



Many of our current or potential competitors, either alone or with their collaboration partners, have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals, and marketing approved products than we do. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Mergers and acquisitions in the biopharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.
Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other applicable regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic products. There are generic products currently on the market for certain of the indications that we are pursuing and additional products are expected to become available on a generic basis over the coming years. If our product candidates are approved, we expect that they will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic products.
Data Privacy and Security Laws
Numerous state, federal and foreign laws, regulations and standards govern the collection, use, access to, confidentiality and security of health-related and other personal information, and could apply now or in the future to our operations or the operations of our partners. In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including data breach notification laws, health information privacy and security laws and consumer protection laws and regulations govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information. In addition, certain foreign laws govern the privacy and security of personal data, including health-related data. For example, the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (“EU GDPR”) imposes strict requirements for processing the personal data of individuals within the European Economic Area (“EEA”). Companies that must comply with the EU GDPR face increased compliance obligations and risk, including more robust regulatory enforcement of data protection requirements and potential fines for noncompliance of up to €20 million or 4% of the annual global revenues of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater. Further, from January 1, 2021, companies have had to comply with the GDPR and also the United Kingdom GDPR (“UK GDPR”) which, together with the amended UK Data Protection Act 2018, retains the GDPR in UK national law. The UK GDPR mirrors the fines under the GDPR relating to fines up to the greater of £17.5 million or 4% of global turnover. Privacy and security laws, regulations, and other obligations are constantly evolving, may conflict with each other to complicate compliance efforts, and can result in investigations, proceedings, or actions that lead to significant civil and/or criminal penalties and restrictions on data processing.
Regulation
Government Regulation of Pharmaceutical Product Development and Approval
U.S. Regulation of Pharmaceutical Product Development and Approval
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and its implementing regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining marketing approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state and local rules and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Our drug candidates must be approved by the FDA through the New Drug Application (“NDA”) process before they 

48



may be legally marketed in the United States. The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

● | completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests, preclinical animal studies and formulation studies all performed in compliance with applicable regulations, including the FDA’s good laboratory practices (“GLP”) regulations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an Investigational IND which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | approval by an institutional review board (“IRB”) or ethics committee representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable good clinical practices (“GCPs”) and other clinical trial-related regulations, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for its proposed indication;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | preparation and submission to the FDA of an NDA together with payment of user fees;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to file the NDA for review;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | review by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”) and finished drug product are produced to assess compliance with the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | potential FDA audit of the preclinical and/or clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA review and approval of the NDA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preclinical Studies and Clinical Trials
The preclinical development stage generally involves synthesizing the active component, developing the formulation and determining the manufacturing process, evaluating purity and stability, as well as carrying out non-human toxicology, pharmacology and drug metabolism studies in the laboratory, which support subsequent clinical testing. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations, including GLPs where applicable. The sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for human trials. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions regarding the proposed clinical trials and places the IND on clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a drug candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. Accordingly, submission of an IND does not guarantee the FDA will allow clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that could cause the trial to be suspended or terminated.
The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the drug product to human subjects or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with GCPs, which establish standards for conducting, recording data from, and reporting the results of clinical trials, and are intended to assure that the rights, safety, and well-being of study participants are protected. GCPs also include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted 

49



under written study protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments. While the IND is active and before approval, progress reports summarizing the results of the clinical trials and nonclinical studies performed since the last progress report must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the same or similar drugs, findings from animal or in vitro testing suggesting a significant risk to humans, and any clinically important increased incidence of a serious suspected adverse reaction compared to that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.
Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits.
The IRB also reviews and approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. Depending on its charter, this group may determine whether a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries.
Clinical trials are generally conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined, known as Phase I, Phase II and Phase III clinical trials.

● | Phase I: The drug is initially introduced into a small number of healthy volunteers or patients with the target disease or condition who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the drug candidate. These studies are designed to assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action, dosage tolerance, side effects associated with increasing doses, and safety of the drug, and if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase II: The drug is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate optimal dosage and dosing schedule. At the same time, safety and further PK and PD information is collected, as well as identification of possible adverse effects and safety risks and preliminary evaluation of efficacy. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase III: The drug is administered to an expanded number of patients, generally at multiple sites that are geographically dispersed, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug for its intended use, its safety profile, and to establish the overall benefit/risk profile of the drug and provide an adequate basis for drug approval and labeling of the drug product. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase IV clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase IV clinical trials as a condition of NDA approval.
The FDA, the IRB, or the clinical trial sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an 

50



institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the drug in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, cGMPs impose extensive procedural, substantive and recordkeeping requirements to ensure and preserve the long-term stability and quality of the final drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
NDA Submission and FDA Review Process
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of non-clinical studies and of the clinical trials, together with other detailed information, including extensive manufacturing information and information on the composition of the drug and proposed labeling, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the drug for one or more specified indications. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical studies intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of the product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by independent investigators. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, as amended (“PDUFA”) each NDA must be accompanied by an application user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. PDUFA also imposes an annual prescription drug program fee for human drugs. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.
The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once filed, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the filing date to complete a standard review of an NDA for a drug that is a new molecular entity. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a “filing” decision after it the application is submitted. The FDA reviews the NDA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed drug is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the drug is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity.
The FDA may refer applications for novel drugs or drug candidates that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new drug to determine whether they comply with cGMPs. The FDA will not approve the drug unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the drug within required specifications. In addition, before approving an NDA, the FDA may re-analyze clinical trial data and may also audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements.
After the FDA evaluates the application, manufacturing process and manufacturing facilities where the drug product and/or its API will be produced, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter (“CRL”) An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A CRL indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the 

51



application is not ready for approval. A CRL usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA. The CRL may require additional clinical data and/or an additional pivotal clinical trial(s), and/or other significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. If a CRL is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval.
If a drug receives marketing approval, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may be significantly limited to specific diseases, dosages, or patient populations. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the drug labeling or may condition the approval of the NDA on other changes to the proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct post-market testing or clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the effects of approved drugs. For example, the FDA may require so-called Phase IV testing which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a drug’s safety and effectiveness and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved drugs that have been commercialized. The FDA may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”) to ensure that the benefits of a drug or biological product outweigh its risks. A REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a medicine and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use, and could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of drugs. Drug approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following initial marketing.
Pediatric Trials
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, an NDA or supplement thereto must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. A sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration must also submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan (“PSP”) within sixty days of an end-of-Phase II meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and the FDA. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from preclinical studies, early phase clinical trials, and/or other clinical development programs.
Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a drug product as an “orphan drug” if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition (generally meaning that it affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more in cases in which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug product available in the United States for treatment of the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product). A company must request orphan product designation before submitting an NDA. If the request is granted, the FDA will publicly disclose the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential use. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for a particular active ingredient for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product 

52



exclusivity, meaning that the FDA may not approve any other applications for the same product for the same indication for seven years, including a full NDA, except in certain limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity or if the FDA finds that the holder of the orphan drug exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA application user fee.
A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, orphan drug exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or, as noted above, if a second applicant demonstrates that its product is clinically superior to the approved product with orphan exclusivity or the manufacturer of the approved product is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
Post-Marketing Requirements
Following approval of a new drug, the NDA sponsor and the approved drug are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and recordkeeping activities, reporting to the applicable regulatory authorities of adverse experiences with the drug, providing the regulatory authorities with updated safety and efficacy information, drug sampling and distribution requirements, and complying with applicable promotion and advertising requirements. Modifications or enhancements to the drug or its labeling or changes of the site of manufacture are often subject to the approval of the FDA and other regulators, which may or may not be received or may result in a lengthy review process.
FDA regulations also require that approved drug products be manufactured in specific facilities identified in the approved application for marketing and in accordance with cGMP. NDA holders using contract manufacturers, laboratories or packagers are responsible for the selection and monitoring of qualified firms, and, in certain circumstances, qualified suppliers to these firms. These manufacturers must comply with cGMP regulations that require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:

● | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | fines, warning letters, or untitled letters;
--+---------------------------------------------


● | clinical holds on clinical trials;
--+-----------------------------------


● | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

53




● | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases and other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product; or
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of drug products. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe, in their independent professional medical judgment, legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products. However, companies may share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with a product’s FDA-approved labeling.
Marketing Exclusivity
Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can delay the acceptance by the FDA for review, or the approval, of certain marketing applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent data exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”), or an NDA submitted under Section 505(b)(2), or 505(b)(2) NDA, submitted by another company for another drug based on the same active moiety, regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original reference drug or for another indication, where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be accepted for review after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA for the reference drug.
The FDCA alternatively provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, such as new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving abbreviated NDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for drugs containing the active agent for the original indication or condition of use.
Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to any preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
Pediatric exclusivity is another type of marketing exclusivity available in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity provides for an additional six months of marketing exclusivity attached to another period of exclusivity if a sponsor conducts clinical trials in children in response to a written request from the FDA. The issuance of a written request does not require the sponsor to undertake the described clinical trials.

Other U.S. Regulatory Matters
Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities following drug approval are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in addition to the FDA, including, in the United States, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and state and local governments. In the United States, the activities of pharmaceutical manufacturers are subject to federal and state laws designed to prevent fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. The laws generally limit financial interactions between manufacturers and health care providers or other participants in the healthcare industry and/or require disclosure to the government and public of such interactions. Many of these laws and regulations contain ambiguous requirements or require administrative guidance for implementation.
Pharmaceutical manufacturers are also required to provide discounts or rebates under government healthcare programs or to certain government and private purchasers in order to obtain coverage under federal healthcare programs such as Medicaid. Participation in such programs may require tracking and reporting of certain drug prices. Manufacturers are subject to fines and other penalties if such prices are not reported accurately. Drugs must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
The distribution of pharmaceutical drugs is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical drugs.
The failure to comply with regulatory requirements subjects manufacturers to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines, civil monetary or other penalties, injunctions, recall or seizure of drugs, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals, additional regulatory oversight and integrity monitoring, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs or refusal to allow a firm to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts. In addition, even if a firm complies with FDA and other requirements, new information regarding the safety or efficacy of a product could lead the FDA to modify or withdraw product approval. Prohibitions or restrictions on sales or withdrawal of future products marketed by us could materially affect our business in an adverse way.
Chinese Regulation of Pharmaceutical Product Development and Approval
Since China’s entry into the World Trade Organization in 2001, the Chinese government has made significant efforts to standardize regulations, develop its pharmaceutical regulatory system and strengthen intellectual property protection.
In October 2017, China’s drug regulatory system entered a new and significant period of reform. The General Office of the State Council and the General Office of the Communist Party of China Central Committee jointly issued the Opinion on Deepening the Reform of the Regulatory Approval System to Encourage Innovation in Drugs and Medical Devices, or the Innovation Opinion, which is a mandatory plan to further reform the review and approval system and to encourage the innovation of drugs and medical devices. Under the Innovation Opinion and other recent reforms, the expedited programs and other advantages encourage drug manufacturers to seek marketing approval in China first and to develop drugs in high priority disease areas, such as oncology or rare disease.
To implement the regulatory reform introduced by the Innovation Opinion, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress of the PRC (“SCNPC”) and the National Medical Products Administration (“NMPA”) have recently revised the fundamental laws, regulations and rules governing pharmaceutical products and the pharmaceutical industry, including the amendment of the framework law known as the People’s Republic of China Drug Administration Law (“PRC Drug Administration Law”), which became 

55



effective on December 1, 2019. The State Administration for Market Regulation (“SAMR”) has promulgated two key implementing regulations for the PRC Drug Administration Law: (i) the amended Administrative Measures for Drug Registration and (ii) the amended Measures on the Supervision and Administration of the Manufacture of Drugs. Both regulations took effect on July 1, 2020.
Rest of the World Regulation of Pharmaceutical Product Development and Approval
For other countries outside of Asia and the United States, such as countries in Europe, Latin America or other parts of Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, drug licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with applicable GCP requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and ethical principles.
If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
Other Healthcare Laws
Other U.S. Healthcare Laws
We may also be subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by the U.S. federal government and the states where we may market our drug candidates, if approved. These laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security and transparency laws, such as the following:

● | federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibit, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully offering, soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, for an item or service or the purchasing or ordering of a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | federal false claims laws, including the False Claim Act and the Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, information or claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payers that are false or fraudulent. In addition, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), which prohibits, among other things, executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program (including private health plans) or making false statements relating to healthcare matters. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”), which among other things, strictly regulates drug product and medical device marketing, prohibits manufacturers from marketing such products prior to approval or for off-label use and regulates the distribution of samples;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | federal laws that require pharmaceutical manufacturers to report certain calculated product prices to the government or provide certain discounts or rebates to government authorities or private entities, often as a condition of reimbursement under government healthcare programs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to the CMS, information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

56




doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), other healthcare professionals (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members;
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), and their implementing regulations, imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, on “covered entities,” including certain healthcare providers, health plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and their respective “business associates,” and their subcontractors that create, receive, maintain or transmit individually identifiable health information for or on behalf of a covered entity, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | state law equivalents of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including private insurers, state transparency laws, state laws limiting interactions between pharmaceutical manufacturers and members of the healthcare industry, and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by federal laws, thus complicating compliance efforts.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We may also be subject to federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers.
Efforts to ensure that our activities comply with applicable healthcare laws may involve substantial costs. Many of these laws and their implementing regulations contain ambiguous requirements or require administrative guidance for implementation. Given the lack of clarity in laws and their implementation, our activities could be subject to challenge. If our operations were found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we could be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, including, without limitation, damages, fines, imprisonment, additional regulatory oversight and integrity monitoring, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.
Coverage and Reimbursement
U.S. Coverage and Reimbursement
Successful sales of our drug candidates in the U.S. market, if approved, will depend, in part, on the extent to which our drugs will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs or private health insurance (including managed care plans). Patients who are provided with prescriptions as part of their medical treatment generally rely on such third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with their prescriptions and therefore adequate coverage and reimbursement from such third-party payors are critical to new and ongoing product acceptance. Coverage and reimbursement policies for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor as there is no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products among third-party payors in the United States. There may be significant delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement as the process of determining coverage and reimbursement is often time consuming and costly. Further, third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for medical drugs and services and implementing measures to control utilization of drugs (such as requiring prior authorization for coverage).
Additionally, the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic drugs. Adoption or expansion of price controls and cost-containment measures could further limit our net revenue and results. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our drug candidates, if approved, or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover our drug candidates could have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition.

57



General legislative cost control measures may also affect reimbursement for our products. If we obtain approval to market a drug candidate in the United States, we may be subject to spending reductions affecting Medicare, Medicaid or other publicly funded or subsidized health programs and/or any significant taxes or fees.
U.S. Health Care Reform
The United States government, state legislatures, and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price-controls, restrictions on reimbursement, and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. For example, in March 2010, the Affordable Care Act (“ACA”) was passed which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both the government and private insurers and continues to significantly impact the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The ACA contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products through increased rebates for drugs reimbursed by Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs. There have been judicial, Congressional and executive branch challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, including efforts to repeal or replace certain aspects of the ACA. For example, on June 17, 2021 the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the individual mandate was repealed by Congress. In addition, on August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”) into law, which among other things, extends enhanced subsidies for individuals purchasing health insurance coverage in ACA marketplaces through plan year 2025. The IRA also eliminates the “donut hole” under the Medicare Part D program beginning in 2025 by significantly lowering the beneficiary maximum out-of-pocket cost and through a newly established manufacturer discount program.
Additionally, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny in the United States of pharmaceutical pricing practices in light of the rising cost of prescription drugs and biologics. Such scrutiny has resulted in several recent Congressional inquiries, presidential executive orders and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. For example, in July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order with multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to Biden’s executive order, on September 9, 2021, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform and sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue to advance these principles. In addition, the IRA, among other things, (1) directs the HHS to negotiate the price of certain single-source drugs and biologics covered under Medicare and (2) imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation. These provisions will take effect progressively starting in fiscal year 2023, although they may be subject to legal challenges. Further, the Biden administration released an additional executive order on October 14, 2022, directing HHS to report on how the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation can be further leveraged to test new models for lowering drug costs for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries.
Other Significant Chinese Regulation Affecting Our Business Activities in China
Chinese Regulation of Foreign Investment
The establishment, operation and management of corporate entities in China are governed by the Company Law of the People’s Republic of China (the “PRC Company Law”), which was adopted by the SCNPC in December 1993, implemented in July 1994, and subsequently amended in December 1999, August 2004, October 2005, December 2013 and October 2018. Under the PRC Company Law, companies are generally classified into two categories: limited liability companies and companies limited by shares. The PRC Company Law also applies to foreign-invested limited liability companies. Pursuant to the PRC Company Law, where laws on foreign investment have other stipulations, such stipulations shall prevail.

58



Investment activities in China by foreign investors are governed by the Guiding Foreign Investment Direction, which was promulgated by the State Council on February 11, 2002 and came into effect on April 1, 2002, and the latest Special Administrative Measures (Negative List) for Foreign Investment Access (2021) (the “Negative List”), which was promulgated by the Ministry of Commerce of the People’s Republic of China (“MOFCOM”), and National Development and Reform Commission (“NDRC”), on December 27, 2021 and took effect on January 1, 2022. The Negative List set out in a unified manner the restrictive measures, such as the requirements on shareholding percentages and management, for the access of foreign investments, and the industries that are prohibited for foreign investment. The Negative List covers 12 industries, and any field not falling in the Negative List shall be administered under the principle of equal treatment to domestic and foreign investment.
The Foreign Investment Law of the People’s Republic of China (the “Foreign Investment Law”) was promulgated by the National People’s Congress (“NPC”) in March 2019 and become effective in January 2020. After the Foreign Investment Law came into force, the Law on Wholly Foreign-Owned Enterprises of the People’s Republic of China, the Law on Sino-foreign Equity Joint Ventures of the People’s Republic of China and the Law on Sino-foreign Contractual Joint Ventures of the People’s Republic of China have been repealed simultaneously. The investment activities of foreign natural persons, enterprises or other organizations (hereinafter referred to as foreign investors) directly or indirectly within the territory of China shall comply with and be governed by the Foreign Investment Law, including: (i) establishing by foreign investors of foreign-invested enterprises in China alone or jointly with other investors; (ii) acquiring by foreign investors of shares, equity, property shares, or other similar interests of Chinese domestic enterprises; (iii) investing by foreign investors in new projects in China alone or jointly with other investors; (iv) other forms of investment prescribed by laws, administrative regulations or the State Council.
In December 2019, the State Council issued the Regulations on Implementing the Foreign Investment Law, which came into effect in January 2020. After the Regulations on Implementing the Foreign Investment Law came into effect, the Regulation on Implementing the Sino-Foreign Equity Joint Venture Enterprise Law, Provisional Regulations on the Duration of Sino-Foreign Equity Joint Venture Enterprise, the Regulations on Implementing the Wholly Foreign-Owned Enterprise Law and the Regulations on Implementing the Sino-Foreign Cooperative Joint Venture Enterprise Law have been repealed simultaneously.
In December 2019, the MOFCOM and the SAMR issued the Measures for the Reporting of Foreign Investment Information, which came into effect in January 2020. After the Measures for the Reporting of Foreign Investment Information came into effect, the Interim Measures on the Administration of Filing for Establishment and Change of Foreign Investment Enterprises has been repealed simultaneously. Since January 1, 2020, for foreign investors carrying out investment activities directly or indirectly in China, the foreign investors or foreign-invested enterprises shall submit investment information to the relevant commerce administrative authorities pursuant to these measures.
Chinese Regulation of Commercial Bribery
Pursuant to specific provisions in the amended People’s Republic of China Anti-Unfair Competition Law, commercial bribery is prohibited. Both the bribe giver and bribe recipient are subject to civil and criminal liability. Further, pharmaceutical companies involved in a criminal investigation or administrative proceedings related to bribery are listed in the Adverse Records of Commercial Briberies by its provincial health and family planning administrative department. Pursuant to the Provisions on the Establishment of Adverse Records of Commercial Briberies in the Medicine Purchase and Sales Industry, which became effective on March 1, 2014, provincial health and family planning administrative departments formulate the implementing measures for the establishment of Adverse Records of Commercial Briberies. If a pharmaceutical company is listed in the Adverse Records of Commercial Briberies for the first time, their production is not required to be purchased by public medical institutions. A pharmaceutical company will not be penalized by the relevant Chinese government authorities merely by virtue of having contractual relationships with distributors or third-party promoters who are engaged in bribery activities, so long as such pharmaceutical company and its employees are not utilizing the distributors or third-party promoters for the implementation of, or acting in conjunction with them in, the prohibited bribery activities. In addition, a pharmaceutical company is under no 

59



legal obligation to monitor the operating activities of its distributors and third-party promoters, and it will not be subject to penalties or sanctions by relevant Chinese government authorities as a result of failure to monitor their operating activities.
Chinese Regulation of Product Liability
In addition to the strict new drug approval process, certain Chinese laws have been promulgated to protect the rights of consumers and to strengthen the control of medical products in China. Under current Chinese law, manufacturers and vendors of defective products in China may incur liability for loss and injury caused by such products. Pursuant to the General Principles of the Civil Law of the People’s Republic of China (“PRC Civil Law”) promulgated on April 12, 1986 and amended on August 27, 2009, a defective product which causes property damage or physical injury to any person may subject the manufacturer or vendor of such product to civil liability for such damage or injury. The Civil Code of the People’s Republic of China (“PRC Civil Code”), which was promulgated in May 2020 and became effective on January 1, 2021, amalgamates and replaces a series of specialized laws in civil law area, including the PRC Civil Law. The rules on product liability in the PRC Civil Code remain consistent with the rules in the PRC Civil Law.
On February 22, 1993, the Product Quality Law of the People’s Republic of China (“Product Quality Law”) was promulgated to supplement the PRC Civil Law aiming to protect the legitimate rights and interests of the end-users and consumers and to strengthen the supervision and control of the quality of products. The Product Quality Law was revised on July 8, 2000, August 27, 2009 and December 29, 2018 respectively. Pursuant to the revised Product Quality Law, manufacturers who produce defective products may be subject to civil or criminal liability and have their business licenses revoked.
The Law of the People’s Republic of China on the Protection of the Rights and Interests of Consumers was promulgated on October 31, 1993 and was amended on August 27, 2009 and October 25, 2013 to protect consumers’ rights when they purchase or use goods and accept services. According to which, all business operators must comply with this law when they manufacture or sell goods and/or provide services to customers. Under the amendment on October 25, 2013, all business operators shall pay high attention to protect the customers’ privacy and strictly keep confidential any consumer information they obtain during the business operation. In addition, in extreme situations, pharmaceutical product manufacturers and operators may be subject to criminal liability if their goods or services lead to the death or injuries of customers or other third parties.
Chinese Tort Law
Under the Tort Law of the People’s Republic of China (“Tort Law”), which became effective on July 1, 2010, if damages to other persons are caused by defective products due to the fault of a third party, such as the parties providing transportation or warehousing, the producers and the sellers of the products have the right to recover their respective losses from such third parties. If defective products are identified after they have been put into circulation, the producers or the sellers shall take remedial measures such as the issuance of a warning, or the recall of products in a timely manner. The producers or the sellers shall be liable under tort if they fail to take remedial measures in a timely manner or have not made efforts to take remedial measures, thus causing damages. If the products are produced or sold with known defects, causing deaths or severe adverse health issues, the infringed party has the right to claim punitive damages in addition to compensatory damages. The PRC Civil Code amalgamated and replaced the Tort Law effective January 1, 2021. The rules on tort in the PRC Civil Code are generally consistent with the Tort Law.
Chinese Regulation of Intellectual Property Rights
China has made substantial efforts to adopt comprehensive legislation governing intellectual property rights, including patents, trademarks, copyrights and domain names.

60



Patents
Pursuant to the Patent Law of the People’s Republic of China (the “PRC Patent Law”), most recently amended in December 2008 and October 2020, and its implementation rules, most recently amended in January 2010, patents in China fall into three categories: invention, utility model and design. An invention patent is granted to a new technical solution proposed in respect of a product or method or an improvement of a product or method. A utility model is granted to a new technical solution that is practicable for application and proposed in respect of the shape, structure or a combination of both of a product. A design patent is granted to the new design of a certain product in shape, pattern or a combination of both and in color, shape and pattern combinations aesthetically suitable for industrial application. Under the PRC Patent Law, the term of patent protection starts from the date of application. Patents relating to invention are effective for twenty years, and utility models and designs are effective for ten and fifteen years, respectively, from the date of application. The PRC Patent Law adopts the principle of “first-to-file” system, which provides that where more than one person files a patent application for the same invention, a patent will be granted to the person who files the application first.
Existing patents can become narrowed, invalid or unenforceable due to a variety of grounds, including lack of novelty, creativity, and deficiencies in patent application. In China, a patent must have novelty, creativity and practical applicability. Under the PRC Patent Law, novelty means that before a patent application is filed, no identical invention or utility model has been publicly disclosed in any publication in China or overseas or has been publicly used or made known to the public by any other means, whether in or outside of China, nor has any other person filed with the patent authority an application that describes an identical invention or utility model and is recorded in patent application documents or patent documents published after the filing date. Creativity means that, compared with existing technology, an invention has prominent substantial features and represents notable progress, and a utility model has substantial features and represents any progress. Practical applicability means an invention or utility model can be manufactured or used and may produce positive results. Patents in China are filed with the China National Intellectual Property Administration (“CNIPA”). Normally, the CNIPA publishes an application for an invention patent within 18 months after the filing date, which may be shortened at the request of applicant. The applicant must apply to the CNIPA for a substantive examination within three years from the date of application.
Article 19 of the PRC Patent Law provides that, for an invention or utility model completed in China, any applicant (not just Chinese companies and individuals), before filing a patent application outside of China, must first submit it to the CNIPA for a confidential examination. Failure to comply with this requirement will result in the denial of any Chinese patent for the relevant invention. This added requirement of confidential examination by the CNIPA has raised concerns by foreign companies who conduct research and development activities in China or outsource research and development activities to service providers in China. The PRC Patent Law also sets up the framework and adds the provisions for patent linkage and patent term extension.
Patent Enforcement
Unauthorized use of patents without consent from owners of patents, forgery of the patents belonging to other persons, or engagement in other patent infringement acts, will subject the infringers to infringement liability. Serious offenses such as forgery of patents may be subject to criminal penalties.
When a dispute arises out of infringement of the patent owner’s patent right, Chinese law requires that the parties first attempt to settle the dispute through mutual consultation. However, if the dispute cannot be settled through mutual consultation, the patent owner, or an interested party who believes the patent is being infringed, may either file a civil legal suit or file an administrative complaint with the relevant patent administration authority. A Chinese court may issue a preliminary injunction upon the patent owner’s or an interested party’s request before instituting any legal proceedings or during the proceedings. Damages for infringement are calculated as the loss suffered by the patent holder arising from the infringement, or the benefit gained by the infringer from the infringement. If it is difficult to ascertain damages in this manner, damages may be determined by using a reasonable multiple of the license fee under a contractual license. 

61



Statutory damages may be awarded in the circumstances where the damages cannot be determined by the calculation standards referenced above. The damage calculation methods shall be applied in the aforementioned order. Generally, the patent owner has the burden of proving that the patent is being infringed. However, if the owner of an invention patent for manufacturing process of a new product alleges infringement of its patent, the alleged infringer has the burden of proof.
The most recent amendment to the PRC Patent Law, which was promulgated by the SCNPC in October 2020 and became effective in June 2021, describes the general principles of linking generic drug applications to pharmaceutical patent protection, also known as Patent Linkage. In July 2021, the NMPA and the CNIPA jointly published the Measures for Implementing an Early-Stage Resolution Mechanism for Pharmaceutical Patent Disputes (Tentative) (“Measures on Patent Linkage”), providing an operating mechanism for Patent Linkage. Upon notification of generic applications and certifications, if the patentee or the interested person disagrees, the patentee or the interested person will need to file a claim with the court or the CNIPA within 45 days after the Center for Drug Evaluation (“CDE’s”) publication and must submit a copy of the case acceptance notification to the CDE within 15 working days after the case acceptance date. Otherwise, the NMPA can proceed with the technical review and approval. For chemical drugs, the NMPA would initiate a nine-month approval stay period upon notification. If the patentee or the interested person cannot secure a favorable court judgment or a decision from the CNIPA within the nine-month period, the NMPA can grant marketing authorization to the generic applicant after the nine-month period expires.
Medical Patent Compulsory License
According to the PRC Patent Law, for the purpose of public health, the CNIPA may grant a compulsory license for manufacturing patented drugs and exporting them to countries or regions covered under relevant international treaties to which China has acceded.
Exemptions for Unlicensed Manufacture, Use, Sale or Import of Patented Products
The PRC Patent Law provides five exceptions permitting the unauthorized manufacture, use, sale or import of patented products. None of following circumstances are deemed an infringement of the patent rights, and any person may manufacture, use, sell or import patented products without authorization granted by the patent owner as follows:

● | Any person who uses, promises to sell, sells or imports any patented product or product directly obtained in accordance with the patented methods after such product is sold by the patent owner or by its licensed entity or individual;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Any person who has manufactured an identical product, has used an identical method or has made necessary preparations for manufacture or use prior to the date of patent application and continues to manufacture such product or use such method only within the original scope;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Any foreign transportation facility that temporarily passes through the territory, territorial waters or territorial airspace of China and uses the relevant patents in its devices and installations for its own needs in accordance with any agreement concluded between China and that country to which the foreign transportation facility belongs, or any international treaty to which both countries are party, or on the basis of the principle of reciprocity;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Any person who uses the relevant patents solely for the purposes of scientific research and experimentation; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Any person who manufactures, uses or imports patented drug or patented medical equipment for the purpose of providing information required for administrative approval, or manufactures, uses or imports patented drugs or patented medical equipment for the abovementioned person.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

However, if patented drugs are utilized on the ground of exemptions for unauthorized manufacture, use, sale or import of patented drugs prescribed in PRC Patent Law, such patented drugs cannot be manufactured, used, sold or imported for any commercial purposes without authorization granted by the patent owner.

Trade Secrets
According to the People’s Republic of China Anti-Unfair Competition Law promulgated by the SCNPC on September 2, 1993, as amended on November 4, 2017 and on April 23, 2019 (collectively, the “PRC Anti-Unfair Competition Law”), the term “trade secrets” refers to technical and business information that is unknown to the public that has utility and may create business interests or profits for its legal owners or holders, and is maintained as a secret by its legal owners or holders.
Under the PRC Anti-Unfair Competition Law, business persons are prohibited from infringing others’ trade secrets by: (i) obtaining the trade secrets from the legal owners or holders by any unfair methods such as theft, bribery, fraud, coercion, electronic intrusion, or any other illicit means; (ii) disclosing, using or permitting others to use the trade secrets obtained illegally under item (i) above; (iii) disclosing, using or permitting others to use the trade secrets, in violation of any contractual agreements or any requirements of the legal owners or holders to keep such trade secrets in confidence; or (iv) instigating, inducing or assisting others to violate confidentiality obligation or to violate a rights holder’s requirements on keeping confidentiality of trade secrets, disclosing, using or permitting others to use the trade secrets of the rights holder. If a third party knows or should have known of such illegal conduct but nevertheless obtains, uses or discloses trade secrets of others trade secrets, the third party may be deemed to have committed a misappropriation of the others’ trade secrets.
Trademarks and Domain Names
Trademarks. According to the Trademark Law of the People’s Republic of China, promulgated by the SCNPC in August 1982, as amended in February 1993, October 2001, August 2013 and April 2019 and its implementation rules (collectively, the “Trademark Law”), the Trademark Office of the National Intellectual Property Administration is responsible for the registration and administration of trademarks throughout China. The Trademark Law has adopted a “first-to-file” principle with respect to trademark registration.
Domain Names. Domain names are protected under the Administrative Measures on the Internet Domain Names promulgated by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology in August 2017 and effective November 2017. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology is the main regulatory body responsible for the administration of Chinese internet domain names.
Chinese Regulation of Labor Protection
Under the Labor Law of the People’s Republic of China, effective on January 1, 1995 and subsequently amended on August 27, 2009 and December 29, 2018, the Employment Contract Law of the People’s Republic of China, effective on January 1, 2008 and subsequently amended on December 28, 2012 and the Implementing Regulations of the Employment Contract Law, effective on September 18, 2008, employers must establish a comprehensive management system to protect the rights of their employees, including a system governing occupational health and safety to provide employees with occupational training to prevent occupational injury, and employers are required to truthfully inform prospective employees of the job description, working conditions, location, occupational hazards and status of safe production as well as remuneration and other conditions as requested by the Labor Contract Law of the People’s Republic of China.
Pursuant to the Law of Manufacturing Safety of the People’s Republic of China effective on November 1, 2002 and amended on August 27, 2009, August 31, 2014 and June 10, 2021, manufacturers must establish a comprehensive management system to ensure manufacturing safety in accordance with applicable laws, regulations, national standards, and industrial standards. Manufacturers not meeting relevant legal requirements are not permitted to commence their manufacturing activities.
Pursuant to the Administrative Measures Governing the Production Quality of Pharmaceutical Products effective on March 1, 2011, manufacturers of pharmaceutical products are required to establish production 

63



safety and labor protection measures in connection with the operation of their manufacturing equipment and manufacturing process.
Pursuant to applicable Chinese laws, rules and regulations, including the Social Insurance Law which became effective on July 1, 2011 and amended on December 29, 2018, the Interim Regulations on the Collection and Payment of Social Security Funds, which became effective on January 22, 1999 and amended on March 24, 2019, Interim Measures concerning the Maternity Insurance of Employees, which became effective on January 1, 1995, and the Regulations on Work-related Injury Insurance, which became effective on January 1, 2004 and was subsequently amended on December 20, 2010, employers are required to contribute, on behalf of their employees, to a number of social security funds, including funds for basic pension insurance, unemployment insurance, basic medical insurance, work-related injury insurance and maternity insurance. If an employer fails to make social insurance contributions timely and in full, the social insurance collecting authority will order the employer to make up outstanding contributions within the prescribed time period and impose a late payment fee at the rate of 0.05% per day from the date on which the contribution becomes due. If such employer fails to make the overdue contributions within such time limit, the relevant administrative department may impose a fine equivalent to one to three times the overdue amount.
Regulations Relating to Foreign Exchange Registration of Offshore Investment by Chinese Residents
In July 2014, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (“SAFE”), issued SAFE Circular 37 and its implementation guidelines. Pursuant to SAFE Circular 37 and its implementation guidelines, residents of China (including Chinese institutions and individuals) must register with local branches of SAFE in connection with their direct or indirect offshore investment in an overseas special purpose vehicle (“SPV”), directly established or indirectly controlled by Chinese residents for the purposes of offshore investment and financing with their legally owned assets or interests in domestic enterprises, or their legally owned offshore assets or interests. Such Chinese residents are also required to amend their registrations with SAFE when there is a change to the basic information of the SPV, such as changes of a Chinese resident individual shareholder, the name or operating period of the SPV, or when there is a significant change to the SPV, such as changes of the Chinese individual resident’s increase or decrease of its capital contribution in the SPV, or any share transfer or exchange, merger, division of the SPV. Failure to comply with the registration procedures set forth in the SAFE Circular 37 may result in restrictions being imposed on the foreign exchange activities of the relevant onshore company, including the payment of dividends and other distributions to its offshore parent or affiliate, the capital inflow from the offshore entities and settlement of foreign exchange capital, and may also subject relevant onshore companies or Chinese residents to penalties under Chinese foreign exchange administration regulations.
Regulations Relating to Employee Stock Incentive Plan
In February 2012, SAFE promulgated the Notices on Issues Concerning the Foreign Exchange Administration for Domestic Individuals Participating in Stock Incentive Plans of Overseas Publicly Listed Companies (the “Stock Option Rules”). In accordance with the Stock Option Rules and relevant rules and regulations, Chinese citizens or non-Chinese citizens residing in China for a continuous period of not less than one year, who participate in any stock incentive plan of an overseas publicly listed company, subject to a few exceptions, are required to register with SAFE through a domestic qualified agent, which could be a Chinese subsidiary of such overseas listed company, and complete certain procedures. We and our employees who are Chinese citizens or who reside in China for a continuous period of not less than one year and who participate in our stock incentive plan are subject to such regulation. In addition, the State Taxation Administration of the PRC, or SAT, has issued circulars concerning employee stock options or restricted shares. Under these circulars, employees working in China who exercise stock options, or whose restricted shares vest, will be subject to Chinese individual income tax (”IIT”). The Chinese subsidiaries of an overseas listed company have obligations to file documents related to employee stock options or restricted shares with relevant tax authorities and to withhold IIT of those employees related to their stock options or restricted shares. If the employees fail to pay, or the Chinese subsidiaries fail to withhold, their IIT according to relevant laws, rules and regulations, the Chinese subsidiaries may face sanctions imposed by the tax authorities or other Chinese government authorities.

64



Regulations Relating to Dividend Distribution
Pursuant to the PRC Company Law and Foreign Investment Law, and Regulations on Implementing the Foreign Investment Law of the People’s Republic of China, foreign investors may freely remit into or out of China, in RMB or any other foreign currency, their capital contributions, profits, capital gains, income from asset disposal, intellectual property royalties, lawfully acquired compensation, indemnity or liquidation income and so on within the territory of China.
In January 2017, SAFE issued the Notice on Improving the Check of Authenticity and Compliance to Further Promote Foreign Exchange Control, which stipulates several capital control measures with respect to outbound remittance of profits from domestic entities to offshore entities, including the following: (i) under the principle of genuine transaction, banks shall check board resolutions regarding profit distribution, the original version of tax filing records and audited financial statements; and (ii) domestic entities shall hold income to account for previous years’ losses before remitting the profits. Moreover, domestic entities shall provide detailed explanations of the sources of capital and the utilization arrangements and board resolutions, contracts and other proof when completing the registration procedures in connection with an outbound investment.
Regulations Relating to Foreign Exchange
The principal regulations governing foreign currency exchange in China are the Foreign Exchange Administration Regulations, most recently amended in August 2008. Under the Foreign Exchange Administration Regulations, payments of current account items, such as profit distributions and trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions can be made in foreign currencies without prior approval from SAFE by complying with certain procedural requirements. However, approval from or registration with appropriate government authorities is required where RMB is to be converted into foreign currency and remitted out of China to pay capital expenses such as the repayment of foreign currency-denominated loans.
In August 2008, SAFE issued the Circular on the Relevant Operating Issues Concerning the Improvement of the Administration of the Payment and Settlement of Foreign Currency Capital of Foreign-Invested Enterprises (“SAFE Circular 142”), regulating the conversion by a foreign-invested enterprise of foreign currency-registered capital into RMB by restricting how the converted RMB may be used. SAFE Circular 142 provides that the RMB capital converted from foreign currency registered capital of a foreign-invested enterprise may only be used for purposes within the business scope approved by the applicable government authority and may not be used for equity investments within China. SAFE also strengthened its oversight of the flow and use of the RMB capital converted from foreign currency registered capital of foreign-invested enterprises. The use of such RMB capital may not be changed without SAFE’s approval, and such RMB capital may not in any case be used to repay RMB loans if the proceeds of such loans have not been used. In March 2015, SAFE issued the Circular of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Reforming the Management Approach regarding the Settlement of Foreign Exchange Capital of Foreign-invested Enterprises (“SAFE Circular 19”), which became effective and replaced SAFE Circular 142 on June 1, 2015. Although SAFE Circular 19 allows for the use of RMB converted from the foreign currency- denominated capital for equity investments in China, the restrictions continue to apply as to foreign-invested enterprises’ use of the converted RMB for purposes beyond the business scope, for entrusted loans or for inter-company RMB loans. SAFE promulgated the Notice of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Reforming and Standardizing the Foreign Exchange Settlement Management Policy of Capital Account (“SAFE Circular 16”) effective on June 9, 2016, which reiterates some of the rules set forth in SAFE Circular 19, but changes the prohibition against using RMB capital converted from foreign currency-denominated registered capital of a foreign-invested company to issue RMB entrusted loans to a prohibition against using such capital to issue loans to unassociated enterprises. Violations of SAFE Circular 19 or SAFE Circular 16 could result in administrative penalties.
The Circular of Further Improving and Adjusting Foreign Exchange Administration Policies on Foreign Direct Investment was promulgated by SAFE in November 2012 and amended in May 2015, which substantially amends and simplifies the current foreign exchange procedure. Pursuant to this circular, the opening of 

65



various special purpose foreign exchange accounts (e.g., pre-establishment expenses accounts, foreign exchange capital accounts and guarantee accounts), the reinvestment of lawful incomes derived by foreign investors in China (e.g., profit, proceeds of equity transfer, capital reduction, liquidation and early repatriation of investment), and purchase and remittance of foreign exchange as a result of capital reduction, liquidation, early repatriation or share transfer in a foreign-invested enterprise no longer require SAFE approval, and multiple capital accounts for the same entity may be opened in different provinces, which was not possible before. In addition, SAFE promulgated the Circular on Printing and Distributing the Provisions on Foreign Exchange Administration over Domestic Direct Investment by Foreign Investors and the Supporting Documents in May 2013, which specifies that the administration by SAFE or its local branches over direct investment by foreign investors in China shall be conducted by way of registration and banks shall process foreign exchange business relating to the direct investment in China based on the registration information provided by SAFE and its branches.
In February 2015, SAFE promulgated the Circular on Further Simplifying and Improving the Policies Concerning Foreign Exchange Control on Direct Investment (“SAFE Circular 13”), which took effect on June 1, 2015. SAFE Circular 13 delegates the authority to enforce the foreign exchange registration in connection with the inbound and outbound direct investment under relevant SAFE rules to certain banks and therefore further simplifies the foreign exchange registration procedures for inbound and outbound direct investment.
Regulations on Securities Offering and Listing Outside of China
On February 17, 2023, the CSRC promulgated a new set of regulations consisting of the Trial Administrative Measures of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies (the “Trial Measures”) and five supporting guidelines which will come into effect on March 31, 2023 to regulate overseas securities offering and listing activities by domestic companies either in direct or indirect form.
The Trial Measures and supporting guidelines apply to overseas offerings by domestic companies of equity shares, depositary receipts, convertible corporate bonds, or other equity-like securities, and overseas listing of the securities for trading. Both direct and indirect overseas securities offering and listing by domestic companies would be regulated, of which the former refers to securities offering and listing in an overseas market made by a joint-stock company incorporated domestically, and the latter refers to securities offering and listing in an overseas market made in the name of an offshore entity, while based on the underlying equity, assets, earnings or other similar rights of a domestic company which operates its main business domestically. According to the Trial Measures, if an issuer meets the following conditions, the offering and listing shall be determined as an indirect overseas offering and listing by a domestic company: (i) the total assets, net assets, revenues or gross profits of the domestic company(ies) of the issuer in the most recent financial year account for more than 50% of the corresponding figure in the issuer’s audited consolidated financial statements over the same period; (ii) the majority of the senior management in charge of business operation and management of the issuer are Chinese citizens or habitually reside in China, or its main places of business operation are located in China or main parts of its business activities are conducted in China.
Under the Trial Measures and supporting guidelines, a filing-based regulatory system would be implemented covering both direct and indirect overseas offering and listing. For an indirect initial public offering and listing in an overseas market, the issuer shall designate a major domestic operating entity to submit the filing documents to the CSRC, including but not limited to the prospectus within three working days after such application of overseas offering and listing is submitted. The CSRC would, within 20 working days if filing documents are complete and in compliance with the stipulated requirements, complete the filing and publish the filing information on the CSRC’s official website. While for confidential filings of overseas offering and listing application documents, the designated filing entity may apply for an extension of the publication of such filing. The issuer shall report to the CSRC within three working days after the overseas offering and listing application documents become public. In addition, subsequent securities offerings of an issuer in the same overseas market where it has previously offered and listed securities shall be filed with the CSRC within three working days after the offering is completed.

66



Meanwhile, overseas offering and listing would be prohibited under certain circumstances, including but not limited to that (i) the offering and listing are expressly forbidden by the Chinese laws, regulations and relevant rules; (ii) the intended overseas securities offering and listing may endanger national security as reviewed and determined by competent authorities under the State Council in accordance with laws or (iii) there are material disputes with regard to the ownership of the equity held by the domestic company’s controlling shareholder or by other shareholders that are controlled by the controlling shareholder and/or actual controller. If a domestic company falls into the circumstances where overseas offering and listing is prohibited prior to the overseas offering and listing, the domestic company shall postpone or terminate the intended overseas offering and listing, and report to the CSRC and competent authorities under the State Council in a timely manner.
If domestic companies fail to fulfill the above-mentioned filing procedures or offer and list in an overseas market against the prohibited circumstances, they would be warned and fined up to RMB 10 million. The controlling shareholders and actual controllers of such domestic companies that organize or instruct the aforementioned violations would be fined up to RMB10 million and directly liable persons-in-charge and other directly liable persons would be each fined up to RMB 5 million. Other Chinese National- and Provincial-Level Laws and Regulations.
Other Chinese National- and Provincial-Level Laws and Regulations
We are subject to changing regulations under many other laws and regulations administered by governmental authorities at the national, provincial and municipal levels, some of which are or may become applicable to our business. For example, regulations control the confidentiality of patients’ medical information and the circumstances under which patient medical information may be released for inclusion in our databases, or released by us to third parties. These laws and regulations governing both the disclosure and the use of confidential patient medical information may become more restrictive in the future.
Employees and Human Capital Resources
