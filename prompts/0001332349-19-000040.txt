Item 1. | Business.

Unless otherwise specified, references to "Brookdale," "we," "us," "our" or "the Company" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K mean Brookdale Senior Living Inc. together with its consolidated subsidiaries.
Our Business
As of December 31, 2018, we are the largest operator of senior living communities in the United States based on total capacity, with 892 communities in 45 states and the ability to serve approximately 84,000 residents. We offer our residents access to a full continuum of services across the most attractive sectors of the senior living industry. We operate and manage independent living, assisted living, memory care and continuing care retirement communities ("CCRCs"). We also offer a range of home health, hospice and outpatient therapy services to residents of many of our communities and to seniors living outside of our communities.
We believe that we operate in the most attractive sectors of the senior living industry, and our goal is to be the first choice in senior living by being the nation’s most trusted and effective senior living provider and employer. With our range of community and service offerings, we believe that we are positioned to take advantage of favorable demographic trends over time. Our community and service offerings combine housing with hospitality and healthcare services. Our senior living communities offer residents a supportive home-like setting, assistance with activities of daily living ("ADL") such as eating, bathing, dressing, toileting and transferring/walking and, in certain communities, licensed skilled nursing services. We also provide home health, hospice and outpatient therapy services to residents of many of our communities and to seniors living outside of our communities. By providing residents with a range of service options as their needs change, we provide greater continuity of care, enabling seniors to age-in-place, which we believe enables them to maintain residency with us for a longer period of time. The ability of residents to age-in-place is also beneficial to our residents and their families who are concerned with care decisions for their elderly relatives.
Strategy
Our strategy is to win locally by providing choices for high quality care and personalized service by caring associates while leveraging our industry-leading scale and experience. We believe that successfully executing on our strategy will improve our operations and provide attractive long-term returns to our stockholders. Our strategy is focused on three priorities:

• | Associates. Brookdale’s culture is based on servant leadership, and our associates are the key to attracting and caring for residents and patients and improving our operations. Through this strategic priority, we intend to attract, engage, develop and retain the best associates by maintaining a compelling value proposition in the areas of compensation, leadership, career growth and meaningful work. We continue to execute on our three-year plan initiated in 2017 to invest above the industry to improve our associate total rewards program and our performance management, training and development program for our community leaders and staff. We believe engaged associates lead to an enhanced resident experience and lower turnover, leading to improved operations. 


• | Residents, Patients and Their Families. Brookdale continues to be driven by its mission to enrich the lives of those we serve with compassion, respect, excellence and integrity. We believe that earning the trust of our residents, patients and their families will allow us to build relationships that create passionate advocates and generate referrals. Through this strategic priority, we intend to provide excellent customer service and expand referral development programs in order to earn the trust of our customers and the communities in which we operate and ultimately increase our move-ins and reduce our controllable move-outs. 


• | Winning Locally and Leveraging Scale Effectively. We intend to win locally while also leveraging our scale. With this priority, we are committed to completing our community-level capital expenditures as planned, maintaining the quality of our communities and their operations, and aligning our sales, marketing and operations teams to drive top line performance. We also are executing on plans to improve our sales process, to prioritize communities with the most opportunities for improvements and to ensure that our communities are ready for new competition. 

In the near term, we plan to focus on our operations improvement and the expansion of our healthcare services to residents and seniors living outside of our communities. We also plan to make significant additional near-term investments in our communities, including increased spend attributable to major building infrastructure projects, in order to ensure that our communities are in appropriate physical condition to support our strategy and to protect the value of our community portfolio. We also plan to complete our remaining real estate transactions announced in 2018. This plan includes the terminations of management arrangements on 
5

communities that we previously leased or managed on behalf of former unconsolidated ventures and exercising our options to cause terminations of our triple-net lease obligations on communities with annual base rent of up to $35 million. We will also continue to invest in our Program Max initiative through which we expand, renovate, reposition or redevelop selected existing senior living communities.
Over the longer term, we plan to further invest for growth and opportunistically return capital to stockholders while maintaining a strong balance sheet. We plan to explore additional products and services that we may offer to our residents and, where opportunities arise, pursue development, investment and acquisition opportunities such as selective acquisitions of senior living communities and operating companies. Any such activity may be pursued on our own or through venture investments with third parties. In addition, we will continue to evaluate our owned and leased community portfolios for opportunities to better align our communities to our strategy.
We believe that our successful execution on these strategic priorities and our longer-term plans will allow us to achieve our goal to be the first choice in senior living by being the nation’s most trusted and effective senior living provider and employer.
Recent Developments 
Portfolio Optimization and Other Transaction Updates
We have significantly reduced the size of our community portfolio following our acquisition of Emeritus Corporation in 2014. Our acquisition of Emeritus had increased our consolidated community portfolio by 493 communities and significantly increased our scale and provided us entry into 10 new states. Following our integration of Emeritus, during 2016 through 2018 we undertook an initiative to optimize our community portfolio under which we disposed of owned and leased communities and restructured leases in order to simplify and streamline our business, increase the quality and durability of our cash flow, improve our liquidity, and reduce our debt and lease leverage. Further, in 2018 we evaluated our owned-community portfolio for opportunities to monetize select high-value communities. 
From 2016 through 2018, we disposed of an aggregate of 75 owned communities as a result of these initiatives and other transactions (50 in 2016, 3 in 2017 and 22 in 2018). We also entered into agreements with our largest lessors that restructured a significant portion of our triple-net lease obligations. As a result of the transactions with HCP, Inc. announced in 2016 and 2017 and Ventas, Inc. and Welltower Inc. announced in 2018, as well as other lease expirations and terminations, our triple-net lease obligations on an aggregate of 201 communities were terminated from 2016 to 2018 (7 in 2016, 105 in 2017 and 89 in 2018). During this period we also sold our ownership interests in seven unconsolidated ventures and acquired six communities that we previously leased or managed. As of December 31, 2018, we owned 344 communities, leased 343 communities, managed 18 communities on behalf of unconsolidated ventures, and managed 187 communities on behalf of third parties. The charts below show the foregoing changes in our portfolio from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2018.
During the year ending December 31, 2019, we expect to close on the dispositions of 13 owned communities classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2018. For the year we also anticipate terminations of our management arrangements with third parties as we transition to new operators our interim management on formerly owned or leased communities and our management on certain former unconsolidated ventures in which we sold our interest. The closings of the various pending and expected transactions 
6

are, or will be, subject to the satisfaction of various closing conditions, including (where applicable) the receipt of regulatory approvals. However, there can be no assurance that the transactions will close or, if they do, when the actual closings will occur.
See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for a summary of the foregoing completed and expected transactions and their impact on our results of operations.
Increased Competitive Pressures
New openings of senior housing communities has subjected the senior housing industry and us to increased competitive pressures in recent years. Data from the National Investment Center for the Seniors Housing & Care Industry ("NIC") shows that industry occupancy began to decrease starting in 2016 as a result of new openings and oversupply. During and since 2016 we have experienced an elevated rate of competitive new openings, with significant new competition opening in several of our markets, which has adversely affected our occupancy, revenues, results of operations and cash flow. We expect the elevated rate of competitive new openings and pressures on our occupancy and rate growth to continue through 2019. Such increased level of new openings, as well as lower levels of unemployment generally, have also contributed to wage pressures and increased competition for community leadership and personnel. We continue to address new competition by focusing on operations with the objective to ensure high customer satisfaction, retain key leadership and actively engage district and regional management in community operations; enhancing our local and national marketing and public relations efforts; and evaluating current community position relative to competition and repositioning if necessary (e.g., services, amenities, programming and price). We also continue to execute on our 3-year plan initiated in 2017 to invest above industry to improve the total rewards program and performance management, training and development program for our community leaders and staff. 
Planned Capital Expenditures
During 2018 we completed an intensive review of our community-level capital expenditure needs with a focus on ensuring that our communities are in appropriate physical condition to support our strategy and determining what additional investments are needed to protect the value of our community portfolio. As a result of that review, we have budgeted to make significant additional near-term investments in our communities, a portion of which will be reimbursed by our lessors. In the aggregate, we expect our full-year 2019 non-development capital expenditures, net of anticipated lessor reimbursements, to be approximately $250 million. For 2019, this includes an increase of approximately $75 million in our community-level capital expenditures relative to 2018, primarily attributable to major building infrastructure projects. We anticipate that our 2019 capital expenditures will be funded from cash on hand, cash flows from operations, and, if necessary, amounts drawn on our secured credit facility. We expect that our 2020 community-level capital expenditures will continue to be elevated relative to 2018, but lower than 2019. 
The Senior Living Industry
The senior living industry has undergone dramatic growth in the last twenty years, marked by the emergence of assisted living communities in the mid-1990s, and it remains highly fragmented with numerous local and regional operators. According to NIC data, there were more than 2,300 local and regional senior housing operators as of December 31, 2018, of which more than 90% operated five or fewer communities. We are one of a limited number of large operators that provide a broad range of community locations and service level offerings at varying price levels.
Beginning in 2007, the senior housing industry was affected negatively by the downturn in the general economy, which resulted in a near halt in construction of new communities. The industry experienced a slow recovery in occupancy and rate growth beginning in 2010 according to NIC. In more recent years, as the economy has improved and demographic trends favorable to the industry have drawn nearer, the industry has attracted increased investment resulting in increased construction and development of new senior housing supply. New openings of senior housing communities and oversupply have subjected the senior housing industry to increased competitive pressures in recent years. Data from NIC shows that industry occupancy began to decrease starting in 2016 as a result of new openings and oversupply.  
We believe that a number of trends will contribute to the continued growth of the senior living industry in coming years. As a result of scientific and medical breakthroughs over the past 30 years, seniors are living longer. Due to demographic trends, and continuing advances in science, nutrition and healthcare, the senior population will continue to grow, and we expect the demand for senior housing and healthcare services to continue to increase in future years. The primary market of the senior living industry is individuals age 80 and older. According to United States Census data, that group’s population is projected to increase by nearly 50% to a population of 20 million by 2030. 
We believe the senior living industry has been and will continue to be impacted by several other trends. Although seniors are living longer, they are experiencing soaring rates of Alzheimer’s and other dementias and the growing burden of chronic diseases and 
7

conditions. As a result of increased mobility in society, a reduction of average family size and increased number of two-wage earner couples, families struggle to provide care for seniors and therefore look for alternatives outside of their family for care. There is a growing consumer awareness among seniors and their families concerning the types of services provided by senior living operators, which has further contributed to the demand for senior living services. 
Challenges in our industry include increased state and local regulation of the assisted living, memory care and skilled nursing sectors, which has led to an increase in the cost of doing business. The regulatory environment continues to intensify in the number and types of laws and regulations affecting us, accompanied by increased enforcement activity by state and local officials. Like other companies, our financial results may be negatively impacted by increasing salaries, wages and benefits costs for our associates. Increases in the costs of food, utilities, insurance, and real estate taxes may also have a negative impact on our financial results.
In addition, there continue to be various federal and state legislative and regulatory proposals to implement cost containment measures that would limit payments to healthcare providers in the future. We cannot predict what action, if any, Congress will take on reimbursement policies of the Medicare or Medicaid programs or what future rule changes the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services ("CMS") will implement. Changes in the reimbursement rates or methods or timing of government reimbursement programs could adversely affect our revenues, results of operations and cash flow.
Competition
The senior living industry is highly competitive. We compete with numerous organizations, including not-for-profit entities, that offer similar communities and services, such as home health care and hospice agencies, community-based service programs, retirement communities, convalescent centers and other senior living providers. In general, regulatory and other barriers to competitive entry in the independent living, assisted living and memory care sectors of the senior living industry are not substantial. Consequently, we may encounter competition that could limit our ability to attract new residents and associates, to retain existing residents and associates, and to raise or maintain resident fees and expand our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our occupancy, revenues, results of operations and cash flows. Our major publicly-traded senior housing competitors are Capital Senior Living Corporation and Five Star Senior Living, Inc. Our major private senior housing competitors include Holiday Retirement, Life Care Services, LLC, and Sunrise Senior Living, LLC, as well as a large number of not-for-profit entities. 
Over the long term we plan to evaluate and, where opportunities arise, pursue development, investment and acquisition opportunities such as selective acquisitions of senior living communities and operating companies. The market for acquiring and/or operating senior living communities is highly competitive, and some of our present and potential senior living competitors have, or may obtain, greater financial resources than us and may have a lower cost of capital. In addition, several publicly-traded and non-traded real estate investment trusts, or REITs, and private equity firms have similar objectives as we do, along with greater financial resources and/or lower costs of capital than we are able to obtain. Partially as a result of tax law changes enacted through RIDEA, we now compete more directly with the various publicly-traded healthcare REITs for the acquisition of senior housing properties, the largest of which are HCP, Inc., Ventas, Inc. and Welltower Inc.
Our History
Brookdale Senior Living Inc. was formed as a Delaware corporation in June 2005 for the purpose of combining two leading senior living operating companies, Brookdale Living Communities, Inc. and Alterra Healthcare Corporation, which had been operating independently since 1986 and 1981, respectively. On November 22, 2005, we completed our initial public offering of common stock, and on July 25, 2006, we acquired American Retirement Corporation, another leading senior living provider that had been operating independently since 1978. On September 1, 2011, we completed the acquisition of Horizon Bay, which was the then-ninth largest operator of senior living communities in the United States. On July 31, 2014, we completed our acquisition by merger of Emeritus Corporation, which was the then-second largest operator of senior living communities in the United States.
Segments
As of December 31, 2018, we had five reportable segments: Independent Living; Assisted Living and Memory Care; CCRCs; Health Care Services; and Management Services. These segments were determined based on the way that our chief operating decision maker organizes our business activities for making operating decisions, assessing performance, developing strategy and allocating capital resources. Prior to this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we referred to the Independent Living segment as our Retirement Centers segment, the Assisted Living and Memory Care segment as our Assisted Living segment, and the Health Care Services segment as our Brookdale Ancillary Services segment. The name changes had no effect on the underlying methodology related to, or results of operations of, our segments.

Communities that we own or lease are included in the Independent Living, Assisted Living and Memory Care, or CCRC segment, as applicable. The home health, hospice and outpatient therapy services provided to our residents and seniors living outside of our communities are generally included in the Health Care Services segment, while skilled nursing and inpatient healthcare services provided in our skilled nursing units are included in the CCRC segment. Communities that we manage on behalf of third parties or unconsolidated ventures in which we have an ownership interest are included in the Management Services segment. The chart below shows the number of communities and units within each of our senior housing and Management Services segments as of December 31, 2018.

Segments | Communities | Units | | % of Total Units | Average Number of Units per Community
Independent Living | 68 | | 12,419 | | 14.7 | % | 183
Assisted Living and Memory Care | 593 | | 37,500 | | 44.5 | % | 63 
CCRCs | 26 | | 6,573 | | 7.8 | % | 253
Managed | 205 | | 27,787 | | 33.0 | % | 136
Total | 892 | | 84,279 | | 100.0 | % | 94 

For the year ended December 31, 2018, we generated 81.5% of our resident fee revenue from private pay customers, 15.1% from government reimbursement programs (primarily Medicare) and 3.4% from other payor sources. Approximately 44.7% of our resident fee revenue was generated from owned communities, 42.6% was generated from leased communities and 12.7% was generated from our Health Care Services segment. The chart below shows the percentage of our resident fee and management fee revenue attributable to each of our segments for the year ended December 31, 2018. 

Segments | Revenue | | % of Total Revenue
Independent Living | $ | 599,977 | | | 17.0 | %
Assisted Living and Memory Care | 1,995,851 | | | 56.8 | % 
CCRCs | 416,408 | | | 11.8 | % 
Health Care Services | 436,975 | | | 12.4 | % 
Management Fees | 71,986 | | | 2.0 | % 
Total resident fee and management fee revenue | $ | 3,521,197 | | | 100.0 | %

Further operating results and financial metrics from our five segments are discussed further in "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and Note 20 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Our Community Offerings
We offer a variety of senior living communities in locations across the United States. The communities we operate and manage consist of independent living, assisted living and memory care communities, and CCRCs. The majority of our units are organized in campus-like settings or stand-alone communities containing multiple service levels.
Independent Living Communities
Our independent living communities are primarily designed for middle to upper income seniors who desire an upscale residential environment providing the highest quality of service. A number of our independent living residents relocate to one of our communities in order to be in a metropolitan area that is closer to their adult children. The majority of our independent living communities consist of both independent and assisted living units in a single community, which allows residents to age-in-place by providing them with a continuum of senior independent and assisted living services. While the number varies depending upon the particular community, as of December 31, 2018 approximately 78.5% of all of the units at our independent living communities were independent living units, with the balance of the units licensed for assisted living and memory care. 
Our independent living communities generally are large multi-story buildings averaging 183 units with extensive common areas and amenities. Residents may choose from studio, one-bedroom and two-bedroom units, depending upon the specific community.

Each independent living community provides residents with basic services such as meal service, 24-hour emergency response, housekeeping, concierge services, transportation and recreational activities. Most of these communities also offer custom tailored personal care services at an additional charge, which may include medication reminders, check-in services and escort and companion services.
In addition to the basic services, our independent living communities that include assisted living also provide residents with personal care service options to provide assistance with ADLs. The levels of care provided to residents vary from community to community depending, among other things, upon the licensing requirements and healthcare regulations of the state in which the community is located.
Residents in our independent living communities are able to maintain their residency for an extended period of time due to the range of service options available to residents (not including skilled nursing) as their needs change. Residents with cognitive or physical frailties and higher level service needs are accommodated with supplemental services in their own units or, in certain communities, are cared for in a more structured and supervised environment on a separate wing or floor. These communities also generally have a dedicated assisted living staff and separate assisted living dining rooms and activity areas.
Assisted Living and Memory Care Communities
Our assisted living and memory care communities offer housing and 24-hour assistance with ADLs to mid-acuity frail and elderly residents. Residents typically enter an assisted living or memory care community due to a relatively immediate need for services that may have been triggered by a medical event. Our assisted living and memory care communities include both freestanding, multi-story communities with more than 50 beds, and smaller, freestanding single story communities. Depending upon the specific location, the community may include (i) private studio, one-bedroom and one-bedroom deluxe apartments, or (ii) individual rooms for one or two residents in wings or "neighborhoods" scaled to a single-family home, which includes a living room, dining room, patio or enclosed porch, laundry room and personal care area, as well as a caregiver work station.
We also provide memory care services at freestanding memory care communities that are specially designed for residents with Alzheimer's and other dementias. Our freestanding memory care communities have approximately 20 to 70 beds and some are part of a campus-like setting which includes a freestanding assisted living community. As of December 31, 2018, we provide memory care services at 462 of our communities, aggregating 11,860 memory care units across our segments. These communities include 115 freestanding memory care communities with 4,473 units included in our Assisted Living and Memory Care segment. 
All residents at our assisted living and memory care communities are eligible to receive the basic care level, which includes ongoing health assessments, three meals per day and snacks, coordination of special diets planned by a registered dietitian, assistance with coordination of physician care, social and recreational activities, housekeeping and personal laundry services. In some locations we offer our residents exercise programs and programs designed to address issues associated with early stages of Alzheimer's and other dementias. In addition, we offer at additional cost, higher levels of personal care services to residents at these communities who are very physically frail or who require more frequent or intensive physical assistance or increased personal care and supervision due to cognitive impairments.
As a result of their progressive decline in cognitive abilities, residents at our memory care units typically require higher levels of personal care and services than in assisted living and therefore pay higher monthly service fees. Specialized services include assistance with ADLs, behavior management and an activities program, the goal of which is to provide a normalized environment that supports residents' remaining functional abilities. 
CCRCs
Our CCRCs are large communities that offer a variety of living arrangements and services to accommodate all levels of physical ability and health. Most of our CCRCs have independent living, assisted living and skilled nursing available on one campus or within the immediate market, and some also include Alzheimer's and dementia care services. Our CCRC residents are generally senior citizens who are seeking a community that offers a continuum of care so that they can age-in-place. These residents generally first enter the community as a resident of an independent living unit and may later move into an assisted living or skilled nursing area as their needs change.
Seventeen of our CCRCs, of which 16 are included in the Management Services segment, allow for residents in the independent living units to pay a one-time upfront entrance fee, typically $100,000 to $400,000, which is partially refundable in certain circumstances. We refer to these communities as entry fee CCRCs. The amount of the entrance fee varies depending upon the type and size of the dwelling unit, the type of contract plan selected, whether the contract contains a lifecare benefit (i.e., a healthcare discount) for the resident, the amount and timing of the refund, and other variables. These agreements are subject to regulations 
10

in various states. Residents under all of our entrance fee agreements also pay a monthly service fee, which entitles them to the use of certain amenities and services. Since entrance fees are paid upon initial occupancy, the monthly fees are generally less than fees at a comparable rental community. The refundable portion of a resident's entrance fee is generally refundable within a certain number of months or days following contract termination or upon the resale of the unit, or in some agreements, upon the resale of a comparable unit or 12 months after the resident vacates the unit. Some entrance fee agreements entitle the resident to a refund of the original entrance fee paid plus a percentage of the appreciation of the unit upon resale. 
Our Healthcare Services Offerings 
Through our Health Care Services segment we currently provide home health, hospice and outpatient therapy services, as well as education and wellness programs, to residents of many of our communities and to seniors living outside of our communities. As of December 31, 2018, our Health Care Services segment platform included networks in 28 states with the ability to provide home health services to approximately 60% of our units, hospice services to approximately 20% of our units, and outpatient therapy to approximately 15% of our units. Skilled nursing and inpatient healthcare services provided in our skilled nursing units are included in the CCRC segment. During the year ended 2018, we generated approximately 55% of our Health Care Services segment revenue from residents at our communities and approximately 45% from our patients outside our communities. 
The home health services we provide include skilled nursing, physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathology, home health aide services, and social services as needed. Our hospice services include clinical and skilled care, as well as spiritual and emotional counseling. Our outpatient therapy services include physical therapy, occupational therapy and speech language pathology services and other specialized therapy. The majority of our home health, hospice and outpatient therapy services are reimbursed by government reimbursement programs, primarily Medicare, and non-covered services are paid directly by residents from private pay sources. Our education and wellness programs focus on wellness and physical fitness to allow residents to maintain maximum independence. These services provide many continuing education opportunities for seniors and their families through health fairs, seminars, and other consultative interactions. We believe that our integrated healthcare services offerings are unique among senior housing operators and that we have a significant advantage over our senior housing competitors with respect to providing such services because of our established infrastructure, scale and experience.
Management Services
As of December 31, 2018, we managed 18 communities on behalf of unconsolidated ventures and 187 communities on behalf of third parties, which represented approximately 33.0% of our senior housing capacity. The chart below shows the type and number of communities and units contained in our Management Services segment as of December 31, 2018 and the percentage of our management fee revenue attributable to such communities for the year ended December 31, 2018.

Community Type | Communities | Units | % of Total Units | Management Fees | % of Total Management Fees
Independent Living | 31 | 5,434 | 19.5% | 11,538 | 16.0% 
Assisted Living and Memory Care | 134 | 10,907 | 39.3% | 25,119 | 34.9% 
CCRCs | 40 | 11,446 | 41.2% | 35,329 | 49.1% 
Total | 205 | 27,787 | 100.0% | 71,986 | 100.0% 

Under our management arrangements, we receive management fees, which are generally determined by an agreed upon percentage of gross revenues (as defined in the management arrangement), as well as reimbursed expenses, which represent the reimbursement of certain expenses we incur on behalf of the owners. A majority of our management arrangements as of December 31, 2018 are interim management arrangements entered into in connection with prior lease terminations that may be terminated by either party on short notice and without any reason, have a remaining term of approximately one year or less, or may be terminated by the owner within the next approximately one-year or less. Generally either party to our management arrangements may terminate upon the occurrence of an event of default caused by the other party, generally subject to cure rights. Several long-term agreements also provide for early termination rights of the owner which may in some cases require an early termination fee. In some cases, subject to our cure rights, if any, community owners may terminate us as manager if any licenses or certificates necessary for operation are revoked, if we do not satisfy certain designated performance thresholds or if the community is sold to an unrelated third party. Also, in some instances, a community owner may terminate the management agreement relating to a particular community if we are in default under other management agreements relating to other communities owned by the same owner or its affiliates. Certain of our management agreements, both with unconsolidated ventures and with entities owned by third parties, provide that an event of default under the debt instruments applicable to the ventures or the entities owned by third parties that is 
11

caused by us may also be considered an event of default by us under the relevant management agreement, giving the non-Brookdale party to the management agreement the right to pursue the remedies provided for in the management agreement, potentially including termination of the management agreement. Further, in the event of default on a loan, the lender may have the ability to terminate us as manager. With respect to communities held in unconsolidated ventures, the management agreement generally may be terminated in connection with the sale by the venture partner of its interest in the venture or the sale of properties by the venture. Termination, early or otherwise, or non-renewal of, or renewal on less-favorable terms, of our management arrangements could cause an unexpected loss in revenues and would negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows.
Approximately 50 of our management arrangements as of December 31, 2018 are interim in nature and were entered into with respect to communities for which leases have been terminated or sales of owned communities. We may enter into such arrangements in connection with future lease terminations or sales of owned communities. Pursuant to these arrangements, we have agreed to manage such formerly-leased or formerly-owned communities until the communities have been transitioned to new managers. Generally either party may terminate these interim management arrangements on short notice and for any reason, and we expect most of the arrangements as of December 31, 2018 to be terminated during 2019. 
During the year ended December 31, 2018, approximately 60.7% of our management fees revenue was derived from services provided to unconsolidated ventures in which HCP, Inc. held an interest, including 29.8% of our management fees revenue derived from services provided to our unconsolidated CCRC venture in which we share control with HCP, Inc. 
Competitive Strengths
We believe our national network of senior living communities and healthcare services networks are well positioned to benefit from the future growth and increasing demand in the industry. Some of our most significant competitive strengths are:

• | Skilled management team with extensive experience. Our senior management team and our Board of Directors have extensive experience in the senior living, healthcare and real estate industries, including the operation and management of a broad range of senior living assets.


• | Geographically diverse, high-quality, purpose-built communities. As of December 31, 2018, we are the largest operator of senior living communities in the United States based on total capacity, with 892 communities in 45 states and the ability to serve approximately 84,000 residents.


• | Ability to provide a broad spectrum of care. Given our diverse mix of independent living, assisted living and memory care communities and CCRCs, as well as our healthcare services offerings, we are able to meet a wide range of our residents’ and patients’ needs. We believe that we are one of the few companies in the senior living industry with this capability and the only company that does so at scale on a national basis. We believe that our multiple product offerings create marketing synergies and cross-selling opportunities.


• | The size of our business allows us to realize cost and operating efficiencies while continuing a local-community focus. The size of our business allows us to realize cost savings, economies of scale in the procurement of goods and services, and access to favorable debt and financing terms. Our scale also allows us to achieve increased efficiencies with respect to various corporate functions. We negotiate contracts for food, insurance and other goods and services with the advantages that scale provides. In addition, we leverage our centralized corporate functions such as finance, human resources, legal, information technology and marketing. We intend to utilize our expertise and size to capitalize on economies of scale resulting from our national platform and to enhance our residents’ and patients’ experiences. We believe that our geographic footprint and centralized infrastructure provide us with a significant operational advantage over local and regional operators of senior living communities.


• | Significant experience in providing healthcare services. Through our Health Care Services segment, we provide a range of home health, hospice, outpatient therapy, education, wellness and other services to residents of certain of our communities and to seniors outside our communities, which we believe is a distinct competitive difference among senior housing operators. We have significant experience in providing these services and expect to receive additional revenues as we expand our offerings of these services to additional residents and seniors living outside of our communities.

Seasonality
Our seniors housing business has typically experienced some seasonality, which we experience in certain regions more than others, due to weather patterns, geography and higher incidence and severity of flu and other illnesses during winter months. Although our seasonal pattern varies from year to year, our average monthly occupancy generally begins to decline sequentially during the 
12

fourth quarter of the year, and we generally expect average monthly occupancy to begin to increase towards the end of the second quarter each year.
Operations
Operations Overview
We have implemented intensive standards, policies and procedures and systems, including detailed staff manuals and training materials, which we believe have contributed to high levels of customer service. Further, we believe our centralized support infrastructure allows our community-based leaders and personnel to focus on resident care and family connections. 
Consolidated Corporate Operations Support
We have developed a centralized support infrastructure and services platform, which provides us with a significant operational advantage over local and regional operators of senior living communities. The size of our business also allows us to achieve increased efficiencies with respect to various corporate functions such as procurement, human resources, finance, accounting, legal, information technology and marketing. We are also able to realize cost efficiencies in the purchasing of food, supplies, insurance, benefits, and other goods and services. In addition, we have established centralized operations groups to support all of our product lines and communities in areas such as training, regulatory affairs, asset management, dining and procurement. We have also established company-wide policies and procedures relating to, among other things: resident care; community design and community operations; billing and collections; accounts payable; finance and accounting; risk management; development of employee training materials and programs; marketing activities; the hiring and training of management and other community-based personnel; compliance with applicable local and state regulatory requirements; and implementation of our acquisition, development and leasing plans.
Community Staffing and Training
Each community has an Executive Director responsible for the overall day-to-day operations of the community, including quality of care and service, social services and financial performance. Each Executive Director receives specialized training from us. In addition, a portion of each Executive Director's compensation is directly tied to the operating performance of the community and key care and service quality measures. We continue to take actions intended to simplify the role of our Executive Directors to allow them to focus on our residents and their families and our associates. We believe that the quality of our communities, coupled with our competitive compensation philosophy and our ability to provide industry-leading systems and training, has enabled us to attract high-quality, professional community Executive Directors.
Depending upon the size of the community, each Executive Director is supported by key leaders, a Health and Wellness Director (or nursing director) and/or a Sales Director. The Health and Wellness Director or nursing director is directly responsible for day-to-day care of residents. The Sales Director oversees the community’s sales, marketing and community outreach programs. Other key positions supporting each community may include individuals responsible for food service, healthcare services, activities, housekeeping, and maintenance.
We believe that quality of care and operating efficiency can be maximized by direct resident and staff contact. Employees involved in resident care, including the administrative staff, are trained in the support and care needs of the residents and emergency response techniques. We have adopted formal training and evaluation procedures to help ensure quality care for our residents. We have extensive policy and procedure manuals and hold regular training sessions for management and staff at each site.
Quality Assurance
We maintain quality assurance programs at each of our communities through our corporate and regional staff. Our quality assurance programs are designed to achieve a high degree of resident and family member satisfaction with the care and services that we provide. Our quality control measures include, among other things, community inspections conducted by corporate staff on a regular basis. These inspections cover the appearance of the exterior and grounds; the appearance and cleanliness of the interior; the professionalism and friendliness of staff; quality of resident care (including assisted living services, nursing care, therapy and home health programs); the quality of activities and the dining program; observance of residents in their daily living activities; and compliance with government regulations. Our quality control measures also include the survey of residents and family members on a regular basis to monitor their perception of the quality of services provided to residents. 
In order to foster a sense of community as well as to respond to residents' needs and desires, at many of our communities, we have established a resident council or other resident advisory committee that meets monthly with the Executive Director of the 
13

community. Separate resident committees also exist at many of these communities for food service, activities, marketing and hospitality. These committees promote resident involvement and satisfaction and enable community management to be more responsive to the residents' needs and desires. 
Marketing and Sales
Our marketing efforts are intended to create awareness of our Brookdale brand and services to motivate individuals interested in senior living to visit our communities. We target a variety of constituents who have a role in the decision-making process for senior housing and our healthcare services, including potential residents, their family members and referral sources, including the medical community (hospital discharge planners, physicians, skilled nursing facilities, home health agencies and social workers), professional organizations, employer groups, clergy, area agencies for the elderly, and paid referral organizations. Our marketing staff develops overall strategies for promoting our communities at the local and national level and monitors the success of our multi-layered marketing efforts, including local media and outreach programs, internet advertising, social media, print advertising, e-mail, direct mail, signage and special events, such as health fairs and community receptions. We utilize contact centers and the Brookdale website to handle hundreds of thousands of customer inquiries to schedule visits directly to our communities. Certain resident referral programs have been established and promoted at many communities within the limitations of federal and state laws.

We will continue to leverage our brand recognition while pursuing a multi-layered marketing approach. We have a Network Selling methodology, aimed at optimizing the customer experience as they consider the many options and care levels that we provide within the markets we serve. With our selling model, sales associates are organized to support communities directly as well as coordinate the sales efforts of multiple communities where we have density within markets. Additionally, we have segmented our communities to optimize levels of price, service offerings, amenities and programs offered based on local demand and supply so that we can create differentiated value to meet the needs of our customers.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 43,200 full-time employees and approximately 22,200 part-time employees, of which approximately 560 work in our Brentwood, Tennessee headquarters office and approximately 570 work in our Milwaukee, Wisconsin office. We currently consider our relationship with our employees to be good. During 2018 we eliminated our smaller regional support offices.
Industry Regulation
The regulatory environment surrounding the senior living industry continues to intensify in the number and type of laws and regulations affecting it. Federal, state and local officials are increasingly focusing their efforts on enforcement of these laws and regulations. This is particularly true for large for-profit, multi-community providers like us. Some of the laws and regulations that impact our industry include: state and local laws impacting licensure, protecting consumers against deceptive practices, and generally affecting the communities' management of property and equipment and how we otherwise conduct our operations, such as fire, health and safety laws and regulations and privacy laws; federal and state laws governing Medicare and Medicaid, which regulate allowable costs, pricing, quality of services, quality of care, food service, resident rights (including abuse and neglect) and fraud; federal and state residents' rights statutes and regulations; Anti-Kickback and physicians referral ("Stark") laws; and safety and health standards set by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. We are unable to predict the future course of federal, state and local legislation or regulation. Changes in the regulatory framework could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Many senior living communities are also subject to regulation and licensing by state and local health and social service agencies and other regulatory authorities. Although requirements vary from state to state, these requirements may address, among others, the following: personnel education, training and records; community services; staffing; physical plant specifications; furnishing of resident units; food and housekeeping services; emergency evacuation plans; emergency power generator requirements; professional licensing and certification of staff; and resident rights and responsibilities. In several of the states there are different levels of care that can be provided based on the level of licensure. In several of the states in which we operate or intend to operate, assisted living and memory care communities, home health agencies and/or skilled nursing facilities require a certificate of need before the community or agency can be opened or the services at an existing community can be expanded. Senior living communities may also be subject to state and/or local building, zoning, fire and food service codes and must be in compliance with these local codes before licensing or certification may be granted. These laws and regulatory requirements could affect our ability to expand into new markets and to expand our services and communities in existing markets.
14

Unannounced surveys or inspections may occur annually or bi-annually, or following a regulator's receipt of a complaint about the provider. From time to time in the ordinary course of business, we receive survey reports from state regulatory bodies resulting from such inspections or surveys. Most inspection deficiencies are resolved through a plan of corrective action relating to the community's operations, but the reviewing agency may have the authority to take further action against a licensed or certified community or agency, which could result in the imposition of fines, imposition of a provisional or conditional license, suspension or revocation of a license, suspension or denial of admissions, loss of certification as a provider under federal reimbursement programs or imposition of other sanctions, including criminal penalties. Loss, suspension or modification of a license may also cause us to default under our debt and lease documents and/or trigger cross-defaults. Sanctions may be taken against providers or facilities without regard to the providers' or facilities' history of compliance. We may also expend considerable resources to respond to federal and state investigations or other enforcement action under applicable laws or regulations. To date, none of the deficiency reports received by us has resulted in a suspension, fine or other disposition that has had a material adverse effect on our revenues. However, any future substantial failure to comply with any applicable legal and regulatory requirements could result in a material adverse effect to our business as a whole. In addition, states Attorneys General vigorously enforce consumer protection laws as those laws relate to the senior living industry. State Medicaid Fraud and Abuse Units may also investigate assisted living and memory care even if the community or any of its residents do not receive federal or state funds.
Regulation of the senior living industry is evolving at least partly because of the growing interests of a variety of advocacy organizations and political movements attempting to standardize regulations for certain segments of the industry, particularly assisted living and memory care. Our operations could suffer if future regulatory developments, such as federal assisted living and memory care laws and regulations, as well as mandatory increases in the scope and severity of deficiencies determined by survey or inspection officials or increase the number of citations that can result in civil or criminal penalties. Certain current state laws and regulations allow enforcement officials to make determinations on whether the care provided by one or more of our communities exceeds the level of care for which the community is licensed. Furthermore, certain states may allow citations in one community to impact other communities in the state. Revocation or suspension of a license, or a citation, at a given community could therefore impact our ability to obtain new licenses or to renew existing licenses at other communities, which may also cause us to be in default under our loan or lease agreements and trigger cross-defaults or may also trigger defaults under certain of our credit agreements, or adversely affect our ability to operate and/or obtain financing in the future. If a state were to find that one community's citation will impact another of our communities, this will also increase costs and result in increased surveillance by the state survey agency. If regulatory requirements increase, whether through enactment of new laws or regulations or changes in the enforcement of existing rules, including increased enforcement brought about by advocacy groups, in addition to federal and state regulators, our operations could be adversely affected. Any adverse finding by survey and inspection officials may serve as the basis for false claims lawsuits by private plaintiffs and may lead to investigations under federal and state laws, which may result in civil and/or criminal penalties against the community or individual.
There are various extremely complex federal and state laws governing a wide array of referrals, relationships and arrangements and prohibiting fraud by healthcare providers, including those in the senior living industry, and governmental agencies are devoting increasing attention and resources to such anti-fraud initiatives. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, and the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 expanded the penalties for healthcare fraud. With respect to our participation in federal healthcare reimbursement programs, the government or private individuals acting on behalf of the government may bring an action under the False Claims Act alleging that a healthcare provider has defrauded the government and seek treble damages for false claims and the payment of additional monetary civil penalties. The False Claims Act allows a private individual with knowledge of fraud to bring a claim on behalf of the federal government and earn a percentage of the federal government's recovery. Because of these incentives, so-called "whistleblower" suits have become more frequent.
Additionally, since we operate communities that participate in federal and/or state healthcare reimbursement programs, we are subject to federal and state laws that prohibit anyone from presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for reimbursement which are false, fraudulent or are for items or services that were not provided as claimed. Similar state laws vary from state to state. Violation of any of these laws can result in loss of licensure, citations, sanctions and other criminal or civil fines and penalties, the refund of overpayments, payment suspensions, or termination of participation in Medicare and Medicaid programs, which may also cause us to default under our debt and lease documents and/or trigger cross-defaults.
We are also subject to certain federal and state laws that regulate financial arrangements by healthcare providers, such as the Federal Anti-Kickback Law, the Stark laws and certain state referral laws. The Federal Anti-Kickback Law makes it unlawful for any person to offer or pay (or to solicit or receive) "any remuneration ... directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind" for referring or recommending for purchase any item or service which is eligible for payment under the Medicare and/or Medicaid programs. Authorities have interpreted this statute very broadly to apply to many practices and relationships between healthcare providers and sources of patient referral. If we were to violate the Federal Anti-Kickback Law, we may face criminal penalties and civil sanctions, including fines and possible exclusion from government reimbursement programs, which may also cause us to default under our leases and loan agreements and/or trigger cross-defaults. Adverse consequences may also result if 
15

we violate federal Stark laws related to certain Medicare and Medicaid physician referrals. While we endeavor to comply with all laws that regulate the licensure and operation of our senior living communities, it is difficult to predict how our revenues could be affected if we were subject to an action alleging such violations.
We are also subject to federal and state laws designed to protect the confidentiality of patient health information. The United States Department of Health and Human Services has issued rules pursuant to HIPAA relating to the privacy of such information. Rules that became effective in 2003 govern our use and disclosure of health information at certain HIPAA covered communities. We established procedures to comply with HIPAA privacy requirements at these communities. We were required to be in compliance with the HIPAA rule establishing administrative, physical and technical security standards for health information by 2005. To the best of our knowledge, we are in compliance with these rules.
Medicare and Medicaid Programs
We rely on reimbursement from government programs, including the Medicare program and, to a lesser extent, Medicaid programs, for a portion of our revenues. Reimbursements from Medicare and Medicaid represented 12.4% and 2.7%, respectively, of our total resident fee revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018. During the period, Medicare reimbursements represented 81.7% of our Health Care Services segment revenue, and Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements represented 20.9% of our CCRCs segment revenue.
Medicare is a federal program that provides certain hospital and medical insurance benefits to persons age 65 and over and certain disabled persons. We receive revenue for our home health, hospice, skilled nursing and outpatient therapy services from Medicare. Medicaid is a medical assistance program administered by each state, funded with federal and state funds pursuant to which healthcare benefits are available to certain indigent or disabled patients. We receive reimbursements under Medicaid (including state Medicaid waiver programs) for many of our assisted living and memory care communities.
These government reimbursement programs are highly regulated, involve significant administrative discretion, and are subject to frequent and substantial legislative, administrative and interpretive changes, which may significantly affect reimbursement rates and the methods and timing of payments made under these programs. Continuing efforts of government to contain healthcare costs could materially and adversely affect us, and reimbursement levels may not remain at levels comparable to present levels or may not be sufficient to cover the costs allocable to patients eligible for reimbursement. 
Medicare reimbursement for home health and skilled nursing services is subject to fixed payments under the Medicare prospective payment systems. In accordance with Medicare laws, CMS makes annual adjustments to Medicare payment rates in many prospective payment systems under what is commonly known as a “market basket update.” Each year, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (“MedPAC”), a commission chartered by Congress to advise it on Medicare payment issues, recommends payment policies to Congress for a variety of Medicare payment systems. Congress is not obligated to adopt MedPAC recommendations and based on previous years, there can be no assurance that Congress will adopt MedPAC’s recommendations in any given year.
Medicaid reimbursement rates for many of our assisted living and memory care communities also are based upon fixed payment systems. Generally, these rates are adjusted annually for inflation. However, those adjustments may not reflect actual increases of the cost of providing healthcare services. In addition, Medicaid reimbursement can be impacted negatively by state budgetary pressures, which may lead to reduced reimbursement or delays in receiving payments.
Audits and Investigations
As a result of our participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, we are subject to various government reviews, audits and investigations to verify our compliance with these programs and applicable laws and regulations. CMS has engaged a number of third party firms, including Recovery Audit Contractors (RAC), Zone Program Integrity Contractors (ZPIC), and Unified Program Integrity Contractors (UPIC) to conduct extensive reviews of claims data to evaluate the appropriateness of billings submitted for payment. Audit contractors may identify overpayments based on coverage requirements, billing and coding rules or other risk areas. In addition to identifying overpayments, audit contractors can refer suspected violations of law to government enforcement authorities. An adverse determination of government reviews, audits and investigations may result in citations, sanctions and other criminal or civil fines and penalties, the refund of overpayments, payment suspensions, or termination of participation in Medicare and Medicaid programs. Our costs to respond to and defend any such audits, reviews and investigations may be significant and are likely to increase in the current enforcement environment, and any resulting sanctions or criminal, civil or regulatory penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Healthcare Education and Reconciliation Act
To help fund the expansion of healthcare coverage to previously uninsured people, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Healthcare Education and Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “Affordable Care Act”), which became law in 2010, provides for certain reforms to the healthcare delivery and payment system aimed at increasing quality and reducing costs.
As it relates to our business, the Affordable Care Act provides for reductions to the annual market basket payment updates for home health and hospice agencies and additional annual “productivity adjustment” reductions to the annual market basket payment update as determined by CMS for skilled nursing facilities (beginning in federal fiscal year 2012), hospice agencies (beginning in federal fiscal year 2013), and home health agencies (beginning in federal fiscal year 2015). These reductions have, and could in the future, result in lower reimbursement than the previous year. The Affordable Care Act also provides for new transparency, reporting, and certification requirements for skilled nursing facilities.
Furthermore, the Affordable Care Act mandates changes to home health and hospice benefits under Medicare. For home health, the Affordable Care Act mandates creation of a value-based purchasing program, development of quality measures, a decrease in home health reimbursement beginning with federal fiscal year 2014 that was phased-in over a four-year period, a reduction in the outlier cap, and reinstatement of a 3% add-on payment for home health services delivered to residents in rural areas on or after April 1, 2010 and before January 1, 2016. The Affordable Care Act also requires the Secretary of HHS to test different models for delivery of care, some of which would involve home health services. It also requires the Secretary to establish a national pilot program for integrated care for patients with certain conditions, bundling payment for acute hospital care, physician services, outpatient hospital services, and post-acute care services, which would include home health. The Affordable Care Act further directed the Secretary of HHS to rebase payments for home health, which resulted in a decrease in home health reimbursement that began in 2014 and was phased-in over a four-year period. The Secretary is also required to conduct a study to evaluate costs and quality of care among efficient home health agencies regarding access to care and treating Medicare beneficiaries with varying severity levels of illness and to provide a report to Congress.
Potential efforts in the Congress to alter, amend, repeal or replace the Affordable Care Act, or to fail to fund various aspects of the Affordable Care Act, create additional uncertainty about the ultimate impact of the Affordable Care Act on us and the healthcare industry. The healthcare reforms and changes resulting from the Affordable Care Act, as well as other similar healthcare reforms, including any potential change in the nature of services we provide, the methods or amount of payment we receive for such services, and the underlying regulatory environment, could adversely affect our business, revenues, results of operations and cash flows.
The Improving Medicare Post-Acute Care Transformation Act of 2014
The Improving Medicare Post-Acute Care Transformation Act of 2014 (the “IMPACT Act”), which became law in 2014, requires standardized assessment data for quality improvement, payment, and discharge planning purposes across the spectrum of post-acute care, including home health, hospice and skilled nursing. The IMPACT Act will require such agencies and facilities to begin reporting standardized patient assessment data, new quality measures, and resource use measures. Failure to report such data when required would subject an agency or facility to a two percent reduction in market basket prices then in effect. The IMPACT Act further requires HHS and MedPAC to study, and report to Congress by 2022 regarding alternative post-acute care payment models, including payment based upon individual patient characteristics and not care setting. The IMPACT Act also includes provisions impacting Medicare-certified hospices, including increasing survey frequency to once every 36 months, imposing a medical review process for facilities with a high percentage of stays in excess of 180 days, and updating the annual aggregate Medicare payment cap.
The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015
The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (“MACRA”) became law in 2015. The legislation, among other things, permanently replaced the sustainable growth rate formula previously used to determine updates to Medicare fee schedule payments with quality and value measurements and participation in alternate payment models; extended the Medicare Part B outpatient therapy cap exception process until December 31, 2017; extended the 3% add-on payment for home health services delivered to residents in rural areas until December 31, 2017; and set payment updates for post-acute providers at 1% after other adjustments required by the Affordable Care Act for 2018. As part of federal budget legislation that became law on February 9, 2018, the Medicare Part B cap on outpatient therapy services was permanently repealed effective January 1, 2018.
Home Health Claim Review Demonstrations
In 2016, CMS announced that it would implement a 3-year Medicare pre-claim review demonstration for home health services in the states of Illinois, Florida, Texas, Michigan and Massachusetts. The pre-claim review is a process through which a request for provisional affirmation of coverage is submitted for review before a final claim is submitted for payment. CMS began the pre-
17

claim review demonstration in Illinois in August 2016, which CMS paused in April 2017. The pre-claim review demonstration resulted in increased administrative costs and reimbursement delays for our Illinois home health agency. In December 2018, CMS indicated it was continuing the process for obtaining approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act of a 5-year Medicare claim review demonstration for Illinois, which would be further expanded to Florida, Texas, North Carolina and Ohio. Under this Review Choice Demonstration as currently proposed, providers would have an initial choice of three options for review: pre-claim review, post-payment review, or minimal post-payment review with a 25% payment reduction for all home health services. We derive a significant portion of our home health revenue from these states. If implemented, the claim review demonstrations could adversely affect our revenue, results of operations and cash flows. 
Home Health Value-Based Purchasing 
On January 1, 2016, CMS implemented Home Health Value-Based Purchasing ("HHVBP"). The HHVBP model was designed to give Medicare certified home health agencies incentives or penalties, through payment bonuses, to give higher quality and more efficient care. HHVBP was rolled out to nine pilot states: Arizona, Florida, Iowa, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nebraska, North Carolina, Tennessee and Washington, six of which Brookdale currently has home health operations. Bonuses and penalties began in 2018 with the maximum of plus or minus 3% and are scheduled to grow to plus or minus 8% by 2022. Payment adjustments are calculated based on performance in 20 measures which include current Quality of Patient Care and Patient Satisfaction star measures, as well as measures based on submission of data to a CMS web portal. 
The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018
The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (the “BBA”), enacted in February 2018, includes several provisions impacting Medicare reimbursement to home health, hospice, and outpatient therapy providers. With respect to home health providers, the BBA (1) will base payment on a 30-day episode of care beginning January 1, 2020, coupled with annual determinations by CMS to ensure budget neutrality (including taking into account provider behavior), (2) will eliminate retroactive payment adjustments based upon the level of therapy services required beginning January 1, 2020, (3) extends the 3% add-on payment for home health services provided to residents in rural areas beginning January 1, 2018, coupled with a reduction and phase out of such add-on payment over the following four fiscal years, and (4) will establish a market basket update of 1.5% for the year beginning January 1, 2020. With respect to hospice providers, the BBA establishes a new payment policy related to early discharges to hospice care from hospitals. This policy imposed a financial penalty on hospitals for each early discharge to hospice care beginning October 1, 2018. With respect to outpatient therapy providers, the BBA permanently repeals the Medicare Part B outpatient therapy cap effective January 1, 2018 and continues the targeted medical review process with a reduction of the applicable threshold triggering such review to $3,000 effective January 1, 2018. 
CMS Final Rule 1689-FC for Medicare Home Health Prospective Payment 
In July 2018, CMS issued proposed payment changes for Medicare home health providers for 2019 and 2020. For 2019, CMS estimates that the net impact of the payment provisions of the proposed changes will result in an increase of 2.2% in reimbursement to home health providers and finalizes the methodology used to determine the rural add-on payment for 2019 through 2022 as well as regulations text changes regarding certifying and recertifying patient eligibility for Medicare home health services and remote patient monitoring. Additionally, the proposed rule includes changes to the home health prospective payment system ("HHPPS") case-mix adjustment methodology through the use of a new Patient-Driven Grouping Model ("PDGM") for home health payments. This change is proposed to be implemented January 1, 2020 and also includes a change in the unit of payment from 60-day episodes of care to 30-day episodes of care. 
Environmental Matters
Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real property, such as us, may be held liable in certain circumstances for the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances, including, among others, petroleum and materials containing asbestos, that could be located on, in, at or under a property, regardless of how such materials came to be located there. Additionally, such an owner or operator of real property may incur costs relating to the release of hazardous or toxic substances, including government fines and payments for personal injuries or damage to adjacent property. The cost of any required investigation, remediation, removal, mitigation, compliance, fines or personal or property damages and our liability therefore could exceed the property's value and/or our assets' value. The presence of such substances, or the failure to properly dispose of or remediate the damage caused by such substances, may adversely affect our ability to sell such property, to attract additional residents and retain existing residents, to borrow using such property as collateral or to develop or redevelop such property. Such laws impose liability for investigation, remediation, removal and mitigation costs on persons who disposed of or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances at third-party sites. Such laws and regulations often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence, release or 
18

disposal of such substances as well as without regard to whether such release or disposal was in compliance with law at the time it occurred. Moreover, the imposition of such liability upon us could be joint and several, which means we could be required to pay for the cost of cleaning up contamination caused by others who have become insolvent or otherwise judgment proof. We do not believe that we have incurred such liabilities that would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our operations are subject to regulation under various federal, state and local environmental laws, including those relating to: the handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of medical waste products generated at our communities; identification and warning of the presence of asbestos-containing materials in buildings, as well as removal of such materials; the presence of other substances in the indoor environment; and protection of the environment and natural resources in connection with development or construction of our properties.
Some of our communities generate infectious or other hazardous medical waste due to the illness or physical condition of the residents, including, for example, blood-contaminated bandages, swabs and other medical waste products and incontinence products of those residents diagnosed with an infectious disease. The management of infectious medical waste, including its handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal, is subject to regulation under various federal, state and local environmental laws. These environmental laws set forth the management requirements for such waste, as well as related permit, record-keeping, notice and reporting obligations. Each of our communities has an agreement with a waste management company for the proper disposal of all infectious medical waste. The use of such waste management companies does not immunize us from alleged violations of such medical waste laws for operations for which we are responsible even if carried out by such waste management companies, nor does it immunize us from third-party claims for the cost to cleanup disposal sites at which such wastes have been disposed. Any finding that we are not in compliance with environmental laws could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.
Federal regulations require building owners and those exercising control over a building's management to identify and warn, via signs and labels, their employees and certain other employers operating in the building of potential hazards posed by workplace exposure to installed asbestos-containing materials and potential asbestos-containing materials in their buildings. The regulations also set forth employee training, record-keeping requirements and sampling protocols pertaining to asbestos-containing materials and potential asbestos-containing materials. Significant fines can be assessed for violation of these regulations. Building owners and those exercising control over a building's management may be subject to an increased risk of personal injury lawsuits by workers and others exposed to asbestos-containing materials and potential asbestos-containing materials. The regulations may affect the value of a building containing asbestos-containing materials and potential asbestos-containing materials in which we have invested. Federal, state and local laws and regulations also govern the removal, encapsulation, disturbance, handling and/or disposal of asbestos-containing materials and potential asbestos-containing materials when such materials are in poor condition or in the event of construction, remodeling, renovation or demolition of a building. Such laws may impose liability for improper handling or a release to the environment of asbestos-containing materials and potential asbestos-containing materials and may provide for fines to, and for third parties to seek recovery from, owners or operators of real properties for personal injury or improper work exposure associated with asbestos-containing materials and potential asbestos-containing materials.
The presence of mold, lead-based paint, contaminants in drinking water, radon and/or other substances at any of the communities we own or may acquire may lead to the incurrence of costs for remediation, mitigation or the implementation of an operations and maintenance plan. Furthermore, the presence of mold, lead-based paint, contaminants in drinking water, radon and/or other substances at any of the communities we own or may acquire may present a risk that third parties will seek recovery from the owners, operators or tenants of such properties for personal injury or property damage. In some circumstances, areas affected by mold may be unusable for periods of time for repairs, and even after successful remediation, the known prior presence of extensive mold could adversely affect the ability of a community to retain or attract residents and could adversely affect a community's market value.
We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws.
We are unable to predict the future course of federal, state and local environmental regulation and legislation. Changes in the environmental regulatory framework (including legislative or regulatory efforts designed to address climate change, such as the proposed "cap and trade" legislation) could have a material adverse effect on our business. Because environmental laws vary from state to state, expansion of our operations to states where we do not currently operate may subject us to additional restrictions on the manner in which we operate our communities.
