General Overview
 
We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Colorado on January 12, 2000 under the name Capital Resources Alliance, Inc. At inception, we were a development stage company in the business of mining and exploration. On May 19, 2014 our company completed a reverse merger with Nate’s Pancakes, Inc., an Indiana company, with Nate’s Pancakes being the surviving entity. In May 2014, we changed our name from Capital Resource Alliance, Inc. to Nate’s Food Co.
 
In connection with the reverse merger, we became a food manufacturing and product company, and in May 2014, we executed a licensing agreement with Nate’s Pancakes to market and sell “Nate’s Homemade”, exclusively throughout the world.
 
On April 6, 2017, our board of directors and a majority of our shareholders approved the filing of Restated Articles of Incorporation to increase the authorized shares of common stock of our company from Five Hundred Million (500,000,000) to One Billion Five Hundred Million 1,500,000,000. The Restated Articles of Incorporation to effect the increase of common stock was filed with the Secretary of State for the State of Colorado on July 26, 2017.
 
Our Current Business
 
We are a food manufacturing and product company that manufactures, distributes and sells ready-to-use, pre-mixed pancake and waffle batter. We hold a 20 year worldwide exclusive license agreement for Nate’s Homemade. 
 
On August 23, 2016, we entered in to an arrangement with one of California’s largest aerosol producers to begin pilot production runs of Nate’s Homemade Pancake and Waffle Batter in order to start supplying Southern California grocery stores. This will enable our company to expand our current online sales activity to include distribution to regional grocery chains without impacting our ongoing development activities with ABCO Laboratories Inc. in Northern California.

License Agreement
 
Term
 
The license agreement is for a term of twenty (20) years. Our company has the right to renew the license agreement for successive ten (10) year period by paying $1,000,000 for each new term. 
 
Payments/Royalty
 
Our company shall pay a royalty equal to Three Percent (3%) of the Gross Revenue from the licensed products. Gross revenue is defined as total revenue minus discounts and allowances. The license requires that we pay a minimum monthly fee of $7,500 beginning twelve (12) months from the execution of the license agreement (June 1, 2015) which is against the 3% royalty. The fee began accruing on June 1, 2015. As at May 31, 2018 and May 31, 2017, accrued fees are $0 and $103,500 respectively, and is included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the accompanying financial statements.
 
Since the company temporarily halted all production in January 2018, halted sales on our on-line store shortly thereafter, the company has had no revenues since March 31, 2019.  The holders of the license have agreed to accept a buy-out of $0.00, and halt the accrual of any additional minimum fees in the future.  The company will, from April 1, 2019, be the sole owners of the intellectual property associated with the license agreement.
 
Product Ordering
 
Our company is able to purchase raw materials directly from 3rd party suppliers and manufacture the product for sales. Our company may also develop and create additional flavors such as chocolate, blueberry, or strawberry.
 
Buy-Out
 
Our company also has the option, at our election, to purchase the intellectual property associated to the license agreement.  Since the buy-out option is calculated to be an amount equal to the revenue for the 12 months immediately prior to the buy-out, the Company has elected to buy-out the license, effective March 1, 2019 
Our Product
 
Through Nate’s Homemade we sell a ready-to-use, pre-mixed pancake and waffle batter delivered in a pressurized can. Our current product is an original flavor of pancake and waffle batter. We are currently in the process of developing additional flavors and products with the goal to have 10 products in development in 2019. Currently, we have developed three flavors for our pancake and waffle mix and have begun development on a brownie batter. We plan to continue to expand into other baked goods and other non-breakfast areas.
Our Customers
 
We sell our products across the United States to a variety of customers through our online store at www.nateshomemade.com.
 
We have delivered samples and will continue to deliver samples of our products to retail chains such as Wal-Mart, Target, Sam’s Club, Costco, Kroger, BJ’s and Albertson’s and in retail stores and evaluate their interest of our product.
Sales and Marketing
 
To date, our sales have primarily been through our online store at www.nateshomemade.com. We continue presenting the product and providing samples to distributors and retailers. We have prepared several advertisements for placement in various grocery industry related journals and magazines, but we have not begun placement yet.
Manufacturing and Distribution
 
Raw materials used in our products include cans, valves, caps, flour and other commodities. We continuously monitor worldwide supply and cost trends of these raw materials to enable us to take appropriate action to obtain the ingredients and packaging we need for production. Although the prices of our principal raw materials may fluctuate based on adverse weather, the economy, and other conditions, we believe such raw materials to be generally available from numerous sources.
 
We currently utilize one production facility in the United States which manufactures and distributes our products.

Seasonality
 
Sales of our products are generally evenly distributed throughout the year.
 
Competition
 
We operate in a highly competitive environment. We have numerous competitors of varying sizes, including manufacturers of private label products, as well as manufacturers of other branded food products, which compete for trade merchandising support and consumer dollars. We compete with large conventional consumer packaged foods companies. We also compete with natural and organic consumer packaged foods companies. At present, there are no other companies manufacturing or distributing aerosol delivered pancake and waffle batters.
 
Competitive factors in our industry include product innovation, product quality, price, brand recognition and loyalty, product variety and ingredients, product packaging and package design, effectiveness of marketing and promotional activity, and our ability to identify and satisfy consumer tastes and preferences.
 
Compliance with Government Regulation
 
Food-Related Regulations
 
As a manufacturer and distributor of food products, we are subject to a number of food-related regulations, including the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and regulations promulgated thereunder by the FDA. This comprehensive regulatory framework governs the manufacture (including composition and ingredients), labeling, packaging, and safety of food in the United States. The FDA:

· | regulates holding, distribution and manufacturing practices for food ingredients and foods through its current good manufacturing practices regulations and periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to audit compliance;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | specifies the standards of identity for certain foods, including many of the products we sell; and 
· | prescribes the format and content of certain information required to appear on food product labels. 

 
In March 2014, the FDA issued a proposed rule that would make significant changes to the information appearing in, and the format of, the nutrition facts appearing on food labels. In July 2015, the FDA issued a supplemental proposed rule to establish a reference value for added sugars and to require a declaration of the percent daily value of added sugars on the food label. The proposed rule would also revise the footnote in the nutrition label regarding the percent daily value. It is not clear whether FDA will issue final regulation or, if it does, how much time FDA will give food manufactures to bring their labels into compliance.
 
In addition, the FDA enforces the Public Health Service Act and regulations issued thereunder, which authorizes regulatory activity necessary to prevent the introduction, transmission, or spread of communicable diseases. These regulations require, for example, pasteurization of milk and milk products. The FDA also is implementing the Food Safety Modernization Act of 2011 (“FSMA”) which, among other things, mandates that the FDA adopt preventive controls to be implemented by farms, warehouses, food facilities and transporters in order to minimize or prevent hazards to food safety. 
 
In September 2015, FDA released final rules implementing the Produce Safety and Current Good Manufacturing Practices, Hazard Analysis and Risk Based Preventive Controls (HARPC) requirements for human food and animal food, which was a major milestone in the implementation of FSMA. The final rules revise the FDA’s food safety regulations by: (1) codifying good agricultural practices and water fertilizer action limits, (2) updating and revising certain requirements in the existing current good manufacturing practices regulations (current 21 CFR Part 110), (3) requiring the establishment and implementation of a food safety system that includes an analysis of hazards and risk-based preventive controls and sets requirements for a written food safety plan, and (4) adding new requirements for a risk-based end-to-end supply chain program.

We are subject to numerous other federal, state, and local regulations involving such matters as the licensing and registration of manufacturing facilities, enforcement by government health agencies of standards for our products, inspection of our facilities, and regulation of our trade practices in connection with the sale of our products. In response to food-borne illness events, FDA scrutiny of the food and beverage industry has increased over the past few years, which has required food and beverage companies to dedicate additional resources to the areas regulated by the FDA.
 
Labeling Regulations
 
We are subject to various labeling requirements with respect to our products at the federal, state, and local levels. At the federal level, the FDA has authority to review product labeling, and the Federal Trade Commission may review labeling and advertising materials, including online and television advertisements to determine if advertising materials are misleading. Similarly, many states review dairy product labels to determine whether they comply with applicable state laws. In addition, the European Union has issued and enforces rules governing foodstuff labeling, nutrition, and health claims. We believe we are in material compliance with all labeling laws and regulations applicable to our business.
 
We believe that we are and will continue to be in compliance in all material respects with applicable statutes and the regulations passed in the United States. There are no current orders or directions relating to our company with respect to the foregoing laws and regulations.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We currently have the exclusive license to all intellectual property held by IPC, Inc., the Patent filed by Nate Steck for delivery of pancake and waffle batter contained in an aerosol can, as well as the our domain names and websites, www.natesfoodco.com and www.nateshomemade.com.
Employees
 
Other than our directors and officers, who provide their services to our company and independent consultants, we have no full time employees.
