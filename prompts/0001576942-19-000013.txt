Overview
Stitch Fix is transforming the way people find what they love, one client at a time and one Fix at a time.
Stitch Fix was inspired by the vision of a client-first, client-centric new way of retail. What people buy and wear matters. When we serve our clients well, we help them discover and define their styles, we find jeans that fit and flatter their bodies, we reduce their anxiety and stress when getting ready in the morning, we give them confidence in job interviews and on first dates, and we give them time back in their lives to invest in themselves or spend with their families. Most of all, we are fortunate to play a small part in our clients looking, feeling, and ultimately being their best selves.
We are reinventing the shopping experience by delivering one-to-one personalization to our clients through the combination of data science and human judgment. This combination drives a better client experience and a more powerful business model than either element could deliver independently.
Since our founding in 2011, we have helped millions of men, women, and kids discover and buy what they love through personalized shipments of apparel, shoes, and accessories, hand-selected by Stitch Fix stylists and delivered to our clients’ homes. We call each of these shipments a Fix. Clients can choose to schedule automatic shipments or order a Fix on demand after they fill out a style profile on our website or mobile app. For each Fix, we charge clients a styling fee that is credited toward items they purchase. Alternatively, select U.S. clients may purchase an annual Style Pass, which offers unlimited styling for the year for a $49 fee that is also credited towards items they purchase. After receiving a Fix, our clients purchase the items they want to keep and return the other items, if any, at no additional charge. In addition, our Extras feature allows clients to select items such as socks, bras, underwear, and other intimates that are then added to the items their stylist selects for their Fix. 
Stitch Fix was founded with a focus on Women’s apparel. In our first few years, we were able to gain a deep understanding of our clients and merchandise and build the capability to listen to our clients, respond to feedback, and deliver the experience of personalization. More recently, we have extended those capabilities into Petite, Maternity, Men’s, Plus, and Kids apparel, as well as shoes and accessories. Our stylists leverage our data science and apply their own judgment to hand select apparel, shoes, and accessories for our clients from a broad range of merchandise.
We are successful when we are able to help clients find what they love again and again, creating long-term, trusted relationships. Our clients share personal information with us, including detailed style, size, fit, and price preferences, as well as unique inputs, such as how often they dress for certain occasions or which parts of their bodies they like to flaunt or cover up. Our clients are motivated to share these personal details with us and provide us with ongoing feedback because they recognize that doing so will result in more personalized and successful experiences. This feedback also creates a valuable network effect by helping us to better serve other clients. As of August 3, 2019, we had 3,236,000 active clients. See the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Metrics” for information on how we define and calculate active clients.
The very human experience that we deliver is powered by data science. Our data science capabilities consist of our rich data set and our proprietary algorithms, which fuel our business by enhancing the client experience and driving business model efficiencies. The vast majority of our client data is provided directly and explicitly by the client, rather than inferred, scraped, or obtained from other sources. We also gather extensive merchandise data, such as inseam, pocket shape, silhouette, and fit. This large and growing data set provides the foundation for proprietary algorithms that we use throughout our business, including those that predict purchase behavior, forecast demand, optimize inventory, and enable us to design new apparel. We believe our data science capabilities give us a significant competitive advantage, and as our data set grows, our algorithms become more powerful.
Our stylists leverage our data science through a custom-built, web-based styling application that provides recommendations from our broad selection of merchandise. Our stylists then apply their judgment to select what they believe to be the best items for each Fix. Our stylists provide a personal touch, offer styling advice and context to each item selected, and help us develop long-term relationships with our clients.
We offer merchandise across multiple price points and styles from established and emerging brands, as well as our own private labels, which we call Exclusive Brands. Many of our brand partners also design and supply items exclusively for our clients.
In May 2019, we launched our service in the United Kingdom.
Industry Overview
Technology is Driving Transformation Across Industries
Technological innovation has profoundly impacted how consumers discover and purchase products, forcing businesses to adapt to engage effectively with consumers. We believe that new business models that embrace these changes and truly focus on the consumer will be the winners in this changing environment.
The Apparel, Shoes, and Accessories Market is Massive but Many Retailers have Failed to Adapt to Changing Consumer Behavior
The U.S. apparel, shoes, and accessories market is large, but we believe many brick-and-mortar retailers have failed to adapt to evolving consumer preferences. Euromonitor International Limited, or Euromonitor, a consumer market research company, estimated that the U.S. apparel, footwear, and accessories market was $359 billion in calendar 2018. Euromonitor expects this market to grow to $431 billion by calendar 2023, a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 3.7%. 
Euromonitor estimated that the UK apparel, footwear, and apparel accessories market was $72 billion in calendar 2018. Euromonitor expects this market to grow to $96 billion (in current prices) by calendar 2023, a CAGR of 6%.
Historically, brick-and-mortar retailers have been the primary source of apparel, shoes, and accessories sales in the United States. Over time, brick-and-mortar retail has changed and the era of salespersons who know each customer on a personal level has passed. We believe many of today’s consumers view the traditional retail experience as impersonal, time-consuming, and inconvenient. This has led to financial difficulties, bankruptcies, and store closures for many major department stores, specialty retailers, and retail chains. 
eCommerce is Growing, but has Further Depersonalized the Shopping Experience
The internet has created new opportunities for consumers to shop for apparel. eCommerce continues to take market share from brick-and-mortar retail. Euromonitor estimated that the eCommerce portion of the U.S. apparel, footwear and accessories market was $78.6 billion in calendar 2018. Euromonitor expects the eCommerce portion of this market to grow to $151 billion by calendar 2023, a CAGR of 14.0%. This represents an expansion of eCommerce penetration of the U.S. apparel, footwear, and accessories market from 21.9% of $359 billion in calendar 2018 to 35.1% of $431 billion in calendar 2023.
Euromonitor estimated that the eCommerce portion of the UK apparel, footwear, and accessories market was $14.8 billion in calendar 2018. Euromonitor expects the eCommerce portion to grow to $27 billion by calendar 2023, a CAGR of 13.0%. This represents an expansion of eCommerce penetration of UK apparel, footwear and apparel accessories market from 24.7% of $72 billion in calendar 2018 to 34.4% of $96 billion in calendar 2023.
The first wave of eCommerce companies prioritized low price and fast delivery. This transaction-focused model is well suited for commoditized products and when consumers already know what they want. However, we believe eCommerce companies often fall short when consumers do not know what they want and price and delivery speed are not the primary decision drivers. There is an overwhelming selection of apparel, shoes, and accessories available to consumers online, and searches and filters are poor tools when it comes to finding items that fit one’s style, figure, and occasion. eCommerce companies also lack the critical personal touchpoints necessary to help consumers find what they love, further depersonalizing the shopping experience.
Personalization is the Next Wave
To be relevant today, retailers must find a way to connect with consumers on a personal level and fit conveniently into their lifestyles. Personalization in retail can be difficult and nuanced, as consumers consider many factors that can be difficult to articulate, including style, size, fit, feel, and occasion. We believe that an intelligent combination of data science and human judgment is required to deliver the personalized retail experience that consumers seek.
Competition
The retail apparel industry is highly competitive. Our competitors include eCommerce companies that market apparel, shoes, and accessories; local, national, and global department stores; specialty retailers; discount chains; independent retail stores; and the online offerings of these traditional retail competitors. Additionally, we experience competition for consumer discretionary spending from other product and experiential categories.
We compete primarily on the basis of client experience, brand, product selection, quality, convenience, and price. We believe that we are able to compete effectively because we offer clients a personalized and fun shopping experience that our competitors are unable to match. 
See Part I, Item1A “Risk Factors—Our industry is highly competitive and if we do not compete effectively our operating results could be adversely affected” for more information.
Our Service
Stitch Fix combines data science and human judgment to deliver one-to-one personalization to our clients at scale. We help millions of clients discover and buy what they love through data-driven, personalized, hand-selected shipments of apparel, shoes, and accessories.
Our Data Science Advantage
Our data science capabilities fuel our business. These capabilities consist of our rich and growing set of detailed client and merchandise data and our proprietary algorithms. We use data science throughout our business, including to style our clients, predict purchase behavior, forecast demand, optimize inventory, and design new apparel.
Our data set is particularly powerful because:

• | the vast majority of our client data is provided directly and explicitly by the client, rather than inferred, scraped, or obtained from other sources;


• | our clients are motivated to provide us with relevant personal data, both at initial signup and over time as they use our service, because they trust it will improve their Fixes; and


• | our merchandise data tracks dimensions that enable us to predict purchase behavior and deliver more personalized Fixes.

On average, each client directly provides us with over 90 meaningful data points through his or her style profile, including detailed style, size, fit, and price preferences, as well as unique inputs such as how often he or she dresses for certain occasions or which parts of his or her body the client likes to flaunt or cover up. Over time, through their feedback on Fixes they receive, clients share additional information about their preferences as well as detailed data about both the merchandise they keep and return. Historically, over 85% of our shipments have resulted in direct client feedback. This feedback loop drives important network effects, as our client-provided data informs not only our personalization capabilities for the specific client, but also helps us better serve other clients. In addition, Style Shuffle, an interactive mobile and web-based feature in which participants rate an assortment of Stitch Fix merchandise, provides additional data to strengthen our understanding of client tastes and style preferences.
We believe our proprietary merchandise data set is differentiated from other retailers. We encode each of our SKUs with numerous information attributes to help our algorithms make better recommendations for our clients. The information we store for each SKU includes:

• | basic data, such as brand, size, color, pattern, silhouette, and material;


• | item measurements, such as length, width, diameter of sleeve opening, and distance from collar to first button;


• | nuanced descriptors, such as how appropriate the piece is for a client that prefers preppy clothing or whether it is appropriate for a formal event; and


• | client feedback, such as how the item fit a 5’10” client or how popular the piece is with young mothers.

Our algorithms use our data set to match merchandise to each of our clients. For every combination of client and merchandise, we compute the probability the client will keep that item based on her and other clients’ preferences and purchase history as well as the attributes and past performance of the merchandise. 
Pairing Data Science with Human Judgment
The combination of data science and human judgment drives a better client experience and a more powerful business model than either element could deliver independently. Our advanced data science capabilities harness the power of our data for our stylists by generating predictive recommendations to streamline our stylists’ individualized curation process. Stylists add a critical layer of contextual, human decision making that augments and improves our algorithms’ selections and ultimately produces a better, more personalized Fix for each client.
Our Differentiated Value Proposition
Our Value Proposition to Clients
Our clients love our service for many reasons. We help clients find apparel, shoes, and accessories that they love in a way that is convenient and fun. We save our clients time by doing the shopping, delivering Fixes right to their homes, allowing them to try on merchandise in the comfort of their homes and in the context of their own closets, and making the return process simple. Our expert styling service connects each client to a professional who will understand her fashion needs, hand select items personalized to her, and offer her ongoing style advice. Clients also value the quality and diversity of our merchandise as we deliver the familiar brands they know, offer items they can’t find anywhere else, and expand their fashion palette by exposing them to new brands and styles they might not have tried if they shopped for themselves. We often hear from clients that we have helped them find the perfect pair of jeans or discover a dress silhouette 
they never would have selected for themselves. In these situations, not only is our service more convenient, it is in fact more effective at helping clients find what they love. We proudly style men, women, and kids across ages, sizes, tastes, geographies, and price preferences.
Our Value Proposition to Brand Partners
We believe that we are a preferred channel and a powerful growth opportunity for our brand partners. Unlike many sales channels, we do not rely on discounts or promotions. Also, by introducing our clients to brands they may not have shopped for, we help our brand partners reach clients they may not have otherwise reached. Further, we provide our brand partners with insights based on client feedback that help our brand partners improve and evolve their merchandise to better meet consumer demand.
Our Strengths
Since we were founded in 2011, we have shipped millions of Fixes to our clients. We have achieved this success due to our following key strengths:

• | our rich client and merchandise data;


• | our expert data science team and proprietary and predictive algorithms;


• | our team of 5,100+ stylists;


• | our unique combination of data science and human judgment; and


• | our superior business model.

Our Strategy
We aim to transform the way people find what they love. We plan to achieve this goal by continuing to:

• | expand our relationships with existing clients;


• | acquire new clients; and


• | expand our addressable market.

How it Works
The Fix
A Fix is a Stitch Fix-branded box containing a combination of apparel, shoes, and accessories personally selected for a client by her Stitch Fix stylist and delivered to the client for her to try on in the comfort of her own home. She can keep some, all, or none of the items in the Fix and easily return any items in a prepaid-postage bag provided in the Fix. One of our stylists individually selects each item in a Fix for a client from a broad range of merchandise recommended to the stylist by our algorithms. These algorithmic recommendations are based on the client’s personal style profile, her own order behavior, the aggregate historical behavior of our client base, and the aggregate historical data we have collected on each item of merchandise we have available.
We have numerous touch points with our clients. Before a client receives his or her first Fix, he or she shares the following information with us:

• | Style profile. Upon registering, each client fills out a style profile on either our website or mobile application. The style profile allows us to introduce ourselves to a client, initiate a dialogue, and start gathering data.


• | Personal note to stylist. Each client can share a personal note with his or her stylist when placing a Fix order or after receiving a Fix. For example, a client might request shoes for a friend’s wedding or shorts for an upcoming vacation. These personal notes enable us to better personalize a Fix.

After completing her initial style profile, a client chooses her preferred order frequency and can select the exact date by which she wants to receive her Fix. We currently offer two types of Fix scheduling:

• | Auto-ship. A client can elect to auto-ship Fixes every two to three weeks, monthly, bi-monthly, or quarterly.


• | On-demand. Our on-demand option allows clients to schedule a one-time Fix at any time, either instead of or in addition to utilizing the auto-ship option. An on-demand client is prompted to schedule her next Fix each time she checks out, but is not obligated to do so.

We recognize that our clients have different needs, so our Fix frequency options are another way that we personalize the client experience. Each client can increase or decrease the Fix frequency at any time, and can also easily reschedule any given shipment to better accommodate her needs. Each Fix is delivered to the client’s address of choice.
We also offer Extras, a feature that allows clients to select items such as socks, bras, underwear, and other intimates that are then added to the items their stylist selects for their Fix.
In addition to a personalized selection of apparel, shoes, and accessories, each Fix also includes a personal note from the stylist and a style card to provide clients with outfit ideas for each item.
Once a client decides which items she wishes to keep she can easily check out and pick the delivery date for her next Fix via our website or mobile application.
During the checkout process, each client is invited to provide feedback about the fit, price, style, and quality of the items received. Historically, over 85% of shipments have resulted in direct client feedback. This feedback informs both our algorithms and stylists to improve each future Fix. We also gather feedback through Style Shuffle, an interactive mobile and web-based feature in which participants rate an assortment of Stitch Fix merchandise, providing additional data to strengthen our understanding of client tastes and style preferences.
We charge clients a styling fee of $20 in the United States and £10 in the UK for each Fix, which is credited toward the merchandise purchased. For our Style Pass clients, we charge a $49 annual fee in the United States, the only country where Style Pass is offered, which provides unlimited styling for the year and is credited toward the merchandise purchased over the course of the year. If the client chooses to keep all items chosen for them by their stylist, she receives a discount on the entire shipment, which is 25% in the United States and 20% in the UK. The client can return the items she does not want or exchange items for a different size if available, using the prepaid-postage bag delivered in her Fix. We request that clients return items to us that they do not wish to purchase within three calendar days of receiving a Fix. 
Direct Buy
In June 2019, we launched direct-buy functionality to allow clients the flexibility of purchasing items outside of a Fix. The first offering of this direct-buy functionality is Shop New Colors, which is available for Men’s and Women’s clients in the United States and allows clients to order previously purchased items in different colors, sizes, or prints. No styling fee is charged for direct purchases.
Our Merchandise, Brand Partners, and Exclusive Brands
The breadth of our merchandise selection is essential to our success. Our algorithms filter over one thousand SKUs to recommend a subset of relevant merchandise to our stylists, who leverage the information to select the merchandise for a client’s Fix. We source merchandise from brand partners and also create our own merchandise to serve unmet client needs. We offer apparel, shoes, and accessories across a range of price points. We currently serve our clients in the following categories: Women’s, Petite, Maternity, Men’s, Plus, and Kids, and our merchandise addresses a diverse range of styles.
Brand Partners
We partner with established and emerging brands across multiple price points and styles. With many of our brand partners, we develop third-party branded items exclusively sold to Stitch Fix clients. This exclusivity allows our clients to discover personally recommended products that are unavailable elsewhere.
Exclusive Brands
We also design and bring to market our own styles, which we refer to as Exclusive Brands, in order to target specific client needs that are unmet by what our merchandising team can source in the market. We use data science to identify and develop the new products for our Exclusive Brands. We then pair our data with the expertise of our design teams to bring these new products to market. We expect our product development efforts will yield better products for our clients as we acquire more data and feedback.
Exclusive Brands are a meaningful part of our business and we expect them to be a permanent part of our portfolio. However, we do not have specific targets for the merchandise mix provided by our brand partners and our Exclusive Brands, and expect it will fluctuate over time. We will continue to develop products when we identify opportunities or gaps in the market.
Sourcing
We purchase substantially all of our merchandise directly from our brand partners or Exclusive Brands merchandise vendors, who are responsible for the entire manufacturing process.
For the production of our Exclusive Brands, we contract with merchandise vendors, who are responsible for the entire manufacturing process. Some of these vendors operate their own manufacturing facilities and others subcontract the manufacturing to other parties. Our vendors generally agree to our standard vendor terms, which govern our business relationship. Although we do not have long-term agreements with our vendors, we have long-standing relationships with a diverse base of vendors that we believe to be mutually satisfactory.
All of our Exclusive Brand merchandise is produced according to our specifications, and we require that all of our vendors comply with applicable law and observe strict standards of conduct. We have hired independent firms that conduct audits of the working conditions at the factories producing our Exclusive Brands. If an audit reveals potential problems, we require that the vendor institute corrective action plans to bring the factory into compliance with our standards, or we may discontinue our relationship with the vendor. We require that all new factories producing Exclusive Brand merchandise for us be audited before Stitch Fix production begins.
Inventory Management and Fulfillment
We have seven fulfillment centers, six of which are in the United States (located in California, Arizona, Texas, Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Indiana), and a seventh in the UK.
In our fulfillment centers, our algorithms increase efficiencies in processes such as allocation, batch picking, transportation, shipping, returns, and ongoing process improvement. We have a reverse logistics operation to manage returned merchandise. Our specialist returns teams in our dedicated return intake areas accept, process, and reallocate returns to our inventory so the merchandise can be selected for another Fix. Our expertise in inventory management allows us to turn inventory quickly, which drives working capital efficiency.
Seasonality
Seasonality in our business does not follow that of traditional retailers, such as typical concentration of revenue in the holiday quarter. We generally experience lower quarter-over-quarter growth rates during our second fiscal quarter due to slower active client growth during the holiday season.
Intellectual Property
We protect our intellectual property through a combination of trademarks, domain names, copyrights, trade secrets and patents, as well as contractual provisions and restrictions on access to our proprietary technology. Our principal trademark assets include the trademarks “Stitch Fix” and “Fix,” which are registered in the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, our logos and taglines, and multiple private label apparel and accessory brand names. We have applied to register or registered many of our trademarks in the United States and other jurisdictions, and we will pursue additional trademark registrations to the extent we believe they would be beneficial and cost-effective.
We file patents in the United States and abroad and intend to pursue additional patent protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost-effective.
We are the registered holder of multiple domestic and international domain names that include “stitchfix” and similar variations. We also hold domain registrations for many of our private-label brand names and other related trade names and slogans.
Our proprietary algorithm technologies, other than those incorporated into a patent application, are protected by trade secret laws.
In addition to the protection provided by our intellectual property rights, we enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees, consultants, contractors and business partners. Our employees are also subject to invention assignment agreements. We further control the use of our proprietary technology and intellectual property through provisions in both our client terms of use on our website and in our vendor terms and conditions.
Government Regulation
As with all retailers and companies operating on the internet, we are subject to a variety of international and U.S. federal and state laws governing the processing of payments, consumer protection, the privacy of consumer information, and other laws regarding unfair and deceptive trade practices.
Apparel, shoes, and accessories sold by us are also subject to regulation by governmental agencies in the United States and in the UK. These regulations relate principally to product labeling, licensing requirements, flammability testing, and product safety. We are also subject to environmental laws, rules, and regulations. Similarly, apparel, shoes, and accessories sold by us are also subject to import regulations in the United States and other countries concerning the use of wildlife products for commercial and non-commercial trade, including the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. We do not estimate any significant capital expenditures for environmental control matters either in the current fiscal year or in the near future.
Employees
As of August 3, 2019, we had approximately 8,000 employees, including over 5,100 stylists, 1,700 fulfillment center employees, 280 client experience employees, 200 engineers, and 125 data scientists. As of such date, over 88% of our employees and 37% of our management team identified as female. None of our employees is represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
