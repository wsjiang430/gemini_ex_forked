Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

Overview
 
The Reserve Petroleum Company (the “Company,” “we,” “our” or “us”) is engaged principally in managing its owned mineral properties and the exploration for and the development of oil and natural gas properties. Other business segments are not significant factors in our operations. The Company is a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Delaware in 1931.
Oil and Natural Gas Properties
 
For a summary of certain data relating to the Company’s oil and gas properties including production, undeveloped acreage, producing and dry wells drilled and recent activity, see Item 2, “Properties.” For a discussion and analysis of current and prior years’ revenue and related costs of oil and gas operations and a discussion of liquidity and capital resource requirements, see Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
Owned Mineral Property Management
 
The Company owns non-producing mineral interests in 256,270 gross acres equivalent to 88,246 net acres. These mineral interests are located in ten different states in the north and south central United States. A total of 81,113 (92%) net acres are located in the states of Arkansas, Kansas, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and Texas, the areas of concentration for the Company in our exploration and development programs.
 
The Company has several options relating to the exploration and/or development of our owned mineral interests. Management continually reviews various industry reports and other sources for activity (leasing, drilling, significant discoveries, etc.) in areas where the Company has mineral ownership. Based on our analysis of any activity and assessment of the potential risk relative to the particular area, management may negotiate a lease or farmout agreement and accept a royalty interest, or we may choose to participate as a working interest owner and pay our proportionate share of any exploration or development drilling costs.
 
A substantial amount of the Company’s oil and gas revenue has resulted from our owned mineral property management. In 2018, $3,149,054 (41%) of oil and gas sales was from royalty interests versus $1,737,841 (28%) in 2017. As a result of our mineral ownership, the Company had royalty interests in 23 gross (0.31 net) wells, which were drilled and completed as producing wells in 2018. This resulted in an average royalty interest of about 1.4% for these 23 new wells. The Company has very little control over the timing or extent of the operations conducted on our royalty interest properties. See the following paragraphs for a discussion of mineral interests in which the Company chooses to participate as a working interest owner.
 
Development Program
 
Development drilling by the Company is usually initiated in one of three ways. The Company may participate as a working interest owner with a third party operator in the development of non-producing mineral interests, which it owns; with a joint interest operator, we may participate in drilling additional wells on our producing leaseholds; or if our exploration program, discussed below, results in a successful exploratory well, we may participate in the drilling of additional wells on the exploratory prospect. In 2018, the Company participated in the drilling of 7 development wells with 5 wells (0.68 net) completed as producers and 2 wells in progress at year-end 2018.

Exploration Program
 
The Company’s exploration program is normally conducted by purchasing interests in prospects developed by independent third parties; participating in third party exploration of Company-owned non-producing minerals; developing our own exploratory prospects; or a combination of the above.
 
The Company normally acquires interests in exploratory prospects from someone in the industry with whom management has conducted business in the past and/or if management has confidence in the quality of the geological and geophysical information presented for evaluation to Company personnel. If evaluation indicates the prospect is within our risk limits, we may negotiate to acquire an interest in the prospect and participate in a non-operating capacity.
 
The Company develops exploratory drilling prospects by identification of an area of interest, development of geological and geophysical information and purchase of leaseholds in the area. The Company may then attempt to sell an interest in the prospect to one or more companies in the petroleum industry with one of the purchasing companies functioning as operator. In 2018, we participated in the drilling of 8 exploratory wells with 2 wells (0.18 net) completed as producers, 3 wells in progress at the end of 2018 and 3 wells (0.24 net) completed as dry holes.
 
For a summation of exploratory and development wells drilled in 2018 or planned for in 2019, see Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” subheading “Update of Oil and Gas Exploration and Development Activity from December 31, 2017.”
 
Customers
 
In 2018, the Company had two customers whose total purchases were greater than 10% of revenues from oil and gas sales. Redland Resources, LLC purchases were $1,481,719 or 19% of total oil and gas sales and Luff Exploration Company purchases were $889,496 or 12% of total oil and gas sales. The Company sells most of its oil and gas under short-term sales contracts that are based on the spot market price.
Competition
 
The oil and gas industry is highly competitive in all of its phases. There are numerous circumstances within the industry and related market place that are out of the Company’s control such as cost and availability of alternative fuels, the level of consumer demand, the extent of other domestic production of oil and gas, the price and extent of importation of foreign oil and gas, the cost of and proximity of pipelines and other transportation facilities, the cost and availability of drilling rigs, regulation by state and federal authorities, and the cost of complying with applicable environmental regulations.
 
The Company does not operate any of the wells in which we have an interest; rather, we partner with companies that have the resources, staff, and experience to operate wells both in the drilling and production phases. The Company uses its strong financial base and its mineral and leasehold acreage ownership, along with its own geologic and economic evaluations, to participate in drilling operations with these companies. This methodology allows us to participate in exploration and development activities we could not undertake on our own due to financial and personnel limits and allows us to maintain low overhead costs.
 
Regulation
 
The Company’s operations are affected in varying degrees by political developments and federal and state laws and regulations. Although released from federal price controls, interstate sales of natural gas are subject to regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Oil and gas operations are affected by environmental laws and other laws relating to the petroleum industry, and both are affected by constantly changing administrative regulations. Rates of production of oil and gas have, for many years, been subject to a variety of conservation laws and regulations, and the petroleum industry is frequently affected by changes in the federal tax laws.
 
Generally, the respective state regulatory agencies supervise various aspects of oil and gas operations within their states and the transportation of oil and gas sold intrastate.
 
Environmental Protection and Climate Change
 
The operation of the various producing properties, in which the Company has an interest, is subject to federal, state, and local provisions regulating discharge of materials into the environment, the storage of oil and gas products, and the contamination of subsurface formations. The Company’s lease operations and exploratory activity have been and will continue to be affected by existing regulations in future periods. However, the known effect to date has not been material as to capital expenditures, earnings, or industry competitive position. Environmental compliance expenditures produce no increase in productive capacity or revenue and require more of management’s time and attention at a cost which cannot be estimated with any assurance or certainty.

In 2009, the EPA officially published its findings that greenhouse gas emissions present an endangerment to human health and the environment. According to the EPA, these emissions are contributing to global warming and climate change. These findings allowed the EPA to adopt and implement regulations in recent years to restrict these emissions under existing provisions of the Federal Clean Air Act.
 
The Company may be, directly and indirectly, subject to the effects of climate change and may, directly or indirectly, be affected by government laws and regulations related to climate change. We cannot predict with any degree of certainty what effect, if any, climate change and government laws and regulations related to climate change will have on the Company and our business, whether directly or indirectly. While we believe that it is difficult to assess the timing and effect of climate change and pending legislation and regulation related to climate change on our business, we believe that those laws and regulations may affect, directly or indirectly, (i) the costs associated with drilling and production operations in which we participate; (ii) the demand for oil and natural gas; (iii) insurance premiums, deductibles and the availability of coverage; and (iv) the cost of utilities paid by the Company. In addition, climate change may increase the likelihood of property damage and the disruption of operations of wells in which we participate. As a result, our financial condition could be negatively impacted, but we are unable to determine at this time whether that impact would be material.
