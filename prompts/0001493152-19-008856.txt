ITEM 1 – BUSINESS
Corporate History
 
We were incorporated under the name Jam Run Acquisition Corporation on July 2, 2013 in the State of Delaware. From inception through early February 2014, we were a blank check company and qualified as an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act which became law in April, 2012, with a business plan of entering into a transaction with a foreign or domestic private company in order for that company to become a reporting company as part of the process toward the public trading of its stock.
 
On February 6, 2014, we issued 9,700,000 shares of our common stock, representing approximately 97% of our then-outstanding shares to Laurence Wainer for $1,970. In connection with this transaction, we changed our name Blow & Drive Interlock Corporation and Mr. Wainer became our sole officer and director.
 
On March 7, 2017, we entered into an Debt Conversion and Series A Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement (the “SPA”) with Mr. Wainer, one of our officers and directors at that time, under which we agreed to create a new series of non-convertible preferred stock entitled “Series A Preferred Stock,” with One Million (1,000,000) shares authorized and the following rights: (i) no dividend rights; (ii) no liquidation preference over the Company’s common stock; (iii) no conversion rights; (iv) no redemption rights; (v) no call rights by the Company; (vi) each share of Series A Convertible Preferred stock will have one hundred (100) votes on all matters validly brought to the Company’s common stockholders; and Mr. Wainer agreed to acquire 1,000,000 shares of our Series A Preferred Stock, once created, in exchange for Mr. Wainer forgiving $25,537 in accrued salary we owed to him as of December 31, 2016. The Series A Preferred Stock was created with the State of Delaware by filing a Certificate of Designation on March 13, 2017. The description of the SPA set forth in this report is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of that document, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.26 and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
On January 2, 2019, Mr. Wainer closed the transaction that was the subject of an Agreement to Purchase Common Stock and Preferred Stock (the “Agreement”) between Mr. Wainer and The Doheny Group, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company (“Doheny Group”), under which Doheny Group acquired 8,924,000 shares of our common stock (the “Common Shares”) and One Million (1,000,000) shares of our Series A Preferred Stock (the “Preferred Shares” and together with the Common Shares, the “Shares”), from Mr. Wainer in exchange for $30,000. Combined, the Shares represent approximately 84% of our outstanding voting rights. Mr. David Haridim is the principal of Doheny and was appointed to our Board of Directors and as our sole executive officer. We were a party to the Agreement solely for the purpose of acknowledging certain representations and warranties about the company in the Agreement. The description of the Agreement set forth in this report is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of that document, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.20 and is incorporated herein by reference.

Business Overview
 
General
 
We manufacture, market, lease, install and monitor a Breath Alcohol Ignition Interlock Device (BAIID) we developed known as the BDI-747 Ignition Interlock Device (the “BDI-747/1”), which is a mechanism that is installed on the steering column of an automobile and into which a driver exhales prior to starting their vehicle. The device in turn provides a blood-alcohol concentration analysis. If the driver’s blood-alcohol content is higher than a certain pre-programmed limit, the device prevents the ignition from engaging and the automobile from starting. These devices are often required for use by DUI or DWI (“driving under the influence” or “driving while intoxicated”) offenders as part of a mandatory court or motor vehicle department program. The BDI-747/1 has met the 2013 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) guidelines for Breath Alcohol Ignition Interlock Devices [Federal Register Volume 78, Number 89] as an authorized BAIID [Element Materials Technology/Report # ESP018444P June 17, 2015]. The BDI-747/1 is manufactured by BDI Manufacturing Inc., a subsidiary of Blow & Drive Interlock, Inc., from parts and supplies from C4 Development Ltd.
 
The primary market for the BDI-747/1 Ignition Interlock Device is as a breathalyzer device to be used by persons convicted of a driving under the influence of alcohol. In order for the BDI-747/1 to be used in states for persons convicted of driving under the influence the device must be approved by each individual state. The process to get the device approved varies greatly state-to-state. As of December 31, 2017, the BDI-747/1 was approved for use in five states, namely Oregon, Texas, Arizona, Kentucky, and Tennessee. As of December 31, 2018, the BDI-747/1 device was approved in Oregon, Texas, Arizona, and Kentucky. As of March 31, 2019, the BDI-747/1 device was only approved in Arizona and Texas. The states where our BDI-747/1 device is approved has decreased primarily as a result of new state certification rules that require increased capital investment that we are not to afford.
 
In states where the BDI-747/1 is approved as a BAIID, we lease the BDI-747/1 devices to offenders, typically for twelve months, but the time could differ on a case-by-case basis depending on the sentence received by the offender. In some states we market, lease, install and support the devices directly and in other states we sell distributorships to authorized distributors allowing them to lease, install, service, remove and support the BDI-747/1 devices. Currently, we lease the devices directly in the states we are approved, except West Phoenix, Arizona and Lubbock, Texas, where we have licensed distributors that lease the devices.
 
In states where we lease the devices directly to consumers, we typically charge between $89-$189 in upfront fees for the user (which covers one month of the lease payment), and then between $69-$89/month for the other eleven months of the lease for the typical one year lease. The lease payment covers the installation of the device in the consumer’s vehicle, the rental of the device, recalibration of the device as required by each state (typically every 30 to 60 days) and the monitoring services for the device, which are then reported to the state in accordance with each state’s requirements. In states and areas where we do not have a direct presence, which we only have in Phoenix, Arizona, we contract with independent service centers, such as car alarm installation companies or other auto services companies, to perform the installations of our BDI-747/1 device, which centers must be approved by the states in which we perform the installations. Because our devices are installed in consumers’ vehicles are part of a judicially-mandated program, and since the use of the device controls the individual’s driving privileges, collection rates of the monthly leasing fees is close to 100%. The failure to make the payment could be a violation of the consumer’s sentence or probation and could cause them to lose the device and their driving privileges.

In areas where we have a distributor, in our typical distributorship arrangement, we charge the distributor a flat fee distributorship territory fee up front (which fee varies based on the size and location of the distributorship), a $150 per unit registration fee, and then a $35 monthly fee for each device the distributor has in its inventory. These fees may vary on a case-by-case basis. The relationship with our distributors may either be on an exclusive or non-exclusive basis depending upon the location of the distributorship and the fees charged.
 
As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 1,558 units on the road, with approximately 1,451 devices being leased directly from us and approximately 107 devices leased through our distributors, compared to December 31, 2016, when we had approximately 1,075 units on the road, with approximately 327 devices being leased directly from us and approximately 748 devices leased through our distributors. Notably, as of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 1,100 units on the road, with approximately 885 devices being leased directly from us and approximately 215 devices leased through our distributors. The decrease in the total number of devices we have on the road is primarily due to the fact the BDI-747/1 devices was approved in fewer states in 2018 compared to 2017.
 
Due to the decrease in the number of states where our BDI-747/1 device is approved, and the resulting decrease in the number of devices we have on the road, our management is currently exploring all options related to our business, including, but not limited to: (i) taking out loans or selling our stock in order to raise money to continue, and try to expand, our current business; (ii) trying to acquire a synergistic business and grow our current business; or (iii) selling our current business and trying to find another business to, in or out of our current business segment, to take over the public corporation.

Principal Products and Services 
 
Our only product is the BDI-747/1 Breath Alcohol Ignition Interlock Device. The BDI-747/1 device is used to detect alcohol in a person’s system by measuring the level of alcohol in a person’s breath by having them blow into the device and determining whether that level is over or under a preset level set by the installer or a trained technician. The pre-determined level differs by state, but is typically around .02. The device is approximately the size of a smartphone which is installed directly onto a vehicle’s steering column. The device requires the driver to exhale into the device prior to starting the vehicle. The device will prevent the vehicle from starting if the driver’s blood-alcohol content exceeds the predetermined set level.

Marketing
 
In 2017, most of our marketing consisted of getting approval for our BDI-747/1 device in as many states as possible. By gaining approval in a state our BDI-747/1 device appears on that state’s list of approved breathalyzer ignition interlock devices. Someone convicted of driving under the influence that is required to use a breathalyzer ignition interlock device must choose one from the list of state-approved devices. As a result, by gaining approvals in states, our device is automatically disseminated to our targeted consumers by the state. In addition to trying to obtain approvals in as many states as we can, our other marketing efforts related to our BDI-747/1 device have largely consisted of speaking with various individuals and companies that are in the breathalyzer ignition interlock device industry, such as companies in the business of conducting educational courses for individuals convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol, companies in the business of installing ignition interlock devices, and individuals involved in the approval process for breathalyzer ignition interlock devices.
 
In addition to marketing our BDI-747/1 device directly to consumers, we have also marketed our distributorship opportunities to various individuals and companies that are in the breathalyzer ignition interlock device industry. In the past, the efforts have included radio and television advertisements of our distributorship program. Although we are not currently running any radio or television advertisements for our distributorship program, we may do so again in the future. We have also discussed these opportunities with various companies and individuals in the industry, similar to what we have done with our marketing of our BDI-747/1 device.
 
Manufacturing
 
We are the primary manufacturer of our BDI-747/1 device, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, BDI Manufacturing, Inc., an Arizona corporation. However, we do utilize a supply and assembly company called C4 Development Ltd., a Hong Kong corporation (“C4 Development”). On June 29, 2015, we entered into a Supply Agreement with C4 Development, under which C4 Development supplies us with a part known as the “PCB with Alcohol Tester.” This device has certain parts utilized in our BDI-747/1 device, but the PCB with Alcohol Tester is not a device, by itself, that is capable of obtaining approval from the NHTSA as a breath alcohol interlock device. Once we obtain these parts for a device from C4 Development, we compile the components to the devices at our facility in Phoenix, Arizona in order to create our BDI-747/1 device.
Competition
 
The business of breathalyzer ignition interlock device industry is competitive, and from time-to-time new companies may appear on the list of approved providers in various states, however, there is a high barrier to entry due to the cost of development fees, manufacturing fees, NHSTA-approved testing, and state field testing. We compete with a number of successful companies in the industry, including, but not limited to, LifeSafer®, Smart Start®, Intoxalock®, Guardian Interlock Systems and Dräger. These larger companies have greater financial resources than we do, have approval in most (if not all) states, and likely have 50,000 of their respective ignition interlock devices on the road each. By comparison as of March 31, 2019, we were approved in two states and had approximately 1,100 units on the road. Although we believe our BDI-747/1 device compares favorably to the interlock devices provided by our competitors, we will need to raise significant capital and gain approval in most states in order capitalize on our BDI-747/1 device. We believe if we do this we will be able to compete better with these larger competitors.

Due to the state approvals necessary to service the judicially-mandated breath analyzer ignition interlock market we believe there is a barrier to entry that will discourage too many other companies from entering the industry. Not only must a new entrant develop and manufacture a breathalyzer device, it must meet the NHTSA requirements, and then get approved by state regulators, all of which can be costly. The complexities and costs of meeting all these steps should keep new entrants into the industry to a minimum.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We currently have a utility patent for our BDI Model #1 power line filter, which is used with our BDI-747 Breath Alcohol Ignition Interlock Device to prevent interference from electromagnetic waves. Although we do not have any other formal intellectual property protection over our BDI-747/1 device (such as device patents or trademarks), we do have general intellectual property protections provided by federal and state laws that prohibit unfair business practices, etc.
Government Regulation
 
Ignition interlock devices must be certified by the states in which a company intends to market and lease the devices. Before applying for certification to any state, the devices are sent to an independent laboratory for testing and certification that the device meets or exceeds the guidelines published by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration as the Model Specifications for Breath Alcohol Ignition Interlock Devices. Each state has its own set of certification guidelines that must be met. Typically the requirements for state certification are met once the device is certified by an independent laboratory as meeting or exceeding the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s published guidelines.
 
Our BDI-747/1 device was certified by an independent testing laboratory in June 2015. As of December 31, 2017, the BDI-747/1 was approved for use in five states, namely Oregon, Texas, Arizona, Kentucky, and Tennessee. As of December 31, 2018, the BDI-747/1 device was approved in Oregon, Texas, Arizona, and Kentucky. As of March 31, 2019, the BDI-747/1 device was only approved in Arizona and Texas.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2017, we had seven independent contractors, which primarily install, calibrate, remove and monitor our BDI-747/1 devices. Mr. Laurence Wainer, our President and Secretary at December 31, 2017, was an independent contractor. At December 31, 2017, we had approximately 35 installers and technicians working in the states where we approved that are independent contractors.
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had four independent contractors, which primarily install, calibrate, remove and monitor our BDI-747/1 devices. Mr. Laurence Wainer, our President and Secretary at December 31, 2018, was an independent contractor. We have approximately 25 installers and technicians working in the states where we approved that are independent contractors.
