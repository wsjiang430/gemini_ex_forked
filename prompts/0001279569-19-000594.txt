ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
ITH is a mineral exploration company engaged in the acquisition and exploration of mineral properties. The Company currently holds or has the right to acquire interests in an advanced stage exploration project in Alaska referred to as the “Livengood Gold Project” or the “Project”. The Company is in the process of optimizing the Livengood Gold Project as discussed below. The Company has not yet begun preparation for the extraction of mineralization from the deposit or reached commercial production. The Company controls 100% of the Livengood Gold Project, which has a current (as at August 26, 2016) mineral resource of 497 million measured tonnes at an average grade of 0.68 g/tonne (10.84 million ounces), 28 million indicated tonnes at an average grade of 0.69 g/tonne (0.62 million ounces) and 53 million inferred tonnes at an average grade of 0.66 g/tonne (1.1 million ounces). In 2017, the Company issued the results of a pre-feasibility study that was summarized in the April 2017 Report which converted a portion of the mineral resources at the Project into proven reserves of 378 million tonnes at an average grade of 0.71 g/tonne (8.62 million ounces) and probable reserves of 14 million tonnes at an average grade of 0.72 g/tonne (353,000 ounces) based on a gold price of $1,250 per ounce. All work presently planned by the Company is directed at maintaining necessary environmental baseline activities at the Livengood Gold Project and focusing efforts on Project optimization opportunities, including those identified in the April 2017 Report. A more complete description of the Livengood Gold Project and the current activities is set forth in Part I, Item 2 and Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
Since 2006, the Company has focused primarily on the acquisition and exploration of mineral properties in Alaska and Nevada by acquiring through staking, purchase, lease or option (primarily from AngloGold Ashanti (U.S.A.) Exploration Inc. (“AngloGold”) in a transaction which closed on August 4, 2006) interests in a number of mineral properties in Alaska (Livengood Gold Project, Terra, LMS, BMP, Chisna, Coffee Dome, West Tanana, Gilles, West Pogo, Caribou, Blackshell and South Estelle) and Nevada (North Bullfrog and Painted Hills) that it believed had the potential to host large precious or base metal deposits. Some of these, such as the Painted Hills, Gilles, West Tanana, Caribou and Blackshell properties, were, in light of disappointing exploration results, dropped or returned to the respective optionors or lessors, and the associated costs written off while others, such as the South Estelle property, have been sold. Since early 2008, the Company’s primary focus has been the exploration and advancement of the Livengood Gold Project and the majority of its resources have been directed to that end. In August 2010, ITH undertook a corporate spin-out arrangement transaction whereby all of its mineral property interests other than the Project were transferred to Corvus and Corvus was spun out as an independent and separate public company. Following the completion of that transaction, the sole mineral property held by the Company is the Livengood Gold Project. Since the completion of such transaction, the Company has focused exclusively on the ongoing exploration and potential development of the Livengood Gold Project.
 
The head office and principal executive address of ITH is located at Suite 2300 – 1177 West Hastings Street, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada V6E 2K3, and its registered and records office is located at 2400 – 745 Thurlow Street, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada  V6E 0C5.
 
2018
 
Livengood Gold Project Developments
 
During the year ended December 31, 2018 and to the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company progressed on a number of opportunities with the potential for optimization and reducing the costs of building and operating a mine at the Project. Outside consultants were retained to conduct additional metallurgical tests and engineering, including confirmation of the flow sheet and optimizing the operating costs. Using the improved mineralization and alteration models now available for the Livengood gold deposit arising from the work completed in 2017, 4,000 kg of metallurgical composites were selected and shipped to SGS Vancouver. Approximately 2,000 kg of these samples were processed during 2018 to evaluate optimum grind size and to determine whether different recovery parameters should be applied to different areas of the orebody. The engineering firm of BBA Inc. (“BBA”) was retained to continue to guide the metallurgical program. During 2018, the Company also completed work to advance the environmental baseline efforts needed to support future permitting.

Director Changes
 
On March 16, 2018, Mr. Victor Flores notified the Board of his decision to resign as director effective on March 21, 2018. Mr. Flores was nominated for election as director by Paulson & Co., Inc. (“Paulson”) pursuant to that certain Investor Rights Agreement, dated December 28, 2016, between the Company and Paulson. Effective on March 22, 2018, the Company appointed Damola Adamolekun as a director, filling the vacancy created by the resignation of Mr. Flores.
 
The Board appointed Mr. Stuart Harshaw to the Board effective April 1, 2018, to fill the vacancy that resulted from General Hamilton’s November 6, 2017 resignation.
 
At the 2018 Annual General Meeting of shareholders in Vancouver, B.C. on May 30, 2018, the shareholders fixed the size of the board at nine with the addition of Mr. Karl Hanneman, CEO of the Company.
 
Financing
 
On March 13, 2018, the Company completed a non-brokered private placement pursuant in which it issued 24,000,000 common shares at $0.50 per share for gross proceeds of $12.0 million. The Company intends to use the funds for continuation of optimization studies in the attempt to further improve and de-risk the Project, for required environmental baseline studies, and for general working capital purposes.
Other Developments
 
On March 12, 2018, the Board approved recommendations by management to further reduce corporate overhead costs, including a reduction in CEO salary by 50% (reflecting an approximate 50% reduction in the amount of time the CEO will spend working on the Project), a reduction in board cash compensation and expense, and staff reductions as appropriate as critical work is completed. Depending upon the level of technical work or permitting efforts underway in future years, these cost savings are expected to bring total project general and administrative costs into the range of $2.5 million per year.
 
2019
 
Outlook
 
On November 1, 2018, the Board approved a 2019 budget of $3.7 million. The work program incorporated in this budget will build upon the metallurgical studies undertaken in 2018 to continue to define and refine the project flowsheet. Approximately 2,000 kg of samples will be processed in 2019 to evaluate optimum grind size and to determine whether different recovery parameters should be applied to different areas of the orebody. BBA will be retained to continue to guide the metallurgical program. Work is also planned to advance the environmental baseline efforts needed to support future permitting.
 
The Company remains open to a strategic alliance to help support the future development of the Project while considering all other appropriate financing options. The size of the gold resource, the favorable location, and the proven team are some of the reasons the Company would potentially attract a strategic partner with a long term development horizon who understands the Project is highly leveraged to gold prices.
 
Regulatory, Environmental and Social Matters
 
All of the Company’s currently proposed exploration is under the jurisdiction of the State of Alaska. In Alaska, low impact, initial stage surface exploration such as stream sediment, soil and rock chip sampling does not require any permits. The State of Alaska requires an APMA (Alaska Placer Mining Application) exploration permit for all substantial surface disturbances such as trenching, road building and drilling. These permits are also reviewed by related state and federal agencies that can comment and require specific changes to the proposed work plans to minimize impacts on the environment. The permitting process for significant disturbances generally requires 30 days for processing and all work must be bonded. The Company currently has all necessary permits with respect to its currently planned exploration activities in Alaska. Although the Company has never had an issue with the timely processing of APMA permits, there can be no assurances that delays in permit approval will not occur.

ITH has established a Technical Committee, which has adopted a formal, written charter. As set out in its charter, the overall purpose of the Technical Committee is to assist the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to the Company’s continuing commitment to improving the environment and ensuring that activities are carried out and facilities are operated and maintained in a safe and environmentally sound manner that reflects the ideals and principles of sustainable development. The primary function of the Technical Committee is to monitor, review and provide oversight with respect to the technical aspects of the Company’s projects as well as monitor policies, standards, and programs relative to health, safety, community relations and environmental-related matters. The Technical Committee also advises the Board and makes recommendations for the Board’s consideration regarding health, safety, community relations and environmental-related issues.
 
Although not set out in a specific policy, the Company strives to be a positive influence in the local communities where its mineral projects are located, not only by contributing to the welfare of such communities through donations of money and supplies, as appropriate, but also through hiring, when appropriate, local workers to assist in ongoing exploration programs. The Company considers building and maintaining strong relationships with such communities to be fundamental to its ability to continue to operate in such regions and to assist in the eventual development (if any) of mining operations in such regions, and it attaches considerable importance to commencing and fostering such relationships from the beginning of its involvement in any particular area.
 
Corporate Structure
 
ITH was incorporated under the Company Act (British Columbia) under the name “Ashnola Mining Company Ltd.” on May 26, 1978. ITH’s name was changed to “Tower Hill Mines Ltd.” on June 1, 1988, and subsequently changed to “International Tower Hill Mines Ltd.” on March 15, 1991. ITH has been transitioned under, and is now governed by, the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia). On November 15, 2005, the shareholders resolved to amend the Company’s Articles to increase its authorized capital from 20,000,000 common shares without par value to 500,000,000 common shares without par value. This increase became effective on April 20, 2006.
 
ITH has three material subsidiaries:
 

· | Tower Hill Mines, Inc. (“TH Alaska”), a corporation incorporated in Alaska on June 27, 2006, which holds most of the Company’s Alaskan mineral properties and is 100% owned by ITH;

The following corporate chart sets forth all of ITH’s material subsidiaries:
 



Competition
 
ITH is an exploration stage company. The Company competes with other mineral resource exploration and development companies for financing, technical expertise and the acquisition of mineral properties. Many of the companies with whom the Company competes have greater financial and technical resources. Accordingly, these competitors may be able to spend greater amounts on the acquisition, exploration and development of mineral properties. This competition could adversely impact the Company’s ability to finance further exploration and to achieve the financing necessary for the Company to develop its mineral properties.
Availability of Raw Materials and Skilled Employees
 
All aspects of the Company’s business require specialized skills and knowledge. Such skills and knowledge include the areas of geology, drilling, logistical planning, preparation of feasibility studies, permitting, construction and operation of a mine, financing and accounting. Since commencing its current operations in mid-2006, the Company has found and retained appropriate employees and consultants and believes it will continue to be able to do so in the future.
 
All of the raw materials the Company requires to carry on its business are readily available through normal supply or business contracting channels in Canada and the United States. Since commencing exploration activities at the Livengood Gold Project in mid-2006, the Company has been able to secure the appropriate personnel, equipment and supplies required to conduct its contemplated programs. While it has experienced difficulty in procuring some equipment, such as drill equipment or services, experienced drillers and timely assay laboratory services in previous years, the recent overall slowdown in the mineral exploration business has resulted in more equipment and services being made available on a timely basis. As a result, the Company does not believe that it will experience any shortages of required personnel, equipment or supplies in the foreseeable future.
 
Employees
 
At December 31, 2018, the Company had 3 employees. The Company also uses consultants with specific skills to assist with various aspects of project evaluation, engineering, community engagement and investor relations, and corporate governance.
Seasonality
 
As the Company’s mineral exploration activity takes place in Alaska, its business is seasonal. Due to the northern climate, exploration work on the Livengood Gold Project can be limited due to excessive snow cover and cold temperatures. In general, surface sampling work is limited to May through September and surface drilling from March through November, although some locations afford opportunities for year-round exploration operations and others, such as road-accessible wetland areas, may only be explored while frozen in the winter.
