Information about Discontinued Operations
On April 29, 2018, the Company entered into two distinct disposition agreements with respect to selected assets owned by our subsidiaries.
DT APAC and DT Singapore (together, “Pay Seller”), each wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company, entered into an Asset Purchase Pay Agreement (the “Pay Agreement”), dated as of April 23, 2018, with Chargewave Ptd Ltd (“Pay Purchaser”) to sell certain assets (the “Pay Assets”) owned by the Pay Seller related to the Company’s Direct Carrier Billing business. The Pay Purchaser is principally owned and controlled by Jon Mooney, an officer of the Pay Seller. At the closing of the asset sale, Mr. Mooney was no longer employed by the Company or Pay Seller. As consideration for this asset sale, Digital Turbine is entitled to receive certain license fees, profit sharing and equity participation rights as outlined in the Company’s Form 8-K filed May 1, 2018 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). The transaction was completed in July 2018. With the sale of these assets, the Company has determined that it will exit the segment previously referred to as the Content business.
DT Media (the “A&P Seller”), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “A&P Agreement”), dated as of April 28, 2018, with Creative Clicks B.V. (the “A&P Purchaser”) to sell business relationships with various advertisers and publishers (the “A&P Assets”) related to the Company’s Advertising and Publishing ("A&P") business. As consideration for this asset sale, we are entitled to receive a percentage of the gross profit derived from these customer agreements for a period of three years as outlined in the Company’s Form 8-K filed May 1, 2018 with the SEC. The transaction was completed in June 2018. With the sale of these assets, the Company has determined that it will exit the segment of its Advertising business previously referred to as the A&P business.
We believe that these dispositions will allow the Company to benefit from a streamlined business model, simplified operating structure, and enhanced management focus.
As a result of these dispositions, the results of operations from our Content reporting segment and A&P business within the Advertising reporting segment are reported as “Net loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes” and the related assets and liabilities are classified as “held for disposal" in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report. The Company has recast prior period amounts presented within this Report to provide visibility and comparability. All

discussion herein, unless otherwise noted, refers to our remaining operating segment after the dispositions, the O&O business. See “Discontinued Operations” in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report.
Information about Segment and Geographic Revenue
As a result of the dispositions, the Company now manages its business in one operating segment, the O&O business, which is presented as one reportable segment: Advertising. Information about segment and geographic revenue is set forth in Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report.
Advertising
O&O Business
The Company's O&O business is an advertiser solution for unique and exclusive carrier and OEM inventory, which is comprised of Ignite and other recurring and lifecycle products, features, and professional services delivered on the Ignite platform.
Ignite is a software platform that enables mobile operators and OEMs to control, manage, and monetize devices through application installation at the time of activation and over the life of a mobile device. Ignite allows mobile operators to personalize the application activation experience for customers and monetize their home screens via revenue share agreements such as: Cost-Per-Install (CPI), Cost-Per-Placement (CPP), Cost-Per-Action (CPA) with third party advertisers; or via Per-Device-License Fees (PDL) agreements which allow operators and OEMs to leverage the Ignite platform, products and features for a structured fee. Setup Wizard and Dynamic Installs are the two delivery methods available to operators and OEMs on first boot of the device. Additional products and features are available throughout the life-cycle of the device that provide operators and OEMs additional opportunity for advertising revenue streams. The Company has launched Ignite with mobile operators and OEMs in North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia Pacific, India and Israel. 
Competition
The distribution of applications, mobile advertising, development, distribution and sale of mobile products and services is a highly competitive business. We compete for advertising partners on the basis of positioning, brand, quality and price. We compete for wireless carrier and manufacturer placement based on these factors, as well as historical performance. We compete for platform deployment contracts with other mobile platform companies. We also compete for experienced and talented employees.
Our primary competition for application and media distribution comes from the traditional Google application store, existing operator solutions built internally, as well as companies providing application install products and services as offered by Facebook, Snapchat, IronSource, InMobi, Cheetah Mobile, Baidu, Taptica, and others. These companies can be both customers for Digital Turbine products, as well as competitors in certain cases. With Ignite, we compete with smaller competitors, such as IronSource, Wild Tangent, and Sweet Labs, but the more material competition is internally developed operator solutions and specific mobile application management solutions built in-house by OEMs and wireless operators. Some of our existing wireless operators could make a strategic decision to develop their own solutions rather than continue to use our Ignite products, which could be a material source of competition. And finally, although we do not see any competition from larger Enterprise application players such as IBM, Citrix, Oracle, Salesforce, or MobileIron, it is possible they could decide to compete against our Ignite solution.
Digital Turbine has internally developed solutions for top-tier mobile operators and original equipment manufacturers including device application management solutions and application-based value added services. Ignite is a patent pending mobile application management solution that enables operators and device OEMs to pre-install and manage applications from a single web interface. We see competitors in internally developed operator solutions and specific mobile application management solutions built individually by OEMs.

Product Development
Our product development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits for employees working on campaign management, creating, developing, editing, programming, performing quality assurance, obtaining carrier certification and deploying our products across various mobile phone carriers and on our internal platforms. We devote substantial resources to the development, technology support, and quality assurance of our products. Total product development costs incurred for the years ended March 31, 2019, 2018, 2017 were $10.9 million, $9.7 million, and $9.3 million, respectively. 
Contracts with Customers
We have both exclusive and non-exclusive carrier and OEM agreements. Our agreements with advertisers are generally non-exclusive. Our carrier and OEM agreements for our Advertising business are multi-year agreements, with terms that are generally longer than one to two years. In addition, some carrier agreements provide that the carrier can terminate the agreement early and, in some instances, at any time without cause, which could give them the ability to renegotiate economic or other terms. The agreements generally do not obligate the carriers to market or distribute any of our products or services. In many of these agreements, we warrant that our products do not violate community standards, do not contain libelous content, do not contain material defects or viruses, and do not violate third-party intellectual property rights and we indemnify the carrier for any breach of a third party’s intellectual property. Most of our sales are made either directly to application developers, advertising agencies representing application developers or through advertising aggregators.
We generally have numerous advertisers who represent a significant level of business. Coupled with advertiser concentration, we distribute a significant level of advertising through one operator. If such advertising clients or this operator decided to materially reduce or discontinue its use of our platform, it could cause an immediate and significant decline in our revenue and negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition.
During the year ended March 31, 2019 one major customer, Oath Inc., a subsidiary of Verizon Communications, represented 28.6% of net revenues. During the year ended March 31, 2018, two major customers, Oath Inc., a subsidiary of Verizon Communications, and Machine Zone, Inc., represented 23.5% and 16.1% of net revenues, respectively.
The Company partners with mobile carriers and OEMs to deliver applications on our Ignite platform through the carrier network. During the year ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, Verizon Wireless, a subsidiary of Verizon Communications, a carrier partner, generated 45.9% and 51.5%, respectively, while AT&T Inc., a carrier partner, including its Cricket subsidiary, generated 38.7% and 34.3%, respectively, of our net revenues.
Business Seasonality
Our revenue, cash flow from operations, operating results and other key operating and financial measures may vary from quarter to quarter due to the seasonal nature of advertiser spending. For example, many advertisers (and their agencies) devote a disproportionate amount of their budgets to the fourth quarter of the calendar year to coincide with increased holiday spending. We expect our revenue, cash flow, operating results and other key operating and financial measures to fluctuate based on seasonal factors from period to period and expect these measures to be generally higher in the third and fourth fiscal quarters than in prior quarters.
Employees
As of March 31, 2019, the Company, including its subsidiaries, had 161 employees, 158 of whom were full-time and 3 of whom were part-time. We consider our relationships with our employees to be satisfactory. As of March 31, 2019, none of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. The Company also uses a number of contractors on an as-needed basis.

From 2005 to February 12, 2008, the Company was a public shell company with no operations. Throughout the years, the Company has made several acquisitions, such as (1) the acquisition in December 2011 by its wholly-owned subsidiary, Digital Turbine USA, Inc., of assets of Digital Turbine LLC, which were re-branded as “Discover,” (2) the acquisition in September 2012 by DT EMEA of ” Logia Content Development and Management Ltd. (“Logia Content”), Volas Entertainment Ltd. (“Volas”) and Mail Bit Logia (2008) Ltd. (“Mail Bit”), including the “LogiaDeck” software which has been rebranded as “Ignite,” (3) the acquisition in April 2013 of Mirror Image International Holdings Pty Ltd, and (4) the acquisition in October 2014 of the intellectual property assets of Xyologic Mobile Analysis, GmbH ("XYO" or "Xyologic).  In February 2014, the Company disposed of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Twistbox Entertainment, Inc. (“Twistbox”), and as such, it is no longer reflected as part of our continuing operations in this Report. In March 2015, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, acquired Appia, Inc., which was renamed Digital Turbine Media, Inc. and which is referred to in this Form 10-K and the consolidated financial statements as “DT Media.”
In April 2018, the Company entered into two separate agreements to dispose of the Content reporting segment (through the Pay Agreement) and A&P business within the Advertising reporting segment (through the A&P Agreement). As a result of these dispositions, the results of operations from our Content reporting segment and A&P business within the Advertising reporting segment are reported as “Net loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes” and the related assets and liabilities are classified as "held for disposal" in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report. The Pay Agreement and A&P Agreement both closed in June 2018.
