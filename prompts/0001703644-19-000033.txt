Item 1. Business
Overview
Our Company
Granite Point Mortgage Trust Inc. is a Maryland corporation that focuses primarily on directly originating, investing in and managing senior floating-rate commercial mortgage loans and other debt and debt-like commercial real estate investments. We operate as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, as defined under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. The terms “Granite Point,” “we,” “our,” “us” and the “company” refer to Granite Point Mortgage Trust Inc. and its subsidiaries as a consolidated entity.
We were incorporated on April 7, 2017 and commenced operations as a publicly traded company on June 28, 2017, upon completion of a formation transaction, or the Formation Transaction, pursuant to which we acquired the equity interests in TH Commercial Holdings LLC, or our Predecessor, and its portfolio of commercial mortgage loans and other commercial real estate-related debt investments from Two Harbors Investment Corp., or Two Harbors, a publicly traded hybrid mortgage real estate investment trust (NYSE: TWO). Our Predecessor became our wholly owned indirect subsidiary as a result of the Formation Transaction. In exchange for equity interests of our Predecessor, we issued 33,071,000 shares of our common stock representing approximately 76.5% of our outstanding common stock after the IPO and 1,000 shares of our 10% cumulative redeemable preferred stock having a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share to Two Harbors or an affiliate of Two Harbors, which immediately sold such preferred stock to an unaffiliated third-party investor. On November 1, 2017, Two Harbors distributed the shares of our common stock issued to it in connection with the Formation Transaction by means of a special pro rata dividend to Two Harbors common stockholders. Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, under the symbol “GPMT”. We are externally managed by Pine River Capital Management L.P., or our Manager. 
We are a long-term, fundamental value-oriented investor. We construct our investment portfolio on a loan-by-loan basis, emphasizing rigorous credit underwriting, selectivity and diversification, and assess each investment from a fundamental value perspective relative to other opportunities available in the market. Our primary target investments are directly originated floating-rate performing senior commercial real estate loans, typically with terms of three to five years, usually ranging in size from $25 million to $150 million. We typically provide intermediate-term bridge or transitional financing for a variety of purposes, including acquisitions, recapitalizations, refinancings and a range of business plans, including lease-up, renovation, repositioning and repurposing of the property. We target the top 25, and generally up to the top 50, metropolitan statistical areas in the United States, or MSAs. We believe that those markets provide ample supply of high credit quality properties to lend against, sufficient number of owners and sponsors with institutional attributes, and adequate market liquidity. We believe this approach will enable us to deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns to our stockholders while preserving our capital base through diverse business cycles.
Our origination strategy relies on our extensive and longstanding direct relationships with a wide array of national, regional and local private owner/operators, private equity firms, funds, REITs, brokers and co-lenders. Our team’s reach across the United States and active dialogue with market participants has produced significant volume of investment opportunities since our Predecessor’s formation, and our reputation as a reliable counterparty has led to multiple investment opportunities with repeat clients. We have deep experience in the commercial real estate finance markets, with each of the senior members of our team of commercial real estate professionals, or our CRE team, having over 20 years of experience in commercial real estate debt markets.
We believe that the U.S. commercial real estate debt markets offer enduring investment opportunities. A significant amount of commercial real estate debt is scheduled to mature over the next five years, and there is a sustained need for acquisition, repositioning and recapitalization loans. We expect that traditional lenders, including banks which have historically accounted for approximately half of the market, will not be able to meet borrower demand due to structural and regulatory constraints. As a result, we believe that there are significant opportunities to originate floating-rate senior commercial real estate loans on transitional properties at attractive risk-adjusted return.
We have elected to be treated as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. To qualify as a REIT, we are required to meet certain investment and operating tests and annual distribution requirements. We generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes on our taxable income to the extent that we annually distribute all of our net taxable income to stockholders, do not participate in prohibited transactions and maintain our intended qualification as a REIT. However, certain activities that we may perform may cause us to earn income which will not be qualifying income for REIT purposes. We have designated one of our subsidiaries as a taxable REIT subsidiary, or TRS, as defined in the Code, to engage in such activities, and we may form additional TRSs in the future. We also operate our business in a manner that will permit us to maintain our exclusion from registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act.

Our Business
Our Investment Objective and Strategy
Our investment objective is to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for our stockholders over the long-term, primarily through dividends, and to preserve our capital base through business cycles. We intend to achieve this objective by further growing our already well-diversified investment portfolio and actively managing various risks associated with our business strategy. We focus on preserving our stockholders’ capital, as we believe that stability of our capital base is of paramount importance to our ability to invest in assets that generate attractive returns on an ongoing basis.

Our investment strategy is to directly originate, invest in and manage a portfolio of commercial real estate loans and other debt and debt-like instruments secured by institutional quality commercial properties managed by experienced owners in attractive markets across the United States. Our extensive real estate expertise, industry relationships, sourcing, and underwriting capabilities aid us in executing on our strategy. We approach the commercial real estate debt markets by emphasizing the following factors:
Origination
Our origination strategy relies on our extensive and longstanding direct relationships with a wide array of national, regional and local private owner/operators, private equity firms, funds, REITs, brokers and co-lenders. We invest significant time and resources in the early stages of our origination process to increase the likelihood of closing the investment on its original terms, which has resulted in our reputation as a reliable counterparty.
Markets
We generally target the top 25, and up to top 50, MSAs, which we believe provide ample supply of high credit quality properties to lend against, sufficient number of owners and sponsors with institutional attributes, and adequate market liquidity. We do not favor particular markets and instead look for the most compelling investments available across different geographies.
Type of Investments
Our primary target investments are directly originated floating-rate performing, intermediate term, bridge or transitional senior commercial real estate loans, typically with terms of three to five years, usually ranging in size from $25 million to $150 million that are backed by a variety of property types located across the United States. The range of loan sizes we originate is related to the breadth of MSAs from which we source our investments.
Owners and Sponsors
We seek institutional and established owners and sponsors with demonstrated market and property type expertise, as well as possessing sufficient resources (whether through loan structure or entity capitalization) to implement their business plans. We evaluate a sponsor’s track record and reputation for meeting its obligations with lenders in the past and acting responsibly.
Property Types
We focus our investment strategy on income producing property types including office, industrial, multifamily, hospitality, retail and others. We prefer not to invest in debt on specialty property types that require specific expertise to operate and rely on government reimbursement programs for their cash flows.
Financing Purpose and Business Plans
We typically provide intermediate-term bridge or transitional financing for a variety of purposes, including acquisitions, recapitalizations, refinancings and a range of business plans including lease-up, renovation, repositioning and repurposing of the property. We believe that the scale and flexibility of our capital, as well as our CRE team’s long-standing industry relationships, enables us to finance strong borrowers and sponsors, and invest in debt collateralized by high-quality properties.
As a long-term, fundamental value-oriented investor, we may adjust our investment strategy as we react to evolving market dynamics. We believe there are enduring opportunities within our target investments that present attractive risk-adjusted returns. However, as economic and business cycles develop, we may expand and/or adjust our investment strategy and target investments to capitalize on various investment opportunities. We believe that our well-diversified portfolio and flexible investment strategy will allow us to actively adapt to changing market conditions and generate attractive long-term returns for our stockholders in a variety of environments.
Our Investment Philosophy
Our investment philosophy is governed by several guiding principles:

• | Value investing approach - We are a long-term, fundamental value-oriented investor. We search for value across various geographies, property types and capital structure, guided by the belief that each investment should be attractive on its own fundamental merits and assessed relative to other available opportunities.


• | Cash flow potential - We emphasize a property’s cash flow potential as an underwriting metric, rather than a loan’s basis against the value of the property. From an underwriting perspective, we believe that a property’s long-term ability to generate sustainable cash flows is of greater importance than its current sale value.


• | Comprehensive underwriting and loan structuring - We engage in a rigorous and comprehensive underwriting process on each investment. We diligence a property’s cash flow potential, including micro- and macroeconomic factors, our borrower’s expertise and reputation, and business plan. Additionally, we place great emphasis on the loan terms and structural protections to provide us with the tools to protect our investment and our stockholders’ capital, if so required.


• | Selectivity and portfolio diversification - We focus on creating loan portfolios on a loan-by-loan basis rather than engaging in large bulk purchases of investments. As a result, we are able to identify and invest among a broad array of opportunities, and construct a portfolio diversified across markets, property types and sponsors, across the large U.S. commercial real estate debt market, which has a size in excess of $3 trillion.

 3


• | Active investment monitoring and management - The team originating a loan remains responsible for monitoring and managing that investment from origination through the moment it is repaid, sold or otherwise liquidated. We believe that this approach maintains accountability for each loan and is reflective of our credit culture.

Our Competitive Strengths
Long-Tenured Presence in the Commercial Real Estate Debt Market
Our team of commercial real estate professionals, or our CRE team, is among the most experienced in the industry. Each member of our CRE team has been active in the commercial real estate debt markets for a majority of their careers. The senior members of our CRE team have over 20 years of experience in commercial real estate finance each, including experience building and managing multiple commercial real estate lending businesses, both as broker dealers and as investment managers. This broad experience provides us with the expertise in capital markets, structured finance and investment management needed to navigate and exploit the commercial real estate finance markets and successfully execute on our business plan for the benefit of our stockholders.
High Quality Portfolio with Attractive Yield
Our portfolio consists of cash-generating commercial real estate debt investments with a principal balance of $3.2 billion as of December 31, 2018, with an additional $626.2 million of potential future funding obligations. The current cash flow of our portfolio should allow us to continue to generate an attractive dividend for our stockholders. Additionally, we believe the scale of our portfolio should allow us better access to capital and an opportunity to build upon existing relationships with our clients. 
Established Direct Origination Platform with Strong Sourcing Capabilities
We have a proven ability to directly originate investments within multiple markets across the United States. We have the ability to generate investments and find value in local markets due to our vast borrower, sponsor and broker relationships combined with many years of experience in the commercial real estate debt market. We believe that our origination experience combined with the high quality of our portfolio will allow us to continue to grow and deploy capital into attractive target investments in a timely manner to the benefit of our stockholders.
Focused Investment Process Leading to Reputation as a Reliable Counterparty
We employ a highly disciplined sourcing, screening and underwriting process. We invest significant time and resources in the early stages of our origination process and communicate frequently with our borrowers regarding business plan, terms and structure. This process increases the likelihood of closing the investment on the originally agreed to terms, resulting in our reputation as a reliable counterparty.
Robust Underwriting, Structuring and Investment Management Capabilities
Our established underwriting, structuring and investment management capabilities are supplemented by our extensive experience in the commercial real estate industry, providing multiple perspectives on performance of real estate collateral through credit and interest rate cycles. This wealth of experience serves as a foundation for thorough screening of investment opportunities, disciplined underwriting procedures, and active portfolio management of our portfolio. Our risk management process entails regular monitoring of the properties we lend against, contact with the owners and sponsors, property visits, and examining local market economic, demographic and business trends affecting real estate fundamentals. 
Our Target Investments
We are focused on originating senior commercial mortgage loans backed by different types of commercial real estate properties located in various markets across the United States. We have invested in, and we may, from time to time, invest in other debt and debt-like commercial real estate investments. Together, we refer to these investments as our target investments.
Primary Target Investments

• | Senior Mortgage Loans. Commercial mortgage loans that are secured by real estate and evidenced by a first priority mortgage. These loans may vary in term, may bear interest at a fixed or floating rate (although our focus is floating-rate loans), and may amortize and typically require a balloon payment of principal at maturity. These investments may encompass a whole loan or may include pari passu participations within such a mortgage loan. These loans may finance stabilized properties or properties that are subject to a business plan that is expected to enhance the value of the property through lease-up, refurbishment, updating or repositioning.

Secondary Target Investments
As part of our financing strategy, we may from time-to-time syndicate senior participations in our originated senior commercial mortgage loans to other investors and retain a subordinated debt position for our portfolio in the form of a mezzanine loan or subordinated mortgage interest, as described below. Alternatively, we may opportunistically co-originate the investments described below with senior lenders, or acquire them in the secondary market.

• | Mezzanine Loans. Mezzanine loans are secured by a pledge of equity interests in the property. These loans are subordinate to a senior mortgage loan, but senior to the property owner’s equity.

 4


• | Preferred Equity. Investments that are subordinate to any mortgage and mezzanine loans, but senior to the property owner’s common equity.


• | Subordinated Mortgage Interests. Sometimes referred to as a B-note, a subordinated mortgage interest is an investment in a junior portion of a mortgage loan. B-notes have the same borrower and benefit from the same underlying secured obligation and collateral as the senior mortgage loan, but are subordinated in priority payments in the event of default.


• | Other Real Estate Securities. Investments in real estate that take the form of CMBS or collateralized loan obligations, or CLOs, that are collateralized by pools of real estate debt instruments, which are often senior mortgage loans, or other securities.

Based on current market conditions, we expect that the majority of our investments will continue to consist of senior commercial mortgage loans directly originated by us and secured by cash-flowing properties located in the United States. These investments typically pay interest at rates that are determined periodically on the basis of a floating base lending rate, primarily LIBOR plus a premium, and have an expected term between three and five years.
We may opportunistically adjust our capital allocation to our target investments, with the proportion and types of investments changing over time depending on our views on, among other things, the current economic and credit environment. In addition, we may invest in investments other than our target investments, in each case subject to maintaining our qualification as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes and our exclusion from regulation under the Investment Company Act.
Our Portfolio
As of December 31, 2018, our investment portfolio consisted of 94 commercial real estate debt investments with an aggregate principal balance of $3.2 billion and an additional $626.2 million of potential future funding obligations. The following table and charts provide summary statistics on our portfolio and illustrate diversification across property types and geographies.

____________________

(1) | “Senior” means a loan primarily secured by a first priority lien on commercial real property and related personal property and also includes, when applicable, any companion subordinate loans.


(2) | Cash coupon does not include origination or exit fees. Weighted average cash coupon excludes fixed rate loans.


(3) | Yield includes net origination fees and exit fees, but does not include future fundings, and is expressed as a monthly equivalent. Weighted average yield excludes fixed rate loans.


(4) | Initial LTV is calculated as the initial loan amount (plus any financing that is pari passu with or senior to such loan) divided by the as is appraised value (as determined in conformance with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice, or USPAP) as of the date of the loan was originated set forth in the original appraisal.


(5) | Stabilized LTV is calculated as the fully funded loan amount (plus any financing that is pari passu with or senior to such loan), including all contractually provided for future fundings, divided by the as stabilized value (as determined in conformance with USPAP) set forth in the original appraisal. As stabilized value may be based on certain assumptions, such as future construction completion, projected re-tenanting, payment of tenant improvement or leasing commissions allowances or free or abated rent periods, or increased tenant occupancies.

Our Financing Strategy and Leverage
Our financing strategy includes raising capital through public offerings of our equity and debt securities and the available capacity under our repurchase and other financing facilities. Over time, in addition to our current mix of funding sources, we may use other forms of financing including secured and unsecured financing facilities and other credit facilities, securitizations, and public and private, secured and unsecured debt issuances by us or our subsidiaries. 
As of December 31, 2018, we had repurchase agreements in place to finance loans held for investment with Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A., JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association, Goldman Sachs Bank USA, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association and Citibank, N.A., for an aggregate maximum facility amount of $2.1 billion, or $2.3 billion inclusive of our option to upsize the Wells Fargo Bank agreement. 
In the second quarter of 2018, we financed a pool of commercial real estate loans through a collateralized loan obligation, or CLO, which is consolidated on our financial statements. As of December 31, 2018, the outstanding amount due on the securitized debt obligation was $654.3 million.
As of December 31, 2018, we also had a revolving credit facility in place to finance loans held-for-investment with Citibank, N.A. with a current maximum facility amount of $105.0 million. The facility was temporarily upsized from $75.0 million to $105.0 million at December 31, 2018.
We are not required to maintain any particular debt-to-equity leverage ratio; however, the actual leverage we employ for particular investments will depend upon our assessment of the credit, liquidity, price volatility and other risks of those investments and the financing counterparties, and availability of particular types of financing at the time, as well as the financial covenants under our financing facilities. Our decision to use leverage to finance our assets is at the discretion of our management team and is not subject to the approval of our stockholders. We currently expect that our leverage will not exceed, on a debt to equity basis, a ratio of 3.5-to-1. We endeavor to match the terms and indices of our assets and liabilities, including in certain instances through the use of derivatives. We also seek to minimize the risks associated with recourse borrowing. 
Subject to maintaining our qualification as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes and our exemption from the Investment Company Act, we may, from time to time, engage in a variety of hedging transactions that seek to mitigate the effects of fluctuations in interest rates or currencies and their effects on our cash flows. These hedging transactions could take a variety of forms, including interest rate swaps or cap agreements, options, futures contracts, forward rate agreements or similar financial instruments. We expect these instruments would allow us to reduce, but not eliminate, the risk that we have to refinance our liabilities before the maturities of our investments and to reduce the impact of changing interest rates on our earnings.
Competition
We are engaged in a competitive business. Our net income depends, in part, on our ability to originate or acquire investments at favorable spreads over our borrowing costs. In our lending and investment activities, we compete for opportunities with a variety of institutional lenders and investors, including other REITs, specialty finance companies, public and private funds, commercial and investment banks, commercial finance and insurance companies and other financial institutions. Several other REITs have raised significant amounts of capital, and may have investment objectives and strategies that overlap with ours, which may create additional competition for lending and investment opportunities.
 6

Some of our competitors may have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that may not available to us. Many of our competitors are not subject to the operating constraints associated with REIT rule compliance or maintenance of an exclusion from regulation under the Investment Company Act. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments than we do, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of loans and investments, offer more attractive pricing or other terms, and establish more relationships than us. Furthermore, competition for originations of and investments in our target investments may lead to decreasing yields, which may further limit our ability to generate desired returns.
Additionally, the current administration has indicated that it may focus on issues relating to financial regulation, which could potentially relieve some of the current restrictions on financial institutions and allow them to more freely compete with us for our target investments. While there is much uncertainty regarding the timing and specifics of any policy changes, any such actions could affect our business.
We believe our industry experience and relationships provide us with a competitive advantage and helps us assess risks and determine appropriate risk and return parameters for our target investments. Additionally, we believe that our relationship with our Manager and access to its resources enables us to compete more effectively and generate attractive investment opportunities for our portfolio. However, we may not be able to achieve our business goals or expectations due to the competitive risks that we face.
For additional information concerning these competitive risks, see “Risk Factors - Risks Related to our Lending and Investment Activities - We operate in a competitive market for investment opportunities and competition may limit our ability to originate or acquire desirable investments in our target investments and could also affect the pricing of these securities” included in Item 1A of this of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Investment Guidelines
Our board of directors has approved the following investment guidelines:

• | no investment shall be made that would cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended;


• | no investment shall be made that would cause us to be regulated or required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act;


• | we will primarily invest in our target investments, consisting of senior commercial mortgage loans, mezzanine loans, preferred equity, subordinated mortgage interests, real estate securities and other debt and debt-like commercial real estate investments;


• | not more than 25% of our equity capital will be invested in any individual asset without the prior approval of a majority of our board of directors;


• | any investment in excess of $300 million in an individual asset requires the prior approval of a majority of our board of directors; and


• | until appropriate investments in our target investments are identified, we may invest our available cash in interest-bearing, short-term investments, including money market accounts or funds, and corporate bonds, subject to the requirements for our qualification as a REIT under the Code.

These investment guidelines may be changed from time-to-time by our board of directors without our stockholders’ consent, but we expect to disclose any material changes to our investment guidelines in the periodic quarterly and annual reports that we file with the SEC. We are not subject to any limits or proportions under our investment guidelines with respect to the mix of target investments that we originate or acquire other than as necessary to maintain our qualification as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes and our exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act.
Management Agreement
Upon completing our IPO on June 28, 2017, we entered into a management agreement with our Manager. We pay our Manager a base management fee equal to 1.5% of equity on an annualized basis, as defined in the management agreement. For purposes of calculating the management fee, equity means the sum of the net proceeds received from all issuances of equity securities, plus cumulative “core earnings” at the end of the most recently completed calendar quarter, less any distributions to stockholders, any amount paid to repurchase stock, and any incentive fees earned by our Manager, but excluding the incentive fee earned in the current quarter. As a result, equity for purposes of calculating the management fee may differ from the amount of stockholders’ equity shown in the financial statements.
Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2018, incentive fees, if earned, are payable to our Manager, as defined in the management agreement. The incentive fee is the excess of (1) the product of (a) 20% and (b) the result of (i) “core earnings” for the previous 12-month period, minus (ii) the product of (A) equity in the previous 12-month period, and (B) 8% per annum, less (2) the sum of any incentive fees paid to our Manager with respect to the first three calendar quarters of such previous 12-month period; provided, however, that no incentive fees are payable with respect to any calendar quarter unless “core earnings” for the 12 most recently completed calendar quarters in the aggregate is greater than zero.
 7

For purposes of calculating base management and incentive fees, “core earnings” means net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders, excluding non-cash equity compensation expense, incentive fees earned by our Manager, depreciation and amortization, any unrealized gains or losses or other similar non-cash items that are included in net income for the applicable period (regardless of whether such items are included in other comprehensive income or loss or in net income), and one-time events pursuant to changes in U.S. GAAP and certain material non-cash income or expense items, in each case after discussions between our Manager and the independent directors and approved by a majority of the independent directors. 
The current term of the management agreement expires on June 28, 2020, and thereafter will automatically renew for successive one-year terms annually until terminated in accordance with the terms of the agreement. Upon termination of the management agreement by us without cause or by our Manager due to the Company’s material breach of the management agreement, we are required to pay a termination fee equal to three times the sum of the average annual base management fee and average annual incentive compensation, in each case earned by our Manager during the 24-month period immediately preceding the date of termination, calculated as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal quarter prior to the date of termination.
In addition, under the terms of an amendment to the management agreement entered into in the fourth quarter of 2018, our Manager agreed to reimburse the Company an amount related to the compensation payable to the sales agents under the Company’s equity distribution agreement by netting such amount from the base management fee payable to our Manager for the applicable quarterly period.
Employees
We are externally managed by our Manager pursuant to a management agreement. Our executive officers and all of our support personnel are employees of an affiliate of our Manager. We do not have any employees.
Conflicts of Interest
We are subject to conflicts of interest relating to our Manager and its affiliates because, among other things:

• | Each of our executive officers is an employee of an affiliate of our Manager. Therefore, these individuals have interests in our relationship with our Manager that are different than the interests of our stockholders. In particular, these individuals have a direct interest in the financial success of our Manager, which may encourage these individuals to support strategies that impact us based upon these considerations. As a result of these relationships, these persons have a conflict of interest with respect to the agreements and arrangements we have with our Manager and its affiliates.


• | Our Manager may retain, for and on behalf and at our sole cost and expense, such services of persons and firms as our Manager deems necessary or advisable in connection with our management and operations, which may include affiliates of our Manager; provided, that any such services may only be provided by affiliates to the extent (i) such services are on arm's length terms and competitive market rates in relation to terms that are then customary for agreements regarding the provision of such services to companies that have assets similar in type, quality and value to our investments, or (ii) such services are approved by a majority of our independent directors. Our Manager is entitled to rely reasonably on qualified experts and professionals (including accountants, legal counsel and other professional service providers) hired by our Manager at our sole cost and expense. In addition, our Manager is authorized to enter into one or more sub-advisory agreements with other investment managers, or, each, a Sub-Manager, pursuant to which our Manager may obtain the services of the Sub-Manager to assist our Manager in providing the investment advisory services required to be provided by our Manager under the management agreement. Specifically, our Manager may retain a Sub-Manager to recommend specific securities or other investments based upon our investment guidelines, and work, along with our Manager, in structuring, negotiating, arranging or effecting the acquisition or disposition of such investments and monitoring investments on our behalf, subject to oversight of our Manager and us. Our Manager, and not us, is responsible for any compensation payable to any Sub-Manager. Any sub-management agreement entered into by our Manager will be in accordance with applicable laws.


• | Our Manager may engage and supervise, on our behalf and at our expense, independent contractors, advisors, consultants, attorneys, accountants, auditors, and other service providers, which may include affiliates of our Manager, that provide various services with respect to us, including investment banking, securities brokerage, mortgage brokerage, credit analysis, risk management services, asset management services, loan servicing, other financial, legal or accounting services, due diligence services, underwriting review services, and all other services (including transfer agent and registrar services) as may be required related to our activities or investments (or potential investments).

Our Manager may assign or delegate to one or more of its affiliates the performance of its responsibilities under the management agreement in accordance with the terms of the management agreement.

Our Manager’s liability is limited under the management agreement, and we agree to indemnify our Manager and its affiliates with respect to all expenses, losses, damages, liabilities, demands, charges and claims incurred by our Manager and its affiliates in or by reason of any pending, threatened or completed action, suit, investigation or other proceeding arising from acts or omissions of such indemnified parties except by reason of acts or omission constituting bad faith, willful misconduct, gross negligence or reckless disregard of their respective duties under the management agreement, as determined by a final non-appealable order of a court of competent jurisdiction. As a result, we could experience poor performance or losses for which our Manager would not be liable.
We agree to pay our Manager a base management fee, which is not based upon performance metrics or goals, and which might reduce our Manager’s incentive to devote its time and effort to seeking loans and investments that provide attractive risk-adjusted returns for our portfolio. Because the base management fees will be based on our outstanding equity, our Manager may also be incentivized to advance strategies that increase our equity, and there may be circumstances where increasing our equity will not optimize the returns for our stockholders.
In addition, our Manager has the ability to earn incentive fees based on our earnings, which may create an incentive for our Manager to invest in assets with higher yield potential, which are generally riskier or more speculative, or sell an asset prematurely for a gain, in an effort to increase our short-term net income and thereby increase the incentive fees to which it is entitled.
Resolution of Potential Conflicts of Interest in Allocation of Investment Opportunities
Our Manager has agreed that for so long as our Manager is managing us, neither our Manager nor any of its affiliates will sponsor or manage any other U.S. publicly traded REIT that invests in senior commercial mortgage loans, mezzanine loans, preferred equity, subordinated mortgage interests, and any other types of investments from time to time mutually agreed to by our Manager and a majority of our independent directors, all of which we refer to as “Specified Target Investments.” In addition, for the period between June 28, 2017 through June 28, 2018, our Manager and its affiliates were precluded from sponsoring or managing one or more private investment funds that invest in investment classes that are the same or similar to the Specified Target Investments, except that the Manager and its affiliates were permitted to perform investment advisory services related to a single Specified Target Investment on a one-off basis for one or more private investors or investment funds, so long as the investment advisory services were provided at the request of a client of the Manager or an affiliate and the Manager promptly notified us that such services had been rendered. The foregoing restrictions on our Manager lapsed on June 28, 2018 and are no longer applicable.
Following June 28, 2018, our Manager has agreed to offer us the right to participate in all investment opportunities that our Manager determines are appropriate for us in view of our investment objectives, policies and strategies, and other relevant factors, subject to the exception that we might not participate in each such opportunity but will on an overall basis equitably participate with our Manager’s other clients in relevant investment opportunities in accordance with our Manager’s then prevailing investment allocation policy. Our Manager’s investment allocation policy is subject to approval by our independent directors and, at the request of our independent directors, will be subject to periodic review and back-testing by our internal audit function or an independent third party. When making decisions where a conflict of interest may arise, our Manager will endeavor to allocate investment and financing opportunities in a fair and equitable manner over time as between us and our Manager’s other clients, in each case in accordance with our Manager’s investment allocation policy. Our Manager has broad discretion in making that determination, and in amending that determination over time. In allocating investments among us and a Pine River fund, our Manager’s reasons for its allocation decisions may include the following:

• | the contrasting strategies, time horizons and risk profiles of the participating clients;


• | the relative capitalization and cash availability of the clients;


• | the different liquidity positions and requirements of the participating clients;


• | whether a client has appropriate exposure to or concentration in the asset type, geography or property type in question, taking into account both the client's overall investment objectives and the client's exposure or concentration relative to other clients sharing in the allocation;


• | whether an opportunity can be split between the clients, or whether it must be allocated entirely to one client or the other;


• | borrowing base considerations (such as repurchase agreements or other credit facility terms);


• | expectations regarding the timing and sources of new capital and, in the case of the Pine River funds, historical and anticipated subscription and redemption patterns of the Pine River funds; and


• | regulatory or tax considerations.

In certain circumstances strict compliance with the foregoing allocation procedures may not be feasible and unusual or extraordinary conditions may, on occasion, warrant deviation from the practices and procedures described above. In such circumstances, senior personnel of our Manager and/or our board of directors may be called upon to determine the appropriate action which will serve the best interests of, and will be fair and equitable to, all clients involved.

Our Manager may in the future adopt additional conflicts of interest resolution policies and procedures designed to support the equitable allocation and to prevent the preferential allocation of investment opportunities among entities with overlapping investment objectives.
Operating and Regulatory Structure
Regulation
We are required to maintain qualifications, approvals and licenses in a number of states in order to conduct our lending activities and own certain of our target investments. Licensing requirements vary considerably by state and may impose various different obligations on our business, including restrictions on loan origination activity; limits on finance charges, including type, amount and manner of charging fees; disclosure requirements; surety bond and minimum specified net worth requirements; periodic reporting requirements; notice requirements for changes in principal officers, directors or principal owners; and record keeping requirements. Additionally, our licensed entities are required from time to time to submit to routine examinations by state regulatory agencies to ensure our compliance with applicable requirements. State licensing requirements can and do change as statutes and regulations are enacted, promulgated or amended. Obtaining and maintaining the appropriate qualifications, approvals and licenses cause us to incur ongoing expenses and our failure to comply with applicable requirements would have a material adverse effect on us and our operations.
REIT Qualification
We have elected and qualify to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2017. Our qualification as a REIT depends upon our ability to meet on a continuing basis, through actual investment and operating results, various complex requirements under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or the Code, relating to, among other things, the sources of our gross income, the composition and values of our assets, our distribution levels and the diversity of ownership of our shares. We believe that we have been organized in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code, and that our intended manner of operation will enable us to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT.
So long as we qualify as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our taxable income that we distribute currently to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year and do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate rates and may be precluded from qualifying as a REIT for the subsequent four taxable years following the year during which we lost our REIT qualification. Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain U.S. federal, state and local taxes on our income or property.
See “Risk Factors - Risks Related to our REIT Status and Certain Other Tax Items” included in Item 1A of this of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Investment Company Act Exemption
We conduct our operations so that neither we nor any of our subsidiaries are an “investment company” as defined in Section 3(a)(1)(A) or Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act. We believe we are not an investment company under Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act because we do not engage primarily, or hold ourselves out as being engaged primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. Rather, through our wholly owned or majority-owned subsidiaries, we are primarily engaged in non-investment company business related to real estate. In addition, we conduct our operations so that we do not come within the definition of an investment company under Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act because less than 40% of our total assets on an unconsolidated basis will consist of “investment securities” (the “40% test”). Excluded from the term “investment securities” (as that term is defined in the Investment Company Act) are securities issued by majority-owned subsidiaries that are themselves not investment companies and are not relying on the exclusion from the definition of investment company set forth in Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act. The Investment Company Act defines a majority-owned subsidiary of a person as a company 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of which are owned by such person, or by another company which is a majority-owned subsidiary of such person. The Investment Company Act defines voting securities as any security presently entitling the owner or holder thereof to vote for the election of directors of a company. We treat entities in which we own at least a majority of the outstanding voting securities as majority-owned subsidiaries for purposes of the 40% test. We monitor our holdings to ensure ongoing compliance with this test.
 10

We hold our assets primarily through direct or indirect wholly owned or majority-owned subsidiaries, certain of which are excluded from the definition of investment company pursuant to Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Investment Company Act. We classify our assets for purposes of certain of our subsidiaries’ Section 3(c)(5)(C) exclusion from the Investment Company Act based upon no-action positions taken by the SEC staff and interpretive guidance provided by the SEC and its staff. Based on such guidance, to qualify for the exclusion pursuant to Section 3(c)(5)(C), each such subsidiary generally is required to hold at least (i) 55% of its assets in “qualifying” real estate assets and (ii) 80% of its assets in “qualifying” real estate assets and real estate-related assets. “Qualifying” real estate assets for this purpose include mortgage loans, certain B-Notes and certain mezzanine loans that satisfy various conditions as set forth in SEC staff no-action letters and other guidance, and other assets that the SEC staff in various no-action letters and other guidance has determined are the functional equivalent of senior mortgage loans for the purposes of the Investment Company Act. We treat as real estate-related assets, CMBS, B-Notes and mezzanine loans that do not satisfy the conditions set forth in the relevant SEC staff no-action letters and other guidance, and debt and equity securities of companies primarily engaged in real estate businesses. To the extent that the SEC staff publishes new or different guidance with respect to these matters, we may be required to re-classify our assets for purposes of the Investment Company Act, including for purposes of our subsidiaries’ compliance with the exclusion provided in Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Investment Company Act.
If we were required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, we would become subject to substantial regulation with respect to our capital structure (including our ability to use borrowings), management, operations, transactions with affiliated persons (as defined in the Investment Company Act) and portfolio composition, including disclosure requirements and restrictions with respect to diversification and industry concentration and other matters. Compliance with the Investment Company Act would, accordingly, limit our ability to make certain investments and require us to significantly restructure our business plan, which could materially adversely affect our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders.
See “Risk Factors - Risks Related to our Company and Structure - Maintaining our exclusions from registration as an investment company under the Investment Company Act imposes limits on our operations” included in Item 1A of this of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
