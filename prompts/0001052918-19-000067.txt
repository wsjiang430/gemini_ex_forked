ITEM 1 - DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
Company History
 
The Company was originally incorporated under the laws of the State of Idaho on November 9, 1935, under the name of Montgomery Mines, Inc. In April 1978 controlling interest in the Montgomery Mines Corporation was obtained by a group of the Thunder Mountain property holders who then changed the corporate name to Thunder Mountain Gold, Inc. with the primary goal to further develop their holdings in the Thunder Mountain Mining District, Valley County, Idaho. 
Change in Situs and Authorized Capital
 
The Company moved its situs from Idaho to Nevada, but maintains its corporate offices in Garden City, Idaho. On December 10, 2007, articles of incorporation were filed with the Secretary of State in Nevada for Thunder Mountain Gold, Inc., a Nevada Corporation. The Directors of Thunder Mountain Gold, Inc. (Nevada) were the same as for Thunder Mountain Gold, Inc. (Idaho). 
 
On January 25, 2008, the shareholders approved the merger of Thunder Mountain Gold, Inc. (Idaho) with Thunder Mountain Gold, Inc. (Nevada), which was completed by a share for share exchange of common stock. The terms of the merger were such that the Nevada Corporation was the surviving entity. The number of authorized shares for the Nevada Corporation is 200,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.001 per share and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value of $0.0001 per share.

The Company is structured as follows: The Company owns 100% of the outstanding stock of Thunder Mountain Resources, Inc., a Nevada Corporation. Thunder Mountain Resources, Inc. owns 100% of the outstanding stock of South Mountain Mines, Inc., an Idaho Corporation. South Mountain Mines, Inc. owns 75% of Owyhee Gold Territory, LLC.
 
We have no patents, licenses, franchises or concessions which are considered by the Company to be of importance. The business is not of a seasonal nature. Since the potential products are traded in the open market, we have no control over the competitive conditions in the industry. There is no backlog of orders.
 
There are numerous Federal and State laws and regulation related to environmental protection, which have direct application to mining and milling activities. The more significant of these laws deal with mined land reclamation and wastewater discharge from mines and milling operations. We do not believe that these laws and regulations as presently enacted will have a direct material adverse effect on our operations.
 
Subsidiary Companies
 
On May 21, 2007, the Company filed Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State in Nevada for Thunder Mountain Resources, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Thunder Mountain Gold, Inc. The financial information for the new subsidiary is included in the consolidated financial statements.
 
On September 27, 2007, Thunder Mountain Resources, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Thunder Mountain Gold, Inc., completed the purchase of all the outstanding stock of South Mountain Mines, Inc., an Idaho corporation. On November 8, 2012, South Mountain Mines, Inc., (“SMMI”) a wholly owned subsidiary of Thunder Mountain Resources, Inc., which in turn is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and Idaho State Gold Company II LLC (“ISGC”) formed Owyhee Gold Territory LLC (“OGT”) (aka Owyhee Gold Trust, LLC) a limited liability company (LLC). 
 
On November 4, 2016, the Company entered into a Settlement Agreement between ISGC II and, SMMI.  This Settlement was judicially-ratified on November 9, 2016.  SMMI is the Manager and controlling Member and has 75% ownership in the OGT with ISGC II retaining 25% ownership, with a capped at $5 million net returns royalty, with SMMI maintaining total management control over the Project. 
 
The South Mountain Property consists of 17 patented mining claims encompassing approximately 326 acres, 21 unpatented mining lode claims covering approximately 290 acres, and approximately 489 acres of leased private land. In addition, the project owns 360 acres of private land (mill site) not contiguous with the mining claims. 
 
Current Operations
 
Thunder Mountain Gold is a mineral exploration stage company with no producing mines. The Company intends to remain in the business of exploring for mining properties that have the potential to produce gold, silver, base metals and other commodities. 
 
On February 27, 2019, the Company entered into an Option Agreement, (the “BeMetals Option Agreement”) with BeMetals Corp., a British Columbia corporation (“BeMetals”), and BeMetals USA Corp., a Delaware corporation (“BMET USA”), a wholly owned subsidiary of BeMetals. Under the terms of the BeMetals Option Agreement, BMET USA will be entitled to purchase 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of SMMI from TMRI, both wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company. The term of the agreement is for two years, upon certain conditions extendable to three years, with BeMetals required to issue a preliminary economic assessment ("PEA") completed by a mutually agreed third-party engineering firm. Upon Tranche 2, BeMetals will issue 10 million BMET common shares (Consideration Shares) to TMRI, and BeMetals will also purchase of 2.5 million shares of the Company’s common stock at a price of $0.10 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $250,000, on a private placement. BeMetals will make cash payments of $1,100,000 over the 24 months of the Option Agreement. The first Tranche of $100,000 has been paid to the Company. The exercise of the Option Agreement price can be paid in combination with cash and BeMetals common shares. The calculation of the purchase price is an amount equal to the lesser of 50% of the market capitalization of BeMetals at the time; and the greater of either:
 A.
$10 million; or 
 B.
20% the net present value of the South Mountain Project as calculated in a PEA

Payment may be satisfied by through the delivery of BMET common shares (Consideration Shares), a cash payment or a combination of Consideration Shares and cash. The BMET common shares will be issued at a deemed value based on the 5-day VWAP of Consideration Shares immediately prior to the date that BMET USA gives notice of its intention to exercise the option.
 
Payment(s) may be accelerated to exercise the Option Agreement, and restrictions will exist on resale of BeMetals common shares. The Company will not be granted any anti-dilution rights in respect of the Consideration Shares. 
The Company will provide additional information to shareholders of the Company regarding the BeMetals Option Agreement in either a Schedule 14A proxy circular or a Schedule 14C information statement to be prepared in connection with obtaining the required shareholder approval to the BeMetals Option Agreement. There is no assurance that the transactions contemplated under the BeMetals Option Agreement will be completed.
