Perrigo Company plc - Item 1
Business Overview

We previously had two legacy segments, Specialty Sciences and Other, which contained our Tysabri® financial asset and API businesses, respectively, which we divested. Following these divestitures, there were no substantial assets or operations left in either of these segments. Effective January 1, 2017, all expenses associated with our former Specialty Sciences segment were moved to unallocated expenses. Financial information related to our business segments can be found in Item 8. Note 19. Our segments reflect the way in which our management makes operating decisions, allocates resources and manages the growth and profitability of the Company. 
MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS IN OUR BUSINESS
Vision Transformation
Upon the arrival of our new CEO and President Murray Kessler, he and his leadership team made their first priority to set a new vision for the Company that will help us transform into a consumer-focused company. That vision is "To make lives better by bringing "Quality, Affordable Self-Care Products™" that consumers trust everywhere they are sold." The new vision for the future is designed to support the shifting focus on our consumer branded and store brand portfolio and our global reach and the opportunities for growth we see ahead of us, while remaining loyal to our heritage. The vision represents an evolution from healthcare to self-care, which takes advantage of a massive global trend and opens up a large number of adjacent growth opportunities for the Company.
Irish Tax Appeals Commission Notice of Amended Assessment
Perrigo Pharma International, a designated activity company organized under the laws of Ireland, formerly known as Elan Pharma International Limited (“Elan Pharma”) and currently a subsidiary of Perrigo Company plc, timely filed an appeal on December 27, 2018 with the Irish Tax Appeals Commission regarding a NoA issued by the Irish Office of the Revenue Commissioners (“Irish Revenue”) for the calendar year ended December 31, 2013. The NoA is dated November 29, 2018, and assesses an Irish corporation tax liability against Elan Pharma in the amount of €1,636 million, not including interest or any applicable penalties.
Perrigo acquired Elan Pharma through the December 2013 business combination between Perrigo’s predecessor and Elan Corporation, plc. The NoA relates to the tax treatment of the April 2013 sale by Elan Pharma of Tysabri® intellectual property and related assets to Biogen Idec. As previously reported, the consideration paid by Biogen Idec took the form of an upfront payment and future contingent payments. The upfront payment received from Biogen Idec in 2013 and contingent payments received in subsequent years were recognized as trading income in Elan Pharma’s tax returns filed with Irish Revenue. This treatment is consistent with Elan Pharma’s activities for two decades relating to the active management of intellectual property rights, which includes acquiring,
developing, holding, exploiting, dealing in and disposing of intellectual property rights for use in the pharmaceutical industry.
On October 30, 2018, Irish Revenue issued an audit findings letter to Elan Pharma asserting the claim that (a) IP sales transactions by Elan Pharma, including the sale of Tysabri®, were not part of the trade of Elan Pharma and therefore should have been treated as chargeable gains subject to an effective 33% tax rate, rather than the 12.5% tax rate applicable to trading income, and (b) all amounts received in respect of both the Tysabri® transaction and the related transaction entered into with RPI Finance Trust in 2017 should be taxed in Elan Pharma’s 2013 tax year.
We disagree with both the basis on which Elan Pharma has been assessed and the methodology used to calculate the amount set out in the NoA. We believe the NoA is without merit and that Irish Revenue’s position is incorrect as a matter of law. Accordingly, we filed an appeal of the NoA on December 27, 2018 and will pursue all available administrative and judicial avenues as may be necessary or appropriate. As part of this strategy to pursue all available administrative and judicial avenues, Elan Pharma was, on February 25, 2019, granted leave by the Irish High Court to seek judicial review of the issuance of the NoA. The judicial review filing is based on our belief that Elan Pharma's legitimate expectations as a taxpayer have been breached, not on the merits of the NoA itself. If we are ultimately successful in the judicial review proceedings, the NoA will be invalidated and Irish Revenue will not be able to re-issue the NoA. The proceedings before the Tax Appeals Commission has been stayed until a decision on the judicial review application has been made, which could take up to, or more than, a year. No payment of any amount related to this assessment is required to be made, if at all, until all applicable proceedings

Business Overview

have been completed, which could take a number of years. However, while we believe our position to be correct, there can be no assurance of an ultimate favorable outcome, and if the matter is ultimately resolved unfavorably it would have a material adverse impact on us, including on liquidity and capital resources (refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors - Tax related Risks and Item 8. Note 14).
RX Separation
On August 9, 2018, we announced a plan to separate our RX business, which, when completed, will enable us to focus on expanding our consumer-facing businesses. We have begun the preparations for the separation, which may include a possible sale, spin-off, merger or other form of separation. While we are currently targeting to complete the separation by the end of 2019, the form of separation may delay its completion beyond this date. In connection with the proposed separation, we anticipate incurring significant preparation costs, excluding restructuring expenses and transaction costs, in the range of $45.0 million to $80.0 million depending on the final structure of a transaction, with a spin-off resulting in costs at the higher end of this range.
API Divestitures 
During the year ended December 31, 2017, we completed the sale of our India API business to Strides Shasun Limited for $22.2 million in proceeds. Prior to closing the sale, we determined that the carrying value of the India API business exceeded its fair value less the cost to sell, resulting in an impairment charge of $35.3 million, which was recorded in Impairment charges on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2016.
During the year ended December 31, 2017, we completed the sale of our Israel API business to SK Capital, for a sale price of $110.0 million.
Financial Asset
During the year ended December 31, 2016, we initiated a strategic review of the Tysabri® financial asset and identified impairment indicators of the fair value of that royalty stream, which led to a goodwill impairment of $199.6 million, which was recorded in Impairment charges on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we divested the Tysabri® financial asset to Royalty Pharma for up to $2.85 billion, consisting of $2.2 billion in cash and up to $250.0 million and $400.0 million in milestone payments. As a result of this transaction, we transferred the entire financial asset to Royalty Pharma and recorded a $17.1 million gain. We elected to account for the contingent milestone payments using the fair value option method, and these were recorded at an estimated fair value of $134.5 million as of December 31, 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2018, Tysabri® met the 2018 global net sales threshold resulting in a $170.1 million gain recorded in Change in financial assets. We received the $250.0 million royalty payment on February 22, 2019. In order for us to receive the 2020 milestone payment, Royalty Pharma contingent payments for Tysabri® sales in 2020 must exceed $351.0 million. The fair value of the 2020 milestone payment is $73.2 million as of December 31, 2018.
Omega Acquisition
On March 30, 2015, we acquired Omega Pharma Invest N.V. ("Omega"), one of the largest OTC companies in Europe, for $3.0 billion in equity and cash and assumed debt of $1.6 billion, for a total purchase price of $4.6 billion. The Omega acquisition expanded our OTC leadership position into continental Europe, accelerated our international expansion and geographic diversification through enhanced scale and a broader footprint, and diversified our net sales and cash flow streams.
The broader European platform established through the Omega acquisition facilitated the acquisition of a portfolio of well-established OTC brands sold primarily in Europe from GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare (“GSK”), on August 28, 2015, as well as Naturwohl Pharma, GmbH ("Naturwohl"), with its leading German dietary supplement brand Yokebe®, on September 15, 2015.

Perrigo Company plc - Item 1
Business Overview

During the year ended December 31, 2016, we identified impairment indicators associated with certain intangible assets and goodwill, which required us to test these assets for impairment. As a result, we recorded total impairments of $2.0 billion which was recorded in Impairment charges on the Consolidated Statements of Operations (refer to Item 8. Note 4).
NEW PRODUCTS
We consider a product to be new if it (i) was reformulated, (ii) was a product line extension due to changes in characteristics such as strength, flavor, or color, (iii) had a change in product status from "prescription only" ("Rx") to OTC, (iv) was a new store brand or branded launch, (v) was provided in a new dosage form or (vi) was sold to a new geographic area with different regulatory authorities, in all cases, within 12 months prior to the end of the period for which net sales are being measured. During the year ended December 31, 2018, new product sales were $169.7 million.
CONSUMER HEALTHCARE AMERICAS
Overview 
The CHCA segment is focused primarily on the sale of store-brand products, including OTC cough, cold, allergy and sinus, analgesic, gastrointestinal, smoking cessation, infant formula and food, diagnostic products, and animal health products in the U.S., Mexico and Canada. We are a leading provider of consumer healthcare products sold to consumers via store brands as well as consumer healthcare products under our own brands. Consumer awareness and knowledge of the quality and value that OTC store brand products represent continues to grow due to efforts to promote their own label programs. During the year ended December 31, 2018, our CHCA segment represented approximately 51% of consolidated net sales. 
The CHCA segment develops, manufactures, and markets store-brand products that are comparable in quality and effectiveness to national brands. Store brand products must meet the same U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") requirements as national brands within the U.S. and the requirements of comparable regulatory bodies outside the U.S. In most instances our product packaging is designed to invite and reinforce comparison to national brand products, while communicating store brand value to consumers.
The cost of store brand products to retailers is significantly lower than that of comparable nationally advertised brand-name products. Generally, retailers’ dollar profit per unit of store brand product is greater than the dollar profit per unit of the comparable national brand product. The retailer, therefore, can price a store brand product below the competing national brand product and realize a greater profit margin. The consumer benefits by receiving a high quality product at a price below the comparable national brand product. As a result, our business model results in consumers saving money on their healthcare spending. 

We are dedicated to continuing to be the leader in developing and marketing new store brand products, including infant formula, and have a research and development ("R&D") staff that we believe is one of the most experienced in the industry at developing products comparable in formulation and quality to national brand products. Our R&D team also responds to changes in existing national brand products by reformulating existing products. For example, in the OTC pharmaceutical market, certain new products are the result of changes in product status from Rx to OTC. These “Rx-to-OTC switches” require FDA approval through a process initiated by the drug innovator. The drug innovator usually begins the process by filing a New Drug Application ("NDA"), which is often followed by a competitor filing an ANDA. New drugs are also marketed through the FDA's OTC monograph process, which allows for the production of drugs that are generally recognized as safe and effective without pre-marketing approval. 
The CHCA segment also develops, manufactures, and distributes certain branded products, which is consistent with the segment's healthcare strategy to meet consumer needs wherever they are sold. Branded products are sold under the brand names Good Sense®, Sergeant's®, Sentry®, Zephrex D®, PetArmor®, and ScarAway® brand names.
We manufacture a significant portion of our CHCA segment's products at our plants in the U.S., Mexico, and Israel, and we source the remaining product materials from third parties. We rely on both internal R&D and strategic 
 5

Perrigo Company plc - Item 1
CHCA

product development agreements with outside sources to develop new products. In addition, in order to maximize both our capacity and sales of proprietary formulas, we engage in contract manufacturing, which involves producing unique ANDAs and monograph products through partnerships with major pharmaceutical and direct-to-consumer companies.
We believe the increasing age of the population, in combination with continued rising healthcare costs, will drive the need for the greater value that our store brand products provide consumers. In addition, we believe that new products and products switching from Rx to OTC (as described above) will continue to drive growth within the segment.
Recent Developments 

• | On May 29, 2018, we entered into a license agreement with Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp. ("Merck") that will allow us to develop and commercialize an OTC version of Nasonex-branded products, as well as other products containing the same active ingredient. In connection with this license agreement, we paid an upfront license fee of $50.0 million. In addition, if we achieve certain development milestones, we will make future milestone and royalty payments.


• | During the year ended December 31, 2018, we identified indications of impairment in the animal health reporting unit. The impairment indicators related to changes in channel dynamics, a strategic decision to re-prioritize our brands, and a decline in the forecasted outlook of the reporting unit. We recorded goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges of $213.3 million in Impairment charges on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Perrigo Company plc - Item 1
CHCA

The chart below reflects net sales by product category in the CHCA segment, which includes net sales from our OTC contract manufacturing business for the year ended December 31, 2018.

We launched a number of new CHCA products in the year ended December 31, 2018, most notably esomeprazole magnesium (store brand equivalent to Nexium® 24HR capsules), omeprazole delayed release orally disintegrating tablets, and infant formula products. During the year ended December 31, 2018, new product sales in the CHCA segment were $48.7 million.
We, on our own or in conjunction with partners, received final FDA approval from U.S. health authorities for four new products within the CHCA segment in the year ended December 31, 2018, and as of December 31, 2018, we had eight new product applications pending FDA approval.
Sales and Marketing

Our customers include major global, national, and regional retail drug, supermarket, and mass merchandise chains such as Walmart, Costco, Kroger, Target, CVS, Walgreens Boots Alliance, Dollar General, Sam’s Club, Rite Aid, Amazon, Aldi, Petsmart, and Petco, and major wholesalers, including McKesson, Amerisource Bergen, and Cardinal Health.
We seek to establish customer loyalty through superior customer service by providing a comprehensive assortment of high quality, value-priced products; timely processing, shipment and delivery of orders; assistance in managing customer inventories; and support in managing and building the customer’s store brand business. The CHCA segment employs its own sales force to service larger customers, and uses industry brokers for other customers. Field sales employees, with support from marketing and customer service, are assigned to specific customers in order to work most effectively with the customer. They assist customers by developing customized brand and in-store marketing programs for customers' store brand products.
The primary objective of this store brand management approach is to enable our customers, retailers and wholesalers, to increase sales and market share of their own store brand products by communicating store brand 
 7

Perrigo Company plc - Item 1
CHCA

quality and value to the consumer and by inviting comparison to national brand products. Our sales and marketing personnel assist customers in the development and introduction of new store brand products and in the promotion of customers’ existing store brand products by providing market information; establishing individualized promotions and marketing programs, which may include floor displays, bonus sizes, coupons, rebates, store signs, and promotional packs; and performing consumer research. As eCommerce continues to grow as a consumer channel for our products, we are developing resources, programs and tools to be a strategic marketing partner for our customers’ digital marketing efforts.
In contrast with national brand manufacturers, which incur considerable advertising and marketing expenditures targeted directly to the end user or consumer, the CHCA segment’s primary marketing efforts are channeled through retailers and wholesalers and reach the consumer through our customers’ in-store marketing programs and our digital media programs. Because the retail profit margin for store brand products is generally higher than for national brand products, retailers and wholesalers often commit funds for additional promotions.
Our animal health category, which has a greater emphasis on value-branded products, promotes product awareness through direct-to-consumer advertising, including television commercials, online advertising, in-store display vehicles, and social media. 
In addition to in-store marketing programs, our infant formula category markets directly to consumers and healthcare professionals.
Competition
The markets for OTC pharmaceuticals, smoking cessation, and infant formula are highly competitive and differ for each product line and geographic region. Our primary competitors include manufacturers, such as LNK International, Inc., PL Developments, and Dr. Reddy's Labs, and brand-name pharmaceutical and consumer product companies, such as Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer, Bayer AG, GSK, Nestle S.A. (Gerber), Abbott Nutrition, Aurobindo, and Mead Johnson Nutrition Co. The competition is highly fragmented in terms of geographic market coverage and product categories, such that a competitor generally does not compete across all product lines. However, some competitors do have larger sales volumes in certain of our categories. Additionally, national brand companies tend to have more resources committed to marketing their products and could in the future manufacture store brands of their products at lower prices than their national brand products. Competition is based on a variety of factors, including price, quality, assortment of products, customer service, marketing support, and approvals for new products (refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Operations for additional information and risks associated with competition).
CONSUMER HEALTHCARE INTERNATIONAL
Overview 
The CHCI segment is comprised of our branded consumer products across self-care, skin care, and lifestyle products primarily in Europe and our consumer focused businesses in the U.K., Australia, and Israel. This segment also includes our U.K. liquid licensed generic product business. The CHCI segment develops, manufactures, markets and distributes many well-known European consumer healthcare brands in the cough, cold, allergy, sinus, lifestyle, personal care and derma-therapeutics, natural health and vitamins, smoking cessation, and anti-parasite categories. In addition, the segment leverages its broad regulatory, sales, and distribution infrastructure to in-license and sell third-party brands and generic pharmaceutical products. The CHCI segment distributes these products through an extensive network of customers including pharmacies, wholesalers, drug and grocery store retailers, and para-pharmacies in 27 countries, primarily in Europe. Many CHCI products have market leading positions in the markets in which they compete. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the CHCI segment represented approximately 32% of consolidated net sales.
Through continued investment in R&D partnerships and new technologies, the CHCI segment strives to offer high quality products that meet consumers' needs. The combination of internal R&D, new product development, insourcing, acquisitions, and partnerships support the new product pipeline, both in terms of brand extensions and product improvements. In the U.K., R&D focuses on oral liquid formulations for the branded Rx products for which liquid formulations are not available, as well as the development of store brand products and 
 8

Perrigo Company plc - Item 1
CHCI

products for the branded business. Additional R&D centers are located in France, Sweden, Austria, and Belgium. In the rest of Europe, most R&D is performed by external partners with oversight by our teams. The segment has seven plants dedicated to manufacturing certain of its products.
The CHCI segment primarily focuses on building local and regional brands. In many markets outside of the U.S., a brand marketing strategy can be more effective than a store brand strategy due to the absence of mass merchandisers and large scale pharmacy chains. Additionally, the absence of a centralized regulatory environment within Europe adds to the complexity of obtaining approvals for products in these markets.
While the CHCI segment sells products from over 200 brands both on its own and through third parties, it focuses its resources on its "Focus brands", which are selected on the basis of their current sales and growth potential in the OTC market. Additional resources are allocated to these brands to build strong positions in the largest, most highly profitable categories in the OTC market, while maintaining leadership in smaller branded categories. 
Recent Developments

• | Management continues to implement its previously disclosed strategy for brand prioritization, sales force restructuring, and manufacturing insourcing, which is expected to reduce selling costs, improve operating margins and focus on higher value OTC products. As part of this strategy, we implemented a new restructuring plan in our CHCI segment that is expected to improve our cost structure.

Products
Below are the categories in which the CHCI segment competes and some of the top brands in each category.

Product Category | Description | Focus Brands 
Cough, Cold, Allergy, and Sinus | Products that address pain relief and respiratory symptoms, including traditional medications and alternative treatments such as aromatherapy solutions. | Bittner®/Aflubin®Bronchenolo®/Bronchostop®Libenar®Physiomer®Phytsosun®/Valda®Solpadeine®/Coldrex®/Antigrippine®
Lifestyle | Weight management, pregnancy and fertility kits, sleep management, smoking cessation, and eye care. | Niquitin®Silence®/Nytol®XLS (Medical)® 
Personal Care and Derma-Therapeutics | Products for the face and body, including sun care, baby-specific, and feminine hygiene products, and solutions for various skin conditions and allergies such as eczema, psoriasis and rosacea. | ACO®Biodermal®Canoderm®Dermalex®Lactacyd®Wartner® 
Natural Health and Vitamins, Minerals, and Supplements | Vitamins, minerals, supplements, and various other natural remedies. | Abtei®Biover®Davitamon®Granufink®Ymea® 
Anti-Parasite | Products focused on the elimination of parasites in both humans and pets including lice treatment and insect repellent. | Jungle Formula®Paranix®

Perrigo Company plc - Item 1
CHCI

The chart below reflects net sales by product category in the CHCI segment for the year ended December 31, 2018.
We launched a number of new CHCI products in the year ended December 31, 2018, most notably Phytsosun®, Paranix®, and ACO®. During the year ended December 31, 2018, new product sales in the CHCI segment were $77.8 million.
The CHCI segment has more than 100 strategic new products in 12 product categories in development, with each of its Focus brands having a five-year innovation master plan. 
Sales and Marketing
Our customers include pharmacies, drug stores, and grocery stores located primarily in Europe, including Walgreens Boots Alliance, ASDA, Tesco, DM, Rossmann, ETOS, and Kruidvat. The CHCI segment sells its products primarily through an established pharmacy sales force to an extensive network of individual pharmacists. Our sales representatives visit pharmacists frequently, ensuring strong in-store visibility of our brands and facilitating pharmacist education programs. Our sales, marketing, and regulatory teams use training/merchandising teams to work in conjunction with local sales representatives to improve our brands' presence and recognition. We seek to attract key talent from leading OTC, Fast Moving Consumer Goods ("FMCG"), and retailer companies to build strong local teams throughout the countries in which the CHCI segment operates. 
While CHCI products have a higher average gross margin than products sold by the CHCA segment, selling expenses are significantly higher due to the sales force mentioned above, as well as broadcast advertising and point-of-sale promotional spending to enhance brand equity. Key marketing communication tools for the CHCI segment include television and digital commercials, consumer leaflets, product websites, and targeted promotional campaigns.
Competition
The competitive landscape of the European consumer products market, in the categories in which we compete, is highly fragmented, as local companies often hold leadership positions in individual product segments in particular countries. As a result, the relevant competition in each of the CHCI segment's markets is both local and 
 10

Perrigo Company plc - Item 1
CHCI

global. Competitors include Sanofi, Bayer, Reckitt Benckiser, GSK, Novartis, and Johnson & Johnson, as well as additional regional competitors. We believe our key advantage lies in our unique combination of best practices in sales, marketing, and product development from FMCG and OTC/Rx, while embracing the pharmacy channel to drive self-care (refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Operations for additional information and risks associated with competition).
PRESCRIPTION PHARMACEUTICALS
Overview
The RX segment develops, manufactures, and markets a portfolio of generic prescription drugs primarily in the U.S. We define this portfolio as predominantly "extended topicals" as it encompasses a broad array of dosage forms such as creams, ointments, lotions, gels, shampoos, foams, suppositories, sprays, liquids, suspensions, and solutions. The portfolio also includes select controlled substances, injectables, hormones, oral solid dosage forms, and oral liquid formulations. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the RX segment represented approximately 17% of consolidated net sales.
In addition to extended topical products, our current development areas include other delivery systems such as oral liquids, metered dose inhalers, injectables, and transdermal products, some of which we are developing with third parties. Our other areas of expertise include our production capabilities for controlled substances and hormonal products. R&D efforts focus on complex formulations, many of which require costly clinical endpoint trials.
We manufacture our topical and oral products in the U.S. and Israel, and also source from various FDA-approved third parties. Rx products are manufactured, labeled, and packaged in facilities that comply with strict regulatory standards and meet customers’ stringent requirements.
In addition, the RX segment offers OTC products through the prescription channel (referred to as "ORx®", these products are marketed using the Perrigo name). ORx® products are OTC products that are available for pharmacy fulfillment and may be eligible for healthcare reimbursement when prescribed by a physician. We offer numerous ORx® products that are reimbursable through many health plans and the U.S. Medicaid and Medicare programs. 
We actively collaborate with other pharmaceutical companies to develop, manufacture, and market certain products or groups of products. These types of agreements are common in the pharmaceutical industry. We may choose to enter into these types of agreements to, among other things, leverage our or our collaborators' scientific R&D expertise, or utilize our extensive marketing and distribution resources (refer to Item 8. Note 2 for more information regarding our method for recognizing revenue and expenses related to collaboration agreements, as well as Item 8. Note 17 for more information regarding our collaboration agreements).
Recent Trends and Developments

• | We continue to experience a significant year-over-year reduction in pricing in our RX segment due to competitive pressures. This softness in pricing is attributable to various factors, including increased focus from customers to capture competition in specific products, supply chain productivity savings, and consolidation of certain customers. While in the fourth quarter of 2018, we experienced a year-over-year decrease in pricing pressure, we expect softness in pricing to continue to impact the segment for the foreseeable future.


• | On August 9, 2018, we announced a plan to separate our RX business, which, when completed, will enable us to focus on expanding our consumer-facing businesses. We have begun the preparations for the separation, which may include a possible sale, spin-off, merger or other form of separation. While we are currently targeting to complete the separation by the end of 2019, the form of separation may delay its completion beyond this date. In connection with the proposed separation, we anticipate incurring significant preparation costs, excluding restructuring expenses and transaction costs, in the range of $45.0 million to $80.0 million depending on the final structure of a transaction, with a spin-off resulting in costs at the higher end of this range.

Sales and Marketing
Our customers include sourcing groups such as Red Oak, WBAD and ClarusONE, major wholesalers, national and regional retail drug, supermarket and mass merchandise chains, hospitals, and pharmacies.
Competition
The market for Rx products is subject to intense competition from other generic drug manufacturers, brand-name pharmaceutical companies launching their own generic version of their branded products (known as an authorized generic), manufacturers of branded drug products that continue to produce those products after patent expirations, and manufacturers of therapeutically similar drugs. Among our generic drug manufacturer competitors are Taro Pharmaceuticals, Mylan, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., Glenmark Generics Inc., Akorn, Lupin, and Apotex Corp.

RX

We believe that one of our primary competitive advantages is our ability to introduce difficult to develop and/or manufacture topical generic versions to brand-name drug products. Generally, these products are exposed to less competition due to the relatively longer and more expensive development, clinical trial, and approval processes. In addition, we believe we have a favorable competitive position due primarily to our efficient distribution systems, topical production economies of scale, customer service, and overall reputation for high quality products (refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Operations for more information and risks associated with competition).
INFORMATION APPLICABLE TO ALL REPORTABLE SEGMENTS
Trademarks, Patents and Licensing Agreements
While we own certain trademarks and patents, neither our business as a whole, nor any of our segments, is materially dependent upon our ownership of any one trademark, or patent, or group of trademarks or patents.
Materials Sourcing
Affordable high quality raw materials and packaging components are essential to all of our business units due to the nature of the products we manufacture. Raw materials and packaging components are generally available from multiple suppliers. Supplies of certain raw materials, bulk tablets, and components may be more limited, as they are available from one or only a few suppliers and may require regulatory approval before we can use them. Prior to the sale of our Israel and India API businesses, we had the ability to manufacture and supply certain API for our OTC and Rx products, which we now source from the companies that have acquired our API businesses. We have been purchasing an increasing number of components and select finished goods rather than manufacturing them because of the availability of goods, economic reasons, temporary production limitations, FDA restrictions, sale of our API businesses, and other factors.
Historically, we have been able to react effectively to situations that require alternate sourcing. Should such alternate sourcing be necessary, FDA requirements placed on products approved through the ANDA or NDA process could substantially lengthen the approval of an alternate source and adversely affect financial results. We believe we have good, cooperative working relationships with substantially all of our suppliers and have historically been able to capitalize on economies of scale in the purchase of materials and supplies due to our volume of purchases (refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Operations for risks associated with materials sourcing).
Manufacturing and Distribution
Our primary manufacturing facilities are in the U.S. We also have manufacturing facilities in the U.K., Belgium, France, Germany, Austria, Israel, Mexico, and Australia, along with a joint venture in China (refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Operations for risks associated with our manufacturing facilities). We supplement our production capabilities with the purchase of products from outside sources. The capacity of some facilities may be fully utilized at certain times for various reasons, such as customer demand, the seasonality of the cough/cold/flu, allergy, or flea and tick seasons, and new product launches. We may utilize available capacity by performing contract manufacturing for other companies. We have logistics facilities in the U.S., Israel, Mexico, Australia, and numerous locations throughout Europe. We use contract freight and common carriers to deliver our products.

Significant Customers 
Our primary customer base aligns with the concentration of large drug retailers in the current global retail drug industry marketplace. Walmart is our largest customer and accounted for the following percentage of consolidated net sales:

Year Ended 
December 31, 2018 | | December 31, 2017 | | December 31, 2016
12.8 | % | | 13.0 | % | 13.0 | %

 Sales to Walmart are primarily in the CHCA segment. In addition, while no other customer individually comprises more than 10% of net sales, we do have other significant customers. The next five largest customers represent 23% of net sales in 2018. The loss of several of these customers could be material. We believe we generally have good relationships with all of our customers (refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Operations for risks associated with customers).
Environmental
We are subject to various environmental laws and regulations. We have made, and continue to make, expenditures necessary to comply with applicable environmental laws, but do not believe that the costs for complying with such laws and regulations have been or will be material to our business. We do not have any material remediation liabilities outstanding.
While we believe that climate change could present risks to our business, including increased operating costs due to additional regulatory requirements, physical risks to our facilities, water limitations, and disruptions to our supply chain, we do not believe these risks are material to our business in the near term. 
Corporate Social Responsibility
We are committed to doing business in an ethical manner. We have a long history of environmentally sound and efficient operations, safe and healthy working conditions, and active participation in the communities where we are located. As reflected in our Corporate Social Responsibility Commitment Statement available on our website, we remain committed to:

• | Helping consumers access safe, effective and affordable health and wellness products;


• | Strong corporate governance;


• | Complying with regulatory and legal requirements;


• | Demonstrating environmental stewardship;


• | Continuously improving packaging sustainability;


• | Protecting human rights of our global employees and challenging our partners to do the same;


• | Diversity of thought, experience and perspective;


• | Providing a safe and healthy work environment for our employees; and


• | Establishing effective community partnerships.

Through these efforts, we strive to minimize our impact on the environment, drive responsible business practices, and ensure the welfare of our employees, their families, and the communities in which we operate now and into the future.
GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND PRICING
The manufacturing, processing, formulation, packaging, labeling, testing, storing, distributing, advertising, and sale of our products are subject to regulation by a variety of agencies in the localities in which our products are sold. In addition, we manufacture and market certain of our products in accordance with standards set by various organizations. We believe that our policies, operations, and products comply in all material respects with existing regulations to which we are subject (refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Operations for related risks).

Regulation

United States Regulation
U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
The FDA has jurisdiction over our Rx, OTC drug products, API, and Infant Formula Foods. The FDA’s jurisdiction extends to the manufacturing, testing, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, and promotion of these products. We are committed to consistently providing our customers with high quality products that adhere to "current Good Manufacturing Practices" ("cGMP") regulations promulgated by the FDA.
OTC and Rx Pharmaceuticals 
All facilities where Rx and OTC products are manufactured, tested, packaged, stored, or distributed for the U.S. market must comply with FDA cGMPs and regulations promulgated by competent authorities in the countries, states and localities where the facilities are located. All of our drug products are manufactured, tested, packaged, stored, and distributed according to cGMP regulations. The FDA performs periodic audits to ensure that our facilities remain in compliance with all appropriate regulations. 
Many of our OTC products are regulated under the OTC monograph system and subject to certain FDA regulations. Under this system, selected OTC drugs are generally recognized as safe and effective and do not require the approval of an ANDA or NDA prior to marketing. Products marketed under the OTC monograph system must conform to specific quality, formula, and labeling requirements, including permitted indications, required warnings and precautions, allowable combinations of ingredients, and dosage levels. It is generally less costly to develop and bring to market a product regulated under the OTC monograph system. 
            We also market generic prescription drugs and non-prescription products that have switched from prescription to OTC status. Prior to commercial marketing, these products require approval by the FDA of an ANDA or NDA that provides information on chemistry, manufacturing controls, clinical safety, efficacy and/or bioequivalence, packaging, and labeling. While the development process for these drugs generally requires less time and expense than the development process of a new drug, the size and duration of required studies can vary greatly. Prior to the onset of the Generic Drug User Fee Amendments of 2012 (“GDUFA”), the FDA approval of generic drug applications took approximately three to five times longer than approval of innovator drugs. Pursuant to GDUFA II, beginning October 1, 2017, year five of the program, the FDA pledged to complete a first cycle review on 90% of electronic generic applications within 10 months of submission.
Under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, as amended ("FFDCA") (the Hatch-Waxman amendments), a company submitting an NDA can obtain a three-year period of marketing exclusivity for a prescription or OTC product if it performs a clinical study that is essential to FDA approval. Longer periods of exclusivity are possible for new chemical entities, orphan drugs (those designated under section 526 of the FFDCA) and drugs under the Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now Act. During this exclusivity period, the FDA cannot approve any ANDAs for a similar or equivalent generic product, which can preclude another party from marketing a similar product during this period. A company may obtain an additional six months of exclusivity if it conducts pediatric studies requested by the FDA on the product. This exclusivity can delay both the FDA approval and sales of certain products.
A company may be entitled to a 180-day generic exclusivity period for certain products. This exclusivity period often follows a patent certification and litigation process whereby the product innovator may sue for infringement. The legal action does not ordinarily result in material damages, but it generally triggers a statutorily mandated delay in FDA approval of the ANDA for a period of up to 30 months from when the innovator was notified of the patent challenge. 
The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act ("FDASIA") was signed into law on July 9, 2012. The law established, among other things, new user fee statutes for generic drugs and biosimilars, FDA authority concerning drug shortages, changes to enhance the FDA's inspection authority of the drug supply chain, and a limited extension of the 30-month stay provision described above. The FDASIA also reduced the time required for FDA responses to generic-blocking citizen petitions. We implemented new systems and processes to comply with the new facility self-identification and user fee requirements of the FDASIA, and we monitor facility self-

identification and fee payment compliance to mitigate the risk of potential supply chain interruptions or delays in regulatory approval of new applications.
The U.S. government's Federal Drug Supply Chain Security Act ("DSCSA") requires development of an electronic pedigree to track and trace each prescription drug at the salable unit level through the distribution system, which will be effective incrementally over a 10-year period. The serialization of all Rx products distributed in the U.S. needed to be completed by November 26, 2018, with the requirement for tracking the products commencing on November 27, 2023. Requirements for the tracing of products at the lot level through the pharmaceutical distribution supply chain went into effect on January 1, 2015 for manufacturers, wholesale distributors, and re-packagers, and on July 1, 2015 for dispensers. 
Infant Formula and Foods 
The FDA’s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition is responsible for the regulation of infant formula. The Office of Nutrition, Labeling and Dietary Supplements ("ONLDS") has labeling responsibility for infant formula, while the Office of Food Additive Safety ("OFAS") has program responsibility for food ingredients and packaging. The ONLDS evaluates whether an infant formula manufacturer has met the requirements under the FFDCA and consults with the OFAS regarding the safety of ingredients in infant formula and of packaging materials for infant formula.
All manufacturers of pediatric nutrition products must begin with safe food ingredients, which are either generally recognized as safe or approved as food additives. The Infant Formula Act provides specific requirements for infant formula to ensure the safety and nutrition of infant formulas, including minimum and, in some cases, maximum levels of specified nutrients.
Before marketing a particular infant formula, the manufacturer must provide regulatory agencies assurance of the nutritional quality of that particular formulation consistent with the FDA’s labeling, nutrient content, and manufacturer quality control requirements. A manufacturer must notify the FDA at least 90 days before the marketing of any infant formula that differs fundamentally in processing or in composition from any previous formulation produced by the manufacturer. We actively monitor this process and make the appropriate adjustments to remain in compliance with recent FDA rules regarding cGMP, quality control procedures, quality factors, notification requirements, and reports and records for the production of infant formulas.
In addition, the FFDCA requires infant formula manufacturers to test product composition during production and shelf-life; to keep records on production, testing, and distribution of each batch of infant formula; to use cGMP and quality control procedures; and to maintain records of all complaints and adverse events, some of which may reveal the possible existence of a health hazard. The FDA conducts yearly inspections of all facilities that manufacture infant formula, inspects new facilities during early production runs, and collects and analyzes samples of infant formula. Our infant formula manufacturing facilities have been inspected by the FDA with no corrective actions required.
Our infant and toddler foods are subject to the Food Safety Modernization Act ("FSMA"), which protects the safety of U.S. foods by mandating comprehensive, prevention-based controls within the food industry. Under FSMA, the FDA has mandatory recall authority for all food products and greater authority to inspect food producers and is taking steps toward product tracing to enable more efficient product source identification in the event of a safety issue. 
Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients
Third parties develop and manufacture API for use in certain of our products that are exported to the U.S. and other global markets. Before API can be commercialized in the U.S., the manufacturer and/or developer must submit a drug master file ("DMF") that provides the proprietary information related to the manufacturing process. The FDA inspects the manufacturing facilities to assess cGMP compliance, and the facilities and procedures must be cGMP compliant before API may be exported to the U.S. 
The facilities and products are subject to regulation by the applicable regulatory bodies in the place of manufacture as well as the regulatory agency in the country from which the product is exported or imported. For API 
 16

Perrigo Company plc - Item 1
Regulation

exported to European markets, the manufacturer must submit a European DMF and, where applicable, obtain a certificate of suitability from the European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines. The manufacturing facilities and production procedures for API marketed in Europe must meet European Union ("EU")-GMP and European Pharmacopeia standards.
U.S. Department of Agriculture
The Organic Foods Production Act enacted under Title 21 of the 1990 Farm Bill established uniform national standards for the production and handling of foods labeled as "organic." Our infant formula manufacturing sites in Vermont and Ohio adhere to the standards of the U.S. Department of Agriculture ("USDA") National Organic Program for production, handling, and processing to maintain the integrity of organic products. Our infant formula manufacturing sites in Vermont and Ohio are USDA-certified, enabling them to produce and label organic products for U.S. and Canadian markets.
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") is the main regulatory body in the United States for veterinary pesticides. The EPA's Office of Pesticide Programs is responsible for the regulation of pesticide products applied to animals. All manufacturers of animal health pesticides must show that their products will not cause “unreasonable adverse effects to man or the environment” as stated in the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act. Within the U. S., pesticide products that are approved by the EPA must also be approved by individual state pesticide authorities before distribution in that state. Post-approval monitoring of products is required, with reports provided to the EPA and some state regulatory agencies.
U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration
The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration ("DEA") regulates certain drug products containing controlled substances, such as morphine, hydromorphone, opium, testosterone, midazolam, and List I chemicals, such as pseudoephedrine, pursuant to the federal Controlled Substances Act ("CSA"). The CSA and DEA regulations impose registration, security, record keeping, reporting, storage, manufacturing, distribution, importation and other requirements upon legitimate handlers under the oversight of the DEA. The DEA categorizes controlled substances into Schedules I, II, III, IV, or V, with varying qualifications for listing in each schedule. We are subject to the requirements regarding the controlled substances in Schedules II - V and the List I chemicals. Our facilities that manufacture, distribute, import, or export any controlled substances must register annually with the DEA.
The DEA inspects all manufacturing facilities to review security, record keeping, reporting, and handling prior to issuing a controlled substance registration, and it also periodically inspects facilities for compliance with the CSA and its regulations. Failure to maintain compliance with applicable requirements, particularly as manifested in the loss or diversion of controlled substances, can result in enforcement action, such as civil penalties, refusal to renew necessary registration, or the initiation of proceedings to revoke those registrations. In certain circumstances, violations could lead to criminal prosecution. We are also subject to state laws regulating the manufacture and distribution of certain products.
Federal Healthcare Programs and Drug Pricing Regulation

Within the U.S., government healthcare insurance and welfare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs are important third party payers for patients who take our products. These programs include several indirect forms of price regulation applicable to our drug products as a condition for coverage and/or payment for our products and also regulate the amount that pharmacies and other healthcare providers will be paid for our products. Specifically, U.S. law requires that a pharmaceutical manufacturer, as a condition of having federal funds being made available for the manufacturer’s drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B, enter into three government pricing program agreements: (i) a Medicaid rebate agreement with the Secretary of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) to pay rebates to state Medicaid programs for the manufacturer’s covered outpatient drugs that are dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries and paid for by a state Medicaid program; (ii) a 340B program agreement with the Secretary of HHS to provide discounts to certain “covered entity” safety net healthcare providers; and (iii) a Master Agreement with the Department of Veterans Affairs ("VA") under which discounts are available for purchases by federal agencies. We have such agreements in effect. 
 17

Perrigo Company plc - Item 1
Regulation

Medicaid Rebate Agreement
The Medicaid rebate agreement requires the drug manufacturer to remit rebates to each state Medicaid agency on a quarterly basis for both fee-for-service and Medicaid managed care organization utilization. Rebate amounts are based on pricing data reported by the manufacturer to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), including Average Manufacturer Price ("AMP") and, in the case of innovator products, Best Price ("BP"). U.S. law also requires that a company that participates in the Medicaid rebate program report average sales price ("ASP") information to CMS for each calendar quarter for certain categories of drugs that are paid under Part B of the Medicare program. CMS uses these submissions to determine payment rates for drugs under Medicare Part B.
Under the Medicaid rebate program, the minimum rebate amounts due are as follows: (i) for noninnovator products, in general generic drugs marketed under ANDAs, the rebate amount is 13% of the AMP for the quarter; and (ii) for innovator products, in general brand-name products marketed under NDAs, the rebate amount is the greater of 23.1% of the AMP for the quarter or the difference between such AMP and the BP for that same quarter. Manufacturers also pay an “additional rebate" on innovator drugs where price increases since launch have outpaced inflation. Beginning with the first quarter of 2017, an additional rebate is due for noninnovator products, which is calculated somewhat differently from the innovator product additional rebate, but likewise generally applies where and to the extent that a manufacturer’s AMP increases faster than the rate of inflation.
CMS issued a final regulation, generally effective April 1, 2016, to implement changes to the Medicaid rebate program under the 2010 health reform legislation (“Health Reform Law”) and otherwise to provide program guidance. In addition to guidance concerning rebate program administration matters, the regulation also addressed certain related Medicaid reimbursement matters. First, under the Health Reform Law, CMS has also begun to use manufacturer AMP data to calculate reimbursement limits for pharmacies for multiple source drugs under the Medicaid program, known as the federal upper limits ("FULs"). CMS also surveys and publishes retail community pharmacy acquisition cost information to provide state Medicaid agencies with a basis for comparing their own reimbursement and pricing methodologies and rates. Second, the regulation also directed states to update their Medicaid payment methodologies to provide for payment amounts designed to reflect pharmacies’ "actual acquisition costs" for drugs, a change from the prior "estimated acquisition" standard. The regulation also required states to provide the government with findings to support their compliance with this standard by April 1, 2017. 
Pricing and rebate calculations are governed by statutory and regulatory requirements that are complex, vary among products and programs, can change over time, and are subject to interpretation by us, governmental or regulatory agencies, and the courts. In the case of the Medicaid rebate program, if we become aware of errors in our prior price submissions, or a prior BP submission needs to be updated due to late arriving data, we must resubmit the updated data within specified time frames. Such restatements and recalculations increase our cost of compliance with the Medicaid rebate program, and corrections can result in an overage or underage of our rebate liability for past quarters, depending on the nature of the correction.
340B Program Agreement
The 340B drug pricing program requires participating manufacturers to agree to charge statutorily-defined covered entities no more than the 340B “ceiling price” for the manufacturer’s covered outpatient drugs. The ceiling price is derived from the data the manufacturer reports under the Medicaid rebate program and therefore any changes to statutory or regulatory requirements applicable to the Medicaid price figures may impact the 340B ceiling price calculation as well. 340B covered entities include a variety of community health clinics and other entities that receive health services grants from the Public Health Service, as well as certain hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income patients. 
 18

Perrigo Company plc - Item 1
Regulation

Master Agreement with the Department of Veterans Affairs

U.S. law also requires any company that participates in the Medicaid rebate program and Medicare Part B and that wants its covered drugs paid for by certain federal agencies and grantees to enter into a Master Agreement with the VA. Under the Master Agreement, the company must offer its innovator drugs for procurement under the Federal Supply Schedule (“FSS”) contracting program, and must charge certain agencies (VA, Department of Defense, Public Health Service and the Coast Guard) no more than a statutory Federal Ceiling Price (“FCP”). The FCP is calculated based on Non-Federal Average Manufacturer Price data we submit to the VA. FSS contracts include extensive disclosure and certification requirements and standard government terms and conditions with which we must comply. Consistent with VA’s interpretation of the Master Agreement, we have also entered into an agreement to pay rebates on covered drug prescriptions dispensed to TRICARE beneficiaries by TRICARE network retail pharmacies.
Medicare Part D “Coverage Gap” Rebates
For certain innovator products, manufacturers must also enter into an agreement with the Secretary of HHS to provide rebates with respect to utilization of their products by certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries while those patients are within the Medicare Part D benefit “coverage gap.” Manufacturers are not required to submit separate pricing data under this program; the rebate amount is calculated by CMS based on Part D plans’ “negotiated prices” paid to pharmacies.
Other Price Regulation
In addition to these technical government pricing regulation programs, drug pricing has come under increasing public scrutiny arising out of general concerns about high drug costs or price increases, and transparency of pricing and discounting practices within the pharmaceutical distribution system. Several states, including Maryland, Nevada, and California, have recently enacted laws that prohibit “price gouging,” require manufacturers to report certain information concerning price increases exceeding certain amounts, and/or provide advance notice of price increases to certain entities (refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Operations for risks related to the above-mentioned programs). 
Other U.S. Regulations and Organizations
We are subject to various other federal, state, non-governmental, and local agency rules and regulations. Compliance with the laws and regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of our current products and the discovery, development, and introduction of new products requires substantial effort, expense and capital investment. Other regulatory agencies, organizations, legislation, regulation and laws that may impact our business include, but are not limited to: 

• | Physician Payment Sunshine Act - This act requires certain pharmaceutical manufacturers to engage in extensive tracking of payments or transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, maintenance of a payment database and public reporting of the payment data.


• | Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 ("FCPA") - This act and other similar anti-bribery laws prohibit companies and their intermediaries from providing money or anything of value to officials of foreign governments, foreign political parties or international organizations with the intent to obtain or retain business or seek a business advantage.


• | Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") - This agency oversees the advertising and other promotional practices of consumer products marketers. The FTC considers whether a product’s claims are substantiated, truthful and not misleading. The FTC also reviews mergers and acquisitions of companies exceeding specified thresholds and investigates certain business practices relevant to the healthcare industry.


• | International Organization for Standardization ("ISO") - The ISO Standards specify requirements for a Quality Management System that demonstrates the ability to consistently provide products that meet customer and applicable regulatory standards and includes processes to ensure continuous improvement.

 19

Perrigo Company plc - Item 1
Regulation

Our infant formula manufacturing sites are ISO 9001-2008 Certified for Quality Management Systems. ISO inspections are conducted at least annually.

• | United States Pharmacopeial Convention, Inc. ("USP") - The USP is a non-governmental, standard-setting organization. By reference, the FFDCA incorporates the USP quality and testing standards and monographs as the standard that must be met for the listed drugs, unless compliance with those standards is specifically disclaimed on the product’s labeling. USP standards exist for most Rx and OTC pharmaceuticals and many nutritional supplements. The FDA typically requires USP compliance as part of cGMP compliance.


• | Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ("HIPAA") - HIPAA is a set of regulations designed to protect personal information and data collected and stored in medical records. It established a national standard to be used in all doctors' offices, hospitals and other businesses where personal medical information is stored. In addition to protecting personal medical information, HIPAA also gives patients the right to view their medical records and request changes if the data is incorrect. We could be subject to criminal penalties if we knowingly obtain individually identifiable health information from a covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA or for aiding and abetting the violation of HIPAA.


• | Consumer Product Safety Commission ("CPSC") - The CPSC has published regulations requiring child resistant packaging on certain products including pharmaceuticals and dietary supplements. The manufacturer of any product that is subject to any CPSC rule, ban, standard or regulation must certify that, based on a reasonable testing program, the product complies with CPSC requirements.


• | Other State Agencies - We are subject to regulation by numerous other state health departments, insurance departments, boards of pharmacy, state controlled substance agencies, state consumer health and safety regulations, and other comparable state agencies, each of which have license requirements and fees that vary by state.

Regulation Outside the U.S.
We develop and manufacture products and market third-party manufactured products in regions outside the U.S., including Eastern and Western Europe, Israel, Mexico, Australia, countries in Asia, South America, and the Middle East, each of which has its own regulatory environment. The majority of our sales outside the U.S. are in the following categories: OTC/Rx pharmaceuticals, medical devices, dietary supplements and cosmetics. Other regulatory agencies, organizations and legislation that may impact our business include, but are not limited to: 

• | Privacy Regulations - We are subject to numerous global laws and regulations designed to protect personal data, such as the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). The GDPR introduced more stringent data protection requirements in the EU, as well as substantial fines for breaches of the data protection rules. The GDPR increased our responsibility and potential liability in relation to personal data that we process, and we have put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with the GDPR.


• | Transparency Laws - In various jurisdictions in which we operate, we are subject to the laws and regulations aimed at increasing transparency of financial relationships between healthcare professionals and pharmaceutical/medical device manufacturers. These acts require certain pharmaceutical manufacturers to engage in extensive tracking of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals.


• | Anti-Bribery Laws - Various jurisdictions in which we operate have laws and regulations, including the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 and the Irish Criminal Justice (Corruption Offenses) Act 2018, aimed at preventing and penalizing corrupt and anticompetitive behavior.

European Union
OTC and Rx Pharmaceuticals 
The European pharmaceutical industry is highly regulated and much of the legislative and regulatory framework is driven by the European Parliament and the European Commission. This has many benefits, including 
 20

Perrigo Company plc - Item 1
Regulation

the potential to harmonize standards across the complex European market. However, obtaining regulatory agreement across member states presents complex challenges that can lead to delays in the regulatory process. 
In the EU, as well as many other locations around the world, the manufacture and sale of medicinal products are regulated in a manner substantially similar to that of the U.S. requirements, which generally prohibit the handling, manufacture, marketing, and importation of any medicinal product unless it is properly registered in accordance with applicable law. The registration file relating to any particular product must contain data related to product efficacy and safety, including results of clinical testing and/or references to medical publications, as well as detailed information regarding production methods and quality control. Health ministries are authorized to cancel the registration of a product if it is found to be harmful or ineffective or if it is manufactured or marketed other than in accordance with registration conditions.
Between 1995 and 1998, the over-arching regulation that governs medicinal products was revised in an attempt to simplify and harmonize product registration. This revised legislation introduced the mutual recognition procedure (“MRP”), whereby after approval of a marketing authorization by regulatory authorities in the reference member state (“RMS”), additional marketing authorizations could be submitted to other concerned member states to obtain a product license. In November 2005, the medicinal product legislation was further revised to introduce the decentralized procedure (“DCP”), whereby marketing authorizations are submitted simultaneously to the RMS and select concerned member states. In 2005, the EMA also opened up the centralized procedure to sponsors of marketing authorizations for generic medicinal products. Unlike the MRP and DCP, the centralized procedure results in a single marketing authorization and product labeling across all member states that will allow a sponsor to file for individual country reimbursement and make the medicine available in all the EU countries listed on the application. Marketing authorizations and subsequent product licenses are granted to applicants only after the relevant health authority issues a positive assessment of quality, safety and efficacy of the product. 
In addition to obtaining marketing authorization for each product, all member states require that a manufacturer’s facilities obtain approval from an EU Regulatory Authority. The EU has a code of GMP that each manufacturer must follow and comply with. Regulatory authorities in the EU may conduct inspections of the manufacturing facilities to review procedures, operating systems and personnel qualifications. We believe that our policies, operations and products comply in all material respects with existing regulations to which our operations are subject.
In 2011, it was first proposed that the EU Member States had to transition to the European Falsified Medicines Directive (the “Directive”). The Directive was subsequently written into national law on January 2, 2013. The Directive made reference to a Delegated Act (the Delegated Act lists the detailed requirements for manufacturers). The Delegated Act was finalized and published in February 2017, and given a two-year implementation period. The provisions of the Directive are intended to reduce the risk of counterfeit medicines entering the supply chain and also to ensure the quality of API manufactured outside of the EU. The Directive required the serialization of all Rx and some OTC products, similar to the DSCSA in the U.S.
In the EU, member states regulate the pricing of prescription medicinal products, and in some cases, the formulation and dosing of products. This regulation is handled by individual member state national health services. These individual regulatory bodies can result in considerable price differences and product availability among member states. The implementation of tendering systems for the pricing of pharmaceuticals in several countries generally impacts drug pricing for generics; generally “tendering” refers to a system that requires bids to be submitted to the government by competing manufacturers to be the exclusive, or one of a few, suppliers of a product in a particular country.
Data exclusivity provisions exist in many countries, although the application is not uniform. In general, these exclusivity provisions prevent the approval and/or submission of generic drug applications to the health authorities for a fixed period of time following the first approval of the brand-name product in that country. As these exclusivity provisions operate independently of patent exclusivity, they may prevent the submission of generic drug applications for some products even after the patent protection has expired.
The requirements deriving from European pharmacovigilance regulation are constantly expanding due to increasing guidance on good vigilance practices and increased communication on inspectors’ expectations. Pharmacovigilance fee regulation became effective in late 2014 to support health authority assessment of pharmacovigilance safety evaluation reports, study protocols for post authorization safety studies and referrals. 
 21

Perrigo Company plc - Item 1
Regulation

Once approved, the advertising of pharmaceuticals in the EU is governed by national regulations and guidelines. Within certain member states this is overseen by a self-certification process whereas in others national governance bodies approve material prior to release.
The wholesale distribution of medicinal products is an important activity in the integrated supply chain management. The quality and the integrity of medicinal products can be affected by a lack of adequate control. To this end, the EU Commission has published guidelines on Good Distribution Practice of medicinal products for human use in 2013. The present guidelines are based on Articles 84 and 85b(3) of medicinal products for human use directive. 
Medical Devices
The EU has enacted into law numerous directives and adopted many harmonizing standards pertaining to a wide range of industrial products, including medical devices. Medical devices that comply with the requirements of applicable directives are entitled to bear the CE marking of conformity, which indicates that the device conforms to the applicable requirements of the directives and, accordingly, can be commercially distributed throughout Europe. The method of assessing conformity varies depending on the class of the product, but normally involves a combination of self-assessment by the manufacturer and a third-party assessment by a Notified Body, an organization accredited by a member state. Assessment by a Notified Body includes an audit of the manufacturer’s quality system and may also include specific testing of the product. This assessment is a prerequisite for a manufacturer to commercially distribute the product throughout the EU. On May 25, 2017, the EU’s Medical Device Regulation (the “MDR”) became effective. Beginning May 26, 2024, all medical devices sold in the EU will need to be approved under the MDR. Notified Bodies, which are organizations accredited by a member state, can continue to approve medical devices under the existing Medical Device Directives (the “MDDs”) until May 26, 2020. Beginning on May 27, 2020, Notified Bodies will no longer be able to approve new medical devices under the MDDs or approve notifications of “substantial” design changes, including changes to labeling/packaging, changes to the manufacturing process, or the addition of new features and functionality, to medical devices that were approved under the MDDs. 
Dietary Supplements 
Dietary supplements are subject to several regulations that inform the selection of ingredient levels and how products can be described on packaging and in advertising. These regulations include: Food Supplements Directive 2002/46/EC, Food Information to Consumers Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011, Permitted Vitamins and Minerals Regulation (EC) 1170/2009, Food Additives Regulation (EC) 1333/2008, Nutritional & Health Claims Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, the Foods Intended for Particular Nutritional Uses Directive 2009/39/EC, and Regulation (EU) 609/2013.
EU rules on nutrition and health claims, which were established by Regulation EC 1924/2006, apply to any nutritional or health claim by a manufacturer. The objective of the regulation is to ensure that claims made in food labeling or advertising are clear, accurate and based on scientific evidence. The European Food Safety Authority, an advisory panel to the European Commission, performs all scientific assessments of health claims on food and supplement labels. An EU register of nutrition and health claims exists to document approved, pending, and rejected claims. 
Cosmetics
Cosmetic products in the EU market must comply with Regulation EC No. 1223/2009. This regulation requires manufacturers to prepare a product safety report prior to placing a cosmetic product in the market. In addition, for each cosmetic product placed in the market, a “responsible person” must be designated to oversee compliance with the regulation’s reporting requirements. Commission Regulation EU No. 655/2013 establishes the common criteria and justification for claims to be used in the packaging and advertising of cosmetics products.
