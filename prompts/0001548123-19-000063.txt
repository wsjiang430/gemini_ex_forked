  Business Development
  History
  Reflect Scientific, Inc., a Utah corporation (the Company, we, our, us and words of similar import), was organized under the laws of the State of Utah on November 3, 1999, under the name Cole, Inc. On December 31, 2003, we acquired Reflect Scientific, Inc., a California corporation. We changed our name to Reflect Scientific, Inc. and succeeded to the business operations of our wholly-owned subsidiary, that involved the manufacture and distribution of unique laboratory consumables and disposables such as filtration and purification products, customized sample handling vials, electronic wiring assemblies, high temperature silicone, graphite and vespel/graphite sealing components for use by original equipment manufacturers (OEM) in the chemical analysis industries, primarily in the field of gas/liquid chromatography. See our 8-K Current Report dated December 31, 2003, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 15, 2004, and is incorporated herein by reference. See Part IV, Item 15.  On November 29, 2005, we announced the execution of a Letter of Intent to acquire Cryomastor Corporation, a California corporation (Cryomastor [sometimes called Cryometrix, its amended name]).  Effective as of April 4, 2006, we entered into a Purchase Agreement (the JMST Agreement) with JM SciTech, LLC, a limited liability company organized under the laws of the State of Colorado, and doing business as JMST Systems (JMST); David Carver, an individual (Carver); and Julie Martin, an individual (Martin) (JMST, Carver and Martin are sometimes hereinafter referred to collectively as Sellers). Pursuant to the JMST Agreement, we purchased and JMST sold all right, title and interest in and to the JMST Technology (the JMST Technology), as described in the JMST Agreement; and Carver conveyed and assigned any rights he had in and to certain patents (the Carver Patents) and related intellectual assets as described in the JMST Agreement (collectively, including the Carver Patents, referred to herein as the Carver Technology). JMST had created a line of chemical detection instruments that are used in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and homeland security markets. The patented technology allows researchers to accurately analyze chemical formulations for their composition and identity. See our 8-K Current Report dated April 4, 2006, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 7, 2006, and is incorporated herein by reference. See Part IV, Item 15.  On June 27, 2006, we completed the acquisition of Cryomastor pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Cryomastor Merger Agreement), which became our wholly-owned subsidiary; changed its name to Cryometrix, Inc.; and succeeded to its business operations, which involved the manufacture and sale of ultra low temperature freezer systems powered by liquid nitrogen for use in bio-repositories associated with the biotech and pharmaceutical industries, as well as government facilities, universities and many other diverse applications that require a large number of reliable and energy efficient freezers. See our 8-K Current Report dated June 27,   4    2006, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 30, 2006, and is incorporated herein by reference. See Part IV, Item 15.  Business
  Emerging Growth Company Status   As part of the Jumpstart Startups Act of 2012 (JOBS ACT), companies with less than $1.0 billion in gross revenue can qualify as an emerging growth company. We will qualify as an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act, and, as such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, (i) not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, (ii) reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic and annual reports, (iii) not being required to comply with certain new requirements adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or the PCAOB, and (iv) not being required to obtain stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We intend to take advantage of the reduced disclosure obligations. Additionally, we qualify as a Smaller Reporting Company and also have the advantage of not being required to provide the same level of disclosure as larger companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(2) of the Jobs Act, that allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.  We could remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed one billion dollars, (ii) the date that we become a large accelerated filer as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common units that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700.0 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, and (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three-year period. At this time, we expect to remain both a Smaller Reporting Company and Emerging Growth Company for the foreseeable future.  Overview
  Reflect Scientific is engaged in the manufacture and distribution of innovative products targeted at the life science market. Our customers include hospitals and diagnostic laboratories, pharmaceutical and biotech companies, cold chain management, universities, government and private sector research facilities, and chemical and industrial companies.   Our goal is to provide our customers with the best solution for their needs. This philosophy extends into our business strategies and acquisition plans. Through a series of strategic acquisitions, we acquired technology that has enabled us to expand our line of products that take advantage of market needs. Our growing product portfolio includes ultra low temperature freezers, blast freezers and refrigerated transportation in addition to supplying OEM products to the life science industry.  Our Visacon brand chemical detector product line has been discontinued. We launched our next generation detector in late 2013 and expected that, due to price and features advantages, detector sales would grow significantly. While sales have been steady, we did not experience the growth that had been anticipated at the time of the product introduction into the marketplace. In addition patent positions have expired on the core technology. In November 2018, management made the decision to remove the detectors from its product line due to declining demand for the product. This will allow us to focus in on the more lucrative Cryometrix brand of low temperature freezers and blast freezers for the Bio/Pharma market.  Our Cryometrix brand ultra low temperature and blast freezers innovative design enables our customers to save substantially on energy costs related to cryogenic storage. Ultra low temperature freezers are used worldwide for the storage of vaccines, DNA, RNA, proteins and many other biological and chemical samples. There is a growing need for energy efficient, reliable ultra low temperature storage units. Our Cryometrix freezers are targeted to this growing market and we have had tremendous success in blood storage and pharmaceutical manufacturing applications. The application of this technology for use in refrigerated trailers (commonly called reefers) used to transport goods which need to be maintained in a cold environment significantly broadens the market for this technology. The utilization    5    of this technology in reefers eliminates the current method of cooling, which utilize engines run on hydrocarbon fuels. The Cryometrix technology is pollutant free and is more cost effective and efficient than the technologies currently used.   Products
  Reflect Scientific designs, develops and sells scientific equipment for the Life Science and Manufacturing industries. Since Reflect Scientifics organization in 1991, our focus is and has been on providing value added products, analytic testing supplies and equipment, and stand alone products for the life science and industrial market place. Reflect Scientifics products range from non-mechanical Cyrometrix freezers, products and parts for the life science industry to tools and analytical services for industrial manufacturing.  All of Reflect Scientifics products and services are developed with one key factor in mind: Providing a superior cost/benefit to the customer verses other products in the same market space. With years of experience in the life science and industrial manufacturing markets, Reflect Scientific has been able to develop not only unique patentable products, but products that we believe offer a superior value proposition to the customer over any other competing and existing products in the market.  We have developed a business model with a focus on intellectual expertise in the design and development of products and solutions for life science and industrial manufacturing industries. We outsource the majority of our manufacturing, allowing us to maintain the flexibility to develop products across multiple lines and industries. Our strength is in developing and providing products which we believe offer immediate and verifiable cost saving solutions.   We have found a number of companies that can manufacture products to our specification, allowing us to focus on our core competencies of development and design, and maintain a flexible corporate structure capable of taking advantage of new opportunities without the large capital investment required to acquire tooling and manufacturing equipment. Our focus on the intellectual expertise, as opposed to manufacturing of products, allows us to develop products along multiple industry lines and to tailor our products to specific needs in a variety of industrial settings. Our products are sold in the biotechnology, pharmaceutical, cold chain management and medical industries, as well as the manufacturing industries, such as automotive.  Cryometrix Freezers
  Our Cryometrix ultra low temperature and blast freezers are, we believe, a technological breakthrough that provides energy savings and other critically important benefits to cryo-storage customers in the Life Science related industries. Ultra low temperature and blast freezers are used in multiple industries for the storage and fast freezing profiles of everything from blood to cancer vaccines. These types of freezers are used by hospitals and biotechnology research facilities.   The only ultra low temperature freezers currently available are produced by a limited number of companies and rely on a mechanical process for cooling. Because of inadequacies in the mechanical process, we believe there is wastage of inventory each year because of the problems of reliable cooling inherent in the mechanical freezers.   Our freezers incorporate a disruptive technology, as they are based on a complete divergence from the technology currently used in ultra low temperature freezers. Through the advantages of our technology, we believe our freezers solve the current inadequacies and provide immediate cost savings and reliability for our clients. Current cryogenic storage equipment falls short of customer expectations in a variety of key performance criteria.  * High energy usage  a growing problem with rising energy costs  * Inflexible temperature range  existing units cannot be easily modified for colder requirements (colder temperatures are an industry trend) * Sample inventory is at risk in the event of a power failure  * Poor temperature uniformity samples in different areas of the freezer can experience wide variations in temperatures which is undesirable from a regulatory standpoint.  Our Cryometrix ultra low temperature and blast freezer uses a patented design and technology which is powered by liquid nitrogen. Through the use of a liquid nitrogen powered freezer system we are able to address the market need for:  * Low energy requirements  * Flexible temperature control  wide range of usable temperatures * Power failures have little effect - uses passive liquid nitrogen technology rather than electrically powered compressors. * Uniform temperatures throughout freezer  more usable storage volume  6     * Much larger storage volume per area of floor space occupied  reduced facilities cost * Reliable and essentially maintenance free, further lowering cost of ownership * Environmental issues related to pollution using the current refrigerated trailer (reefer) technology  We believe existing mechanical freezers are outdated and our freezers will be the desired technology to which the industry will move, providing us the opportunity to gain a significant market share in this large market.  The adaptation of the freezer technology to reefers for transporting perishable items opens a significant new market. Trailers can easily be retrofit with the Cryometrix unit, which operates pollutant free, more efficiently, and at a cost savings compared to the diesel powered units currently used. The reefer market is a $1 billion market. The non-polluting Cryometrix unit provides significant benefits over any other unit currently marketed.  Competition
  The environment for our products and services is intensely competitive. Although the complexity of the products we produce limits the number of companies we compete with, the companies with competing technology are generally larger and often subsidiaries or divisions of very large multinational companies. Our competitors size and association with large multinational companies gives them advantages over us in the ability to access potential customers. Many potential customers already purchase products either directly from our competitors or from another subsidiary of these large multinational companies, creating natural inroads to sales that we do not possess.   Given our relative size versus our competitors, we are often required to seek niche markets for our products or focus on selling consumable components to be used in our competitors larger detection units. We believe, however, that our technology and experience in the ultra low freezers allows us to be competitive in those markets. As our ultra low freezer products are new to the marketplace, the products long term commercial acceptance is still unknown. Most of our products compete against multiple competitors, with our refrigeration products competing primarily against Thermo Fisher Scientific and Sanyo Corporation.  Growth Plan
  While we will continue to evaluate acquisitions of businesses and technologies to enhance our revenues in the Life Science and green technology markets, our primary focus is on growing our own product lines through increasing market share and the addition of new products to our current offerings.   We seek to expand the applications for our products and equipment into additional markets as we develop brand recognition. We hope to be able to obtain market leverage from our existing products and name recognition as we use our existing offerings and product strengths to position us as a key supplier of cryogenic storage, blast freezing and cold chain management solutions. This strategic plan will also enable us to further diversify our customer base.  Manufacturing, Supplies, and Quality Control
  Many of our products are manufactured by carefully selected third party manufacturers. By outsourcing our manufacturing we are able to reduce the overall cost of our products. We our lower volume products that are less labor and parts intensive in our facility in Orem, Utah.   Regulation and Environmental Compliance
  Presently, none of our products are in highly regulated industries.  Sources and Availability of Raw Materials and Names of Principal Suppliers
  Sources and availability of key materials and intermediates continue to remain stable. Where supply is considered a critical success factor for our business, we have certified primary vendors in place and have identified secondary vendors.  Dependence on One or a Few Major Customers
  We have four major customers who represented 44% and 54% of our sales volume in 2018 and 2017, respectively. The company has strong relationships with each of these customers and does not believe this concentration poses a significant risk due to those long-term relationships and the uniqueness of the products they purchase from us.   7     Need for any Governmental Approval of Principal Products or Services
  No products presently being manufactured or sold by us are subject to prior governmental approvals.  Effect of Existing or Probable Governmental Regulations on the Business
  We are subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. This Act creates a strong and independent accounting oversight board to oversee the conduct of auditors of public companies and strengthens auditor independence. It also requires steps to enhance the direct responsibility of senior members of management for financial reporting and for the quality of financial disclosures made by public companies; establishes clear statutory rules to limit, and to expose to public view, possible conflicts of interest affecting securities analysts; creates guidelines for audit committee members appointment, compensation and oversight of the work of public companies auditors; prohibits certain insider trading during pension fund blackout periods; and establishes a federal crime of securities fraud, among other provisions.   Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act requires all companies with securities registered pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act to comply with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding proxy solicitations, as outlined in Regulation 14A. Matters submitted to stockholders of our Company at a special or annual meeting thereof or pursuant to a written consent will require our Company to provide our stockholders with the information outlined in Schedules 14A or 14C of Regulation 14; preliminary copies of this information must be submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission at least 10 days prior to the date that definitive copies of this information are forwarded to our stockholders.   We are also required to file annual reports on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q with the Securities Exchange Commission on a regular basis, and will be required to timely disclose certain material events (e.g., changes in corporate control; acquisitions or dispositions of a significant amount of assets other than in the ordinary course of business; changes in executive officers and directors; and bankruptcy) in a Current Report on Form 8-K.   Patents, Trademarks, Licenses, Franchises, Concessions, Royalty Agreements or Labor Contracts, including Duration
  All patents and trademarks relating to acquired technologies have been assigned to us. Where appropriate, we seek patent protection for inventions and developments made by our personnel and incorporated into our products or otherwise falling within our fields of interest.   We protect some of our technology as trade secrets and, where appropriate, we use trademarks or registered trademarks used in connection with our products.  Patents have been issued and current cover the following products:  Cryometrix Ultra Low Temperature and Blast freezers  15 patents

Royalty agreements were executed with JMST and Cryometrix as a condition of the companies acquisition of the patents and technology related to the detectors. Under the terms of the royalty agreements:

JMST  David Carver will receive a royalty payment on gross revenues related to revenues derived from the Carver Patents or Carver Technology. Such payments are due on revenue in excess of $500,000 derived from products under the Carver Patents or Carver Technology. The royalty payment is 2.5% on the revenue in excess of $500,000 and is payable quarterly. Payments are to be made in the common stock of Reflect Scientific, not to exceed 500,000 shares in total. New products developed from the Carver Technology are subject to a royalty of 3% of gross revenues in excess of $100,000, with an additional 2% if gross revenues exceed $600,000. Royalties will also be paid in our common stock annually. Common stock will be valued at $3.00 per share for these purposes. Royalty payments are only due for years where there are valid Carver Patents. To date no royalties have been earned or paid under this agreement. In December 2018, management made the decision to remove the detectors from its product line due to low demand.

Research and Development Costs During the Last Two Fiscal Years

During the year ended December 31, 2018, we expended $104,046 for research and development. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we expended $46,696 for research and development. The majority of the research and development on our products is performed by independent contractors who have been enhancing technologies, primarily on the reefer unit and the detectors. We expect research and development cost to increase in the future with the development work required to commercialize our Cryometrix freezers.
