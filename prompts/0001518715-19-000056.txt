ITEM 1 | BUSINESS

General
HomeStreet, Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, "HomeStreet," the "Company," "we," "our" or "us"), a Washington corporation, is a diversified financial services company founded in 1921, headquartered in Seattle, Washington, which serves customers primarily on the West Coast of the United States, including Hawaii. We are principally engaged in commercial and consumer banking and real estate lending, including commercial real estate and single family mortgage banking operations. Our primary subsidiaries are HomeStreet Bank and HomeStreet Capital Corporation.
HomeStreet Bank is a Washington state-chartered commercial bank providing commercial and consumer loans, mortgage loans, deposit products, non-deposit investment products, private banking and cash management services and other banking services. Our loan products include commercial business loans and agriculture loans, consumer loans, single family residential mortgages, loans secured by commercial real estate, and construction loans for residential and commercial real estate projects. We also have partial ownership in WMS Series LLC (dba Penrith Home Loans), which is an affiliated business arrangement with various owners of Windermere Real Estate Company franchises that operates a single family mortgage origination business from select Windermere Real Estate Offices and other locations.
HomeStreet Capital Corporation, a Washington corporation, sells and services multifamily mortgage loans originated by HomeStreet Bank under the Fannie Mae Delegated Underwriting and Servicing Program ("DUS®")1.
Doing business as HomeStreet Insurance Agency, we provide insurance products and services for consumers. 
Shares of our common stock are traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol "HMST." We also have outstanding $63.6 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.5% senior notes due 2026, all of which are registered pursuant to Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
At December 31, 2018, we had total assets of $7.04 billion, net loans held for investment of $5.08 billion, deposits of $5.05 billion and shareholders’ equity of $739.5 million. Our operations are currently grouped into two reportable segments: our Commercial and Consumer Banking segment and our Mortgage Banking segment.
We generate revenue by earning net interest income and noninterest income. Net interest income is primarily the difference between interest income earned on loans and investment securities less the interest we pay on deposits and other borrowings. We earn noninterest income from the origination, sale and servicing of loans and from fees earned on deposit services and investment and insurance sales.
Rising interest rates, reduced inventory of homes for sale, industry overcapacity and increased regulatory and investor requirements have substantially reduced the profitability of our mortgage banking business which has led us to a decision to reduce the size of these operations by seeking a sale of the home loan center-based mortgage origination business and related mortgage servicing rights.
In the six years following our initial public offering ("IPO"), from February 2012 through December 31, 2018, we grew considerably, from 20 retail deposit branches, nine stand-alone home loan centers and 553 full-time employees at the time of our IPO to 60 retail deposit branches, six primary stand-alone commercial lending centers, 32 primary stand-alone home loan centers and 2,036 employees as of December 31, 2018. We generated significant income in our single family mortgage banking business from 2012 through the first half of 2016 that we used in part to resolve problem assets and grow our commercial and consumer banking operations. As a result, we have made substantial progress toward the growth and diversification goals we set following our IPO. 
At December 31, 2018, we had 60 retail deposit branches were located in the State of Washington, Southern California, the Portland, Oregon area and the State of Hawaii, and 32 primary stand-alone home loan centers and six primary commercial lending centers located within our retail deposit branch footprint as well as in Northern California (including the San Francisco Bay Area); Eugene, Salem and Bend, Oregon; Boise and northern Idaho; and Salt Lake City, Utah. An affiliated business arrangement, WMS Series LLC, doing business as Penrith Home Loans, provides point-of-sale loan origination services at certain Windermere Real Estate offices in Washington, Oregon, and Colorado and three stand-alone offices. We also have one stand-alone insurance agency office located in Spokane, Washington. The number of lending offices listed above does not include satellite offices with a limited number of staff who report to a manager located in a separate primary office.

Commercial and Consumer Banking. We provide diversified financial products and services to our commercial and consumer customers through bank branches, ATMs, and online, mobile and telephone banking. These products and services include deposit products; residential, consumer, business and agricultural portfolio loans; non-deposit investment products; insurance products and cash management services. We originate construction loans, bridge loans, and permanent loans for our portfolio on single family residences, and on office, retail, industrial and multifamily properties. We originate multifamily real estate loans through our Fannie Mae DUS® business, and after origination those loans are sold to or securitized by Fannie Mae, with the Company generally retaining the servicing rights. In addition, through the HomeStreet Commercial Capital division of HomeStreet Bank, we originate permanent commercial real estate loans primarily up to $15 million in size, a portion of which we pool for sale and sell into the secondary market. As a part of the Commercial Lending division, we also have a team that specializes in U.S. Small Business Administration ("SBA") lending. 
Mortgage Banking. We currently originate single family residential mortgage loans primarily for sale in the secondary markets and perform mortgage servicing on a substantial portion of such loans. The majority of our mortgage loans are sold to or securitized by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae, while we retain the right to service these loans. We are a rated originator and servicer of jumbo loans, allowing us to sell the loans to other securitizers. Additionally, we purchase loans from WMS Series LLC through a correspondent arrangement with that company. We also sell loans on a servicing-released and servicing-retained basis to securitizers and correspondent lenders. A small percentage of our loans are brokered to other lenders or sold on a servicing-released basis to correspondent lenders. On occasion, we may sell a portion of our mortgage servicing rights ("MSRs"). We manage the loan funding and the interest rate risk associated with the secondary market loan sales and the retained single family MSRs within this business segment.
Restructuring our Mortgage Banking Segment
Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016, our Mortgage Banking segment began to experience substantially lower origination volumes. Mortgage refinancings, which had been a significant contributor to total origination volume since the end of the recession, slowed considerably as mortgage interest rates began to rise above the rate already secured by most homeowners. The increase in mortgage interest rates, combined with the historically low inventory of houses for sale in our primary markets had a significant negative impact on our ability to originate purchase mortgages. As the demand for mortgages generally weakened, the number of competitors and loan officers working in the industry did not decline at the same rate, resulting in overcapacity and increased competition which put pressure on pricing and profit margins. At the same time, short-term interest rates increased without a corresponding increase in longer-term interest rates, resulting in a flatter yield curve which made hedging the change in value of our MSRs much less effective, thereby reducing our risk management results. 
Meanwhile, changes in the regulatory environment presented additional challenges. Increased regulations on loan underwriting and loan disclosures and additional investor data integrity requirements have substantially increased the cost of originating mortgages. In addition, compliance and regulatory standards are unevenly applied between bank and non-bank lenders because the rules and regulations are enforced by different groups of regulators with different approaches to compliance and regulatory oversight. Further, a proposed rule change that would have simplified and reduced the capital burdens for banks holding MSRs did not materialize. With the recent proposal of a Community Bank Leverage Ratio, which provides capital relief for smaller banks but specifically omits the expected relief for MSR assets, we no longer believe such regulatory change for MSRs is likely to occur.
We took measures in 2017 and 2018 to reorganize and streamline our Mortgage Banking segment, reducing headcount from December 31, 2016 by 33%, consolidating office locations, exiting certain markets that were not meeting our performance expectations, introducing more automation and process-driven practices and reducing costs overall. Although these initiatives successfully reduced the cost structure of the Mortgage Banking segment, in late 2018 and early 2019 our Board of Directors reviewed the challenges that continue to confront the Mortgage Banking segment due to the continued downturn in the mortgage industry and determined that it would be in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to explore a potential sale of the home loan center-based mortgage origination business and related MSRs. In February 2019, after marketing these assets for sale through an investment banker, we entered into a non-binding letter of intent with an independent mortgage company to sell the assets related to our home loan center-based mortgage origination operations and transfer our related mortgage personnel and we continue to market our related portfolio of mortgage servicing rights. We have not yet entered into definitive agreements with respect to any sales of these assets or servicing rights, and if we are able to enter into such agreements, the closing of the transactions will remain subject to customary closing conditions, including third party and regulatory approvals.
If we are successful in completing these transactions, going forward we would not continue to operate any stand-alone home loan centers but would still originate loans through our bank locations, online banking services and through our affinity banking relationship. Our affinity banking relationships allow qualified employees of certain organizations that have entered 
into affinity agreements with the Banks to receive preferential terms on a wide range of consumer products, including mortgages.
Investing in Growth of Commercial and Consumer Banking
Since our initial public offering (IPO) in February of 2012, we have steadily grown our commercial and consumer banking presence to diversify our earnings and mitigate the impact of the earnings volatility of our mortgage banking business. As a part of our growth strategy we have opened several de novo retail deposit branches to expand our branch network and increase our core deposit base, while also expanding our offerings of community banking products and services. At the same time we grew and diversified the Bank through acquisitions of whole banks and retail deposit branches in attractive growth markets on the West Coast to increase our scale in existing markets and to enter new markets. Between 2013 and 2017, we acquired four banks, expanding our network in Eastern Washington and Southern California, and eight individual branches to complement our existing networks in Washington, Oregon and California, and we expect to close an acquisition of an additional branch in Southern California later this month. 
Our acquisitions have accelerated our growth of interest-earning commercial banking assets, strengthened our core deposit base, increased our geographic diversification and added experienced commercial and consumer banking professionals in key target markets. We plan to continue to grow opportunistically through acquisitions in addition to our organic growth. 
In addition to these acquisitions, we have also expanded by opening de novo branches in markets that we believe are underserved by community banks. From 2012 to 2015, we opened 10 de novo branches in the greater Seattle area. In 2016, we added six de novo branches in San Diego, Hawaii and Eastern Washington, and in 2017 we opened three de novo branches in Southern California, Eastern Washington and the greater Seattle area. In 2018, we added three de novo branches in the Puget Sound area. Overall, from our IPO through December 31, 2018, we have added 22 de novo branches and acquired eight branches. 
We remain focused on minimizing credit risk and on increasing operating efficiency by growing assets and revenues at a faster pace than expenses through measured growth within our existing markets, while managing costs and improving efficiencies.
Recent Developments
In February 2019, we entered into a non-binding letter of intent to sell assets related to our home loan center-based mortgage origination business and to transfer related mortgage personnel to an independent mortgage company, and announced that we are seeking buyers for our related mortgage servicing rights. These assets and personnel together constitute a considerable majority of the business activity we report under our Mortgage Banking segment. Any transaction to sell these assets will be subject to entering into definitive agreements with potential buyers which will be subject to closing conditions, including third party and regulatory approvals. Assuming we are able to complete the transactions, we expect the size and complexity of our overall organization will be reduced as we significantly reduce the size of our mortgage operation. Following the completion of a sale transaction, the remaining single family mortgage business will be integrated within the Commercial and Consumer Banking segment and originations will be sourced through our retail deposit branch locations, online banking platform, and affinity relationships.
In November 2018, we entered into an agreement with Silvergate Bank to acquire a branch in San Marcos, San Diego County, as well as the business lending team of Silvergate in San Diego. We believe this acquisition will increase our capabilities and market share in Southern California, and especially in San Diego County, with the addition of an experienced commercial lending team with a strong reputation in the community. We expect this transaction will close in March of 2019, subject to customary closing conditions.
Business Strategy 
During 2018, we continued our strategy to grow and diversify earnings with the goal of becoming a leading West Coast regional bank. Our market focus is concentrated primarily in the major metropolitan markets in the Western United States, which are characterized by larger populations, lower unemployment and generally higher growth than many other metropolitan areas. These markets are the Seattle / Puget Sound and Spokane areas of Washington, the Portland, Oregon area, the Hawaiian Islands, the San Francisco Bay Area of California, and Southern California, including Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, and San Diego Counties. We believe there is a significant opportunity for a well-capitalized, community-focused bank to compete effectively in West Coast markets, especially those that are not well served by existing community banks. Our strategy is to offer responsive and personalized service while providing a full range of financial services to small- and middle-market commercial and consumer customers, to build loyalty and grow market share. We have grown organically and through strategic acquisitions.
In 2018, we grew by opening three de novo retail deposit branches in the Puget Sound area and entering an agreement to acquire a retail branch, with deposits, loans, and a commercial lending team in San Diego County, California. That transaction is expected to close in March of 2019. Meanwhile, we also consolidated two retail deposit branches in Eastern Washington into two other nearby branches. In the face of the ongoing challenges facing the single family mortgage banking business, we also streamlined our operations by closing, consolidating, or reducing space in single family home lending centers and a regional processing center.
Our business strategy produced record net income in 2018 from our Commercial and Consumer Banking segment with a progressively improving efficiency ratio for that segment. However, despite our substantial initiatives in the last two years to improve the profitability of our Mortgage Banking segment, our expectations for a recovery in industry volume and profitability have not occurred and it remains unclear when, and to what extent, industry conditions will improve. Therefore, in February 2019, we entered into a non-binding letter of intent to sell our home loan center-based mortgage origination business and transfer related mortgage personnel to an independent mortgage company and announced that we are separately pursuing the sale of a majority of our single-family MSRs. Any transactions related to such sales remain subject to the negotiation and execution of definitive agreements, which would themselves be subject to customary closing conditions including third party and regulatory approvals. However, if we are successful in completing those transaction, the Company will retain a smaller mortgage operation that is integrated with the commercial and consumer banking business, with originations sourced through our branch network, online banking services, and affinity relationships. While single family mortgage loans will remain an important part of our asset diversification strategy and part of a broad array of products that we will offer to our customers, the scale of the business line will be substantially smaller and more focused on our retail deposit network and regional markets.
Assuming the successful sale of our home loan center-based mortgage origination business and servicing rights, our strategy will be to continue growing and diversifying earnings. We plan to accomplish this by continuing to meet the financial needs of our consumer and small business customers by providing targeted banking, investment and insurance products and services through our bank branches and our on-line platform using dedicated investment advisors, insurance agents and business banking officers. We expect to continue to grow our commercial lending (including SBA lending), and commercial real estate and residential construction lending throughout our primary markets. 
We also plan to expand our commercial real estate business with a focus on multifamily mortgage origination through our existing commercial banking network as well as through our Fannie Mae DUS® origination and servicing relationships. We expect to continue to benefit from being one of only 25 companies nationally that is an approved Fannie Mae DUS® seller and servicer. We will continue to support our DUS® program by providing new construction and short-term bridge loans to experienced borrowers who intend to build or purchase apartment buildings for renovation, which we will then seek to replace with permanent financing upon completion of the projects. We also originate commercial real estate construction loans, bridge loans and permanent loans for our portfolio, primarily on office, retail, industrial and multifamily property types located within our geographic footprint and regularly sell those types of loans to other investors.
Our strategy since our IPO included a substantial investment in expanding our retail deposit branch network to fund the growth of our loan portfolio and provide an additional channel to source small-business and consumer loans. While we expect to decrease the pace of our de novo branch openings we will also continue to grow our commercial and consumer banking operations with an emphasis on growing consumer and business deposits within our existing branch footprint while also increasing the proportion of low and no-cost deposit products. In addition to this anticipated organic growth, we expect to continue to seek strategic acquisition opportunities of whole-banks or stand-alone retail deposit branches that meet or exceed our investment and return criteria, as well as seasoned commercial lending teams.
For a discussion of operating results of our lines of business, see "Business Segments" within Management's Discussion and Analysis of this Form 10-K and Note 20, Business Segments in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 included in Item 8 of Part II of this Form 10-K.
Market and Competition
We view our market as the major metropolitan coastal areas of the Western United States, including Hawaii. These metropolitan areas share a number of key demographic factors that are characteristic of growth markets, such as large and growing populations with above-average household incomes, a significant number of large and mid-sized companies, and diverse economies. These markets all share large populations that we believe are underserved due to the rapid consolidation of community banks since the financial crisis. We believe these markets can be well served by a strong regional bank like ours that is focused on providing consumers and businesses with quality customer service and a competitive array of deposit, lending and investment products. 
As of December 31, 2018, we operated full service bank branches, as well as stand-alone commercial and residential lending centers, in the Puget Sound and eastern regions of Washington, the Portland, Oregon metropolitan area, the Hawaiian Islands, and Southern California. As of that date, we also had primary stand-alone commercial and residential lending centers in the metropolitan areas of San Francisco, California and Salt Lake City, Utah, as well as central California and Idaho. 
The financial services industry is highly competitive. We compete with other banks, credit unions, mortgage banking companies, insurance companies, finance companies, and investment and mutual fund companies. In particular, we compete with many financial institutions with greater resources, including the capacity to make larger loans, fund extensive advertising campaigns and offer a broader array of products and services. The number of competitors for lower and middle-market business customers has, however, decreased in recent years primarily due to consolidations. At the same time, national banks have been focused on larger customers to achieve economies of scale in lending and depository relationships and have also consolidated business banking operations and support and reduced service levels in many of our markets. We have taken advantage of industry consolidation by recruiting well-qualified employees and attracting new customers who seek long-term stability, local decision-making, quality products and outstanding expertise and customer service.
In our single family mortgage origination and servicing business, we face especially intense competition from bank and non-bank lenders because the demand for mortgage loans has declined in recent years. The mortgage industry is compliance-intensive and requires significant expertise and internal control systems to ensure mortgage loan origination and servicing providers meet all origination, processing, underwriting, servicing and disclosure requirements. Although we have retained a significant market share in our primary markets, and we believe our compliance-centered culture has afforded us a competitive advantage within an increasingly complex regulatory landscape, the increased costs of compliance combined with inconsistent application of compliance interpretations, guidance and regulatory oversight between bank and non-bank lenders have created significant headwinds for us and we believe have resulted in an uneven competitive advantage for non-bank mortgage originators. In addition, changes in the interest rate environment and recent periods of historically low inventory of homes for sale, along with increasing home prices resulting from that inventory constraint, have significantly decreased demand for mortgages. The industry has surplus capacity because the number of loan officers has not been reduced in proportion to lower demand, resulting in increased price competition and lower profit margins. As a result, we are looking to significantly scale down our presence in the industry by pursuing the sale of our home loan center-based mortgage lending operations.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we employed 2,036 full-time equivalent employees, compared to 2,419 full-time equivalent employees at December 31, 2017.
Where You Can Obtain Additional Information
We file annual, quarterly, current and other reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). We make available free of charge on or through our website http://www.homestreet.com all of these reports (and all amendments thereto), as soon as reasonably practicable after we file these materials with the SEC. Please note that the contents of our website do not constitute a part of our reports, and those contents are not incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K or any of our other securities filings. 
REGULATION AND SUPERVISION
The following is a brief description of certain laws and regulations that are applicable to us. The description of these laws and regulations, as well as descriptions of laws and regulations contained elsewhere in this Form 10-K, does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the applicable laws and regulations.
The bank regulatory framework to which we are subject is intended primarily for the protection of bank depositors and the Deposit Insurance Fund and not for the protection of shareholders or other security holders.
General
The Company is a bank holding company which has made an election to be a financial holding company. It is regulated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the "Federal Reserve") and the Washington State Department of Financial Institutions, Division of Banks (the "WDFI"). The Company is required to register and file reports with, and otherwise comply with, the rules and regulations of the Federal Reserve and the WDFI.
The Bank is a Washington state-chartered commercial bank. The Bank is subject to regulation, examination and supervision by the WDFI and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the "FDIC").
New statutes, regulations and guidance are regularly considered that could contain wide-ranging potential changes to the competitive landscape for financial institutions operating in our markets and in the United States generally. We cannot predict whether or in what form any proposed statute, regulation or other guidance will be adopted or promulgated, or the extent to which our business may be affected. Any change in policies, legislation or regulation, whether by the Federal Reserve, the WDFI, the FDIC, the Washington state legislature, the United States Congress or any other federal, state or local government branch or agency with authority over us, could have a material adverse impact on us and our operations and shareholders. In addition, the Federal Reserve, the WDFI and the FDIC have significant discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including, among other things, policies with respect to the Bank's capital levels, the classification of assets and establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes.
Our operations and earnings will be affected by domestic economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States government and its agencies. In addition to its role as the regulator of bank holding companies, the Federal Reserve has, and is likely to continue to have, an important impact on the operating results of financial institutions through its power to implement national monetary and fiscal policy including, among other things, actions taken in order to curb inflation or combat a recession. The Federal Reserve affects the levels of bank loans, investments and deposits in various ways, including through its control over the issuance of United States government securities, its regulation of the discount rate applicable to member banks and its influence over reserve requirements to which banks are subject. Beginning in December 2015, the Federal Reserve has increased short-term interest rates nine times and may consider additional increases in 2019. We cannot predict the ultimate impact of these rate changes on the economy or our institution, or the nature or impact of future changes in monetary policies of the Federal Reserve.
Regulation of the Company
General
As a bank holding company, the Company is subject to Federal Reserve regulations, examinations, supervision and reporting requirements relating to bank holding companies. Among other things, the Federal Reserve is authorized to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of a subsidiary bank. Since the Bank is chartered under Washington law, the WDFI has authority to regulate the Company generally relating to its conduct affecting the Bank. 
Capital / Source of Strength
During 2015, the Company was a savings and loan holding company and as such became subject to capital requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act, beginning in 2015. Following its conversion to a bank holding company that has elected to be a financial holding company, the Company continues to be subject to these capital requirements. See "Regulation and Supervision of HomeStreet Bank - Capital and Prompt Corrective Action Requirements - Capital Requirements."
Regulations and historical practices of the Federal Reserve have required bank holding companies to serve as a "source of strength" for their subsidiary banks. The Dodd-Frank Act codified this requirement and extended it to all companies that control an insured depository institution. Accordingly, the Company is required to act as a source of strength for the Bank.
Restrictions Applicable to Bank Holding Companies
Federal law generally prohibits a bank holding company, including the Company, directly or indirectly (or through one or more subsidiaries), from acquiring:

• | control of another depository institution (or a holding company parent) without prior approval of the Federal Reserve (as "control" is defined under the Bank Holding Company Act);


• | another depository institution (or a holding company thereof), through merger, consolidation or purchase of all or substantially all of the assets of such institution (or holding company) without prior approval from the Federal Reserve or FDIC;


• | more than 5.0% of the voting shares of a non-subsidiary depository institution or a holding company subject to certain exceptions; or


• | control of any depository institution not insured by the FDIC (except through a merger with and into the holding company's bank subsidiary that is approved by the FDIC).

In evaluating applications by holding companies to acquire depository institutions or holding companies, the Federal Reserve must consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the company and the institutions involved, the effect of the acquisition on the risk to the insurance funds, the convenience and needs of the community and competitive factors. In addition, nonbank acquisitions by a bank holding company are generally limited to the acquisition of up to 5% of the outstanding share of any class of voting securities of a company unless the Federal Reserve has previously determined that the nonbank activities are closely related to banking or prior approval is obtained from the Federal Reserve.
Acquisition of Control
Under the federal Change in Bank Control Act, a notice must be submitted to the Federal Reserve if any person (including a company), or group acting in concert, seeks to acquire "control" of a bank holding company. An acquisition of control can occur upon the acquisition of 10.0% or more of the voting stock of a bank holding company or as otherwise defined by the Federal Reserve. Under the Change in Bank Control Act, the Federal Reserve has 60 days from the filing of a complete notice to act (the 60-day period may be extended), taking into consideration certain factors, including the financial and managerial resources of the acquirer and the antitrust effects of the acquisition. Control can also exist if an individual or company has, or exercises, directly or indirectly or by acting in concert with others, a controlling influence over the Bank. Washington law also imposes certain limitations on the ability of persons and entities to acquire control of banking institutions and their parent companies.
Dividend Policy
Under Washington law, the Company is generally permitted to make a distribution, including payments of dividends, only if, after giving effect to the distribution, in the judgment of the board of directors, (1) the Company would be able to pay its debts as they become due in the ordinary course of business and (2) the Company's total assets would at least equal the sum of its total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed if the Company were to be dissolved at the time of the distribution to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of shareholders whose preferential rights are superior to those receiving the distribution. In addition, it is the policy of the Federal Reserve that bank holding companies generally should pay dividends only out of net income generated over the past year and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. The policy also provides that bank holding companies should not maintain a level of cash dividends that places undue pressure on the capital of its subsidiary bank or that may undermine its ability to serve as a source of strength.
The Company's ability to pay dividends to shareholders is significantly dependent on the Bank's ability to pay dividends to the Company. Capital rules as well as regulatory policy impose additional requirements on the ability of the Company and the Bank to pay dividends. See "Regulation and Supervision of HomeStreet Bank - Capital and Prompt Corrective Action Requirements - Capital Requirements."
Compensation Policies
Compensation policies and practices at the Company and the Bank are subject to regulation by their respective banking regulators and the SEC.
Guidance on Sound Incentive Compensation Policies. Effective on June 25, 2010, federal banking regulators adopted Sound Incentive Compensation Policies Final Guidance (the "Final Guidance") designed to help ensure that incentive compensation policies at banking organizations do not encourage imprudent risk-taking and are consistent with the safety and soundness of 
the organization. The Final Guidance applies to senior executives and others who are responsible for oversight of our company-wide activities and material business lines, as well as other employees who, either individually or as a part of a group, have the ability to expose the Bank to material amounts of risk.
Dodd-Frank Act. In addition to the Final Guidance, the Dodd-Frank Act contains a number of provisions relating to compensation applying to public companies such as the Company. The Dodd-Frank Act added a new Section 14A(a) to the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") that requires companies to include a separate non-binding resolution subject to shareholder vote in their proxy materials approving the executive compensation disclosed in the materials. In addition, a new Section 14A(b) to the Exchange Act requires any proxy or consent solicitation materials for a meeting seeking shareholder approval of an acquisition, merger, consolidation or disposition of all or substantially all of the company's assets to include a separate non-binding shareholder resolution approving certain "golden parachute" payments made in connection with the transaction. A new Section 10D to the Exchange Act requires the SEC to direct the national securities exchanges to require companies to implement a policy to "claw back" certain executive payments that were made based on improper financial statements.
In addition, Section 956 of the Dodd-Frank Act requires certain regulators (including the FDIC, SEC and Federal Reserve) to adopt regulations or guidelines prohibiting excessive compensation or compensation that could lead to material loss as well as rules relating to disclosure of compensation. On April 14, 2011, these regulators published a joint proposed rulemaking to implement Section 956 of Dodd-Frank for depository institutions, their holding companies and various other financial institutions with $1 billion or more in assets. On June 10, 2016, these regulators published a modified proposed rule. Under the new proposed rule, the requirements and prohibitions will vary depending on the size and complexity of the covered institution. Generally, for covered institutions with less than $50 billion in consolidated assets (such as the Company), the new proposed rule would (1) prohibit incentive-based compensation arrangements for covered persons that would encourage inappropriate risks by providing excessive compensation or by providing compensation that could lead to a material financial loss, (2) require oversight of an institution’s incentive-based compensation arrangements by the institution’s board of directors or a committee and approval by the board or committee of certain payments and awards and (3) require the creation on an annual basis and maintenance for at least seven years of records that (a) document the institution’s incentive compensation arrangements, (b) demonstrate compliance with the regulation and (c) are disclosed to the institution's appropriate federal regulator upon request.
FDIC Regulations. We are further restricted in our ability to make certain "golden parachute" and "indemnification" payments under Part 359 of the FDIC regulations, and the FDIC also regulates payments to executives under Part 364 of its regulations relating to excessive executive compensation.
Regulation and Supervision of HomeStreet Bank
General
As a commercial bank chartered under the laws of the State of Washington, HomeStreet Bank is subject to applicable provisions of Washington law and regulations of the WDFI. As a state-chartered commercial bank that is not a member of the Federal Reserve System, the Bank's primary federal regulator is the FDIC. It is subject to regulation and examination by the WDFI and the FDIC, as well as enforcement actions initiated by the WDFI and the FDIC, and its deposits are insured by the FDIC.
Washington Banking Regulation
As a Washington bank, the Bank's operations and activities are substantially regulated by Washington law and regulations, which govern, among other things, the Bank's ability to take deposits and pay interest, make loans on or invest in residential and other real estate, make consumer and commercial loans, invest in securities, offer various banking services to its customers and establish branch offices. Under state law, commercial banks in Washington also generally have, subject to certain limitations or approvals, all of the powers that Washington chartered savings banks have under Washington law and that federal savings banks and national banks have under federal laws and regulations.
Washington law also governs numerous corporate activities relating to the Bank, including the Bank's ability to pay dividends, to engage in merger activities and to amend its articles of incorporation, as well as limitations on change of control of the Bank. Under Washington law, the board of directors of the Bank generally may not declare a cash dividend on its capital stock if payment of such dividend would cause its net worth to be reduced below the net worth requirements, if any, imposed by the WDFI and dividends may not be paid in an amount greater than its retained earnings without the approval of the WDFI. These restrictions are in addition to restrictions imposed by federal law. Mergers involving the Bank and sales or acquisitions of its branches are generally subject to the approval of the WDFI. No person or entity may acquire control of the Bank until 30 days 
after filing an application with the WDFI, which has the authority to disapprove the application. Washington law defines "control" of an entity to mean directly or indirectly, alone or in concert with others, to own, control or hold the power to vote 25.0% or more of the outstanding stock or voting power of the entity. Any amendment to the Bank's articles of incorporation requires the approval of the WDFI.
The Bank is subject to periodic examination by and reporting requirements of the WDFI, as well as enforcement actions initiated by the WDFI. The WDFI's enforcement powers include the issuance of orders compelling or restricting conduct by the Bank and the authority to bring actions to remove the Bank's directors, officers and employees. The WDFI has authority to place the Bank under supervisory direction or to take possession of the Bank and to appoint the FDIC as receiver.
Insurance of Deposit Accounts and Regulation by the FDIC
The FDIC is the Bank's principal federal bank regulator. As such, the FDIC is authorized to conduct examinations of, and to require reporting by the Bank. The FDIC may prohibit the Bank from engaging in any activity determined by law, regulation or order to pose a serious risk to the institution, and may take a variety of enforcement actions in the event the Bank violates a law, regulation or order or engages in an unsafe or unsound practice or under certain other circumstances. The FDIC also has the authority to appoint itself as receiver of the Bank or to terminate the Bank's deposit insurance if it were to determine that the Bank has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or is in an unsafe or unsound condition.
The Bank is a member of the Deposit Insurance Fund ("DIF") administered by the FDIC, which insures customer deposit accounts. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the amount of federal deposit insurance coverage was permanently increased from $100,000 to $250,000, per depositor, for each account ownership category at each depository institution. This change made permanent the coverage increases that had been in effect since October 2008. 
In order to maintain the DIF, member institutions, such as the Bank, are assessed insurance premiums. The Dodd-Frank Act required the FDIC to make numerous changes to the DIF and the manner in which assessments are calculated. The minimum ratio of assets in the DIF to the total of estimated insured deposits was increased from 1.15% to 1.35%, and the FDIC is given until September 30, 2020 to meet the reserve ratio. In December 2010, the FDIC adopted a final rule setting the reserve ratio of the DIF at 2.0%. As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, assessments are now based on an insured institution's average consolidated assets less tangible equity capital.
Each institution is provided an assessment rate, which is generally based on the risk that the institution presents to the DIF. Institutions with less than $10 billion in assets generally have an assessment rate that can range from 1.5 to 30 basis points. However, the FDIC does have flexibility to adopt assessment rates without additional rule-making provided that the total base assessment rate increase or decrease does not exceed 2 basis points. In the future, if the reserve ratio reaches certain levels, these assessment rates will generally be lowered. As of December 31, 2018, the Bank's assessment rate was 6.44 basis points on average assets less average tangible equity capital.
In addition, all FDIC-insured institutions are required to pay a pro rata portion of the interest due on obligations issued by the Financing Corporation to fund the closing and disposal of failed thrift institutions by the Resolution Trust Corporation. The Financing Corporation rate is adjusted quarterly to reflect changes in assessment bases of the DIF. These assessments will continue until the Financing Corporation bonds mature in 2019. The annual rate for the first quarter of 2019 is 0.14 basis points.
Capital and Prompt Corrective Action Requirements
Capital Requirements
In July 2013, federal banking regulators (including the FDIC and the FRB) adopted new capital rules (the "Rules"). The Rules apply to both depository institutions (such as the Bank) and their holding companies (such as the Company). The Rules reflect, in part, certain standards initially adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in December 2010 (which standards are commonly referred to as "Basel III") as well as requirements contemplated by the Dodd-Frank Act. The Rules applied to both the Company and the Bank beginning in 2015. 
The Rules recognize three components, or tiers, of capital: common equity Tier 1 capital, additional Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital. Common equity Tier 1 capital generally consists of retained earnings and common stock instruments (subject to certain adjustments), as well as accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI") except to the extent that the Company and the Bank exercise a one-time irrevocable option to exclude certain components of AOCI. Both the Company and the Bank made this election in 2015. Additional Tier 1 capital generally includes non-cumulative preferred stock and related surplus subject to certain adjustments and limitations. Tier 2 capital generally includes certain capital instruments (such as subordinated debt) and 
portions of the amounts of the allowance for loan and lease losses, subject to certain requirements and deductions. The term "Tier 1 capital" means common equity Tier 1 capital plus additional Tier 1 capital, and the term "total capital" means Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital. 
The Rules generally measure an institution's capital using four capital measures or ratios. The common equity Tier 1 capital ratio is the ratio of the institution's common equity Tier 1 capital to its Tier 1 risk-weighted assets. The Tier 1 capital ratio is the ratio of the institution's Tier 1 capital to its total risk-weighted assets. The total capital ratio is the ratio of the institution's total capital to its total risk-weighted assets. The leverage ratio is the ratio of the institution's Tier 1 capital to its average total consolidated assets. To determine risk-weighted assets, assets of an institution are generally placed into a risk category as prescribed by the regulations and given a percentage weight based on the relative risk of that category. The percentage weights range from 0% to 1,250%. An asset's risk-weighted value will generally be its percentage weight multiplied by the asset's value as determined under generally accepted accounting principles. In addition, certain off-balance-sheet items are converted to balance-sheet credit equivalent amounts, and each amount is then assigned to one of the risk categories. An institution's federal regulator may require the institution to hold more capital than would otherwise be required under the Rules if the regulator determines that the institution’s capital requirements under the Rules are not commensurate with the institution's credit, market, operational or other risks.
To be adequately capitalized both the Company and the Bank are required to have a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 4.5% or more, a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.0% or more, a Tier 1 risk-based ratio of 6.0% or more and a total risk-based ratio of 8.0% or more. In addition to the preceding requirements, all financial institutions subject to the Rules, including both the Company and the Bank, are required to establish a "conservation buffer," consisting of common equity Tier 1 capital, which is at least 2.5% above each of the preceding common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, the Tier 1 risk-based ratio and the total risk-based ratio. An institution that does not meet the conservation buffer will be subject to restrictions on certain activities including payment of dividends, stock repurchases and discretionary bonuses to executive officers.
The Rules set forth the manner in which certain capital elements are determined, including but not limited to, requiring certain deductions related to mortgage servicing rights and deferred tax assets. When the federal banking regulators initially proposed new capital rules in 2012, the rules would have phased out trust preferred securities as a component of Tier 1 capital. As finally adopted, however, the Rules permit holding companies with less than $15 billion in total assets as of December 31, 2009 (which includes the Company) to continue to include trust preferred securities issued prior to May 19, 2010 in Tier 1 capital, generally up to 25% of other Tier 1 capital.
The Rules made changes in the methods of calculating certain risk-based assets, which in turn affects the calculation of risk- based ratios. Higher or more sensitive risk weights are assigned to various categories of assets, among which are commercial real estate, credit facilities that finance the acquisition, development or construction of real property, certain exposures or credits that are 90 days past due or are nonaccrual, foreign exposures, certain corporate exposures, securitization exposures, equity exposures and in certain cases mortgage servicing rights and deferred tax assets.
Both the Company and the Bank were generally required to be in compliance with the Rules on January 1, 2015. The conservation buffer began being phased in beginning in 2016 and would have taken full effect on January 1, 2019. However, in August 2017, the rules were halted at 2017 levels. Certain calculations under the Rules will also have phase-in periods. We believe that the current capital levels of the Company and the Bank are in compliance with the standards under the Rules including the conservation buffer.
Prompt Corrective Action Regulations
Section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act establishes a framework of supervisory actions for insured depository institutions that are not adequately capitalized, also known as "prompt corrective action" regulations. All of the federal banking agencies have promulgated substantially similar regulations to implement a system of prompt corrective action. These regulations apply to the Bank but not the Company. As modified by the Rules, the framework establishes five capital categories; under the Rules, a bank is:

• | "well capitalized" if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or more, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or more, a common equity Tier 1 risk-based ratio of 6.5% or more, and a leverage capital ratio of 5.0% or more, and is not subject to any written agreement, order or capital directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure;


• | "adequately capitalized" if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or more, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or more, a common equity Tier 1 risk-based ratio of 4.5% or more, and a leverage capital ratio of 4.0% or more;


• | "undercapitalized" if it has a total risk-based capital ratio less than 8.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio less than 6.0%, a common equity risk-based ratio less than 4.5% or a leverage capital ratio less than 4.0%;


• | "significantly undercapitalized" if it has a total risk-based capital ratio less than 6.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio less than 4.0%, a common equity risk-based ratio less than 3.0% or a leverage capital ratio less than 3.0%; and


• | "critically undercapitalized" if it has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0%.

A bank that, based upon its capital levels, is classified as "well capitalized," "adequately capitalized" or "undercapitalized" may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, determines that an unsafe or unsound condition, or an unsafe or unsound practice, warrants such treatment.
At each successive lower capital category, an insured bank is subject to increasingly severe supervisory actions. These actions include, but are not limited to, restrictions on asset growth, interest rates paid on deposits, branching, allowable transactions with affiliates, ability to pay bonuses and raises to senior executives and pursuing new lines of business. Additionally, all "undercapitalized" banks are required to implement capital restoration plans to restore capital to at least the "adequately capitalized" level, and the FDIC is generally required to close "critically undercapitalized" banks within a 90-day period.
Capital Simplification Rule
Following the enactment of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (the "EGRRCPA") in May 2018, the federal banking regulators (including the FDIC and the Federal Reserve) have proposed a new rule, the Community Bank Leverage Ratio ("CBLR"), intended to simplify capital rules for certain community banks and their holding companies. Qualifying community banking organizations could elect to be under a new capital requirement rather than the current capital framework. To be eligible to make this election, the community banking organization would have to have less than $10 billion in assets, have a CBLR of at least 9.00% and meet certain other criteria (including limits on off-balance sheet exposures, trading assets and liabilities, mortgage servicing assets, and deferred tax assets). The CBLR would generally be the ratio of the organization’s total bank equity capital to average assets, subject to certain adjustments. The intent of the proposal is to simplify but not weaken capital requirements for qualifying community banks. Based on the requirements and our current structure, we are not eligible to make this election, although that may change if we are successful in selling the assets related to our stand-alone home loan business and related portfolio of mortgage servicing rights. If we do qualify, we will have to assess whether or not it would be advantageous for us to make the election once the rule is finalized and fully adopted. We have previously discussed a different rule proposed by banking regulators in September 2017 to simplify and reduce the capital burden for banks holding mortgage servicing assets. To date, a final rule has not been published, and given the recent proposal of the CBLR which omits the previously expected capital relief for such assets, we no longer expect that the proposed rule to reduce the capital burden for banks holding mortgage servicing rights will be enacted.
Limitations on Transactions with Affiliates
Transactions between the Bank and any affiliate are governed by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act. An affiliate of the Bank is any company or entity which controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the Bank but which is not a subsidiary of the Bank. The Company and its non-bank subsidiaries are affiliates of the Bank. Generally, Section 23A limits the extent to which the Bank or its subsidiaries may engage in "covered transactions" with any one affiliate to an amount equal to 10.0% of the Bank's capital stock and surplus, and imposes an aggregate limit on all such transactions with all affiliates in an amount equal to 20.0% of such capital stock and surplus. Section 23B applies to "covered transactions" as well as certain other transactions and requires that all transactions be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the Bank, as those provided to a non-affiliate. The term "covered transaction" includes the making of loans to an affiliate, the purchase of or investment in the securities issued by an affiliate, the purchase of assets from an affiliate, the acceptance of securities issued by an affiliate as collateral security for a loan or extension of credit to any person or company, the issuance of a guarantee, acceptance or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate, or certain transactions with an affiliate that involves the borrowing or lending of securities and certain derivative transactions with an affiliate.
In addition, Sections 22(g) and (h) of the Federal Reserve Act place restrictions on loans, derivatives, repurchase agreements and securities lending to executive officers, directors and principal shareholders of the Bank and its affiliates.
Standards for Safety and Soundness
The federal banking regulatory agencies have prescribed, by regulation, a set of guidelines for all insured depository institutions prescribing safety and soundness standards. These guidelines establish general standards for internal controls, information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings standards, compensation, fees and benefits. In general, the guidelines require appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risks and exposures specified in the guidelines before capital becomes impaired. The guidelines prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer, employee, director, or principal shareholder.
Each insured depository institution must implement a comprehensive written information security program that includes administrative, technical and physical safeguards appropriate to the institution's size and complexity and the nature and scope of its activities. The information security program also must be designed to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer information, protect against any unanticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such information, protect against unauthorized access to or use of such information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer and ensure the proper disposal of customer and consumer information. Each insured depository institution must also develop and implement a risk-based response program to address incidents of unauthorized access to customer information in customer information systems. If the FDIC determines that the Bank fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, it may require the Bank to submit an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard. The Bank maintains a program to meet the information security requirements.
Real Estate Lending Standards
FDIC regulations require the Bank to adopt and maintain written policies that establish appropriate limits and standards for real estate loans. These standards, which must be consistent with safe and sound banking practices, must establish loan portfolio diversification standards, prudent underwriting standards (including loan-to-value ratio limits) that are clear and measurable, loan administration procedures and documentation, approval and reporting requirements. The Bank is obligated to monitor conditions in its real estate markets to ensure that its standards continue to be appropriate for market conditions. The Bank's board of directors is required to review and approve the Bank's standards at least annually.
The FDIC has published guidelines for compliance with these regulations, including supervisory limitations on loan-to-value ratios for different categories of real estate loans. Under the guidelines, the aggregate amount of all loans in excess of the supervisory loan-to-value ratios should not exceed 100.0% of total capital, and the total of all loans for commercial, agricultural, multifamily or other non-one-to-four family residential properties in excess of such ratios should not exceed 30.0% of total capital. Loans in excess of the supervisory loan-to-value ratio limitations must be identified in the Bank's records and reported at least quarterly to the Bank's board of directors.
The FDIC and the federal banking agencies have also issued guidance on sound risk management practices for concentrations in commercial real estate lending. The particular focus is on exposure to commercial real estate loans that are dependent on the cash flow from the real estate held as collateral and that are likely to be sensitive to conditions in the commercial real estate market (as opposed to real estate collateral held as a secondary source of repayment or as an abundance of caution). The purpose of the guidance is not to limit a bank's commercial real estate lending but to guide banks in developing risk management practices and capital levels commensurate with the level and nature of real estate concentrations.
Risk Retention
The Dodd-Frank Act requires that, subject to certain exemptions, securitizers of mortgage and other asset-backed securities retain not less than five percent of the credit risk of the mortgages or other assets and that the securitizer not hedge or otherwise transfer the risk it is required to retain. In December 2014, the federal banking regulators, together with the SEC, the Federal Housing Finance Agency and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, published a final rule implementing this requirement. Generally, the final rule provides various ways in which the retention of risk requirement can be satisfied and also describes exemptions from the retention requirements for various types of assets, including mortgages. Compliance with the final rule with respect to residential mortgage securitizations was required beginning in December 2015 and was required beginning in December 2016 for all other securitizations.
Volcker Rule
In December 2013, the FDIC, the FRB and various other federal agencies issued final rules to implement certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act commonly known as the "Volcker Rule." Subject to certain exceptions, the final rules generally prohibit banks and affiliated companies from engaging in short-term proprietary trading of certain securities, derivatives, commodity futures and options on those instruments, for their own account. The final rules also impose restrictions on banks and their affiliates from acquiring or retaining an ownership interest in, sponsoring or having certain other relationships with hedge funds or private equity funds.
Section 203 of the EGRRCPA amends the Volker Rule to exempt any institution that does not have, or is not controlled by a company that has more than $10 billion in total consolidated assets and total trading assets and liabilities that are more than five percent of total consolidated assets. As a result, the Bank is exempt from the Volker Rule until such time that its assets exceed $10 billion or its total trading assets and liabilities are more than five percent of total consolidated assets. 
Activities and Investments of Insured State-Chartered Financial Institutions
Federal law generally prohibits FDIC-insured state banks from engaging as a principal in activities, and from making equity investments, other than those that are permissible for national banks. An insured state bank is not prohibited from, among other things, (1) acquiring or retaining a majority interest in certain subsidiaries, (2) investing as a limited partner in a partnership the sole purpose of which is direct or indirect investment in the acquisition, rehabilitation or new construction of a qualified housing project, provided that such limited partnership investments may not exceed 2.0% of the bank's total assets, (3) acquiring up to 10.0% of the voting stock of a company that solely provides or reinsures directors', trustees' and officers' liability insurance coverage or bankers' blanket bond group insurance coverage for insured depository institutions and (4) acquiring or retaining the voting shares of a depository institution if certain requirements are met.
Washington State has enacted a law regarding financial institution parity. The law generally provides that Washington-chartered commercial banks may exercise any of the powers of Washington-chartered savings banks, national banks or federally-chartered savings banks, subject to the approval of the Director of the WDFI in certain situations.
Environmental Issues Associated With Real Estate Lending
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or (the "CERCLA"), is a federal statute that generally imposes strict liability on all prior and present "owners and operators" of sites containing hazardous waste. However, Congress has acted to protect secured creditors by providing that the term "owner and operator" excludes a person whose ownership is limited to protecting its security interest in the site. Since the enactment of the CERCLA, this "secured creditor" exemption has been the subject of judicial interpretations which have left open the possibility that lenders could be liable for cleanup costs on contaminated property that they hold as collateral for a loan. To the extent that legal uncertainty exists in this area, all creditors, including the Bank, that have made loans secured by properties with potential hazardous waste contamination (such as petroleum contamination) could be subject to liability for cleanup costs, which costs often substantially exceed the value of the collateral property.
Reserve Requirements
The Bank is subject to Federal Reserve regulations pursuant to which depositary institutions may be required to maintain non-interest-earning reserves against their deposit accounts and certain other liabilities. Reserves must be maintained against transaction accounts (primarily negotiable order of withdrawal and regular checking accounts). The regulations generally required in 2018 that reserves be maintained as follows:

• | Net transaction accounts up to $16.0 million are exempt from reserve requirements.


• | A reserve of 3.0% of the aggregate is required for transaction accounts over $16.0 million up to $122.3 million.


• | A reserve of 10% is required for any transaction accounts over $122.3 million.

In 2019, the regulations generally require that reserves be maintained as follows:

• | Net transaction accounts up to $16.3 million are exempt from reserve requirements.


• | A reserve of 3.0% of the aggregate is required for transaction accounts over $16.3 million up to $124.2 million.


• | A reserve of 10% is required for any transaction accounts over $124.2 million.

Federal Home Loan Bank System
The Federal Home Loan Bank system consists of 11 regional Federal Home Loan Banks. Among other benefits, each of these serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region. Each of the Federal Home Loan Banks makes available loans or advances to its members in compliance with the policies and procedures established by its board of directors. The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines (the "Des Moines FHLB") and is a borrowing non-member financial institution with the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco (the "San Francisco FHLB"). As a member of the Des Moines FHLB, the Bank is required to own stock in the Des Moines FHLB. Separately, pursuant to a non-member lending agreement with the San Francisco FHLB that we entered into at the time of the Simplicity Acquisition, we are required to own stock of the San Francisco FHLB so long as we continue to be a borrower from the San Francisco FHLB. As of December 31, 2018, we owned $45.5 million of stock in the FHLB in the aggregate based on these obligations. 
Community Reinvestment Act of 1977
Banks are subject to the provisions of the CRA of 1977, which requires the appropriate federal bank regulatory agency to assess a bank's record in meeting the credit needs of the assessment areas serviced by the bank, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The regulatory agency's assessment of the bank's record is made available to the public. Further, these assessments are considered by regulators when evaluating mergers, acquisitions and applications to open or relocate a branch or facility. The Bank currently has a rating of "Satisfactory" under the CRA.
Dividends
Dividends from the Bank constitute an important source of funds for dividends that may be paid by the Company to shareholders. The amount of dividends payable by the Bank to the Company depends upon the Bank's earnings and capital position and is limited by federal and state laws. Under Washington law, the Bank may not declare or pay a cash dividend on its capital stock if this would cause its net worth to be reduced below the net worth requirements, if any, imposed by the WDFI. In addition, dividends on the Bank's capital stock may not be paid in an amount greater than its retained earnings without the approval of the WDFI.
The amount of dividends actually paid during any one period will be strongly affected by the Bank's policy of maintaining a strong capital position. Federal law prohibits an insured depository institution from paying a cash dividend if this would cause the institution to be "undercapitalized," as defined in the prompt corrective action regulations. Moreover, the federal bank regulatory agencies have the general authority to limit the dividends paid by insured banks if such payments are deemed to constitute an unsafe and unsound practice. Capital rules that went into effect in 2015 impose additional requirements on the Bank's ability to pay dividends. See "Regulation and Supervision of HomeStreet Bank - Capital and Prompt Corrective Action Requirements - Capital Requirements."
Liquidity
The Bank is required to maintain a sufficient amount of liquid assets to ensure its safe and sound operation. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis - Liquidity Risk and Capital Resources."
Compensation
The Bank is subject to regulation of its compensation practices. See "Regulation and Supervision - Regulation of the Company - Compensation Policies."
Bank Secrecy Act and USA Patriot Act
The Company and the Bank are subject to the Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act, which gives the federal government powers to address money laundering and terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures, expanded surveillance powers and mandatory transaction reporting obligations. By way of example, the Bank Secrecy Act imposes an affirmative obligation on the Bank to report currency transactions that exceed certain thresholds and to report other transactions determined to be suspicious. Beginning in May 2018, the Bank Secrecy Act required financial institutions, including the Bank, to meet certain customer due diligence requirements, including obtaining a certification from the individual opening the account on behalf of the legal entity that identifies the beneficial owner(s) of the entity. The purpose of these requirements is to enable the Bank to be able to predict with relative certainty the types of transactions in which a customer is likely to engage which should in turn assist in determining when transactions are potentially suspicious.
Like all United States companies and individuals, the Company and the Bank are prohibited from transacting business with certain individuals and entities named on the Office of Foreign Asset Control's list of Specially Designated Nationals and 
Blocked Persons. Failure to comply may result in fines and other penalties. The Office of Foreign Asset Control ("OFAC") has issued guidance directed at financial institutions in which it asserted that it may, in its discretion, examine institutions determined to be high-risk or to be lacking in their efforts to comply with these prohibitions.
The Bank maintains a program to meet the requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act, USA PATRIOT Act and OFAC.
Identity Theft
Section 315 of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act ("FACT Act") requires each financial institution or creditor to develop and implement a written Identity Theft Prevention Program to detect, prevent and mitigate identity theft "red flags" in connection with the opening of certain accounts or certain existing accounts.
The Bank maintains a program to meet the requirements of Section 315 of the FACT Act.
Consumer Protection Laws and Regulations
The Bank and its affiliates are subject to a broad array of federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations that govern almost every aspect of its business relationships with consumers. While this list is not exhaustive, these include the Truth-in-Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Secure and Fair Enforcement in Mortgage Licensing Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Service Members' Civil Relief Act, the Right to Financial Privacy Act, the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act, the Consumer Leasing Act, the Fair Credit Billing Act, the Homeowners Protection Act, the Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act, laws governing flood insurance, laws governing consumer protections in connection with the sale of insurance, federal and state laws prohibiting unfair and deceptive business practices, foreclosure laws and various regulations that implement some or all of the foregoing. These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with customers when taking deposits, making loans, collecting loans and providing other services. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations can subject the Bank to various penalties, including but not limited to, enforcement actions, injunctions, fines, civil money penalties, civil liability, criminal penalties, punitive damages and the loss of certain contractual rights. The Bank has a compliance governance structure in place to help ensure its compliance with these requirements.
The Dodd-Frank Act established the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection ("CFPB") as a new independent bureau that is responsible for regulating consumer financial products and services under federal consumer financial laws. The CFPB has broad rulemaking authority with respect to these laws and exclusive examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to banks with assets of more than $10 billion.
The Dodd-Frank Act also contains a variety of provisions intended to reform consumer mortgage practices. The provisions include (1) a requirement that lenders make a determination that at the time a residential mortgage loan is consummated the consumer has a reasonable ability to repay the loan and related costs, (2) a ban on loan originator compensation based on the interest rate or other terms of the loan (other than the amount of the principal), (3) a ban on prepayment penalties for certain types of loans, (4) bans on arbitration provisions in mortgage loans and (5) requirements for enhanced disclosures in connection with the making of a loan. The Dodd-Frank Act also imposed a variety of requirements on entities that service mortgage loans and significantly expanded mortgage loan application data collection and reporting requirements under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act.
The Dodd-Frank Act contains provisions further regulating payment card transactions. The Dodd-Frank Act required the Federal Reserve to adopt regulations limiting any interchange fee for a debit transaction to an amount which is "reasonable and proportional" to the costs incurred by the issuer. The Federal Reserve has adopted final regulations limiting the amount of debit interchange fees that large bank issuers may charge or receive on their debit card transactions. There is an exemption from the rules for issuers with assets of less than $10 billion and the Federal Reserve has stated that it will monitor and report to Congress on the effectiveness of the exemption.
Future Legislation or Regulation
The Trump administration, Congress, the regulators and various states continue to focus attention on the financial services industry. Proposals that affect the industry will likely continue to be introduced. In particular, the Trump administration and various members of Congress have expressed a desire to further modify or repeal parts of the Dodd-Frank Act. We cannot predict whether any of these proposals will be enacted or adopted or, if they are, the effect they would have on our business, our operations or our financial condition or on the financial services industry generally.
