Company Overview
 
Canbiola, Inc. was originally incorporated as WrapMail, Inc. (“WRAP”) in Florida on October 11, 2005 in order to tap into a largely un-serviced segment of the web-based advertising industry. Effective December 27, 2010, WRAP effected a 10 for 1 forward stock split of its common stock. Effective June 4, 2013, WRAP effected a 1 for 10 reverse stock split of its common stock. The accompanying consolidated financial statements retroactively reflect these stock splits.
 
Effective January 5, 2015, WRAP acquired 100% ownership of Prosperity Systems, Inc. (“Prosperity”), a New York corporation incorporated on April 2, 2008, in order to acquire Prosperity’s office productivity software suite as a complement to WRAP’s existing intellectual property. After its acquisition, the Company transferred Prosperity’s operations to WRAP and is presently in the process of dissolving Prosperity. For the periods presented, the assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses are those of the Company. Prosperity had no activity for the periods presented.
 
Around the first quarter of 2017, the Company began to transition into the Hemp CBD industry and now primarily offers health and beauty products and supplements containing CBD. On May 15, 2017, WRAP changed its name to Canbiola, Inc. (the “Company” or “CANB” or “Canbiola”) to reflect its transition.
 
Business
 
The Company’s primary business is the development, production and sale of products and delivery devices containing CBD. The Company’s products contain CBD derived from Hemp and include products such as oils, creams, moisturizers, isolate, and gel caps. In addition to offering white labeled products, Canbiola has developed its own line of proprietary products, as well as seeking synergistic value through acquisitions of products and brands in the Hemp industry. Canbiola aims to be the premier provider of the highest quality natural Hemp CBD products on the market through sourcing the very best raw material and developing a variety of products we believe will improve people’s lives in a variety of areas.
 
“CBD” Business
 
Cannabidiol (“CBD”) is one of nearly 85 naturally occurring compounds (cannabinoids) found in industrial hemp (it is also contained in marijuana, but the Company’s products are derived only from hemp). CBD is non-psychoactive and is thought to have numerous uses, including, but not limited to, for pain, insomnia, epilepsy, anxiety, inflammation, and nausea. Unlike CBD derived from marijuana, CBD derived from the seeds and stalks of industrial hemp is generally considered “legal” in the U.S. so long as it contains less than 0.3% of “THC,” another, but psychoactive, cannabinoid found in cannabis. This purported “legal status” is because the 2018 Farm Bill removed hemp as a Schedule I drug under the Controlled Substances Act and hemp may now be grown as a commodity crop, with restrictions; however, the 2018 Farm Bill did not specifically legalize CBD. Until Congress promulgates rules and regulations relating to hemp derived CBD under the 2018 Farm Bill, the “legal” status of CBD from hemp, or the processes the Company may have to implement (and at what expense), are still unknowns. A similar paradigm exists under various state laws with which the Company will have to comply. In any case, CBD derived from marijuana, marijuana and other marijuana derivatives are federally illegal in the U.S. under the Controlled Substances Act, despite being medically or recreationally legal in numerous states, which is why the Company has established procedures to ensure that its CBD is derived from hemp in compliance with the Farm Bill.The Company has all of its hemp based raw materials (isolate) tested by a 3tf party independent laboratory and those results are posted on the Company web site.
 
In order to facilitate its operations, the Company has (and will) form or acquire a number of subsidiaries. Its goal is to eventually operate a vertically integrated hemp conglomerate that has operations spanning from seed to sale. Currently, the Company’s primary focus is the development, sale and manufacture of CBD products. The Company’s products are marketed under the tradename “Canbiola.,” and sold via its website and through doctors and other medical professionals with which the Company enters into distribution agreements. The Company also manufactures and/or sells separately branded CBD products through its subsidiaries and websites for “Pure Leaf Oil” brand and “Seven Chakras” brand.

In December, 2018, the Company acquired 100% of the membership interests in Pure Health Products, LLC, a New York limited liability company (“PHP” or “Pure Health Products”), with which it had had and has an exclusive production agreement, pursuant to an Acquisition Agreement (“PHP Acquisition Agreement”). PHP manufactures and packages the Company’s CBD infused products. PHP may also white label / rebrand or relabel the Company’s products pursuant to “white label agreements” entered into between the Company and/or PHP and third-party customers. Through PHP, the Company is able to control the manufacturing process of its products while reducing its production costs. In January, 2019, PHP acquired certain assets from Seven Chakras, LLC (“Seven Chakras”), a former competitor, which assets included the rights and title to (i) Seven Chakras’ proprietary formulas, methods, trade secrets, and know-how related to the production of Seven Chakras’ CBD products, (ii) Seven Chakras’ tradename, domain name, and social media sites, and (iii) other assets of Seven Chakras including but not limited to raw materials, equipment, packaging and labeling materials, mailing lists, and marketing materials. The Company believes the acquisition of Seven Chakra’s assets will bring accretive value and expand the Company’s market base. The Severn Chakras has a customer following in the northwest and compliments the Canbiola and Pure Leaf Oil brands with additional new products such as bath bombs, stress relief products, and lotions. Seven Chakras has its own internet website and continues in its direct marketing to its customer base.
 
In November 2018, the Company formed Duramed, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“Duramed”) to facilitate the manufacture and sale of durable medical equipment incorporating CBD. On January 14, 2019, Duramed entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (the “Sam MOU”) with Sam International (“Sam”) and ZetrOZ Systems LLC (“ZetrOZ” and, collectively with Sam, the “Manufacturers”). Pursuant to the Sam MOU, the Manufacturers granted Duramed the exclusive right to distribute sam® Pro 2.0 (SA271) and sam® Gel Coupling Patches (UB-14-72) within the United States for the Personal Injury Protection/No Fault Market during the term of the MOU. Duramed has agreed to purchase monthly minimums from the Manufacturers at a price per Unit of $2,447. The exclusivity of the Distribution License granted to Duramed under the MOU is dependent upon meeting the monthly minimum. In addition, Duramed was granted the right to distribute sam® Gel Capture Patches (UB-14-24). Duramed will get rebates of 2%-3% based on the volume of Products sold by it. The initial term of the Sam MOU expires December 31, 2019 (the “Initial Term”). The agreement contemplated by the MOU will automatically renew for additional one-year terms at the end of each calendar year, provided the monthly minimums have been met. The primary thrust of the Duramed Division is to market to patients via doctors via a device rental program reimbursable by insurance carriers to help patient with pain reductions and faster healing.
 
The CBD and cannabis markets are flooded with competition ranging from mom and pop operations to multi-million-dollar conglomerates, many with longer operating histories, more capital and/or more industry knowledge than the Company. The Company hopes to partner with or engage industry specialists to help set it apart from its numerous competitors. One of those points of differentiation is its 3rd party independent testing “Certificate of Analysis” conducted on all of the CBD isolate products it purchases and posting of those lab results on its website.

Research and Development

Government Regulation
 
The cultivation and sale of hemp and hemp products is federally regulated under the United States Farm Bill. The 2018 Farm Bill removed hemp as a Schedule 1 Substance under the Controlled Substances Act; however, rules and regulations relating to manufacture and sale of CBD products under the Farm Bill must still be promulgated and are expected to impact the Company’s operations. As the legal CBD industry and our product lines expand, it is uncertain what other statutory schemes and agencies will start to regulate our CBD products. The FDA currently still considers the addition of CBD to food products or supplements to be illegal and prohibits the advertisement of CBD products with health claims. The Company must also comply with each state’s laws relating to the sale of hemp based CBD products. These regulations may affect, among others, the way the Company manufactures and distributes its products, the way the Company is taxed, the way the Company banks, the location of the Company’s facilities, the content and testing of the Company’s products, and the quality of the Company’s services.
 
Through our document management and email marketing platforms, we are also subject to general business regulations and laws as well as Federal and state regulations and laws specifically governing the Internet and e-commerce. Existing and future laws and regulations may impede the growth of the Internet, e-commerce or other online services, and increase the cost of providing online services. These regulations and laws may cover sweepstakes, taxation, tariffs, user privacy, data protection, pricing, content, copyrights, distribution, electronic contracts and other communications, consumer protection, broadband residential Internet access and the characteristics and quality of services. It is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, sales, use and other taxes, libel and personal privacy apply to the Internet and e-commerce. Unfavorable resolution of these issues may harm our business and results of operations.
