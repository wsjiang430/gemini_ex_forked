ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Overview
KBS Growth & Income REIT, Inc. (the “Company”) was formed on January 12, 2015 as a Maryland corporation that elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) beginning with the taxable year ended December 31, 2015 and it intends to continue to operate in such a manner. As used herein, the terms “we,” “our” and “us” refer to the Company and as required by context, KBS Growth & Income Limited Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership, which we refer to as our “Operating Partnership,” and to their subsidiaries. Substantially all of our business is conducted through our Operating Partnership, of which we are the sole general partner. Subject to certain restrictions and limitations, our business is externally managed by our advisor pursuant to an advisory agreement. KBS Capital Advisors manages our operations and our portfolio of core real estate properties. KBS Capital Advisors also provides asset-management, marketing, investor-relations and other administrative services on our behalf. Our advisor acquired 20,000 shares of our Class A common stock for an initial investment of $200,000. We have no paid employees.
We commenced a private placement offering exempt from registration pursuant to Rule 506(b) of Regulation D of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), on June 11, 2015, pursuant to which we offered a maximum of $105,000,000 of shares of our Class A common stock for sale to accredited investors, of which $5,000,000 of Class A shares were offered pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan. We ceased offering shares in the primary portion of our private offering on April 27, 2016 and processed subscriptions for the primary portion of the private offering dated on or prior to April 27, 2016 through May 30, 2016. KBS Capital Markets Group LLC, an affiliate of our advisor, served as the dealer manager of the offering pursuant to a dealer manager agreement.
We sold 8,548,972 shares of our Class A common stock for gross offering proceeds of $76.8 million in our initial private offering, including 74,744 shares of our Class A common stock under our distribution reinvestment plan for gross offering proceeds of $0.7 million. 
On February 4, 2015, we filed a registration statement on Form S-11 with the SEC to register an initial public offering to offer a maximum of $1,500,000,000 in shares of common stock for sale to the public in the primary offering, consisting of two classes of shares: Class A and Class T and a maximum of $800,000,000 in both classes of shares of our common stock pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan. The SEC declared our registration statement effective on April 28, 2016 and we retained KBS Capital Markets Group LLC to serve as the dealer manager of the initial public offering. We terminated our primary initial public offering effective June 30, 2017. We are continuing to offer shares of common stock pursuant to our publicly registered distribution reinvestment plan offering.
We sold 122,721 and 270,415 shares of Class A and Class T common stock in the initial primary public offering, respectively, for aggregate gross offering proceeds of $3.9 million. As of December 31, 2018, we had sold 566,328 and 22,774 shares of Class A and Class T common stock under our distribution reinvestment plan, respectively, for aggregate gross offering proceeds of $5.4 million. 
On October 3, 2017, we launched a second private placement offering exempt from registration pursuant to Rule 506(c) of Regulation D of the Securities Act pursuant to which we are currently offering a maximum of $1,000,000,000 in shares of our Class A common stock to accredited investors. Prior to the launch of the second private placement offering, on September 29, 2017, we entered into a dealer manager agreement (the “NCPS Dealer Agreement”) with KBS Capital Advisors and North Capital Private Securities Corporation (“NCPS”) in connection with the second private placement offering. As of December 31, 2018, we had sold 343,069 shares of Class A common stock in the second private offering for aggregate gross offering proceeds of $3.0 million.
As of December 31, 2018, we had redeemed 422,286 Class A shares for $3.5 million.
We intend to use substantially all of the net proceeds from our offerings to invest in a diverse portfolio of core real estate properties. We consider core properties to be existing properties with at least 80% occupancy. Based on the current market outlook, we expect our core focus in the U.S. office sector to reflect a value-creating core strategy, which is also known as a core-plus strategy. As of December 31, 2018, we owned four office buildings.
KBS Capital Advisors makes recommendations on all investments to our board of directors. All proposed real estate investments must be approved by at least a majority of our board of directors, including a majority of the conflicts committee. Unless otherwise provided by our charter, the conflicts committee may approve a proposed real estate investment without action by the full board of directors if the approving members of the conflicts committee constitute at least a majority of the board of directors.

Objectives and Strategies
Our primary investment objectives are to preserve and return our stockholders’ capital contributions and to provide our stockholders with attractive and stable cash distributions. We will also seek to realize growth in the value of our investments by timing asset sales to maximize asset value.
Real Estate Portfolio
We have invested in and expect to continue to invest in core real estate properties. We consider core properties to be existing properties with at least 80% occupancy. Based on the current market outlook, we expect our core focus in the U.S. office sector to reflect a value-creating core strategy, which is also known as a core-plus strategy. In many cases, these core properties will have slightly higher (10% to 20%) vacancy rates and/or higher near-term lease rollover at acquisition than more conservative value-maintaining core properties. These characteristics provide us with opportunities to lease space at higher rates, especially in markets with increasing absorption, or to re-lease space in these properties at higher rates, bringing below-market rates of in-place expiring leases up to market rates. Many of these properties will require a moderate level of additional investment for capital expenditures and tenant improvement costs in order to improve or rebrand the properties and increase rental rates. Thus, we believe these properties provide an opportunity for us to achieve more significant capital appreciation by increasing occupancy, negotiating new leases with higher rental rates and/or executing enhancement projects. 
We will seek to invest in core real estate properties that we believe can produce a property-level return of between 10% and 14% over the life of the investment. Property-level return objectives do not take into account corporate-level fees and expenses, including corporate general and administrative expenses and asset management fees. We expect to focus our investments in real properties in office properties located throughout the United States. The primary types of office properties we intend to invest in include low-rise, mid-rise and high-rise office buildings and office parks in urban and suburban locations, especially those that are in or near central business districts or have access to transportation. In addition, we may consider acquiring industrial properties (including warehouse and distribution facilities, office/warehouse flex properties, research and development properties and light industrial properties) and retail properties. 
We will generally hold fee title or a long-term leasehold estate in the properties we acquire. We may also invest in or acquire operating companies or other entities that own and operate assets that meet our investment objectives. We may also participate with other entities (including affiliated entities) in property ownership through joint ventures, limited liability companies, partnerships and other types of common ownership.
Our advisor intends to diversify our real estate property investments by geographic region, investment size and investment risk. 
We generally intend to hold our core real estate properties for three to seven years. However, economic and market conditions may influence us to hold our properties for different periods of time. We generally expect that as we move toward the end of our offering stage, the hold period of assets we will consider will be shorter. We may sell an asset before the end of the expected holding period if we believe that market conditions and asset positioning have maximized its value to us or the sale of the asset would otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders.
We may make adjustments to our target portfolio based on real estate market conditions and investment opportunities. We will not forego a good investment because it does not precisely fit our expected portfolio composition. We believe that we are most likely to meet our investment objectives through the careful selection and underwriting of assets. When making an acquisition, we will emphasize the performance and risk characteristics of that investment, how that investment will fit with our portfolio-level performance objectives, the other assets in our portfolio and how the returns and risks of that investment compare to the returns and risks of available investment alternatives. Thus, to the extent that our advisor presents us with what we believe to be good investment opportunities that allow us to meet the REIT requirements under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Internal Revenue Code”), our portfolio composition may vary from what we initially expect. However, we will attempt to construct a portfolio that produces stable and attractive returns by spreading risk across different real estate investments.
We acquired our first real estate property on August 12, 2015. As of December 31, 2018, our real estate portfolio was composed of four office buildings containing 683,952 rentable square feet, which were collectively 93% occupied. For more information on our real estate investments, including tenant information, see Part 1, Item 2, “Properties.”

The following charts illustrate the geographic diversification of our real estate properties based on total leased square feet and total annualized base rent as of December 31, 2018: 

_____________________
(1) Annualized base rent represents annualized contractual base rental income as of December 31, 2018, adjusted to straight-line any contractual tenant concessions (including free rent), rent increases and rent decreases from the lease’s inception through the balance of the lease term.

We have a stable tenant base and we have tried to diversify our tenant base in order to limit exposure to any one tenant or industry. Our top ten tenants leasing space in our real estate portfolio represented approximately 55% of our total annualized base rent as of December 31, 2018. The chart below illustrates the diversity of tenant industries in our real estate portfolio based on total annualized base rent as of December 31, 2018:
_____________________
(1) Annualized base rent represents annualized contractual base rental income as of December 31, 2018, adjusted to straight-line any contractual tenant concessions (including free rent), rent increases and rent decreases from the lease’s inception through the balance of the lease term.
* “Other” includes any industry less than 4% of total.
Financing Objectives
We financed our real estate acquisitions to date with proceeds raised in our offerings and debt. We may use proceeds from borrowings to finance acquisitions of new properties; to pay for capital improvements, repairs or tenant build-outs to properties; to refinance existing indebtedness; to pay distributions; or to provide working capital. Careful use of debt will help us to achieve our diversification goals because we will have more funds available for investment. Our investment strategy is to utilize primarily secured and possibly unsecured debt to finance our investment portfolio. We may elect to secure financing subsequent to the acquisition date of real estate properties and initially acquire investments without debt financing. To the extent that we do not finance our properties, our ability to acquire additional real estate investments will be restricted. 
We expect to borrow funds at fixed and variable rates. As of December 31, 2018, we had debt obligations in the aggregate principal amount of $117.8 million, with a weighted-average remaining term of 2.8 years. We have a total of $117.8 million of variable rate notes payable. Of the variable rate debt outstanding, approximately $48.5 million was effectively fixed through the use of interest rate swap agreements. The weighted-average interest rate of our variable rate debt as of December 31, 2018 was 4.2%. The weighted-average interest rate represents the actual interest rate in effect as of December 31, 2018 (consisting of the contractual interest rate), using interest rate indices as of December 31, 2018, where applicable.
 7

We have tried to spread the maturity dates of our debt to minimize maturity and refinance risk in our portfolio. In addition, a majority of our debt allows us to extend the maturity dates, subject to certain conditions contained in the applicable loan documents. Although we believe we will satisfy the conditions to extend the maturity of our debt obligations, we can give no assurance in this regard. The following table shows the current maturities, including principal amortization payments, of our debt obligations as of December 31, 2018 (in thousands):

2019 | $ | — 
2020 | 72,800 | 
2021 | — | 
2022 | — | 
2023 | 45,000 | 
Thereafter | — | 
 | $ | 117,800

We expect that once we have fully invested the proceeds raised during our offering stage, our debt financing and other liabilities will be between 45% and 65% of the cost of our tangible assets (before deducting depreciation and other non-cash reserves). Though this is our target leverage, our charter does not limit us from incurring debt until our aggregate borrowings would exceed 300% of our net assets (before deducting depreciation and other non-cash reserves), or effectively 75% of the cost of our tangible assets, though we may exceed this limit under certain circumstances. To the extent financing in excess of this limit is available at attractive terms, the conflicts committee may approve debt in excess of this limit. As of December 31, 2018, our aggregate borrowings were approximately 66% of our net assets before deducting depreciation and other non-cash reserves. 
Economic Dependency
We are dependent on our advisor for certain services that are essential to us, including identification, evaluation, negotiation, acquisition and disposition of investments; management of the daily operations and leasing of our portfolio; and other general and administrative responsibilities. In the event that our advisor is unable to provide these services, we will be required to obtain such services from other sources.
Competitive Market Factors 
The U.S. commercial real estate leasing markets remain competitive. We face competition from various entities for prospective tenants and to retain our current tenants, including other REITs, pension funds, insurance companies, investment funds and companies, partnerships and developers. Many of these entities have substantially greater financial resources than we do and may be able to accept more risk than we can prudently manage, including risks with respect to the creditworthiness of a tenant. As a result of their greater resources, those entities may have more flexibility than we do in their ability to offer rental concessions to attract and retain tenants. This could put pressure on our ability to maintain or raise rents and could adversely affect our ability to attract or retain tenants. As a result, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and ability to pay distributions to our stockholders may be adversely affected. 
Although we believe that we are well-positioned to compete effectively in each facet of our business, there is enormous competition in our market sector and there can be no assurance that we will compete effectively or that we will not encounter increased competition in the future that could limit our ability to conduct our business effectively.

Compliance with Federal, State and Local Environmental Law
Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous real property owner or operator may be liable for the cost of removing or remediating hazardous or toxic substances on, under or in such property. These costs could be substantial. Such laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. Environmental laws also may impose liens on property or restrictions on the manner in which property may be used or businesses may be operated, and these restrictions may require substantial expenditures or prevent us from entering into leases with prospective tenants that may be impacted by such laws. Environmental laws provide for sanctions for noncompliance and may be enforced by governmental agencies or, in certain circumstances, by private parties. Certain environmental laws and common law principles could be used to impose liability for the release of and exposure to hazardous substances, including asbestos-containing materials and lead-based paint. Third parties may seek recovery from real property owners or operators for personal injury or property damage associated with exposure to released hazardous substances and governments may seek recovery for natural resource damage. The costs of defending against claims of environmental liability, of complying with environmental regulatory requirements, of remediating any contaminated property, or of paying personal injury, property damage or natural resource damage claims could reduce our cash available for distribution to our stockholders. All of our real estate acquisitions are subject to Phase I environmental assessments prior to the time they are acquired.
Employees
We have no paid employees. The employees of our advisor or its affiliates provide management, acquisition, disposition, advisory and certain administrative services for us.
Principal Executive Office
Our principal executive offices are located at 800 Newport Center Drive, Suite 700, Newport Beach, California 92660.  Our telephone number and general facsimile number are (949) 417-6500 and (949) 417-6501 , respectively.
Industry Segments
As of December 31, 2018, we had invested in four office buildings. Substantially all of our revenue and net income (loss) is from real estate, and therefore, we currently operate in one business segment.
