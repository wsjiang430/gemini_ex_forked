Liquidity is an essential aspect of the success of a cryptocurrency exchange marketplace. The trades at an exchange drive its liquidity, and robust crypto exchange platform requires seamless trading activity. To manage this liquidity at the customer’s crypto exchange business, the Company will integrate its customer crypto exchange’s liquidity position to other existing exchanges. The Company will provide a modern and robust API interface that connects liquidity and trade volume data between various crypto exchanges.
