Item 1 - Business Overview
Turtle Beach Corporation is a leading gaming accessory brand offering a broad selection of cutting-edge, award-winning gaming headsets for Xbox, PlayStation®, and Nintendo consoles, as well as for PC, Mac®, and mobile/tablet devices. For more than 40 years, Turtle Beach has been a pioneer and key innovator in audio technology and is one of the most recognized names in gaming in North America and Europe.
Turtle Beach, headquartered in San Diego, California, was incorporated in the state of Nevada in 2010 and the Company’s stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol HEAR.
VTB Holdings, Inc. (“VTBH”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Turtle Beach and the owner of Voyetra Turtle Beach, Inc. (“VTB”) and Turtle Beach Europe Limited (“TB Europe”), was incorporated in the state of Delaware in 2010. VTB was incorporated in the state of Delaware in 1975 with operations principally located in Valhalla, New York.
Headset Business
Turtle Beach launched its first gaming headset in 2005 and has become the leading brand in gaming headsets. The Company designs and markets a large assortment of audio peripherals for Xbox, PlayStation®, and Nintendo consoles, as well as for PC, Mac®, and mobile/tablet devices. Turtle Beach is also a licensed partner of Microsoft, delivering innovative and groundbreaking first-to-market products for their consoles. Turtle Beach headsets are distributed internationally in North America, South America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Australia, and Asia. The headsets are sold at thousands of storefronts, including major retailers such as Amazon, Argos, Best Buy, GAME, GameStop, EB Games, Target and Walmart.
Turtle Beach delivers a wide variety of headsets spanning multiple price points ranging from $20 to $250, with many headsets compatible across all major gaming platforms. We believe these price tiers correspond to customer profiles, beginning with entry-level gamers and progressing through casual, enthusiast, core, and professional eSports gamers. Each successive price tier incorporates higher level features, comfort, and finish. For example, premium headset models typically include features like large 50mm speakers, leather-wrapped headbands and ear cushions, memory foam, powerful amplified surround sound, active noise-cancellation, and Bluetooth® connectivity. Additional features include audio presets like Bass Boost and Turtle Beach’s exclusive Superhuman Hearing™ sound setting (which may give players a competitive advantage), removable or flip-to-mute microphones, Turtle Beach’s proprietary ProSpecs™ glasses-friendly design, and rechargeable long-lasting batteries.
As gaming consoles have evolved from dedicated video game platforms to home entertainment hubs, and as mobile and tablet devices have become popular entertainment platforms, Turtle Beach has continued to evolve its product lineup to reflect how content is consumed. While each Turtle Beach headset is designed for a primary platform, such as a specific console or PC, nearly all can be used with multiple platforms, and most are compatible with mobile/tablet devices through a standard 3.5mm jack or Bluetooth® connectivity. This primary platform designation, paired with readily-identifiable platform-specific packaging designs, often results in Turtle Beach products being displayed in multiple in-store sections by retailers, increasing the prominence of the Turtle Beach brand and its products in physical retail locations and online.
In 2018, Turtle Beach was the leading console gaming headset manufacturer in North America with a 46.1% dollar share of the market, as noted in the January-December 2018 retail tracking service from The NPD Group, holding five of the top 10 selling Xbox One models and five of the top 10 selling PlayStation®4 models by revenue. Turtle Beach’s console market share in the UK was 49.8% in 2018 as reported by GfK Global. We believe the Company has achieved these high global market shares by delivering high-quality products that often include first-to-market innovations and robust features, in addition to superior sound and unmatched comfort - key factors that consumers look for when shopping for a gaming headset.

HyperSound Business
In January 2014, Turtle Beach acquired Parametric Technologies through a reverse merger. As a result of the merger, Turtle Beach acquired HyperSound - an innovative and patented technology that delivers directional audio to a specific location. HyperSound technology has applications in multiple sectors, including commercial, consumer, and hearing healthcare. Turtle Beach currently licenses HyperSound technology in the retail industry to be incorporated in customer contact points such as retail point of sales, kiosks, digital signage, wayfinding, museum exhibits, meeting halls, and more.

Industry Overview 
Gaming Headset Market
Gaming headsets are part of a growing global gaming market sized at over $150 billion. The global gaming audience now exceeds global cinema and music markets with over 2.4 billion active gamers worldwide. Gaming peripherals, such as headsets, are a $3.8 billion business globally with over 75% of that market in the Americas and Europe where the Company’s business is focused. Gaming headsets represent more than a $2.7 billion global market, or more than 70% of the total peripherals market.
Competitive eSports is a global phenomenon where professional gamers train, compete, win prize money, partner with major brands, and attract/gain fans - similar to traditional professional sports. There are over 140 million eSports enthusiasts globally and the market is growing quickly. We believe a quality gaming headset is a must-have piece of equipment for eSports participants. 
Many gamers play online where a gaming headset (which typically includes a microphone and allows players to communicate in real-time) provides a more immersive experience in the industry’s most popular games and franchises.
Xbox and PlayStation® consoles are still the dominant gaming platforms in North America and Europe, however, Nintendo’s Switch console continues to perform well two years into its lifecycle. In addition to consoles, personal computers are a popular gaming platform where players utilize a similar style headset. Gaming on mobile/tablet devices represents about a third of the global gaming market, and while headsets can be used for mobile gaming, console and PC gaming are by far the largest drivers of gaming headset use.
Historically, Microsoft and Sony have gone through cycles where their respective console platform is changed significantly or updated to a new version. Microsoft and Sony launched Pro versions of their existing console platforms in 2016 and 2017, respectively, that did not result in the same levels of disruption as previous cycles in the gaming headset business. Turtle Beach believes this is a good indication that any potential future console changes will not be as disruptive. As of early 2019, industry analysts anticipate that the next generation of Xbox will be released in 2020 or 2021, while Sony’s PlayStation®5 is rumored to arrive as early as holiday 2019. The Nintendo Switch™ is completing its second year in the market with more than 25 million units sold through the end of December 2018, during which there has been an expanding library of games and an increased number of multiplayer chat-enabled games. 
In addition to console sales, we believe Xbox, PlayStation®, Nintendo, and PC gaming markets are driven by major game launches and franchises that encourage players to buy equipment and accessories. On Xbox and PlayStation®, flagship games like Call of Duty®, Destiny, Star Wars: Battlefront, Battlefield, Grand Theft Auto, and the recently popular “battle royale” games like Fortnite, Apex Legends and PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, are examples of major franchises that prominently feature online multiplayer modes that encourage communication which tend to drive increased gaming headset sales. Many of these established franchises launch new titles annually leading into the holidays and as a result, the gaming headset business tends to be highly seasonal, often with 45%-55% of sales occurring in the fourth quarter. 
In 2017, PlayerUnkown’s Battlegrounds popularized a style of multiplayer game known as battle royale, in which players compete on large but shrinking maps until there is a single winner left. Players are able to play in teams and audio cues and communication can be very helpful, making headsets a key accessory for this type of game. 
Toward the end of 2017, Epic Games introduced Fortnite which includes a similar format and soared in popularity resulting in large and growing audiences of both players and spectators through content sharing platforms like Twitch, YouTube, Xbox's Mixer and PlayStation® Now.
Gaming headsets are sold at major retailers such as Amazon, Best Buy, GameStop, Target and Walmart. Brick and mortar retailers often have kiosks that allow shoppers to try the headsets and experience each headset’s specific fit, feel, and overall audio quality.
Business Strategy
We intend to further build upon Turtle Beach’s brand awareness, superior audio technology and high-quality products to grow the core console business, as well as continue to advance our personal computer casual gaming business to increase sales and profitability. The Company's strategy focuses on the following:
4


• | Continue to Advance Our Brand. We believe that our brand’s image among consumers is a competitive advantage, and that our success is attributable to our emphasis on delivering the highest quality, most innovative headsets. 

To maintain our competitive position in our markets we are focused on the following:

• | continuing to deliver innovative, high quality gaming headsets that incorporate advanced audio and wireless technology, while delivering a superior game and chat audio experience and unmatched comfort;


• | maintaining our strategic relationships, and continuing investments in eSports partnerships, which we believe provide our brand a larger presence with consumers and create opportunities for retailers to carry our products;


• | leveraging high-quality technical support/customer service to exceed consumer expectations and develop brand loyalty.


• | Expand Our Product Lines. We continue to invest in the resources necessary to maintain and expand our technical capability to manufacture multiple product lines that incorporate the latest technologies. In 2018, we expanded the gaming headset portfolio with the launch of the Atlas line of PC gaming headsets: the Atlas Elite, Atlas One and Atlas Three. 


• | Grow Revenue in New Markets. We intend to increase our sales by continuing to develop internally, or through potential joint venture, partnership or acquisition, products that we offer to our customers with an enhanced focus on growth in the personal computer gaming sector. 

Intellectual Property
We operate in an industry where innovation, investment in new ideas, and protection of resulting intellectual property rights are critical to success. We have a substantial base of intellectual property assets to protect our current and future product development, such as key innovations in gaming headsets as well as all of the core technology areas behind HyperSound, and intend to vigorously enforce such rights.
As a third-party gaming headset company, certain technology used in the new generation of consoles requires a license to enable products to connect to that platform. While Playstation®4 does not require any license to produce headsets that can connect, certain connections on the Xbox One require the purchase of proprietary chips to integrate into the locked chat audio. The Company currently has the necessary licenses, or can obtain the necessary licenses to produce compatible products.
Supply Chain and Operations
We have a global network of suppliers that manufacture products to meet our quality standards and cost objectives sought by our customers. We have worked closely with component, manufacturing and global logistic partners to build a supply chain that we consider predictable, scalable and consistent to provide high-quality, reliable products and leading cost management practices. The use of outsourced manufacturing facilities is designed to take advantage of specific expertise and allow for flexibility and scalability to respond to both seasonality and changing demands for our products.
In anticipation of new product development and incremental growth, we made additional investments with a focus on making advancements to our planning systems. In connection with our initiative to improve our operating efficiency and reduce costs, we have continued efforts to focus on company-wide overhead reduction activities including right-sizing our supply chain and the consolidation of certain warehouses with our global logistics partners.
We believe we have solid relationships with our suppliers and that, subject to the discussion in “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources,” we will continue to have a sufficient supply of quality products on satisfactory terms.
Retail Distribution
Our headsets are sold in over 40 countries by retailers such as Amazon, Argos, Best Buy, GAME, GameStop, EB Games, Target and Walmart. We often have a broader assortment and more shelf space than competitors at video game and electronics retailers such as GameStop and Best Buy, which we believe reinforces the brand’s authenticity with gaming enthusiasts, and our presence in mass channel retailers such as Walmart and Target enables the brand to reach a wider audience of casual gamers. Our established presence on Amazon and other online retail sites, and positive consumer product ratings on those sites, increases the search visibility of our products and helps to influence both online and in-store sales.
TB Europe serves as a primary sales office for the European market, and has strengthened our international operations with support for sales, marketing, customer service and distribution.

TurtleBeach.com is an important focal point for our marketing efforts serving as a destination for paid and earned media. Earned media is favorable publicity gained through promotional efforts other than advertising, as compared with paid media, which refers to publicity gained through advertising. The website acts as a hub for both online and offline activity, and provides a direct sales channel for new and refurbished products.
Customers
The following tables show net revenues by product type:

 | December 31,

In 2018, net sales to our major market channels consisted of $183.9 million to North American retail customers, $64.8 million to European customers, $25.3 million to North American distributors and $13.4 million to other customers.
Our three largest individual customers accounted for approximately 44% of our gross sales in 2018, 43% of our gross sales in 2017, and 49% of our gross sales in 2016. During 2018, our four largest customers - Walmart, Game Stop, Best Buy and Target - each accounted for between 11% to 19% of our consolidated net sales.
Seasonality
Our gaming headset business is seasonal with a significant portion of sales and profits typically occurring around the holiday period. Historically, more than 45% of headset business revenues are generated during the period from September through December as new headsets are introduced and consumers engage in holiday shopping. In addition, launches of major new online multiplayer games, and specific retailer purchasing behavior, can drive significant revenue shifts between months and quarters in a given year.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, Turtle Beach had 154 employees, of which 136 were full-time salaried employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We believe that our relationship with our employees is good.
