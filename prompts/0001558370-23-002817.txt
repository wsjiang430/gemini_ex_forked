Item 1. Business.
​
Consolidated Communications Holdings, Inc. is a Delaware holding company with operating subsidiaries that provide a wide range of communication solutions to consumer, commercial and carrier channels across a service area in over 20 states. We were founded in 1894 as the Mattoon Telephone Company. After several acquisitions, the Mattoon Telephone Company was incorporated as the Illinois Consolidated Telephone Company in 1924. We were incorporated under the laws of Delaware in 2002, and through our predecessors, we have been providing communication services in many of the communities we serve for more than 125 years.
​
In addition to our focus on organic growth, we have achieved business growth and a diversification of revenue and cash flow streams through our acquisitions over a 15-year period from 2002 to 2017 that have created a strong platform and expanded network for future expansion. Through this strategic expansion, we have positioned our business to provide competitive services in rural, suburban and metropolitan markets spanning the country. Marking a pivotal moment for Consolidated, in 2020, we entered into a strategic investment with an affiliate of Searchlight Capital Partners L.P. (“Searchlight”) and also completed a global debt refinancing, which in combination provided us with greater flexibility to support our fiber expansion and growth plans. The strategic investment offered an immediate capital infusion, delivering significant benefits to the customers and communities we serve, and creating a stronger company that is well-positioned to further expand and grow broadband services to meet ever-evolving customer needs.
​
Description of Our Business
​
Consolidated is a broadband and business communications provider offering a wide range of communication solutions to consumer, commercial and carrier customers by leveraging our advanced fiber network, which spans approximately 57,800 fiber route miles across many rural areas and metro communities. We offer residential high-speed Internet, video, phone and home security services as well as multi-service residential and small business bundles. Our business product suite includes: data and Internet solutions, voice, data center services, security services, managed and IT services, and an expanded suite of cloud services. We provide wholesale solutions to wireless and wireline carriers and other service providers including data, voice, network connections and custom fiber builds and last mile connections. Consolidated is dedicated to moving people, businesses and communities forward by delivering the most reliable fiber communications solutions. 
​
We generate the majority of our consolidated operating revenues primarily from monthly subscriptions to our broadband, data and transport services (collectively “broadband services”) marketed to residential and business customers. As consumer demands for bandwidth continue to increase, our focus is on expanding our fiber broadband services and

upgrading data speeds in order to offer a highly competitive fiber product. Our investment in more competitive broadband speeds is critical to our long-term success. With the initial investment from Searchlight and the concurrent debt refinancing in 2020, we launched our largest-ever fiber infrastructure project in 2021 with the goal of upgrading approximately 1.6 million residential and small business premises to fiber-to-the-home/premise (“FTTP”) over six years, enabling multi-Gig symmetrical speeds. The fiber network investments will be made across eight states, including more than 1 million passings within our northern New England service areas. During the years ended 2022 and 2021, we upgraded approximately 403,000 and 330,000 homes and small businesses, respectively, and in 2021, we launched Fidium Fiber, our new Gigabit consumer fiber internet product. We plan to upgrade at least 225,000 passings in 2023 and expand Fidium Fiber further into our footprint as well as to small business customers. By leveraging our existing dense core fiber network and an accelerated build plan, we will be able to significantly increase broadband speeds, expand our multi-Gig coverage and strategically extend our network across our strong existing commercial and carrier footprint to attract more on-net and near-net opportunities. As we invest in network upgrades, we believe we will see stable-to-improved trends in revenue growth and increased broadband penetration. We believe these fiber investments will help us future-proof our network and facilitate the continued transformation of Consolidated into a leading super-regional fiber communications service provider.
​
Searchlight is a strategic partner in our execution of this investment and brings a differentiated perspective to our broadband-first strategy. They are an experienced broadband and fiber infrastructure investor and they bring significant experience investing in FTTP and broadband expansion. Through our partnership with Searchlight, we have and will continue to pursue targeted investments in our business and future growth opportunities as we transform our company into a leading broadband and solutions provider and create long-term value for our investors, customers and employees.

We completed the sale of substantially all of the assets of our non-core, rural ILEC business located in Ohio (the “Ohio operations”) and our business located in the Kansas City market (the “Kansas City operations”) on January 31, 2022 and November 30, 2022, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2021, operating revenues for the Ohio operations and the Kansas City operations were $8.9 million and $51.3 million, or 0.7% and 4.0% of consolidated operating revenues, respectively. The sale of substantially all of the net assets of our Kansas City operations and Ohio operations resulted in a reduction of approximately 3,325 fiber consumer data connections, 14,505 DSL/Copper consumer data connections and 14,800 video connections in 2022. Prior period amounts have not been adjusted to reflect the sales.
​
The telecommunications industry continues to experience increased competition as a result of technology changes, new and emerging providers, and legislative and regulatory developments. Our focus is on expanding our fiber broadband services and upgrading data speeds in order to offer a highly competitive fiber product. We expect our broadband services revenue to continue to grow as we make increased investments in our fiber infrastructure and consumer demand for data-based services and faster speeds increases. In addition, we continue to focus on commercial growth opportunities and are continually expanding our commercial product offerings for small, medium and large businesses to capitalize on industry technological advances. The expected growth in fiber broadband services will mitigate, in part, the anticipated declines in traditional voice services impacted by the ongoing industry-wide reduction in access lines.

Consumer 
​
Broadband Services 
​
Broadband services include revenues from residential customers for subscriptions to our data products. We offer high-speed Internet access at speeds of up to 2 Gbps, depending on the network facilities that are available, the level of service selected and the location.  Our data service plans also include wireless internet access, email and internet security and protection. Our fiber internet product offers symmetrical speeds from 50 Mbps to 2 Gbps over the latest WiFi 6 technology with no data caps. Customers have the ability to view and manage their WiFi network through our Attune WiFi app, which enables customers to create individual profiles, turn on parental controls, manage devices and provide guest access. Our Voice over Internet Protocol (“VoIP”) digital phone service is also available in certain markets as an alternative to the traditional telephone line. We offer multiple voice service plans with options for unlimited local and long distance calls and customizable calling features and voicemail including voicemail to email options. 
​
Video Services 
​
Depending on geographic market availability, our video services range from limited basic service to advanced digital television, which includes several plans, each with hundreds of local, national and music channels including premium and Pay-Per-View channels as well as video on-demand service.  Certain customers may also subscribe to our advanced video services, which consist of high-definition television, digital video recorders (“DVR”) and/or a whole home DVR. Our Whole Home DVR allows customers the ability to watch recorded shows on any television in the home, record multiple shows simultaneously and utilize an intuitive on-screen guide and user interface. Our video subscribers can also watch their favorite shows, movies and livestreams on any device. In addition, we offer several on-demand streaming TV services, which provide endless entertainment options. As the consumer demand for streaming services increases, we continue to de-emphasize our linear video services and transition customers to streaming TV packages offered through our streaming partnerships.
​
Voice Services 
​
We offer several different basic local phone service packages and long-distance calling plans, including unlimited flat-rate calling plans. The plans include options for voicemail and other custom calling features such as caller ID, call forwarding and call waiting. The number of local access lines in service directly affects the recurring revenue we generate from end users and continues to be impacted by the industry-wide decline in access lines.  We expect to continue to experience erosion in voice connections due to competition from alternative technologies, including our own competing VoIP product.
 ​
Commercial
​
Data Services
​
We provide a variety of business communication solutions to commercial customers of all sizes, including voice and data services over our advanced fiber network. The services we offer include scalable high-speed broadband Internet access, SIP trunking and VoIP phone services, which range from basic service plans to virtual hosted systems. Our hosted VoIP package utilizes soft switching technology and enables our customers to have the flexibility of employing new telephone advances and features without investing in a new telephone system. The package bundles local service, calling features, Internet protocol (“IP”) business telephones and unified messaging, which integrates multiple messaging technologies into a single system and allows the customer to receive and listen to voice messages through email.
​
In addition to Internet and VoIP services, we also offer a variety of commercial data connectivity services in select markets including Ethernet services; private line data services; software defined wide area network (“SD-WAN”), a software-based network technology that provides a simplified management and automation of wide area network connections; and multi-protocol label switching. Our networking services include point-to-point and multi-point deployments from 2.5 Mbps to 10 Gbps to accommodate the growth patterns of our business customers.  We offer a suite of cloud-based services, which includes a hosted unified communications solution that replaces the customer’s on-site phone systems and data networks, managed network security services and data protection services. Data center and disaster recovery solutions provide a reliable and local colocation option for commercial customers.

Voice Services 
​
Voice services include basic local phone and long-distance service packages for business customers. The plans include options for voicemail, conference calling, linking multiple office locations and other custom calling features such as caller ID, call forwarding, speed dialing and call waiting. Services can be charged at a fixed monthly rate or a measured rate or can be bundled with selected services at a discounted rate.
 ​
Other 
​
Other services include business equipment sales and related hardware and maintenance support, video services and other miscellaneous revenues, including 911 service revenues. We are a full service 911 provider and have installed and currently maintain a turn-key, state of the art statewide next-generation emergency 911 system located in Maine. As of October 29, 2020, we were no longer the 911 service provider in Vermont. These systems have processed several million calls relying on the caller's location information for routing. Next-generation emergency 911 systems are an improvement over traditional 911 and are expected to provide the foundation to handle future communication modes such as texting and video.
​
Carrier 
​
We provide high-speed fiber data transmission services to regional and national interexchange and wireless carriers including Ethernet, cellular backhaul, dark fiber and colocation services. The demand for backhaul services continues to grow as wireless carriers are faced with escalating consumer and commercial demands for wireless data. Voice services include basic local phone service packages with customized features for resell by wholesale customers. The plans include options for voicemail, conference calling, linking multiple office locations and other custom calling features. 
​
Subsidies 
​
Subsidies consist of both federal and state funding designed to promote widely available, quality broadband services at affordable prices with higher data speeds in rural areas and for low-income consumers across the country. Some subsidies are funded by end user surcharges to which telecommunications providers, including local, long-distance and wireless carriers, contribute on a monthly basis, while others are components of broader economic stimulus or recovery legislation. Certain subsidies are allocated and distributed to participating carriers monthly based upon their respective costs for providing local service. In other cases, subsidies are awarded to carriers periodically over a predetermined number of years to support their deployment of high-speed broadband infrastructure in underserved or unserved areas. Similar to access charges, subsidies are regulated by the federal and state regulatory commissions. See Part I – Item 1 – “Regulatory Environment” below and Item 1A – “Risk Factors – Risks Related to the Regulation of Our Business” for further discussion regarding the subsidies we receive.
​
Network Access Services 
​
Network access services include interstate and intrastate switched access, network special access and end user access.  Switched access revenues include access services to other communications carriers to terminate or originate long-distance calls on our network.  Special access circuits provide dedicated lines and trunks to business customers and interexchange carriers.  Certain of our network access revenues are based on rates set or approved by the federal and state regulatory commissions or as directed by law that are subject to change at any time.
​
Other Products and Services
​
Other products and services include revenues from telephone directory publishing, video advertising, billing and support services and other miscellaneous revenues such as revenue from our Public Private Partnership arrangements. We have entered into numerous Public Private Partnership agreements with several towns in New Hampshire to build new FTTP Internet networks. The new town networks provide multi-gigabit broadband speeds to residential and commercial customers. Public Private Partnerships are a key component of Consolidated’s commitment to expand rural broadband access.

Wireless Partnerships
​
In addition to our core business, we derived a portion of our cash flow and earnings from investments in five wireless partnerships: Mobilnet South Partnership, RSA #17, Pittsburgh SMSA, RSA 6(I) and RSA 6(II). Cellco is the general partner for each of the five cellular partnerships. Cellco is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Verizon Communications Inc. As the general partner, Cellco is responsible for managing the operations of each partnership.
​
On September 13, 2022, we completed the sale of all of our limited partnership interests in the five wireless partnerships to Cellco for an aggregate purchase price of $490.0 million, other than a portion of the interest in one of the partnerships which was sold to a limited partner of such partnership pursuant to its right of first refusal. We intend to use the proceeds from the sale to support our fiber expansion plan. The financial results of the limited partnership interests have been reported as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented. Prior to classification as discontinued operations, wireless partnership investment income was included as a component of other income in the consolidated statements of operations. 
​
We owned 2.34% of the Mobilnet South Partnership. The principal activity of the Mobilnet South Partnership is providing cellular service in the Houston, Galveston and Beaumont, Texas metropolitan areas. We accounted for this investment at our initial cost less any impairment because fair value was not readily available for this investment. Income was recognized only upon cash distributions of our proportionate earnings in the partnership.
​
We owned 20.51% of RSA #17, which serves areas in and around Conroe, Texas. This investment was accounted for under the equity method. Income was recognized on our proportionate share of earnings and cash distributions were recorded as a reduction in our investment.
​
We owned 3.60% of Pittsburgh SMSA, 16.67% of RSA 6(I) and 23.67% of RSA 6(II). These partnerships cover territories that almost entirely overlap the markets served by our Pennsylvania Incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (“ILEC”) and Competitive Local Exchange Carrier operations. Because of our limited influence over Pittsburgh SMSA, we accounted for this investment at our initial cost less any impairment because fair value was not readily available for this investment. RSA 6(I) and RSA 6(II) were accounted for under the equity method.
​
For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recognized income of $23.5 million, $41.8 million and $40.7 million, respectively, and received cash distributions of $29.2 million, $43.0 million and $41.5 million, respectively, from these wireless partnerships.
​
Network Architecture and Technology
​
We have made significant investments in our telecommunications networks and continue to enhance and expand our network by deploying technologies to provide additional capacity to our customers. As a result, we are able to deliver high-quality, reliable data, video and voice services in the markets we serve. Our wide-ranging network and extensive use of fiber provide an easy reach into existing and new areas. By bringing the fiber network closer to the customer premise, we can increase our service offerings, quality and bandwidth. Our existing network enables us to efficiently respond and adapt to changes in technology and is capable of supporting the rising customer demand for bandwidth in order to support the growing amount of wireless data devices in our customers’ homes and businesses.
​
Our networks are supported by advanced 100% digital switches, with a core fiber network connecting all remote exchanges. We continue to enhance our copper network to increase bandwidth in order to provide additional products and services to our marketable homes. In addition to our copper plant enhancements, we have deployed fiber-optic cable extensively throughout our network, resulting in a 100% fiber backbone network that supports all of the inter-office and host-remote links, as well as the majority of business parks within our service areas. In addition, this fiber infrastructure provides the connectivity required to provide broadband and long-distance services to our residential and commercial customers. Our fiber network utilizes FTTP and fiber-to-the-node (“FTTN”) networks to offer bundled residential and commercial services. 
​
We operate advanced fiber networks which we own or have entered into long-term leases for fiber network access. At December 31, 2022, our fiber-optic network consisted of over 57,800 route-miles, which includes approximately 17,000 miles of FTTP deployments, approximately 22,000 route miles of fiber located in the northern New England area, approximately 3,950 miles of fiber network in Minnesota and surrounding areas, approximately 4,790 miles of fiber

network in Texas including parts of the greater Dallas/Fort Worth market, approximately 1,830 route-miles of fiber-optic facilities in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area, approximately 2,300 miles of fiber network in Illinois and approximately 1,150 route-miles of fiber optic facilities in California that cover large parts of the greater Sacramento metropolitan area. Our remaining network includes approximately 4,850 route-miles spanning across various states including portions of Alabama, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania and Washington. 
​
As of December 31, 2022, we passed more than 2.6 million homes and have direct fiber connections to 14,427 on-net commercial building locations. We intend to continue to make strategic enhancements to our network including improvements in overall network reliability and increases to our broadband speeds. We offer data speeds of up to 2 Gbps in select markets, and up to 100 Mbps in markets where 2 Gbps is not yet available, depending on the geographical region.  As part of our multi-year fiber build plan, we plan to extend fiber coverage enabling multi-Gig data speeds to over 70% of our passings by 2026. The upgrades will be made primarily across ten states including more than 1.1 million passings within the northern New England service areas to significantly enhance our broadband speeds. The ultimate total passings will be dependent upon, amongst other things, our ability to secure Public Private Partnership grant arrangement opportunities. Further network investments will enable us to continue to meet consumer demand for faster broadband speeds, symmetrical broadband and more bandwidth consumption as well as more effectively serve our commercial customers. 
​
Through our extensive fiber network, we also expect to be able to support the increased demand on wireless carriers for high-capacity transport services, and intend to also leverage our investments to grow commercial data services. In all the markets we serve, we have launched initiatives to support fiber backhaul services to cell sites. As of December 31, 2022, we had 3,805 cell sites in service and an additional 304 additional cell sites pending completion.

​
Business Strategies
​
Transform our Company into a dominant fiber, gigabit broadband provider
​
In 2020, in connection with the Searchlight investment, we announced plans to upgrade and expand our fiber network through a multi-year build plan with construction beginning in early 2021. The build plan includes the upgrade of approximately 1.6 million passings to fiber enabling multi Gigabit-capable services to over 70% of our passings by 2026. The ultimate total passings upgraded to fiber will be dependent upon, amongst other things, our ability to secure Public Private Partnership grant arrangement opportunities. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we built fiber to approximately 403,000 and 330,000 passings, respectively, enabling faster broadband speeds and in 2023, we plan to upgrade at least 225,000 locations. This marks the biggest fiber deployment project in our Company’s history. Our strategy is to meaningfully upgrade our residential and small business network in those service territories with a predominantly copper-based infrastructure to a FTTP network. Of the planned upgrades, we expect that more than 1.1 million passings will be upgraded within the northern New England service areas. We believe that the upgraded network will be capable of providing up to 10 Gbps of symmetrical broadband, which we believe will make us the only broadband provider in these markets capable of delivering 10 Gbps symmetrical broadband to consumers. In addition to best-in-class upload and download speeds, we believe the resulting network will offer better reliability, improved speed consistency, and a lower operating cost relative to competing broadband network technologies. Given these benefits, we believe that our fiber deployment strategy will allow us to realize meaningful improvements in average revenue per user (“ARPU”), broadband subscriber penetration and customer retention. 
Continue to grow and invest in commercial and carrier services
​
Our commercial and carrier strategy is built on leveraging our dense fiber network in key markets to offer IP-based products and services to our small and medium-sized business (“SMB”), enterprise and carrier customers. We will continue transitioning our customer base away from legacy TDM-based products to fiber and IP-based data and transport services, where we see significant opportunity to increase market share in our footprint. We will also make strategic network investments in both existing markets and edge-out locations to enhance our footprint and increase on-net and near-net opportunities. These builds will be focused on projects with high revenue visibility and attractive payback periods. Our carrier strategy entails leveraging our dense fiber network and long-term relationships in key markets to expand our carrier partnerships and grow small cell and fiber-to-the-tower connections. Investing not just in the network, but in these customer relationships, has been core to our success. Our growth strategy is also supported by the continuous evolution of our product offerings. We are regularly developing and enhancing our suite of managed and cloud services, increasing efficiency and enabling greater scalability and reliability for our business customers. We believe that by developing and investing in next-generation fiber-based products, we will be able to further support our customer needs for networking, communications, and collaboration services. 
Improve the overall customer experience
​
We continue to evaluate our operations in order to improve and enhance the overall customer experience for all customers. In conjunction with the multi-year fiber build plan, we also expect to make significant investments in our back-office infrastructure. We expect our full transformation to occur over a multi-year period. Our planned enhancements include an improved customer portal where customers can manage all aspects of their service. We plan to launch expanded e-commerce, omnichannel customer service and self-service capabilities for all customer groups. We believe that our digital transformation projects will improve our order and install processes making the transition to our services more seamless than ever. Our sales process is also being redesigned in order to provide personalized sales channels and a dedicated care team for our fiber customers. We have a culture of delivering the highest quality customer service experience possible and plan to continue to make investments in our platforms in order to create a truly differentiated customer experience.

​
Competition
​
The telecommunications industry is subject to extensive competition, which has increased significantly in recent years. Technological advances have expanded the types and uses of services and products available. In addition, changes in the regulatory and legislative environment applicable to comparable alternative services have lowered costs for these competitors. As a result, we face heightened competition but also have new opportunities to grow our broadband business. Our competitors vary by market and may include other incumbent and competitive local telephone companies; cable operators offering video, data and VoIP products; wireless carriers; long distance providers; satellite companies; Internet service providers, including fixed wireless Internet service providers (“WISPs”); online video providers; and in some cases new forms of providers that are able to offer a broad range of competitive services. We expect competition to remain a significant factor affecting our operating results and that the nature and extent of that competition will continue to increase in the future. See Part I - Item 1A – “Risk Factors – Risks Relating to Our Business.”
​
Depending on the market area, we compete against Comcast, Charter, AT&T, Mediacom, Armstrong, Optimum, First Light, NewWave Communications and a number of other carriers, in both the commercial and consumer markets. Our competitors offer traditional telecommunications services as well as IP-based services and other emerging data-based services. Our competitors continue to add features and adopt aggressive pricing and packaging for services comparable to the services we offer. 
​
We continue to face competition from cable, wireless and other fiber data providers as the demand for substitute communication services, such as wireless phones and data devices, continues to increase. Customers are increasingly foregoing traditional telephone services and land-based Internet service and relying exclusively on wireless service. Wireless companies are aggressively developing networks using next-generation data technologies, including 5G and beyond, in order to provide increasingly faster data speeds to their customers. A growing number of companies are also building and enhancing their fiber networks in order to provide 1 Gbps or multi Gigabit-capable broadband services within many of our service areas. Broadband-deployment funding initiatives from federal and state agencies, including federal infrastructure legislation enacted in 2021, may also result in other service providers deploying new subsidized fiber networks within our service territories. In addition, the expanded availability of free or lower cost services, such as video over the Internet, complimentary Wi-Fi service and other streaming devices have increased competition among other providers. In order to offer competitive services, we continue to invest in our network and business operations in order to offer new and enhanced services including faster broadband speeds and cloud-enabled services.
​
In our rural markets, services are more costly to provide than services in urban areas as a lower customer density necessitates higher capital expenditures on a per-customer basis. As a result, it may not be economically viable for new entrants to overlap existing networks in rural territories; however, federal and state funding initiatives may enable new entrants to deploy new subsidized networks in our rural markets. Despite the barriers to entry, rural telephone companies still face significant competition from wireless and video providers and, to a lesser extent, competitive telephone companies.
​
Our other lines of business are subject to substantial competition from local, regional and national competitors. In particular, our wholesale and transport business serves other interexchange carriers and we compete with a variety of service providers, including incumbent and competitive local telephone companies and other fiber data companies. These services are subject to additional competitive pressures from the development of new technologies, which may result in price compression as customers migrate from legacy data products to lower priced alternatives. For our business systems products, we compete with other equipment providers or value added resellers, network providers, incumbent and competitive local telephone companies, and with cloud and data hosting service providers.
​
We expect that competition across all of our customer channels will continue to intensify as new technologies develop and new competition emerges.
​
Human Capital Resources
​
As of December 31, 2022, we employed approximately 3,200 employees, including part-time employees. We also use temporary and contract employees in the normal course of our business. Approximately 49% of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements as of December 31, 2022. For a more detailed discussion regarding how the 

9




collective bargaining agreements could affect our business, see Part I - Item 1A – Risk Factors – “Risks Relating to Our Business.”
​
Compensation and Benefits
​
Our employees are the cornerstone of our success. We are committed to providing meaningful, challenging work and opportunities for professional growth in a positive environment. To attract and retain qualified and experienced employees, we offer competitive compensation and benefit packages, which we believe are competitive within the industry and the local markets in which we operate. Our benefit packages may include, among other items, incentive compensation based on the achievement of financial targets, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, a 401(k) savings plan with an employer match, paid time off, and wellness and employee assistance programs. Additionally, for certain eligible directors and employees, we provide long-term incentive compensation, in the form of restricted stock awards. In addition, we are committed to providing employees continuing education and training programs in order for employees to achieve career goals and professional growth.
​
Diversity and Inclusion
​
We embrace diversity and inclusion and seek to hire and retain high-quality employees of all backgrounds and experiences. Honoring our employees as individuals is key to our culture. We believe diversity of backgrounds contributes to different ideas, which in turn drives better results for customers. We respect differences and diversity as qualities that enhance our efforts as a team and believe embracing diversity and a culture of inclusion makes our company a better place to work. We believe in and support the principles incorporated in all anti-discrimination and equal employment laws. We offered leadership Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (“DEI”) training to senior leaders across the Company and our DEI Council, which we formed in 2021, meets regularly as part of an enhanced and comprehensive employee engagement initiative. Our employees complete training each year on discrimination and harassment prevention on topics that include ageism, anti-bullying and respect for people from other racial, ethnic and religious groups. We continue to expand our DEI initiatives and are actively working to help advance our diversity journey and build upon our practices on diversity, inclusion and fairness.
​
Safety, Health and Security
​
We also strive to create and provide a safe, healthful and secure workplace that is free from discrimination or harassment. Our workplace policies and procedures protect against behavior that creates an offensive, hostile, or intimidating work environment. Safety is top priority and we have a strong, ongoing commitment to ensure employees are properly trained and have appropriate safety and emergency equipment. 
​
Regulatory Environment
​
The following summary does not describe all existing and proposed legislation and regulations affecting the telecommunications industry. Regulation can change rapidly and ongoing proceedings and hearings could alter the manner in which the telecommunications industry operates. We cannot predict the outcome of any of these developments, nor their potential impact on us. See Part I – Item 1A – “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Regulation of Our Business”.
​
Overview
​
Our revenues, which include revenues from such telecommunications services as local telephone service, network access service and toll service are subject to broad federal and/or state regulations. The telecommunications industry is subject to extensive federal, state and local regulation.  Under the Communications Act of 1934 (the “Communications Act” and the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (the “Telecommunications Act”), federal and state regulators share responsibility for implementing and enforcing statutes and regulations designed to encourage competition and to preserve and advance widely available, quality telephone service at affordable prices. 

At the federal level, the FCC generally exercises jurisdiction over facilities and services of local exchange carriers, such as our rural telephone companies, to the extent they are used to provide, originate or terminate interstate or international communications.  The FCC has the authority to condition, modify, cancel, terminate or revoke our operating authority for failure to comply with applicable federal laws or FCC rules, regulations and policies.  Fines or penalties also may be imposed for any of these violations. 

10





State regulatory commissions generally exercise jurisdiction over carriers’ facilities and services to the extent they are used to provide, originate or terminate intrastate communications.  In particular, state regulatory agencies have substantial oversight over interconnection and network access by competitors of our rural telephone companies.  In addition, municipalities and other local government agencies regulate the public rights-of-way necessary to install and operate networks.  State regulators can sanction our rural telephone companies or revoke our certifications if we violate relevant laws or regulations. 
​
Federal Regulation
​
Our incumbent local exchange companies and competitive local exchange companies must comply with the Communications Act, which requires, among other things, that telecommunications carriers offer services at just and reasonable rates and on non-discriminatory terms and conditions. The 1996 amendments to the Communications Act (contained in the Telecommunications Act discussed below) dramatically changed, and likely will continue to change, the landscape of the industry.
​
Access Charges
​
On November 18, 2011, the FCC released its comprehensive order on inter-carrier compensation (“ICC”) and universal service reform (“Transformation Order”), which required terminating state access charges to mirror terminating interstate access charges, and as of July 1, 2013, all terminating switched intrastate access charges mirror interstate access charges. The access charge portion of the Transformation Order systematically reduced minute-of-use-based interstate access, intrastate access and reciprocal compensation rates over a six to nine-year period to an end state of “bill-and-keep,” in which each carrier recovers the costs of its network through charges to its own subscribers, rather than through ICC. The reductions apply to terminating access rates and usage, with originating access to be addressed by the FCC in a later proceeding. To help with the transition to bill-and-keep, the FCC created two subsidy mechanisms. The first is an Access Recovery Mechanism (“ARM”), which is funded from the Connect America Fund (“CAF”), and the second is an Access Recovery Charge (“ARC”), which is recovered from end users. 
​
The universal service portion of the Transformation Order redirected support from voice services to broadband services, and is now called the CAF. In December 2014, the FCC released a report and order that addressed, among other things, the transition to CAF Phase II funding for price cap carriers and the acceptance criteria for CAF Phase II funding. Companies are required to commit to a statewide build out requirement of 10 Mbps downstream and 1 Mbps upstream in funded locations. 
​
Our annual support through the FCC’s CAF Phase II funding was $48.1 million through 2021 as described below. The specific obligations associated with CAF Phase II funding included the obligation to serve approximately 124,500 locations by December 31, 2020 (with interim milestones of 40%, 60% and 80% completion by December 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively); to provide broadband service with speeds of 10 Mbps downstream and 1 Mbps upstream; to achieve latency of less than 100 milliseconds; to provide data of at least 100 gigabytes per month; and to offer pricing reasonably comparable to pricing in urban areas.  The Company met the buildout milestones and performance metrics requirements for 2017 through 2020 for all states where it received funding. 
​
In April 2019, the FCC announced plans for the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund (“RDOF”), the next phase of the CAF program. The RDOF is a $20.4 billion fund to bring speeds of 25 Mbps downstream and 3 Mbps upstream to unserved and underserved areas of America. The RDOF program prioritizes terrestrial broadband as a bridge to rural 5G networks by providing a significant weight advantage to traditional broadband providers. Funding will occur in two phases with the first phase auctioning $16.0 billion and the second phase (which is not certain to occur) auctioning $4.4 billion, each to be distributed over 10 years. The minimum speed required to receive funding is 25 Mbps downstream and 3 Mbps upstream. CAF Phase II funding was extended through December 31, 2021 for price cap holding companies. The FCC issued the final census block groups with locations and reserve price. We filed our RDOF short form application on July 14, 2020 and were listed as a qualified bidder by the FCC on October 13, 2020 and participated in the auction. The auction began on October 29, 2020 and ended on November 24, 2020. Consolidated won 246 census block groups serving in seven states. The bids we won are at the 1 Gbps downstream and 500 Mbps upstream speed tier to approximately 27,000 locations at an annual funding level of $5.9 million, beginning January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2031, which resulted in a reduction of approximately $42.2 million in annual support as of January 1, 2022. Consolidated filed its long form 

11




application with supporting documents on January 29, 2021 and received final FCC approval on December 14, 2021. Consolidated began receiving RDOF funding in January 2022.
​
Unbundled Network Element Rules
​
In 2019, the FCC issued two orders that eliminated certain obligations that require incumbent telecommunications carriers to lease Unbundled Network Element (“UNE”) to competitors. The first order addressed wholesale discounts on resold services and Voice Grade analog UNE loops and the second order (“Transport Order”), addressed UNE transport between competitive wire centers. Both orders provided a three-year transition period.
​
The Transport Order addresses two separate but related topics. One is the relief from transport UNEs and the other is to respond to a remand of the FCC’s Business Data Services (“BDS”) order. BDS were previously known as Special Access services. The FCC broadly deregulated BDS services in 2017. This decision was appealed and a U.S. Court of Appeals upheld the order but vacated the BDS transport relief because the Court decided that the FCC had not provided sufficient notice intended to deregulate all BDS transport services. On remand, the FCC addressed this issue in the same order used to provide forbearance relief on UNE transport. The FCC has signaled its intent to continue evaluating various aspects of its UNE and related resale rules, and to forbear from or otherwise modernize them where necessary in light of evolving market conditions.
​
In 2020, Consolidated renegotiated its Wholesale Performance Plans (“WPP”) in Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont to comply with the FCC’s UNE forbearance order issued in 2019.
​
Promotion of Universal Service
​
In general, telecommunications service in rural areas is costlier to provide than service in urban areas.  The lower customer density means that switching and other facilities serve fewer customers and loops are typically longer, requiring greater expenditures per customer to build and maintain.  By supporting the high cost of operations in rural markets, Universal Service Fund (“USF”) subsidies promote widely available, quality telephone service at affordable prices in rural areas.  Revenues from federal and certain states’ USFs totaled $33.4 million, $69.8 million and $72.0 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 
​
State Regulation
​
We are subject to regulation by state governments in the jurisdictions in which we operate. State regulatory commissions generally exercise jurisdiction over our provision of intrastate telecommunications services. In recent years, most states have reduced their regulation of ILECs, including our ILEC operations. Nonetheless, state regulatory commissions generally continue to (i) set the rates that telecommunication companies charge each other for exchanging traffic, (ii) administer support programs designed to subsidize the provision of services to high-cost rural areas, (iii) regulate the purchase and sale of ILECs, (iv) require ILECs to provide service under publicly-filed tariffs setting forth the terms, conditions and prices of regulated services, (v) regulate ILECs’ financing activities including their ability to borrow against and pledge their assets, (vi) regulate transactions between ILECs and their affiliates and (vii) impose various quality of service standards. In many states, BDS and switched interconnection services are subject to price regulation, although the extent of such regulation varies by type of service and geographic region.
​
We operate in states where traditional cost recovery mechanisms, including state USF, are under evaluation or have been modified. As states continue to assess their laws and implement various regulatory changes, there can be no assurance that these mechanisms will continue to provide us with the same level of cost recovery we historically have received.
​
Local Government Authorizations
​
In the various states we operate in, we operate under a structure in which municipalities and other local governmental authorities may impose various fees, such as for the privilege of originating and terminating messages and placing facilities within the relevant area, for obtaining permits for street opening and construction, and/or for operating franchises to install and expand fiber optic facilities. 
​

Regulation of Video and Internet Services
​
Video Services
​
Our cable television subsidiaries each require a state or local franchise or other similar authorization in order to provide cable television service to customers. Each of these subsidiaries is subject to regulation under Title VI of the Communications Act.
​
Under this framework, the responsibilities and obligations of franchising bodies and cable operators have been carefully defined. The law addresses such issues as the use of local streets and rights-of-way; the carriage of public, educational and governmental channels; the provision of channel space for leased commercial access; the amount and payment of franchise fees; consumer protection and similar issues. In addition, federal laws place limits on the common ownership of cable systems and competing multichannel video distribution systems, and on the common ownership of cable systems and local telephone systems in the same geographic area. Many such provisions of federal law have been implemented through FCC regulations. The FCC has expanded its oversight and regulation of certain aspects of the provision of cable television over time. For example, it has acted to assure that new competitors in the cable television business are able to gain access to potential customers and can also obtain licenses to carry certain types of video programming.
​
Internet Services
​
The provision of Internet access services is currently not significantly regulated by either the FCC or the state commissions (with the exception of the California Public Utilities Commission). The Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) has authority to regulate Internet Service Providers with respect to privacy and competitive practices. In 2017, the FCC adopted an order rescinding its previous classification of Internet service as a telecommunications service regulated under Title II of the Communications Act effectively limiting the FCC’s authority over Internet Service Providers. However, the FCC retained rules requiring Internet Service Providers to disclose practices associated with blocking, throttling and paid prioritization of Internet traffic. The FCC order was challenged in court and in 2019, a U.S. Court of Appeals upheld the FCC’s decision reclassifying Internet access services as an information service. However, the ruling invalidated the FCC’s decision that state regulators may not impose obligations similar to the federal network neutrality obligations. Several states have adopted rules similar to the network neutrality requirements that were eliminated by the FCC and new state legislation may be adopted in the future. 
​
The outcome of pending matters before the FCC and the FTC and any potential congressional action cannot be determined at this time but could lead to increased costs for the Company in connection with our provision of Internet services, and could affect our ability to compete in the markets we serve.
​
COVID-19 and Broadband Adoption Initiatives 
​
Federal and state governments have adopted initiatives to assist with the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and to provide funding programs to assist in the deployment of broadband in order to support access to high speed broadband services in underserved or unserved areas. The awards may include a number of regulatory requirements including the completion of construction by certain dates. We are evaluating each of these programs and expect to continue to pursue funding opportunities available to us. We cannot predict what funding we will receive, the ultimate requirements that will be adopted or the impact of these programs on our business.
​
Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act Funding
​
States received opportunities to use federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) funding to assist in the deployment of broadband to unserved and underserved areas within their respective states. In 2020, New Hampshire allocated $50.0 million of CARES Act funding to fund broadband expansion to unserved and underserved locations throughout the state. Consolidated was granted up to $3.5 million to build high-speed Internet networks for homes and businesses in New Hampshire for the towns of Danbury, Springfield and Mason. The state funded 10% upfront with the remainder received upon completion of projects in December 2020. 
​

American Rescue Plan Act Funding
​
President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (“ARPA”) on March 11, 2021. States have been allocated federal funds to be utilized for capital infrastructure, including broadband deployment, and are in various stages of implementation. We are working with the states and municipalities in which we operate, to participate in this broadband grant program.
​
COVID-19
​
On March 13, 2020, the FCC introduced the Keep Americans Connected pledge, which was in effect through June 30, 2020. The pledge asked all communications providers to not terminate service to any residential or small business customers because of their inability to pay their bills due to the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic; to waive any late fees that any residential or small business customers incur because of their economic circumstances related to the coronavirus pandemic; and to open their Wi-Fi hotspots to any American who needs them. Consolidated signed on to the pledge through June 30, 2020. Several states took the FCC pledge a step further by prohibiting carriers from disconnecting service within their state during the respective Governors’ declared states of emergency, which Consolidated also supported. Certain states such as Washington and New York were extended to July 31, 2021 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The state moratoriums on disconnections have since expired.
​
In February 2021, the FCC created the Emergency Broadband Benefit Program (“EBB”), a temporary program to help low income households stay connected during the COVID-19 pandemic by providing broadband service discounts for eligible households. Consolidated was a participant in this program. The EBB ended on December 31, 2021. EBB recipients fully enrolled as of December 31, 2021 automatically continued to receive their current monthly benefit until March 1, 2022, when the Affordable Connectivity Program took its place.
​
Affordable Connectivity Program 
​
The Affordable Connectivity Program (“ACP”) is a permanent broadband affordability program set up to replace the EBB. The ACP program helps ensure that households can afford the broadband they need for work, school, healthcare and more. The benefit provides a discount of up to $30 per month toward internet service for eligible households and up to $75 per month for households on qualifying Tribal lands. Eligible households can also receive a one-time discount of up to $100 to purchase a laptop, desktop computer, or tablet from participating providers if they contribute more than $10 and less than $50 toward the purchase price. The ACP is limited to one monthly service discount and one device discount per household. The program began distributing funds on March 1, 2022. Consolidated is participating in this program.
​
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act 
​
The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (“Infrastructure Act”) passed on March 31, 2021 included $65.0 billion to support broadband infrastructure deployment and access across the United States. The broadband internet portion of the Infrastructure Act is aimed at increasing internet coverage for more universal access, including for rural, low-income, and tribal communities. 65% of this funding is set aside specifically for underserved communities. Additionally, this measure is designed to help make internet access more affordable and increase digital literacy.
​
The Infrastructure Act set aside $42.5 billion for Broadband Equity, Access and Deployment grants (“BEAD”). The National Telecommunications and Information Administration administers the BEAD program and has awarded grants to jurisdictions across the country, which in turn will use the funding to support service providers’ broadband deployment and access initiatives. The FCC currently is undertaking a broadband availability and quality mapping project, the results of which may impact the ultimate distribution of BEAD funding.
