BUSINESS
 Overview
 CarGurus is a global, online automotive marketplace connecting buyers and sellers of new and used cars. Using proprietary technology, search algorithms, and innovative data analytics, we believe we are building the world’s most trusted and transparent automotive marketplace and creating a differentiated automotive search experience for consumers. Our trusted marketplace empowers users with unbiased third‑party validation on pricing and dealer reputation as well as other information that aids them in finding “Great Deals from Top-Rated Dealers.” Our selection of car listings provides the largest number of car listings available on any of the major U.S. online automotive marketplaces. In addition to the United States, we operate online marketplaces in Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy and Spain.
 A core principle of our marketplace is transparency. For consumers considering used vehicles, we aggregate vehicle inventory from dealers and apply our proprietary analysis to generate a Deal Rating as one of: Great Deal, Good Deal, Fair Deal, High Priced, or Overpriced. Deal Rating illustrates how competitive a listing is compared to similar cars sold in the same region in recent history. We determine Deal Rating principally on the basis of both our proprietary Instant Market Value, or IMV, algorithm, which determines the market value of any given vehicle in a local market, and Dealer Rating, a measure of a dealer’s reputation as determined by reviews of that dealer from our user community. By sorting organic search results based on a used car’s Deal Rating, we enable consumers to find the most relevant car for their needs. For new cars, we help our users understand deal quality by providing price analysis and our Dealer Rating. We also provide our users information historically not widely available, such as Price History, Time on Site, and Vehicle History. We believe this approach brings greater transparency, trust, and efficiency to a consumer’s car research and buying process, leading to higher engagement and a more informed consumer who is better prepared to purchase at the dealership.
 Our large, engaged, and predominantly mobile user base presents an attractive audience of in‑market consumers for our dealers. By connecting dealers with more informed consumers, we believe we provide dealers with an efficient customer acquisition channel and attractive returns on their marketing spend with us. Dealers can list their inventory in our marketplace for free with our Basic Listing product or with a paid subscription to our Enhanced and Featured Listing products. Dealers with our Basic Listing product receive anonymized email connections and access to a subset of the tools on our Dealer Dashboard at no cost. Dealers with a paid subscription receive connections with consumers that are not anonymous and can be made through a wider variety of methods, including phone calls, email, managed text and chat, links to the dealers’ website, and map directions to dealerships. Dealers with our Enhanced and Featured Listing products are able to display their dealer name, address, and dealership information on their listings to gain brand recognition, which promotes walk‑in traffic to the dealer. We also provide paying dealers with full access to our Dealer Dashboard, including inventory pricing tools informed by real‑time market conditions, which helps them more effectively price, merchandise, and sell their cars. Our success with dealers is evidenced by the number of paying dealers in our U.S. marketplace. Our U.S. marketplace had 27,534 paying dealers as of December 31, 2018 compared to 25,122 and 20,349 as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.
 Our scaled online marketplace model drives powerful network effects. The industry‑leading inventory selection offered by our dealers attracts a large and engaged consumer audience. The value of robust connections to this audience incentivizes dealers to purchase our Enhanced or Featured Listing products. Having more paying dealers provides consumers with more dealer information and methods to contact them. More consumers and connections drive greater value to paying dealers on our platform. Driven by these network effects, we continue to amass more data, which we use to continuously improve our search algorithms, the accuracy of Deal Ratings, our user experience, and, ultimately, the quality of the connections between consumers and dealers.
 We generate marketplace subscription revenue from dealers through subscriptions to our products including our Listing (which includes features and enhancements such as Delivery), Dealer Display, Dealer Search Engine Marketing, Social Media Advertising, and Retargeting products. We also generate advertising and other revenue from auto manufacturers and other auto‑related brand advertisers. Our rapid revenue growth and financial performance over the last several years exemplifies the strength of our marketplace. We generated revenue of $454.1 million in 2018, $316.9 million in 2017, and $198.1 million in 2016, representing year-over-year increases of 43% in 2018 and 60% in 2017. In 2018, we generated net income of $65.2 million and our Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $49.0 million, compared to net income of $13.2 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $24.1 million in 2017 and net income of $6.5 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $11.0 million in 2016. See “Selected Consolidated Financial Data — Adjusted EBITDA” for more information regarding our use of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to our net income (loss).

Consumer Challenges
 Upon determining what type of car to purchase, consumers face many questions:
  
• | Which dealer has a car like this?
--+----------------------------------


• | What is a fair price for this particular type of car?
--+------------------------------------------------------


• | Have others had a good experience buying from this dealer?
--+-----------------------------------------------------------

 In answering these questions, consumers historically had limited access to unbiased information on specific vehicles, car pricing, and dealer reputation. Every used car is unique, and so for consumers searching for used cars, it is difficult to aggregate the relevant inventory of available cars across dealers, a difficulty exacerbated by the lack of consistency in the way that dealers characterize a car’s attributes. Generally, dealers had more information about car prices than consumers did, as consumers had limited resources and tools to determine an appropriate price. Selecting the right dealer was also challenging for consumers as dealer reputations were historically based primarily on word‑of‑mouth. The lack of clear, unbiased, transparent information made it difficult for consumers to effectively compare vehicles, find the vehicle that best suited their needs and transact with well-regarded dealers.
 Dealer Challenges
 The economics of dealerships depend largely on sales volume, gross margin, and customer acquisition efficiency. To achieve a high return on their marketing investments, dealers must find in‑market consumers; yet because car purchases are infrequent, only a small percentage of consumers are shopping for a car at any given point in time. Traditional marketing channels, including television, radio, and newspaper, can effectively target locally but are inefficient in reaching the small percentage of consumers who are actively in the market to buy a car. In addition, used car pricing is fluid because it is based on rapidly shifting supply and demand dynamics. Dealers need to find ways to manage constantly changing inventory and adjust pricing strategies to adapt to frequently changing market conditions.
Our Strengths
 We believe that our competitive advantages are based on the following key strengths:
 Trusted Marketplace for Consumers.  We provide consumers with unbiased information, intuitive search results, and other tools that empower them to find “Great Deals from Top-Rated Dealers.” We offer the largest online selection of new and used car listings of any major U.S. online automotive marketplace. We aggregate and analyze these listings using proprietary technology and data along with innovative data analytics to create a differentiated automotive search experience for consumers. We believe that providing a transparent consumer experience with unbiased information has instilled greater trust in us among our users, helping us become the most visited online automotive marketplace in the United States according to Comscore. In 2018, we experienced over 91.8 million average monthly sessions in the United States. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Key Business Metrics” for how we define average monthly sessions. We believe this user traffic, an indicator of consumer satisfaction and engagement, is critical to our marketplace success and will continue to strengthen our market position.
 Proprietary Search Algorithms and Data‑Driven Approach.  We have built an extensive repository of data on cars, prices, dealers, and the interactions between consumers and dealers that is the result of over eight years of data aggregation and regression modeling. Our proprietary search algorithms and data analytics allow us to use this valuable data to bring greater transparency to our platform. The primary product of this analysis is our determination of a used car’s IMV, which, in addition to Dealer Rating, drives our Deal Rating. We calculate IMV by applying more than 20 ranking signals and more than 100 normalization rules to millions of data points, including the make, model, trim, features, condition, history, geographic location, and mileage of the car. The growing volume of connections between consumers and dealers on our platform allows us to continually improve the accuracy of our IMV, Dealer Ratings, and used car search results sorted by Deal Rating. We apply the knowledge gained from analyzing this ever‑growing data set to build new features for our consumers and products for our dealers and to more efficiently launch marketplaces in new countries.

Strong Value Proposition to Dealers.  We believe that our marketplace offers an efficient customer acquisition channel for dealers, helping them achieve attractive returns on their marketing spend with us. We provide our dealer base with connections to prospective car buyers; most of these connections have historically been for used cars. We define connections as interactions between consumers and dealers in our marketplace through phone calls, email, managed text and chat, and clicks to access the dealer’s website or map directions to the dealership. We provide all dealers with tools that are informed by real‑time market conditions that help them merchandise and sell their cars, and our paying dealers get access to additional valuable information from our Pricing Tool and Market Analysis tool. Our strong value proposition to the dealer community is evidenced by our 23% growth in average annual revenue per subscribing dealer, or AARSD, in the United States in 2018 compared to 2017.
 Network Effects Driven by Scale.  Having engaged with the majority of dealers and built one of the largest consumer audiences among automotive marketplaces in the United States, we believe that our scale creates powerful network effects that reinforce the competitive strength of our business model. Our large consumer audience increases our appeal to dealers and incentivizes more dealers to subscribe to our Enhanced or Featured Listing products to access the numerous benefits unavailable to non‑paying dealers. Having more paying dealers in our marketplace provides consumers with more dealer information and methods to contact those dealers. More consumers and connections drive greater value and a higher return to paying dealers’ marketing spend on our platform. Driven by these network effects, we continue to amass more data, which we use to further strengthen our search algorithms, the utility of analysis complementing each listing, the quality of our user experience, and the value of connections between consumers and dealers.
 Attractive Financial Model.  We have a strong track record of revenue growth, profitability, and capital efficiency. We generated revenue of $454.1 million in 2018, $316.9 million in 2017, and $198.1 million in 2016, representing year-over-year increases of 43% in 2018 and 60% in 2017.  A significant portion of our revenue is recurring due to the subscription nature of our products. In 2018, 2017, and 2016, dealer marketplace Listing and Dealer Display advertising subscription revenue, and Search Engine Marketing, Social Media Advertising and Retargeting, which we consider to be recurring revenue, comprised 89%, 89% and 86% of total revenue, respectively. Furthermore, our revenue base is highly diversified due to the fragmented nature of the automotive dealer industry. We also have been able to grow and invest in our future growth while improving profitability due to the operating leverage in our business model. On a consolidated basis, while our revenue grew 43% in 2018 and 60% in 2017, our Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded to 11% in 2018 from 8% in 2017 and from 6% in 2016. In the United States, which is our most developed market, we grew our revenue by 42% in 2018 and 57% in 2017 while increasing our income from operations to $58.4 million in 2018 from $41.6 million in 2017 and $27.5 million in 2016.
 Founder‑Led Management Team with Culture of Innovation.  Our founder, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, Langley Steinert, co‑founded and was previously chairman of TripAdvisor, an online marketplace for travel‑related content based on the mission of using technology and a data‑driven approach to provide transparency for consumers’ travel planning. Led by Mr. Steinert and a management team with extensive experience guiding technology companies in evolving industries, we bring the same commitment to fostering a culture of innovation and delivering data-driven transparency to the automotive market. 
 Our Products
 Consumer Marketplace
 We provide consumers an online automotive marketplace where they can search for new and used car listings from our dealers, as well as sell their car in our U.S. marketplace. Through our marketplace, we provide consumers with information that helps them find the most relevant car for their needs. A user accesses our U.S. marketplace through our desktop or mobile‑optimized website at cargurus.com or by using our mobile applications. Most users specify whether they are searching for used, certified pre‑owned, or new cars and then provide their desired vehicle make and model and their zip code.
 Used and Certified Pre‑Owned Cars
 Using our proprietary search algorithms, we immediately display the search results, ranked by Deal Rating, on a search results page, or SRP. Nearly every used car listing in our marketplace is assigned one of five Deal Ratings: Great Deal, Good Deal, Fair Deal, High Priced, or Overpriced. Deal Rating illustrates how competitive a listing is compared to similar cars sold in the same region in recent history. A listing’s Deal Rating is based primarily upon the IMV of the vehicle and the Dealer Rating of the dealer.

Instant Market Value.  IMV is a proprietary algorithm that determines the market value of a used vehicle in a local market and is a key input for determining a vehicle’s Deal Rating. The IMV algorithm is the product of over eight years of regression modeling utilizing more than seven million used car data points. IMV takes into account a number of factors, including comparable currently listed and previously sold used cars in the local market and vehicle details including make, model, trim, year, mileage, options, and vehicle history. Our algorithm uses more than 20 ranking signals and more than 100 normalization rules that distill unstructured data from hundreds of sources across thousands of dealers.
 Dealer Ratings.  Dealer Ratings are derived from user‑generated content from our users’ experiences with dealers with whom they have connected. To promote high‑quality reviews, we require that a user have interacted with the dealer on our site to submit a review. We believe this requirement, together with additional qualification standards, results in a more valuable Dealer Rating. Dealer Rating is an important component of a listing’s Deal Rating and as a result can impact the organic search position of a listing.
 Search Results Page.  In addition to each car’s Deal Rating, our SRP provides users with other useful information, including the difference between the listing price and the IMV that we have determined for the car, Time on Site, mileage, Dealer Rating, and, for paying dealers, dealer location. We provide in‑depth search filters, including price, mileage, trim, color, options, condition, body style, miles per gallon, seating capacity, vehicle ownership and usage history, seller type, and days on market, among others, which we believe deliver the most comprehensive search capability among major U.S. online automotive marketplaces. We also provide our users with additional features to aid their search, including similar vehicle recommendations, side‑by‑side vehicle comparisons, expert reviews, and user rankings. Our platform also gives users the ability to save searches and receive alerts that keep them informed of relevant developments in the market, including newly available inventory and price changes to cars they are monitoring.
 Vehicle Detail Page.  If a user clicks on one of the listings on the SRP, the user is taken to that listing’s vehicle detail page, or VDP. VDPs are designed to provide extensive photos and a comprehensive description of the vehicle, dealer name, address, and dealership information for paying dealers, detailed dealer reviews, methods to contact the dealer for paying dealers, payment calculators, and helpful information about the vehicle, including:

• | Price History. Changes to a vehicle’s price on our site. We also offer price change alerts to consumers on searches they have saved, which allow them to respond quickly to changes in the market. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Time on Site. Length of time a vehicle has been on our site and how many users have saved the vehicle to their list of favorite listings, indicators of the likely demand for the car. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Vehicle History. Title check, accident check, number of owners, and fleet status of the vehicle, giving consumers data that helps them better understand the car’s condition. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New Cars
 Search results for new car listings are sorted by price of inventory matching the user’s search, with the lowest priced listings sorted first. Our new car VDPs include our Dealer Rating and many of the other features of our used car listings, such as Price History and Time on Site. Deal Rating is not applicable to new car listings because it utilizes data not relevant to new cars. Instead, we analyze data on manufacturers’ suggested retail prices, or MSRPs, and recent sales of similar new vehicles, accounting for trade-ins, incentives, and other factors that can affect the price of a new car, to provide users with comparative price information.
Sell My Car
 We also allow our consumer users to list their cars for free in our marketplace. Our Sell My Car offering enables individual car owners to easily merchandise their vehicles, determine an appropriate selling price with our proprietary price guidance, and manage their listings and communications with prospective buyers among our audience. We offer services to facilitate securing financing, processing payment, titling, and other aspects of the private-sale transaction. If a car is sold using these transaction-facilitation services, we collect a fee from the selling consumer.

Dealer Marketplace
 Our marketplace connects dealers to a large audience of informed and engaged consumers. We offer three types of marketplace Listing products to dealers: Basic Listing, which is free, and Enhanced or Featured Listing, each of which requires a paid subscription. We price our Enhanced and Featured Listing products as a monthly, quarterly, semiannual, or annual subscription based on the dealer’s inventory size, region, and our assessment of the return on investment, or ROI, our solution will provide them.

• | Basic Listing. Basic Listing allows non‑paying dealers to list their inventory in our marketplace anonymously. Consumers can contact these dealers only through an anonymous, CarGurus‑branded email address so the dealer does not receive any of the consumer’s personal contact information from our platform. We do not display the name, address, website URL, or phone number of any non-paying dealers on our websites. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Enhanced Listing. Enhanced Listing provides dealers with a higher volume and quality of connections to consumers. Dealers that subscribe to Enhanced Listing gain the opportunity to connect with consumers directly through email, phone, and managed text and chat. Our platform allows paying dealers to provide a link to their website, dealership branding and information such as name, address, and hours of operation, and map directions to their dealership on VDPs, helping consumers easily contact or visit them, which we believe results in increased local brand awareness and walk‑in traffic. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Featured Listing. A dealer that pays the premium subscription rate for our Featured Listing product receives all of the benefits of the Enhanced Listing product, as well as promotion of their Great Deal, Good Deal, and Fair Deal inventory in a clearly labeled section at the top of the search results page. This premium placement for Featured listings generates increased connection volume relative to Enhanced Listing. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dealer Dashboard
 Basic, Enhanced, and Featured Listing dealers all have access to the following Dealer Dashboard features and tools:
  
• | Performance Summary. Provides dealers with real‑time and historical data concerning the connections and consumer exposure they have received in our marketplace and through our digital marketing products. This enables dealers to analyze connections and SRP and VDP views at a granular level to inform the dealer’s sales and merchandising efforts. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Dealer Insights. Provides pricing analysis of the dealer’s inventory, as well as a summary of a vehicle’s missing information such as price, photos, or trim. This information helps dealers better merchandise their vehicles. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | User Review Management. Allows dealers to track and manage their dealership reviews from our users. Dealers can respond to users, report potentially fraudulent reviews, and publish positive reviews to social media platforms for broader exposure. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Enhanced and Featured Listing dealers also have access to the following additional features and tools:
  
• | Pricing Tool. Helps dealers evaluate the impact of pricing changes for each used vehicle in their inventory and the resulting impact on the car’s Deal Rating, empowering dealers to make informed pricing decisions based on market data in their local area. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Market Analysis. Informs dealers of local market trends in used cars, such as the most searched makes and models in their local market. This information helps dealers align with local consumer preferences and inform strategies for increasing inventory turnover and efficient vehicle acquisition. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dealer Digital Marketing and Customer Acquisition Products
 In addition to listing cars in our marketplace through our Listing products, we also provide all dealers with a web widget that allows them to place Deal Rating Badges, which show our Deal Rating for cars that have been rated as a Great Deal, Good Deal, or Fair Deal, on their own website. Our Deal Rating serves as trusted, third‑party validation on their website.
 We offer Enhanced and Featured Listing dealers the following additional advertising and customer acquisition products and enhancements:
  
• | Dealer Display. Dealers are able to buy display advertising that appears in our marketplace and on other sites on the internet to build brand awareness. Advertisements can be targeted by geography, search history, and a number of other targeting factors, allowing dealers to increase their visibility with relevant consumers and drive consumers to the dealer’s own website. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Dealer Search Engine Marketing, Social Media Advertising, and Retargeting. Leveraging the capabilities we have developed for our own algorithmic traffic acquisition, we offer a product that delivers search engine marketing, or SEM, social media advertising, and retargeting to programmatically drive qualified traffic to dealer websites. Utilizing algorithmic bidding strategies and automated keyword list management, we help dealers to optimize traffic acquisition. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Delivery. A dealer that pays for our Listings product can add a feature to expand the visibility of its inventory in the search results beyond its local market.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Auto Manufacturer and Other Advertiser Products
 Our platform offers auto manufacturers and others the ability to purchase display advertising on our site to execute targeted marketing strategies:
  
• | Brand Reinforcement. We allow auto manufacturers to buy advertising on our site and target consumers based on the make, model, and zip code of the cars that a specific consumer is searching for, in order to increase exposure to interested consumers. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Category Sponsorship. To address evolving priorities influenced by industry dynamics, seasonality, and other factors, we offer the ability to sponsor exclusively prominent high traffic pages on our site, such as the New Car front page, Used Car front page, and Research Center. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Automobile Segment Exclusivity. To support the introduction of new models or the success of existing models, we allow manufacturers to target specific automobile segments, such as SUV, sedan, hybrid, luxury, truck, and minivan. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Consumer Segment Exposure. Through our platform, auto manufacturers can target consumers both on our site and on third‑party sites based on various parameters, including estimated household income and vehicle specifications, such as make or model, and zip codes. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Marketing
 Our marketing initiatives aim to drive brand awareness and engagement among consumers and dealers and to position us as a trusted online automotive marketplace.
 Consumer Marketing
 We have built our audience on the strength of our user experience, and we remain focused on delivering an engaging consumer marketplace. The strength of the consumer experience that we offer is one of our most powerful marketing tools. By providing an intuitive search experience in our marketplace and relevant content, updates, and tools to consumers during their car search, we believe that the users who comprise our large and engaged audience provide informal endorsements to other consumers, more powerful than most marketing messages.
 7

Historically, our consumer marketing efforts have been focused primarily on algorithmic traffic acquisition. We employ a team of engineers and data scientists that optimizes our user acquisition through search engines, social media, and other digital marketing channels and has tested over 1 billion keywords on various search engines. We believe our expertise in this area constitutes a competitive advantage over less sophisticated competitors and those who outsource these capabilities.
 We augment our marketing efforts with brand‑building investments in broadcast media, such as television and online video. Our brand awareness is currently lower than many other major U.S. online automotive marketplaces in the United States, despite our large monthly audience and high user engagement. We believe that as a result of our trusted product, audience engagement, and relatively low brand awareness, we are well‑positioned to strengthen our brand by continuing to invest in broadcast media.
 Our vehicle listing data, on‑site user behavior, connections between consumers and dealers, and opinion data from our users create significant opportunities for us to develop and publish car shopping insights. We consistently gain earned media coverage in national, regional, and trade press outlets as well as social channels by leveraging our proprietary data to inform newsworthy content.
 Dealer Marketing
 The primary goals of our dealer marketing initiatives are to acquire dealers not yet in our marketplace, convert non‑paying dealers into paying dealers, retain our existing paying dealers, and expand annual subscription revenues from our paying dealers. Our dealer marketing efforts aim to:

• | Educate Dealers on the Quality of Our Audience and Attractive ROI. We educate dealers on our industry‑leading monthly visits, our strong user engagement, and the large number of connections that we facilitate through our marketplace. We also highlight to dealers how unique features of our platform, such as our intuitive user interface and our proprietary technology and data analytics, yield consumers that we believe are more informed and better prepared to purchase at the dealership, which can lead to a higher ROI for the dealers’ marketing spend. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Provide Best Practices to Assist Dealers in Becoming Successful in Our Marketplace. We provide ongoing communications through webinars, white papers, testimonials, and videos, which show dealers how to use our products to position their inventory for success on our platform. We maintain consistent communication with dealers by email and events to ensure awareness of recent product updates and provide custom account management. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Provide Thought Leadership that Educates Dealers on Marketplace Trends. We generate insightful content on market trends and best practices in digital advertising that are shared through webinars, dealer forums, dealer advisory councils, and our participation in industry conferences and events. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sales
 Our sales team is responsible for bringing dealers onto our marketplace as paying or non‑paying dealers. We have built an efficient inside sales and account management team of over 300 employees worldwide who sell our marketplace products to franchise and independent dealers. We have built a field sales team that works with strategic franchise and national dealership groups in large metropolitan areas. In addition, we have advertising sales employees based in Cambridge, Massachusetts; Detroit, Michigan; Los Angeles, California; and certain foreign locations.
 We have a comprehensive dealer account management process to assist dealers in becoming successful in our marketplace. We assign a Customer Success Associate to every new paying dealer to assist with onboarding and integration with any relevant software systems. The designated Customer Success Associate spends time educating dealers on a range of topics, including effectively using the Dealer Dashboard and tracking sales, and measuring ROI for their marketing spend. After the onboarding period, a Dealer Relations Account Manager is designated to assist the dealer in utilizing our tools and maximizing ROI from our offerings, including optimizing inventory acquisition, effectively pricing vehicles, vehicle merchandising, and keeping inventory up to date with complete vehicle information. We believe this active communication with our dealers fosters customer satisfaction and increases dealer and customer retention.

--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We have integrity. We act responsibly and consider the impact of our actions on each other, our partners and the world around us. We believe empathy, respect and fairness are essential. We set high ethical standards and expect principled leadership from our people.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We have won a number of awards recognizing our strong culture, including Boston Business Journal’s “Best Places to Work” for four years in a row from 2015 to 2018, Boston Globe’s “Top Place to Work” for four of the past
 five years in 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2018 and the Mass TLC Company of the Year award in 2018.
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 732 full‑time employees, 47 of whom were based outside the United States. None of our employees is represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
 Technology and Product Development
 We are a technology company focused on innovative, actionable data analysis. We design our mobile and web products to create an unbiased, transparent experience for both consumers and dealers. We believe in rapid development and frequent updates and have internal tools and automation that allow us to efficiently evolve our products. Our software is built using a combination of internally developed software, third‑party software and services, and open source software.
Our Search Technology
 Our search and ranking technology is served by a proprietary in‑memory search index solution that is scalable, fast, and extensible, allowing us to expand more easily into new markets, as demonstrated by our international marketplace launches. We have highly flexible interfaces that allow dealers to add their inventory to our index without changing data or formats, enabling us to quickly integrate hundreds of inventory sources with minimal effort and easily support inventory growth.
Our Mobile Technology
 We have designed our marketplace to appeal to mobile users by developing our products with a mobile‑first mindset. All of our search results pages use a single‑page application type approach to eliminate page reloads and improve responsiveness. We also use techniques, including predictive pre‑fetching and infinite scrolling, to load content onto a user’s mobile device more efficiently.

Our Integrations
 We make available several application program interfaces and web widgets that integrate with customer relationship management and inventory management solutions, among other platforms. These integrations allow dealers to incorporate designated data and tools into the fabric of their marketing and customer engagement strategies. For example, our Deal Rating Badges are used on over one thousand websites and allow our Deal Rating feature to be promoted across the internet.
Infrastructure
 Our development servers and U.S. website are hosted at third-party data centers near Boston, Massachusetts. Our European websites are hosted on a third-party cloud computing service near London, England. We use third-party content distribution networks to cache and serve many portions of our sites at locations across the globe. We monitor and test at the application, host, network, and full site levels to maintain availability and promote performance.

 Competition for Consumers and Dealers
 We compete for consumer visits with other online automotive marketplaces, free listing services, general search engines, and dealers’ websites. We compete for consumers primarily on the basis of the quality of the consumer experience. We believe we compete favorably on user experience due to the number of our vehicle listings, the unbiased transparency of the information we provide on cars, prices, and dealers, the intuitive nature of our user interface, and our leading mobile user experience, among other factors.
 We compete for dealers’ marketing spend with offline customer acquisition channels, other online automotive marketplaces, dealers’ own customer acquisition efforts on search engines, and other internet sites that attract consumers searching for vehicles. We compete primarily on the basis of the ROI that our marketplace provides. We believe we compete favorably due to our large user audience, high user engagement, and the volume and quality of connections we provide to well‑informed consumers, which results in an attractive ROI for dealers.
 Competition for Advertisers
 We compete for a share of advertisers’ total marketing budgets against media sites, websites dedicated to helping consumers shop for cars, major internet portals, search engines, and social media sites, among others. We also compete for a share of advertisers’ overall marketing budgets with traditional media, such as television, radio, magazines, newspapers, automotive guide publications, billboards, and other offline advertising channels. We compete for advertising spend based on the marketing ROI that our marketplace provides. We believe we compete favorably due to our large user audience size, high user engagement, and the effectiveness and relevance of our advertising products.

Intellectual Property
 We protect our intellectual property through a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, domain names, trade secret protections, confidentiality procedures, and contractual restrictions.
 We have three pending U.S. patent applications. These applications cover proprietary technology that relates to various functionalities on our platform, generally in connection with pricing, ranking and detecting fraud in online listings. We intend to pursue additional patent protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial to our competitive position.
 We have a number of registered and unregistered trademarks. We registered “CarGurus,” the CarGurus logo, the CG logo, and related marks, as trademarks in the United States and certain other jurisdictions. We pursue additional trademark registrations to the extent we believe doing so would be beneficial to our competitive position.
 We are the registered holder of several domestic and international domain names that include “CarGurus” and variations of our name.
 In addition to the protection provided by our intellectual property rights, we enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees and relevant consultants, contractors, and business partners. We control the use of our proprietary technology and intellectual property through provisions in contracts with our customers and partners and our general and product-specific terms of use on our websites.
 Regulatory
 Various aspects of our business are, may become, or may be viewed by regulators from time to time as subject, directly or indirectly, to U.S. federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations. In particular, the advertising and sale of new or used motor vehicles is highly regulated by the states and jurisdictions in which we do business. Although we do not sell motor vehicles and we believe that vehicle listings on our site are not themselves advertisements, state regulatory authorities or third parties could take the position that some of the laws or regulations applicable to dealers or to the manner in which motor vehicles are advertised and sold generally are directly applicable to our business. These advertising laws and regulations, which often originated decades before the emergence of the internet, are frequently subject to multiple interpretations, are not uniform across jurisdictions, sometimes impose inconsistent requirements with respect to new or used motor vehicles, and the manner in which they should be applied to our business model is not always clear. Regulators or other third parties could take, and on some occasions have taken, the position that our marketplace or related products violate applicable brokering, bird‑dog, consumer protection, or advertising laws or regulations.
 In order to operate in this regulated environment, we develop our products and services with a view toward appropriately managing the risk that our regulatory compliance, or the regulatory compliance of the dealers whose inventory is listed on our websites, could be challenged.
 We consider applicable advertising and consumer protection laws and regulations in designing our products and services. With respect to paid advertising, other than display advertising and Featured Listings, we believe that most of the content displayed on the websites we operate does not constitute paid advertising for the sale of motor vehicles. Nevertheless, we endeavor to design the content in a manner that would comply with relevant advertising regulations and consumer protection laws if, and to the extent that, the content is considered to be vehicle sales advertising.
 Our websites and mobile applications enable us, dealers, and users to send and receive text messages and other mobile phone communications, which requires us to comply with the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, or TCPA, in the U.S.  The TCPA, as interpreted and implemented by the Federal Communications Commission and federal and state courts, imposes significant restrictions on utilization of telephone calls and text messages to residential and mobile telephone numbers as a means of communication, particularly when the prior express consent of the person being contacted has not been obtained.  
 In addition, we are subject to numerous federal, national, state, and local laws and regulations in the United States and around the world regarding privacy and the collection, processing, storage, sharing, disclosure, use, cross-border transfer, and protection of personal information and other data.  While the scope of these laws and regulations is changing and remains subject to differing interpretations, we seek to comply with industry standards and all applicable laws, policies, legal obligations, and industry codes of conduct relating to privacy and data protection.  We are also subject to the terms of our privacy policies and privacy-related obligations to third parties.
