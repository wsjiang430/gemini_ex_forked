Item 1.        Business
Our Company
The Company is one of the largest providers of high specification (“high‑spec”) well service rigs and associated services in the United States, with a focus on technically demanding unconventional horizontal well completion and production operations. We believe that our fleet of 141 well service rigs is among the newest and most advanced in the industry and, based on our historical rig utilization and feedback from our customers, we believe that we are an operator of choice for U.S. onshore exploration and production (“E&P”) companies that require completion and production services at increasing lateral lengths. Our high‑specification well service rigs facilitate operations throughout the lifecycle of a well, including (i) completion services, such as milling out composite plugs after the hydraulic fracturing process and the installation of downhole production equipment; (ii) workover, including retrieval and replacement of existing production tubing; (iii) well maintenance, including replacement of downhole artificial lift components; and (iv) decommissioning, such as plugging and abandonment operations. The Company also provides Completion and Other Services, which provides services necessary to bring and maintain a well on production and primarily includes (i) wireline perforating and pumpdown services and (ii) snubbing services often utilized in conjunction with our high-spec rigs to convey equipment in and out of a well during completion and workover activities. The Company provides rental equipment, including well control packages, hydraulic catwalks and other equipment that are often deployed with our well service rigs. In addition, the Company owns and operates a fleet of proprietary, modular natural gas processing equipment that processes rich natural gas streams at the wellhead or central gathering points. The Company has operations in most of the active oil and natural gas basins in the United States, including the Permian Basin, the Denver‑Julesburg Basin, the Bakken Shale, the Eagle Ford Shale, the Haynesville Shale, the Gulf Coast and the South Central Oklahoma Oil Province (“SCOOP”) and Sooner Trend Anadarko Basin Canadian and Kingfisher counties (“STACK”) plays.
Our customers, which include many of the leading U.S. onshore E&P operators such as EOG Resources, Inc., Centennial Resource Development, Inc., Anadarko Petroleum Corporation, Sable Permian Resources Land, LLC and Concho Resources Inc., are increasingly utilizing modern horizontal well designs characterized by long lateral lengths that can extend in excess of 12,000 feet. Long lateral length wellbores require increased amounts of completion tubing, which, in turn, require well service rigs with higher operating horsepower (“HP”) to pull longer tubing strings from the wellbore. Further, long lateral horizontal wells generally utilize taller stacks of wellhead equipment, which drives demand for well service rigs that have taller mast heights capable of accommodating an elevated work floor. These modern horizontal well designs are ideally serviced by “high‑spec” well service rigs with high operating HP (450 HP or greater) and tall mast heights (102 feet or higher) rather than competing coiled tubing units and older or lower‑spec well service rigs. As of December 31, 2018, all but one of our well service rigs meets these specifications, and approximately 84% of our high-spec rigs exceed these specifications with HP ratings of at least 500 HP and mast heights of at least 104 feet, making our fleet particularly well‑suited to perform high‑margin, horizontal well completion and production operations. The remaining rig in our fleet is generally deployed only for plugging and abandonment operations of conventional vertical wells.
The high‑spec well service rigs in our fleet, a substantial majority of which has been built since 2010, have an average age of approximately six years and feature modern operating components sourced from leading U.S. manufacturers such as National Oilwell Varco, Inc. (“NOV”). In February 2017, to meet expected customer demand, we entered into a purchase agreement with NOV (the “NOV Purchase Agreement”), pursuant to which the Company accepted delivery of 28 high‑spec well service rigs periodically in 2017 and 2018. Following delivery of the rigs from NOV, the Company's well service rig fleet expanded to 141 rigs, 
1

of which 140 are high‑spec. The following table provides summary information regarding our high‑spec well service rig fleet. For additional information related to our high-spec rigs, please see “Properties—Equipment—High Specification Rigs” in Part I, Item 2 of this Annual Report.

HP Rating(1) | Mast Height | Mast Rating(2) | Number of High‑Spec Rigs
550-600 | 112’ ‑ 117’ | 250,000 - 300,000 | 59 
500 | 104’ ‑ 108’ | 240,000 - 250,000 | 59 
450 - 475 | 102’ ‑ 104’ | 200,000 - 250,000 | 23 
Total | | | 141 

_________________________

1. | Per manufacturer.


2. | The mast ratings of our high‑spec well service rigs complement their high operating HP and tall mast heights by allowing such rigs to safely support the higher weights associated with the long tubing strings used in long‑lateral well completion operations and is measured in pounds.

The composition of our well service rig fleet makes it particularly well‑suited to provide both completion‑oriented services, the demand for which generally increases along with increased capital spending by E&P operators, and production‑oriented services, the demand for which is less influenced, on a comparative basis, by such capital spending. The ability of our well service rigs to accommodate the needs of our E&P customers in a variety of economic conditions has historically allowed us to maintain relatively high rig utilization as measured by total monthly rig hours worked in a particular period per well service rig, which we refer to herein as our average monthly hours per rig. 
In addition to our core well service rig operations, we offer a suite of completion and other services, including wireline perforating and pump down services, snubbing services often utilized in conjunction with our high spec rigs, well testing equipment and services used to control and separate completion fluids, hydrocarbons and solids after fracturing and transportation and fluid management services. These services are necessary to bring a well to production. Our complementary completion and other services and equipment strategically enhance our operating footprint, create operational efficiencies for our customers and allow us to capture a greater portion of their spending across the lifecycle of a well.
We also provide a range of proprietary, modular equipment for the processing of rich natural gas streams at the wellhead or central gathering points in basins where drilling and completion activity has outpaced the development of permanent processing infrastructure through our processing solutions segment. We have developed a premium offering that includes proprietary designs on modern processing equipment, including modular Mechanical Refrigeration Units (“MRUs”). Our fleet of 29 modular units provide flexibility across a broad range of project requirements and operating environments, and are designed to allow for quick mobilization to minimize downtime and increase utilization, particularly in conjunction with the operational support provided by our expert field personnel. Our natural gas processing solutions assist our customers with meeting pipeline specifications, extracting higher value of natural gas liquids (“NGLs”), providing fuel gas for wellsites and facilities and reducing emissions at the flare tip. Our modular units provide flexibility to match a broad range of project requirements and are designed to allow for quick mobilization and demobilization.
We have focused on combining our high‑spec rig fleet, complementary well service operations and processing solutions with a highly skilled and experienced workforce, which enables us to consistently and efficiently deliver exceptional service while maintaining high health, safety and environmental standards. We believe that our strong operational performance and safety record provides a strong competitive advantage with current and prospective E&P customers.

Our Segments
We conduct our operations through three segments: High Specification Rigs, Completion and Other Services and Processing Solutions. Our High Specification Rig Services segment provides well service rigs and complementary equipment and services in the United States, with a focus on technically demanding unconventional horizontal well completion, workover and maintenance operations. These services are fundamental to establishing and maintaining the flow of oil and natural gas throughout the productive life of a well. Our Completion and Other Services segment provides services necessary to bring and maintain a well on production and consists primarily of our wireline and snubbing lines of business. Our Processing Solutions segment engages in the rental, installation, commissioning, start‑up, operation and maintenance of MRUs, NGL stabilizer units, NGL storage units and related equipment. We operate in most of the active oil and natural gas basins in the United States, including the Permian Basin, the Denver‑Julesburg Basin, the Bakken Shale, the Eagle Ford Shale, the Haynesville Shale, the Gulf Coast and the SCOOP and STACK plays. We incur corporate and administrative costs that are not specific to any of the operating segments, which are reported as other. For further information regarding the results of operations for each segment, please see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations” in Item 7 and Part IV, Note 15 — Segment Reporting of this Annual Report.
We have made certain reclassifications to our prior period amounts due to the change in reportable segments whereby our High Specification Rigs and Completion and Other Services segments were bifurcated from our legacy Well Services segment, as a result of our fourth quarter 2018 operating segment changes. None of these reclassifications have an impact on our consolidated operating results, cash flows or financial position. 
High Specification Rigs and Related Services
Our high‑spec well service rigs facilitate operations throughout the lifecycle of a well, including, as described in greater detail below, (i) completion (ii) workover; (iii) well maintenance; and (iv) decommissioning. We provide these advanced well services to E&P companies, particularly to those operating in unconventional oil and natural gas reservoirs and requiring technically and operationally advanced services. Our high‑spec well service rigs are designed to support growing U.S. horizontal well demands.
Specifically, our high specification rig operations consist primarily of the following:

• | Well completion support. Our well completion support services are utilized subsequent to hydraulic fracturing operations but prior to placing a well into production, and primarily include unconventional well completion operations, including milling out composite plugs, frac sand or other downhole debris or obstructions that were introduced in the well as part of the completion process and installing production tubing and other permanent downhole equipment necessary to facilitate extraction and production.


• | Workovers. Our workover services primarily facilitate major well repairs or modifications required to sustain the flow of oil and natural gas in a producing well. Workovers, which may require a few days to several weeks to complete and generally require additional auxiliary equipment, are typically more complex and more time consuming than well maintenance operations. Workover operations include major subsurface repairs such as repair or replacement of well casing, recovery or replacement of tubing and removal of foreign objects from the wellbore. All of our high‑spec well service rigs are designed to perform complex workover operations.


• | Well maintenance. Our well maintenance services, which are generally conducted multiple times throughout the life of a well, provide periodic maintenance required throughout the life of a well to sustain optimal levels of oil and natural gas production. Our well maintenance services primarily include the removal and replacement of downhole production equipment, including artificial lift components such as sucker rods and downhole pumps, the repair of failed production tubing and the repair and removal of other downhole production‑related byproducts such as frac sand or paraffin that impair well productivity. These and similar routine maintenance services involve relatively low‑cost, short‑duration operations that generally experience relatively stable demand notwithstanding changes in drilling activity.


• | Decommissioning. Our decommissioning services primarily include plugging and abandonment, in which our well service rigs and wireline and cementing equipment are used to prepare non‑economic oil and natural gas wells to be shut in and permanently or temporarily sealed. Decommissioning work is typically less sensitive to oil and natural gas prices than our other well service rig operations as a result of decommissioning obligations imposed by state regulations.

4

In addition to our core well service rig operations, we also offer well service‑related equipment rentals, as described below.

• | Well Service‑Related Equipment Rentals. Our well service‑related equipment rentals consist of a diverse fleet of rental items, including power swivels (hydraulic motor‑driven, pipe‑rotating machines used to deliver shock‑free torque to the drillstring or tubing during well service rig operations), well control packages (equipment used to ensure formation pressure is maintained within the wellbore during well service rig operations), hydraulic catwalks (mechanized lifting devices used to raise and lower drill pipe and tubing to and from the well service rig work floor), frac tanks, pipe racks and pipe handling tools. Our well service‑related equipment rentals are typically used in conjunction with the services provided by our well service rigs and, in the last several years, have resulted in incremental associated revenues and enhanced profit margins.

Completion and Other Services
Our Completion and Other Services segment provides services necessary to bring and maintain a well on production and consists primarily of our wireline and snubbing lines of business along with other, non-rig well services. 

• | Wireline Services. Our wireline services involve the use of wireline trucks equipped with a spool of cable that is unwound and lowered into oil and natural gas wells to convey specialized tools or equipment primarily for well completion, but also for well intervention, pipe recovery, plugging and abandonment purposes.


• | Fluid Management Services. Our fluid management services consist of the hauling of oilfield fluids, including drilling mud, fresh water and saltwater used or produced in well drilling, completion and production. Additionally, we rent tanks to store such fluids at the wellsite.


• | Snubbing Services. Our snubbing services consist of using our snubbing units together with our well service rigs in order to perform well maintenance or workover operations on a pressurized well without killing the well. Our snubbing services, which enable operators to safely run or remove pipe and other associated downhole tools into a flowing well, are utilized for well maintenance, workover and well completion activities.

Processing Solutions
In our processing solutions segment, we provide a range of proprietary, modular equipment for the processing of rich natural gas streams at the wellhead or central gathering points in basins where drilling and completion activity has outpaced the development of permanent processing infrastructure. We have developed a premium offering that includes proprietary designs on modern processing equipment, including modular MRUs. Our modular units provide flexibility across a broad range of project requirements and operating environments, and are designed to allow for quick mobilization to minimize downtime and increase utilization, particularly in conjunction with the operational support provided by our expert field personnel. Our natural gas processing solutions assist our customers with meeting pipeline specifications, extracting higher value NGLs, providing fuel gas for wellsites and facilities and reducing emissions at the flare tip. Our modular units provide flexibility to match a broad range of project requirements and are designed to allow for quick mobilization and demobilization.
In addition to our proprietary natural gas and NGL processing equipment, we offer full transportation, installation and ongoing operation services in the field. Our turn‑key mobilization services include in‑bound transportation, site offloading, installation, commissioning, startup and training of field personnel. Our ongoing operations and maintenance services include daily onsite and callout service, daily field reports and NGL transportation and marketing arrangements. We also employ full‑time process and mechanical engineers with significant experience in designing gas treating and processing solutions to provide quality service to our customers.
Competition
We provide services in various geographic regions across the United States, which are highly competitive. Our competitors include many large and small oilfield service providers. Our largest competitors in the high specification rig and completion services market include Basic Energy Services, Inc., C&J Energy Services, Inc., Forbes Energy Services Ltd., Key Energy Services Inc., Nine Energy Service Inc. and Pioneer Energy Services Corp. We view Pioneer Energy Services as our most significant competitor in the high-spec well service rig market. In the processing solutions market our primary competitors include GTUIT, LLC, Kinder Morgan Treating LP and Schlumberger Limited. In addition, our industry is highly fragmented and we compete regionally with a significant number of smaller service providers.
We believe that the principal competitive factors in the markets we serve are technical expertise, equipment capacity, work force competency, efficiency, safety record, reputation, experience and price. Additionally, projects are often awarded on a 
5

bid basis, which tends to create a highly competitive environment. We seek to differentiate ourselves from our competitors by delivering the highest-quality services and equipment possible, coupled with superior execution and operating efficiency in a safe working environment.
Cyclical Nature of Industry
We operate in a highly cyclical industry and the key factor driving demand for our services is the level of drilling activity by E&P companies. In turn, the level of drilling depends largely on the current and anticipated economics of new well completions. Global supply and demand for oil and the domestic supply and demand for natural gas are critical in assessing industry outlook. Demand for oil and natural gas is cyclical and subject to large, rapid fluctuations. E&P companies tend to increase capital expenditures in response to increases in oil and natural gas prices, which generally results in greater revenues and profits for oilfield service companies. Increased capital expenditures also lead to greater production, which historically has resulted in increased inventories and reduced prices consequently reducing demand for oilfield services. The results of our operations, therefore, may fluctuate from period to period, and these fluctuations may distort comparisons of results across periods.
Seasonality
Our results of operations have historically reflected seasonal tendencies relating to holiday seasons, inclement weather and the conclusion of our customers' annual drilling and completion of capital expenditure budgets. Our most notable declines occur in the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year. Additionally, some of the areas in which we have operations, including the Denver-Julesburg Basin and the Bakken Shale, are adversely affected by seasonal weather conditions, primarily in the fall and winter. During periods of heavy snow, ice, wind or rain, we may be unable to move our equipment between locations, thereby reducing our ability to provide services and generate revenues, or we could suffer weather-related damage to our facilities and equipment resulting in delays in operations. The exploration activities of our customers may also be affected during such periods of adverse weather conditions.
Sales and Marketing
Our sales and marketing activities typically are performed through our local operations in each geographical region and are supported by sales representatives at our corporate headquarters. Our senior management also takes an active role in supporting our local sales and marketing operations and personnel. We believe our local field sales personnel understand the region‑specific issues and customer operating procedures and therefore can more effectively target marketing activities. Our sales representatives work closely with our local managers and field sales personnel to target market opportunities.
Customers
We have strong relationships with a broad customer base, including EOG Resources, Inc., Centennial Resource Development, Inc., Anadarko Petroleum Corporation, Sable Permian Resources Land, LLC and Concho Resources Inc. During 2018, we worked for approximately 200 distinct customers. During 2018, EOG Resources, Inc. accounted for approximately 20% of our revenues. During 2017, EOG Resources, Inc. and PDC Energy, Inc. each accounted for more than 10% of our revenues. After giving effect to the ESCO Acquisition, Devon Energy Corporation would have accounted for more than 10% of our revenues during 2017.
Our top five customers represented approximately 42% and 47% of our consolidated revenues for 2018 and 2017, respectively. Within our High Specification Rig segment, our top five customers represented approximately 45% and 49% of the segment revenues for 2018 and 2017, respectively. Within our Completion and Other Services segment, our top five customers represented approximately 68% and 70% of our revenues for 2018 and 2017, respectively. Within our Processing Solutions segment, our top five customers represented approximately 82% and 92% of our revenues for 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Suppliers
We have built strong relationships with the manufacturers of our high‑spec well service rigs and we believe we will continue to have timely access to new, high‑spec rigs as we continue to grow. For example, in February 2017, we entered into the NOV Purchase Agreement to meet expected customer demand for our high‑spec well service rigs. Further, we have built strong relationships with the third‑party suppliers and other vendors that we use to assemble our MRUs and related modular processing equipment and believe we will continue to have timely access to new MRUs and related equipment as we continue to grow.
In addition, our internal supply chain team manages sourcing and logistics to ensure flexibility and continuity of supply in a cost effective manner across our areas of operation. We have built long‑term relationships with multiple industry leading suppliers of materials and equipment. We purchase a wide variety of materials, parts and components that are manufactured and 
6

supplied for our operations. We are not dependent on any single source of supply for those parts, supplies or materials. We have generally been able to obtain the equipment, parts and supplies necessary to support our operations on a timely basis.
Environmental and Occupational Safety and Health Matters
Our operations, which support the oil and natural gas exploration, development and production activities pursued by our customers, are subject to stringent and comprehensive federal, regional, state and local laws and regulations governing occupational safety and health, the discharge of materials into the environment, solid and hazardous waste management, transportation and disposal, and environmental protection. These laws and regulations may, among other things (i) limit or prohibit our operations on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas; (ii) require remedial measures to mitigate or clean-up pollution from former and ongoing operations; (iii) impose restrictions on the types, quantities and concentrations of various substances that can be released into the environment or injected in formations in connection with oil and natural gas drilling and production activities; (iv) impose specific safety and health standards or criteria addressing worker protection; and (v) impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations.
Numerous governmental entities, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and analogous state agencies, have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them. Any failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory, remedial or corrective action obligations or the incurrence of capital expenditures; the occurrence of delays in the permitting or performance of projects; the issuance of orders enjoining performance of some or all of our operations in a particular area; and governmental or private claims for personal injury or property or natural resource damages.
The trend in environmental regulation has been to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may adversely affect the environment, and thus any changes in environmental laws and regulations or re-interpretation of enforcement policies that result in more stringent and costly regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity position, financial condition, prospects and results of operations. We may be unable to pass on such increased compliance costs to our customers. Moreover, accidental releases or spills may occur in the course of our operations, and we cannot assure you that we will not incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of such releases or spills, including any third-party claims for damage to property, natural resources or persons. Our customers may also incur increased costs or delays or restrictions in permitting or operating activities as a result of more stringent environmental laws and regulations, which may result in a curtailment of exploration, development or production activities that would reduce the demand for our services.
The following is a summary of the more significant existing environmental and occupational safety and health laws, as amended from time to time, to which our business is subject and for which compliance may have a material adverse impact on our capital expenditures, results of operations or financial position.
Worker Health and Safety
We are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”), and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and the public.
Radioactive Materials
Some of our operations utilize equipment that contains sealed, low-grade radioactive sources. Our activities involving the use of radioactive materials are regulated by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (“NRC”) and state regulatory agencies under agreement with the NRC. Standards implemented by these regulatory agencies require us to obtain licenses or other approvals for the use of such radioactive materials. Historically, our radioactive materials compliance costs have not had a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity position, financial condition, prospects or results of operations; however, there can be no assurance that such costs will not be material in the future. The violation of these laws and regulations may result in the denial or revocation of permits, issuance of corrective action orders, injunctions prohibiting some or all of our operations in a particular area, and assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties. In addition, a release of radioactive material could result in substantial remediation costs, and potentially expose us to third party property damage or personal injury claims.
Naturally Occurring Radioactive Materials (“NORM”) may contaminate extraction and processing equipment used in the oil and natural gas industry, most often in the form of scale. The waste resulting from such contamination is regulated by federal and state laws. Standards have been developed for: worker protection, treatment, storage, and disposal of NORM and NORM waste, management of NORM-contaminated waste piles, containers and tanks and limitations on the relinquishment of 
7

NORM contaminated land for unrestricted use under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and state laws. We may incur significant costs or liabilities associated with elevated levels of NORM.
Hazardous Substances and Wastes and Naturally Occurring Radioactive Materials
The RCRA, and comparable state statutes, regulate the generation, treatment, storage, transportation, disposal and clean-up of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. Pursuant to rules issued by the EPA, individual states can have delegated authority to administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more stringent requirements. In the course of our operations, we generate industrial wastes, such as paint wastes, waste solvents and waste oils that are regulated as hazardous wastes. Drilling fluids, produced waters and other wastes associated with the exploration, development and production of oil or natural gas, if properly handled, are currently exempt from regulation as hazardous waste under RCRA and, instead, are regulated under RCRA’s less stringent non-hazardous waste provisions, or other state or federal laws.
However, it is possible that certain oil and natural gas drilling and production wastes now classified as non-hazardous could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future. For example, the EPA is required, by a consent decree, to propose a rulemaking for revision of certain RCRA Subtitle D criteria regulations pertaining to oil and natural gas wastes or sign a determination that revision of the regulations is not necessary no later than March 15, 2019. If EPA proposes a rulemaking for revised oil and natural gas waste regulations, the consent decree requires that the EPA take final action following notice and comment rulemaking no later than July 15, 2021. A reclassification of drilling fluids, produced waters and related wastes as hazardous under RCRA could result in an increase in our, as well as the oil and natural gas exploration and production industries’, costs to manage and dispose of generated wastes, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity position, financial condition, prospects and results of operations. Additionally, other wastes handled at exploration and production sites or generated in the course of providing well services may not fall within this exclusion.
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) and comparable state laws impose strict, joint and several liability for environmental contamination and damages to natural resources without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of persons. These persons include owners and operators of real property impacted by a release of hazardous substances and any company that transported, disposed of, or arranged for the transport or disposal of hazardous substances to or at the site. Under CERCLA, such persons may be liable for, among other things, the costs of remediating the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. In addition, where contamination may be present, it is not uncommon for the neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury, property damage and recovery of response costs.
Water Discharges and Discharges into Belowground Formations
The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, also known as the Clean Water Act (“CWA”), and analogous state laws, impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of oil and hazardous substances, into state waters and waters of the United States. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or an analogous state agency. Spill prevention, control and countermeasure plan requirements imposed under the CWA require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters in the event of a petroleum hydrocarbon tank spill, rupture or leak. In addition, the CWA and analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities. The CWA also prohibits the discharge of dredge and fill material in regulated waters, including wetlands, unless authorized by permit. The CWA and analogous state laws also may impose substantial civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance including spills and other non-authorized discharges.
The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA”) sets minimum standards for prevention, containment and cleanup of oil spills. The OPA applies to vessels, offshore facilities, and onshore facilities, including exploration and production facilities that may affect waters of the United States. Under the OPA, responsible parties including owners and operators of onshore facilities may be held strictly liable for oil cleanup costs and natural resource damages as well as a variety of public and private damages that may result from oil spills. The OPA also requires owners or operators of certain onshore facilities to prepare Facility Response Plans for responding to a worst-case discharge of oil into waters of the United States.
Our oil and natural gas producing customers dispose of flowback and produced water or certain other oilfield fluids gathered from oil and natural gas producing operations in accordance with permits issued by government authorities overseeing such disposal activities. While these permits are issued pursuant to existing laws and regulations, these legal requirements are subject to change based on concerns of the public or governmental authorities regarding such disposal activities. One such concern relates to recent seismic events near underground disposal wells used for the disposal by injection of flowback and produced water or certain other oilfield fluids resulting from oil and natural gas activities. When caused by human activity, such events are called induced seismicity. In response to concerns regarding induced seismicity, regulators in some states have imposed, or are considering 
8

imposing, additional requirements in the permitting of produced water disposal wells or otherwise to assess any relationship between seismicity and the use of such wells. States may, from time to time, develop and implement plans directing certain wells where seismic incidents have occurred to restrict or suspend disposal well operations. In addition, ongoing lawsuits allege that disposal well operations have caused damage to neighboring properties or otherwise violated state and federal rules regulating waste disposal. These developments could result in additional regulation and restrictions on the use of injection wells by our customers to dispose of flowback and produced water and certain other oilfield fluids. Increased regulation and attention given to induced seismicity also could lead to greater opposition to, and litigation concerning, oil and natural gas activities utilizing injection wells for waste disposal.
Any one or more of these developments may necessitate that our customers limit disposal well volumes, disposal rates or disposal locations, or may require our customers or third party disposal well operators that dispose of customer wastewater to shut down disposal wells, which could adversely affect our customers’ business and result in a corresponding decrease in the need for our services, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, liquidity position, financial condition, prospects and results of operations.
Air Emissions
Some of our operations also result in emissions of regulated air pollutants. The federal Clean Air Act (“CAA”) and analogous state laws require permits for certain facilities that have the potential to emit substances into the atmosphere that could adversely affect environmental quality. These laws and their implementing regulations also impose limitations on air emissions and require adherence to maintenance, work practice, reporting and record keeping, and other requirements. Failure to obtain a permit or to comply with permit or other regulatory requirements could result in the imposition of sanctions, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties. In addition, we or our customers could be required to shut down or retrofit existing equipment, leading to additional capital or operating expenses and operational delays.
Many of these regulatory requirements, including New Source Performance Standards (“NSPS”) and Maximum Achievable Control Technology standards, are expected to be made more stringent over time as a result of stricter ambient air quality standards and other air quality protection goals adopted by the EPA. Compliance with these or other new regulations could, among other things, require installation of new emission controls on some of our equipment, result in longer permitting timelines, and significantly increase our capital expenditures and operating costs, which could adversely impact on our business. For example, the EPA issued final CAA regulations in 2012 that include NSPS standards for VOC emissions from completions of hydraulically fractured natural gas wells, compressors, controllers, dehydrators, storage tanks, natural gas processing plants and certain other equipment. In June 2016, the EPA published additional final rules establishing new emissions standards for methane and additional standards for VOCs from certain new, modified and reconstructed equipment and processes in the oil and natural gas source category, including production, processing, transmission and storage activities, and is formally seeking additional information from oil and natural gas producing companies as necessary to eventually expand these final rules to include existing equipment and processes. However, in June 2017, the EPA published a proposal to stay certain portions of the June 2016 standards for two years and re-evaluate the entirety of the 2016 standards. Both the stay and the underlying rules have been the subject of litigation. In September 2018, the EPA proposed revisions to the 2016 rules, which, according the EPA, are intended to “streamline implementation, reduce duplicative EPA and state requirements, and significantly decrease unnecessary burdens on domestic energy producers.” Future implementation of these standards is uncertain at this time. In addition, some of our customers may operate on federal or tribal lands, and are subject to further regulation, including by tribal authorities and the federal Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”). Potentially applicable regulations include EPA's June 2016 Federal Implementation Plan (“FIP”) to implement the Federal Minor New Source Review Program on tribal lands for oil and gas production. The FIP creates a permit-by-rule process for minor sources that also incorporates emission limits and other requirements under various federal air quality standards, applying them to a range of equipment and processes used in oil and gas production. In April 2018, the EPA proposed revisions to reportedly streamline the FIP. Neither the FIP nor the revisions apply in areas of ozone non-attainment. As a result, the EPA may impose area-specific regulations in certain areas identified as tribal lands that may require additional emissions controls on existing equipment. Such requirements will likely result in increased operating and compliance costs for our customers in these regions.
In November 2016, the BLM finalized a rule regulating the venting and flaring of natural gas, leak detection, air emissions from equipment, well maintenance and unloading, drilling and completions and royalties potentially owed for loss of such emissions from oil and natural gas facilities producing on federal and tribal leases. The final rule became effective in January 2017; however, BLM issued a final rule in December 2017 delaying implementation of the venting and flaring rule for one year. In September 2018, the BLM published a revised rule which rescinded and revised several components of the 2016 rule. The venting and flaring rule is also the subject of pending litigation. Additionally, in a March 28, 2017 executive order, President Trump directed the Secretary of the Interior to review these and several other BLM rules related to oil and gas operations and, if appropriate, to suspend, revise, or rescind the rules. The executive order also directs all executive agencies more broadly to review existing

regulations that potentially burden the development or use of domestically produced energy resources. Compliance with these and other air pollution control and permitting requirements has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects and increase costs for us and our customers. Moreover, our business could be materially affected if these or other similar requirements increase the cost of doing business for us and our customers, or reduce the demand for the oil and natural gas our customers produce, and thus have an adverse effect on the demand for our services.
Climate Change
In the United States, domestic efforts to curb Green House Gas (“GHG”) emissions continue to be led by the EPA’s GHG regulations as well as state and regional efforts aimed at tracking and/or reducing GHG emissions by means of cap and trade programs. In addition, the EPA has determined that GHG emissions present a danger to public health and the environment and has adopted regulations that, among other things, restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the CAA and may require the installation of “best available control technology” to limit emissions of GHGs from any new or significantly modified facilities if they would otherwise emit large volumes of GHGs together with other criteria pollutants. Also, the EPA has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and Annual Reporting of GHG emissions from oil and natural gas production, processing, transmission and storage facilities in the United States on an annual basis, including gathering and boosting stations as well as completions and workovers from hydraulically fractured oil wells. The EPA has also taken steps to limit methane emissions, a GHG, from certain new modified or reconstructed facilities in the oil and natural gas sector, but future implementation of these methane rules is uncertain at this time.
In December 2015, the United States joined an agreement (the “Paris Agreement”) at the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France that requires member countries to review and “represent a progression” in their intended nationally determined contributions, which set GHG emission reduction goals, every five years beginning in 2020. The Paris Agreement entered into force in November 2016. Although this agreement does not create any binding obligations for nations to limit their GHG emissions, it does include pledges to voluntarily limit or reduce future emissions. In June 2017, President Trump stated that the United States would withdraw from the Paris Agreement, but may enter into a future international agreement related to GHGs. Such withdrawal has not yet been finalized, and it is not possible at this time to predict how or when the United States might impose restrictions on GHGs as a result of the Paris Agreement. Further, several states and local governments have stated their commitment to its principles in their effectuation of policy and regulations. Still, new legislation or regulatory programs that restrict emissions of GHGs could adversely affect our operations and demand for our services. Substantial limitations on GHG emissions could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas our customers produce and lower the value of their reserves, which could reduce demand for our services and have a corresponding material adverse effect on our business, liquidity position, financial condition, prospects and results of operations. Finally, increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth’s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods and other climatic events. If any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our operations.
Hydraulic Fracturing
Our customers are reliant on hydraulic fracturing services in connection with their production of oil and natural gas. Hydraulic fracturing stimulates production of oil and/or natural gas from dense subsurface rock formations by injecting water, sand and chemicals under pressure into the formation to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production.
Hydraulic fracturing typically is regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions, but the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority pursuant to the Safe Drinking Water Act over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel fuel and issued permitting guidance in February 2014 that applies to such activities. The EPA also finalized rules in June 2016 that prohibit the discharge of wastewater from hydraulic fracturing operations to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants. In addition, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources in December 2016. The final report concluded that “water cycle” activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources “under some circumstances,” noting that the following hydraulic fracturing water cycle activities and local- or regional-scale factors are more likely than others to result in more frequent or more severe impacts: water withdrawals for fracturing in times or areas of low water availability; surface spills during the management of fracturing fluids, chemicals or produced water; injection of fracturing fluids into wells with inadequate mechanical integrity; injection of fracturing fluids directly into groundwater resources; discharge of inadequately treated fracturing wastewater to surface waters; and disposal or storage of fracturing wastewater in unlined pits.
Additionally, the BLM finalized a rule in March 2015 establishing standards for hydraulic fracturing on federal and American Indian lands, but subsequently repealed the rule in December 2017. BLM’s repeal of the rule has been challenged in federal court. In addition, various state and local governments have implemented, or are considering, increased regulatory oversight of hydraulic fracturing through additional permit requirements, operational restrictions, disclosure requirements, well construction 
10

and temporary or permanent bans on hydraulic fracturing in certain areas. For example, Texas, Colorado and North Dakota, among others, have adopted regulations that impose new or more stringent permitting, disclosure, disposal and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations.
In addition to state laws, local land use restrictions, such as city ordinances, may restrict drilling in general and/or hydraulic fracturing in particular. If new federal, state or local laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted, such legal requirements could result in delays, eliminate certain drilling and injection activities and make it more difficult or costly to perform hydraulic fracturing. Any such regulations limiting or prohibiting hydraulic fracturing could result in decreased oil and natural gas exploration and production activities and, therefore, adversely affect demand for our services and our business. Such laws or regulations could also materially increase our costs of compliance and doing business.
Historically, our environmental compliance costs have not had a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity position, financial condition, prospects and results of operations; however, there can be no assurance that such costs will not be material in the future. It is possible that substantial costs for compliance or penalties for non-compliance may be incurred in the future. Moreover, it is possible that other developments, such as the adoption of stricter environmental laws, regulations, and enforcement policies, could result in additional costs or liabilities that we cannot currently quantify.
State and Local Regulation
Our operations, and the operations of our customers, are subject to a variety of state and local environmental review and permitting requirements. Some states have state laws similar to major federal environmental laws and thus our operations are also subject to state requirements that may be more stringent than those imposed under federal law.
Our operations may require state-law based permits in addition to federal permits, requiring state agencies to consider a range of issues, many the same as federal agencies, including, among other things, a project’s impact on wildlife and their habitats, historic and archaeological sites, aesthetics, agricultural operations, and scenic areas. Texas has specific permitting and review processes for oilfield service operations, and state agencies may impose different or additional monitoring or mitigation requirements than federal agencies. The development of new sites and our existing operations also are subject to a variety of local environmental and regulatory requirements, including land use, zoning, building and transportation requirements.
Motor Carrier Operations
We operate as a motor carrier and therefore are subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”) and various state agencies. These regulatory authorities exercise broad powers, governing activities such as the authorization to engage in motor carrier operations; regulatory safety; hazardous materials labeling, placarding and marking; financial reporting; and certain mergers, consolidations and acquisitions. There are additional regulations specifically relating to the trucking industry, including requirements related to testing and weight and dimension specifications of equipment, drug testing and product handling. The trucking industry is subject to possible regulatory and legislative changes that may affect the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or by changing the demand for common or contract carrier services or the cost of providing truckload services. Some of these possible changes include increasingly stringent environmental regulations, changes in the hours of service regulations which govern the amount of time driven in any specific period and requiring onboard black box recorder devices or limits on vehicle weight and size.
Interstate motor carrier operations are subject to safety requirements prescribed by DOT. Intrastate motor carrier operations are subject to safety regulations that often mirror federal regulations. Such matters as weight and dimension of equipment are also subject to federal and state regulations. DOT regulations also mandate drug testing of drivers. From time to time, various legislative proposals are introduced, including proposals to increase federal, state or local taxes, including taxes on motor fuels, which may increase our costs or adversely impact the recruitment of drivers. We cannot predict whether, or in what form, any increase in such taxes applicable to us will be enacted.
