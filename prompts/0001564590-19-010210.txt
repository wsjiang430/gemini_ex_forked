 Overview
 Comstock Holding Companies, Inc., incorporated in 2004 as a Delaware corporation, is a multi-faceted real estate asset management, development and services company primarily focused in the Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Statistical Area (“MSA”) of the United States. In 2018, the Company began to transform its operational platform from for sale production homebuilding to asset management, commercial development and complementary real estate related services. As part of the transformation, the Company now operates through two primary real estate focused platforms – CDS Asset Management, LC (“CAM”) and Comstock Real Estate Services, LC (“CRES”) and is in the process of winding down its on-balance sheet production homebuilding business. References in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to “Comstock,” “Company”, “CAM”, “CRES”, “we,” “our” and “us” refer to Comstock Holding Companies, Inc. together in each case with our subsidiaries and any predecessor entities unless the context suggests otherwise.

 Our Business Strategy
 In 2018, we began winding down our on-balance-sheet, for-sale homebuilding operation and refocusing our operations on commercial real estate development, asset management and real estate related fee-based services. As a result, the Company began operating through two real estate focused platforms, CDS Asset Management ("CAM") and Comstock Real Estate Services ("CRES"). CAM provides real estate development, asset management, and property management services, while CRES provides development supply chain services, including capital markets, real estate brokerage, environmental consulting and design services in the Washington, DC metropolitan area and in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. 
 We believe that Comstock's substantial experience in entitling, designing, developing, and managing a diverse range of properties including apartments, single-family homes, townhomes, mid-rise condominiums, high-rise condominiums and mixed-use (residential and commercial) properties, as well as large scale commercial parking garages and transit related projects, positions the CAM subsidiary to capitalize on commercial development and asset management opportunities in the Washington, DC region. Our CRES subsidiary is well positioned to capitalize on market opportunities related to providing development supply chain services, including capital markets, brokerage, environmental consulting and other real estate related services in the Washington, DC metropolitan area and in other parts of the Washington, D.C. MSA. 
 In connection with our new strategy, and anchoring the transition of our operations, the Company entered into a Master Asset Management Agreement (“AMA”), effective as of January 2, 2018, through its CAM subsidiary with Comstock Development Services, LC (“CDS”), an entity wholly owned by the Chief Executive Officer of the Company. The AMA covers two large-scale, transit-oriented, mixed-use developments in the Washington, DC area; Reston Station, a multi-million square foot development located in Reston, VA, and Loudoun Station, a multi-million square foot development in Ashburn, VA, as well as a mixed-use development asset located in Herndon, VA. Separately, the Company also entered fee-based management agreements with unrelated third parties concerning a mixed-use property in Tysons Corner, VA, and an affordable housing multi-family development in Rockville, MD.
 Pursuant to the AMA, CDS has engaged CAM to manage and administer the CDS commercial real estate portfolio (“CRE Portfolio”) and the day to-day operations of CDS and each property-owning subsidiary of CDS. Pursuant to the terms of the AMA, CAM provides investment advisory, development and asset management services related to the build out, lease-up and stabilization, and management of the CRE Portfolio. CDS pays the Company fees for the services provided by the Company in connection with the CDS portfolio of assets under management (“AUM”)  calculated on a cost-plus basis, thereby protecting the Company from incurring operating costs related to asset management services being provided to CDS in excess of fees collected during the transition, while also enabling the Company to expand its operating capabilities through the addition of qualified managers with experience in growing AUM.
 In addition to the asset management services provided by CAM to CDS, the Company’s CRES subsidiary is focused on generating growth organically and through potential acquisitions of operating businesses that would provide complementary development and supply chain services to assets under management pursuant to the AMA as 
 2


well as to unrelated third parties in the areas of environmental consulting, mortgage brokerage, and capital market and financial consulting services.
 We believe that we have several strengths that distinguish our new business focus and strategy:
  
• | Revenue Base. Our revenues are primarily generated from recurring fees earned under the AMA and operations of our CRES subsidiary. The AMA provides a reliable cost-plus source of revenue and cashflow to cover the Company’s operating expenses related to the services being provided to CDS pursuant to the AMA, positioning the Company to enhance bottom line results and pursue additional revenue growth.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Management Services. Our experienced asset management professionals provide management services to a wide range of real estate assets and businesses that include a variety of commercial real estate uses, including apartments, office buildings, hotels, commercial garages, leased lands, retail stores, mixed-use developments, and transit-oriented developments. Our management team has significant capabilities generated through decades of experience managing large-scale projects and portfolios of commercial real estate development, construction, and property and asset management services. The properties and businesses we currently manage are located primarily along the Dulles Corridor section of the Washington DC Metro Silver Line in Fairfax and Loudoun Counties.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Real Estate Services. Our experienced real estate services-based management team provides a wide range of real estate services in the areas of strategic corporate planning, capital markets and financial consulting services, commercial mortgage brokerage services, and environmental and design-based services. Our environmental services group provides consulting, environmental studies, remediation services and site-specific solutions for properties that may benefit from environmental due diligence, site-specific assessments, and environmental remediation. The real estate services business platform allows us to generate positive fee income from our highly qualified personnel and serves as a potential catalyst for joint venture and acquisition opportunities.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Homebuilding. We will continue to wind-down our for-sale homebuilding operation and with the intention of completing the wind-down as quickly and efficiently as possible. In connection with the winding-down of our for-sale homebuilding operations, we may continue to develop, construct, and market individual homes and building lots for sale until we have depleted our inventory of such products or identified a means of completing the wind-down in an expediated manner. We will substantially complete our production homebuilding operations by the second quarter of 2019 but anticipate residual land development activities and finished lot sales to third party homebuilders to continue beyond 2019. Additionally, the Company may engage in homebuilding activities from time to time if self-performance of our residual lot inventory pipeline is deemed the best financial alternative. Any future homebuilding activities are expected to be provided off balance sheet on an asset management basis. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Quality and Depth of Management. We have a highly qualified and experienced management team providing a broad base of deep expertise and a proven track record to our clients. The combination of the new platforms leverages the diverse capabilities and relationships of the management teams of the Comstock organization developed over more than thirty years.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Alignment of Interests. We believe our new business strategy fosters a strong economic alignment of interests with our shareholders due to our Chief Executive Officer’s large economic interest in the Company and in the portfolio being managed by the Company pursuant to the AMA.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Operating Efficiencies. As previously reported, the transition of our business focus and new strategy required the combination of the operating platform of the Company and the operating platform of the privately held commercial development company controlled by the Company’s Chief Executive Officer. The integration of the two operating platforms has significantly enhanced the operating capabilities of the Company while providing opportunities for additional operational efficiencies and management alignment.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Fee-Based Service Platform. Our asset-light business strategy, adopted in 2018, has contributed to our ability to materially reduce our liabilities during 2018 and we believe will contribute to our ability to produce positive results in future periods.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Company’s various business units work in concert to leverage the collective skill sets of our organization. The talent and experience of our personnel allows workflow flexibility and a multitasking approach to managing various projects. We believe that our business network in the Washington, D.C. MSA provides us with a competitive advantage in sourcing and executing on investment opportunities.
 
While Comstock has developed numerous properties in multiple key markets throughout the southeastern United States, and our management team has experience managing large regional portfolios, we believe the Washington, DC MSA provides continued growth opportunity in the near-term for several reasons, including the following:
 
 
• | Long Track Record. Comstock has been active in the Washington, DC MSA since 1985 and has developed, acquired, and managed thousands of residential units and millions of square feet of mixed-use properties, throughout the region.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Multiple Public-Private Partnerships. Comstock has been selected by multiple local governments (Fairfax County, Loudoun County, and Town of Herndon) to develop and manage large-scale mixed-use, and transit facility developments through public-private partnerships at a time when local jurisdictions are focused on public-private partnerships as a means of leveraging private sector capabilities to meet public infrastructure development needs.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Economic Drivers. Significant growth trends in demand for cyber security and other technology services in the government sector, as well as in the private sector, has generated growth opportunities for tech companies, generating numerous start-ups, and is attracting big tech to the region. Further, Northern Virginia’s data center market, primarily the Dulles Corridor, has seen record growth and has become the global leader in data center space while accounting for more than 40% of national data center space absorption in recent years.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Diverse Employment Base. The diverse and well-educated employment base in the Washington, DC MSA, coupled with proximity to the federal government and the presence of well-established government contractors is contributing to the attractiveness of the region to tech companies.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Metro’s Silver Line. Phase I of Metro’s Silver Line opened in 2014, connecting Tysons Corner and Reston to Arlington and downtown Washington, DC. Phase II is scheduled to open in early 2020 and will extend service from the terminus of Phase I located in the center of Comstock’s Reston Station development to Herndon, Dulles International Airport, and Loudoun County, terminating at Comstock’s Loudoun Station development.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Regional Land Use Plans. Recent changes to Comprehensive Land Use Plans of Fairfax County and Loudoun County encourage high density and mixed-use development proximate to the new Silver Line Metro Stations.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Increased Demand for Transit-Oriented and Mixed-Use Developments. Recent trends indicate commercial tenants are increasingly seeking to locate (or relocate) office to Metro Accessible sites and have demonstrated a willingness to pay premium rents for commercial space because proximity to Metro in urban, mixed-use developments has become a key recruiting tool. Additionally, demand for housing in transit-oriented, mixed-use neighborhoods has increased steadily over the past decade while home ownership rates have decreased and demand for high quality rental housing has increased.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Comstock has been focused on these emerging trends for more than a decade and the Company, through the AMA, controls the development and asset management of a significant portfolio at the forefront of the urban transformation taking place in the Dulles Corridor. With a stabilized portfolio and development pipeline that includes millions of square feet of mixed-use and transit-oriented properties located at key Metro stations in the Dulles Corridor, Comstock is well positioned to capitalize on trends that we believe will shape the future commercial real estate landscape.

Our Operations
 We believe that we are properly staffed for current market conditions and have the ability to manage growth as market conditions warrant. Our operations are focused mainly in the Washington, D.C. MSA, where we believe our over 30 years of experience provides us the best opportunity to enhance stockholder value.
Our Managed Communities
 Reston Station. Reston Station is among the largest mixed-use, transit-oriented developments in the Washington D.C. MSA. Located at the terminus of phase I of Metro’s Silver Line, the Reston Station neighborhood will contain approximately 4.5 million square feet of mixed-use development covering almost 40 acres spanning the highly-trafficked Dulles Toll Road and surrounding Metro’s Wiehle Reston-East Metro Station, the terminus station on Phase I of the Silver Line and the only Metro rail station currently in Reston, VA. The Company is providing a wide variety of its real estate and asset management services to the project pursuant to the AMA, including development and construction management services, leasing management services, property management services, and capital markets services.  The Reston Station neighborhood is being developed in four distinct districts as follows:
 •
Metro Plaza District. The Metro Plaza District has entitlements in place that allow for up to 1.7 million square feet of mixed-use development in five buildings on approximately 7 acres leased pursuant to a long term ground lease with Fairfax County situated directly above the Reston Station Transit Facility, a 1.8 million square foot underground transit facility that includes approximately 2,300 parking spaces operated by Fairfax County as a Metro commuter parking facility, and approximately 1,200 parking spaces operated by the Company as a parking facility for retail and office users, as well as Metro commuters. As of December 31, 2018, construction has been completed on three of the five buildings located above the Reston Station Transit Facility including a 370,000 square foot Trophy-Class office tower, a portion of which has been leased to Google and other corporate users, and the two remaining buildings containing additional Class A office space and ground floor retail are in various stages of development, construction, and leasing. The Metro Plaza District portion of the Reston Station development, including the transit facility and parking garage, is the subject of a Public-Private Partnership agreement between the Board of Supervisors of Fairfax County, Virginia and Comstock Reston Station Holdings, LC, an entity affiliated with CDS.
 
•
Promenade District. The Promenade District has entitlements in place that allow for approximately 1.4 million square feet of mixed-use development on approximately 8 acres situated adjacent to Reston Station’s Metro Plaza District and the Reston Station Transit Facility. As of December 31, 2018, the Company is providing asset management services for the existing buildings consisting of approximately 70,000 square feet of office space constructed prior to 1995, while designing new buildings that will be constructed on the site including office, retail, residential and hotel uses. Marriott International has entered into a franchise agreement with an affiliate of CDS concerning the development and operation of a Marriott Renaissance Hotel and residential tower that is planned to be developed as the first phase of the Promenade District, including approximately 240 hotel rooms, approximately 80 residential units and retail, entertainment and conference spaces.
 
•
Commerce District.  The Commerce District has entitlements in place that allow for approximately 1.5 million square feet of mixed-use development, including three existing Class-A office buildings that include a total of approximately 400,000 square feet. The Commerce District property is situated on approximately 12 acres located adjacent to the south entrance to the Wiehle Reston-East Metro Station and lies directly across the Dulles Toll Road from the Metro Plaza District of Reston Station and the Reston Station Transit Facility. Currently, Comstock is leasing and managing the three existing office buildings while it is also developing designs for new buildings that will include up to 1.1 million square feet of office, retail, hotel and residential uses. The Commerce District property was acquired by a subsidiary of CDS in 2019. The Company is providing a variety of asset management and development services related to the Commerce District property, which was acquired by an affiliate of CDS in 2019. 
 
•
Comstock District. The Comstock District at Reston Station consists of 8.5 acres of land located adjacent to the Promenade District, and currently is the home to Comstock’s corporate headquarters.  The Comstock 
 5


District has entitlements in place to allow for approximately 770,000 square feet of mixed-use development, including an existing 90,000 square foot Class A office building with Comstock’s corporate headquarters, an existing 418-unit residential apartment building owned by an entity not affiliated with Comstock, and entitlements for additional residential buildings and office/retail uses. The Company is providing a variety of asset management and development services related to the portion of the Comstock District property, which is owned by an affiliate of CDS.
 Loudoun Station. Loudoun Station, located at the terminus of Phase II of Metro’s Silver Line is Loudoun County’s first Metro connected development and represents Loudoun County’s beginning transformation into a transit connected community with direct metro rail connectivity to Dulles International Airport, Reston, Tysons Corner, and downtown Washington, D.C. Currently, Loudoun Station has approximately 700,000 square feet of mixed-use development completed, including approximately 357 residential units, 50,000 square feet of Class-A office space, 118,000 square feet of ground floor retail spaces, and a 1,500-space commuter parking garage. Phase II of Metro’s Silver Line is under construction and expected to commence passenger service in early to mid-2020.  Construction of the next phase of residential, retail and commercial space commenced in 2018 and is expected to be completed in early-2020.  The Company is providing a variety of its real estate and asset management services related to the existing buildings and future development pursuant to the AMA, including development and construction management services, leasing management services, property management services, and capital markets services.
 Herndon Station. On November 1, 2017, an affiliate of CDS entered into a public-private partnership with the Town of Herndon, Virginia to acquire, develop, and construct a mixed-use project in the historic downtown area of the Town of Herndon. The development will include up to approximately 500,000 square feet of residential, retail and entertainment spaces, including a performing arts center.  The project will also include a large parking garage for public and private use and also anticipates improvements to existing connections to the adjacent WO&D trail.  The Company is providing a variety of asset management and development services related to the Herndon Station development pursuant to the AMA.
 Shady Grove Metro. In the 2nd quarter of 2018, we conveyed the building pad site for 110 multifamily dwelling units in Rockville, Maryland adjacent to the Shady Grove Metro Station to a joint venture between a subsidiary of the Company and Stratford Capital, LLC (the “JV”). The JV commenced construction of the project in late-2018 and is expected to be completed in 2019. The project is being developed as a low-income housing tax credit (LIHTC) project. The Company is providing a variety of asset management and real estate development management services to the project through its completion pursuant to an asset management agreement with the JV.
 International Gateway. In 2018, CAM entered into an asset management agreement with an unaffiliated property owner to provide asset management, property management and consulting services for a portfolio of two mixed-use retail/office buildings in Tysons Corner, Virginia, known as International Gateway.
Our Recent Acquisitions to Perform Services
 On July 17, 2017, JK Environmental Services, LLC (“JK”), an entity wholly owned by CDS Capital Management, L.C., a subsidiary of the Company, purchased all of the business assets of Monridge Environmental, LLC pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement dated July 14, 2017 for a purchase price of Two Million Forty Thousand Dollars ($2,040,000).

Our Developed Homebuilding Communities
 We are currently winding down the on balance sheet homebuilding projects in the Washington, D.C. MSA. The following communities remained active in the year ended December 31, 2018:
The Estates at Leeland is a community located in Fredericksburg, Virginia. The property is being developed as 24 single-family units. As of December 31, 2018, we have 1 building lot remaining in inventory, which is under contract to be sold to a third-party homebuilder pursuant to a land purchase agreement.
 Marrwood East is a residential project in Loudoun County, Virginia. The property was developed as 35 single-family units. All 35 single-family units were constructed and delivered to third-party purchasers as of December 2018. 
 The Towns at 1333 is a townhome community located in Alexandria, Virginia. The property was developed as 18 condominium townhome units. All 18 units were constructed and delivered to third-party purchasers as of December 2018.
 Richmond Station is a development located in Prince William County, Virginia. We are currently developing the land into building lots for 104 townhomes and 54 multi-family units, all of which are under contract to be sold to two separate third-party homebuilders pursuant to land purchase agreements.  Land development commenced in 2018.
 The Townes at Shady Grove Metro is a residential community in Rockville, Maryland, adjacent to the Shady Grove Metro rail station consisting of 36 townhomes, and 3 single-family units. As of December 31, 2018, we have constructed and delivered 30 units, including the 3 single-family units. The remaining 9 townhome lots are under contract to be sold to a third-party homebuilder pursuant to a land purchase agreement.
 Momentum at Shady Grove Metro is an affordable housing residential development in Rockville, Maryland, adjacent to the Shady Grove Metro rail station consisting of 110 multi-family units. During 2018, we sold this land to a joint-venture between the Company and a third-party developer of affordable housing communities. Construction commenced in 2018 and is expected to be complete in 2019.
 The Woods at Spring Ridge is a residential project in Frederick, Maryland. The property is being developed as 21 single-family units. A majority of the units were sold during 2018. As of December 31, 2018, we have closed on 9 units and we have 4 units in backlog.
 Solomons Choice is a residential project located in Anne Arundel County, Maryland. The property was being developed as 56 single-family units. In the third quarter of 2018, consistent with our strategy to wind-down our for-sale homebuilding operation, we exited this project after selling 1 unit. 
 The Townes at Totten Mews are located in the Northeast quadrant of Washington, D.C. This property is being developed as 40 townhome units. A majority of the units were sold during 2018. As of December 31, 2018, we have closed on 24 units and there were 12 units in backlog.
Backlog
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 16 units in backlog representing revenue of approximately $10.4 million, compared to 20 units in backlog representing revenue of approximately $13.9 million as of December 31, 2017.
 Land/Lot Acquisition and Inventory Management
 While the Company is transitioning away from homebuilding as a primary revenue source, the Company and its subsidiaries continue to have ongoing homebuilding operations. We attempt to mitigate our exposure to real estate inventory risks by utilizing land/lot option contracts, where possible, generally commencing construction of custom features or optional upgrades on homes under contract only after the buyer’s receipt of mortgage approval and receipt of satisfactory deposits from the buyer and monitoring and managing the number of speculative units 
 7


built in each community.  We are currently a party to several joint ventures, all of which are consolidated in our financial statements.
 Going forward, with the change in strategy in 2018, the Company does not intend to acquire new homebuilding projects on balance sheet and will limit its role to providing a variety of asset management services to homebuilding projects owned by third parties and we do not anticipate such future projects to be consolidated on our financial statements.
 Land Development and Home Construction
 Substantially all of our land development and home construction work is performed by subcontractors. Subcontractors typically are selected after a competitive bidding process and retained for a specific community pursuant to a contract that obligates the subcontractor to complete the scope of work at an agreed-upon price. Agreements with the subcontractors and suppliers generally are negotiated for each community. We compete with other homebuilders for qualified subcontractors, raw materials and lots in the markets where we operate. We employ land development supervisors and construction superintendents to monitor land development and home construction activities, participate in major design and building decisions, coordinate the activities of subcontractors and suppliers, review the work of subcontractors for quality and cost control and monitor compliance with zoning and building codes. In addition, our construction superintendents play a significant role in working with our homebuyers by assisting with option selection and home modification decisions, educating buyers on the construction process and instructing buyers on post-closing home maintenance.
 Our home designs are selected or prepared in each of our communities to appeal to the tastes and preferences of local homebuyers. We also offer optional interior and exterior features to allow homebuyers the opportunity to enhance the basic home design and to allow us to generate additional revenue from each home sold. Construction time for our homes depends on the weather, availability of labor, materials and supplies, size of the home, and other factors. We typically complete construction of a home within three to six months.
 We typically do not maintain significant inventories of land development or home construction materials, except for work in progress materials for homes under construction. Generally, the construction materials used in our operations are readily available from numerous sources.
 Marketing and Sales
 We market and sell our homes primarily through commissioned employees. A significant number of our home closings also involve an independent real estate broker representing the buyer. We typically conduct home sales from sales offices and/or furnished model homes in each community. Our sales personnel assist prospective homebuyers by providing floor plans and price information, demonstrating the features and layouts of model homes and assisting with the selection of options and other custom features. We train and inform our sales personnel on the availability of financing, construction schedules, and marketing and advertising plans. As market conditions warrant, to be competitive, we may provide potential homebuyers with one or more of a variety of incentives, including closing cost assistance, discounts and free upgrades.
 We market our homes and communities to prospective homebuyers and real estate brokers through electronic media, including email, social networking sites and our company website, as well as brochures, flyers, newsletters and promotional events. We attempt to position our communities in locations that are desirable to potential homebuyers and convenient to or visible from local traffic patterns, which helps to reduce advertising costs. Model homes play a substantial role in our marketing efforts, and we expend significant effort and resources to create an attractive atmosphere in our model homes.
 We manage inventory to build a limited number of speculative homes in our communities. Speculative homes enhance our marketing and sales efforts to prospective homebuyers who are relocating to these markets, as well as to independent brokers, who often represent homebuyers requiring a home within a short time frame. We determine our speculative homes strategy based on local market factors, such as new job growth, the number of job relocations, housing demand and supply (including new homes), seasonality, current sales contract cancellation trends and our 
 8


past experience in the local markets. We maintain a low level of speculative home inventory in each community based on our current and planned sales pace, and we monitor and adjust speculative home inventory on an ongoing basis as conditions warrant. Speculative homes help to provide us with opportunities to compete effectively with existing homes available in the market and improve our profits and returns on our inventory of owned lots.
 Quality Control
 We provide our single-family and townhouse home buyers with a one-year limited warranty covering workmanship and materials. The limited warranty is transferable to subsequent buyers not under direct contract with us and requires that all home buyers agree to the definitions and procedures set forth in the warranty. Typically, we provide our condominium home buyers with a two-year limited warranty, or as required by statute. In addition, we periodically provide structural warranty of longer durations pursuant to applicable statutory requirements. From time to time, we assess the appropriateness of our warranty reserves and adjust accruals as necessary. Based on historical experience and when deemed appropriate by us, we may accrue additional warranty reserves. We require our general contractors and sub-contractors to warrant the work they perform and they are contractually obligated to correct defects in their work that arise during the applicable warranty period. We seek to minimize our risk associated with warranty repairs through our quality assurance program and by selecting contractors with good reputations, sufficient resources and adequate insurance. It is typical that there is a gap in the warranty coverage provided by contractors and by home builders, which we have self-insured in the past. It is our experience that the warranty claims which we have self-insured have not been significant in nature, but we periodically obtain additional insurance to protect against this unquantifiable risk.
Competition
 The real estate asset management and services industry is highly competitive. Our growth will depend upon our ability to professionally manage the assets subject to the AMA and to expand our services to new clients in the markets in which we operate on a cost-efficient basis. We compete with other businesses in the real estate management and asset management businesses on the basis of price, location, experience, service and reputation. Many of these competitors are larger than us and operate on a national or global scale and they and their clients may have greater technical, marketing and financial resources than we currently provide to our clients. Such competitors may also enjoy competitive advantages that result from, among other things, lower costs of capital, greater business scale and enhanced operating efficiencies. 
Their larger scale and broad national or global presence may allow them to offset downturns in certain localized markets or seasonality related to certain services with increased or steady operations in other markets. We also face competitors on a local and regional basis. Certain competitors may also be subject to different regulatory requirements or rules that may allow them more flexibility or better access to pursue potential investments and raise capital for themselves or their managed companies. In addition, certain competitors may have higher risk tolerance, different risk assessments or lower return thresholds, which could allow them to consider a broader range of investments and to bid more aggressively for investment opportunities than us. Our ability to continue to compete effectively will depend in large part upon the ability to attract, retain and motivate employees, and we must compete with other companies to attract and retain employees.
 For our homebuilding operations, we compete primarily on the basis of price, location, design, quality, service and reputation. We compete with small private builders and large regional or national builders. In addition to competing for home buyers and renters, builders compete for construction financing, raw materials and skilled labor. Additionally, under normal market conditions, competition exists within the industry for prime development sites, especially those where developed building lots are available under option lot contracts. We compete with other local, regional and national builders in all of these areas. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, sales and marketing and other resources than we have. Some of the national builders that we compete against include Pulte Homes, Beazer Homes, M/I Homes, DR Horton, Toll Brothers, CalAtlantic Homes, NVR, K. Hovnanian and Lennar.
 Competition among home builders and multi-family developers is often specific to product types being offered in a particular area. We do not often compete with the large national developers in the urban communities where we develop high-rise and mixed use products. This is primarily because most national builders tend to focus on a narrower range of products than what we offer. We believe this provides us with a distinct advantage in terms of attracting potential home buyers and renters in certain areas. We believe the factors that home buyers consider in

deciding whether to purchase or rent from us include the product type, location, value quality, and reputation of the developer. We believe that our projects and product offerings compare favorably on these factors, and we continually strive to maintain our reputation of building quality products.
 Governmental Regulation and Environmental Matters
 We are subject to various local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning finance, banking, investments, zoning, building design, construction, density requirements and similar matters. We may also be subject to periodic delays or may be precluded entirely from developing in certain communities due to building moratoriums or “slow-growth” or “no-growth” initiatives that could be implemented in the future in the states where we operate. Local and state governments also have broad discretion regarding the imposition of development fees for projects in their jurisdiction.
 We are also subject to a variety of local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning protection of the environment, primarily with respect to our homebuilding business. Some of the laws to which we and our properties are subject to may impose requirements concerning development in waters of the United States, including wetlands, the closure of water supply wells, management of asbestos-containing materials, exposure to radon and similar issues. The particular environmental laws that apply to any given community vary based on several factors, including the environmental conditions related to a particular property and the present and former uses of the property. These environmental laws may result in delays, may cause us to incur substantial compliance related costs, and may prohibit or severely restrict development in certain environmentally sensitive areas. To date, environmental laws have not had a material adverse impact on our operations.
 Technology and Intellectual Property
 We utilize our technology infrastructure to facilitate the management of our client’s projects and the marketing of our projects. We use media and internet based marketing platforms, primarily in lieu of print advertisements. We believe that the home buying population will continue to increase its reliance on information available on the internet to help guide its rental and home buying decision. Accordingly, through our marketing efforts, we will continue to seek to leverage this trend to lower per sale marketing costs while maximizing potential sales.
 Our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, Christopher Clemente, has licensed his ownership interest in the “Comstock” brand and trademark to us in perpetuity and free of charge. We routinely take steps, and occasionally take legal action, to protect it against infringement from third parties. Mr. Clemente has retained the right to continue to use the “Comstock” brand and trademark including for real estate development projects in our current or future markets that are unrelated to the Company but excluding products developed as for sale homes.
 Seasonality 
 We experience seasonality across our business segments. With respect to our Asset Management segment, we do not expect seasonality to materially impact our operations. With respect to our Real Estate Services segment and Homebuilding segment, we do anticipate being impacted by adverse weather conditions. The markets in which we operate are four-season markets that experience significant periods of rain and snow. Construction and remediation cycles and efforts are often adversely affected by severe weather. With respect to our Homebuilding segment, the primary selling season is from January through May as well as September and October. Orders in other months typically are lower. Historically, seasonal activity has increased our working capital requirements for our homebuilding operations during the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. As a result of seasonal activity across our business segments, our quarterly results of operations and financial position at the end of a particular fiscal quarter are not necessarily representative of the balance of our fiscal year.
Asset Management Agreement
 Our commercial development, asset management and real estate services business operates pursuant to the AMA between CAM and CDS that was entered into on March 30, 2018 with an effective date of January 2, 2018. Pursuant to the Agreement, CDS will pay CAM an annual cost-plus fee (the “Annual Fee”) in an aggregate amount 
 10


equal to the sum of (i) the employment expenses of personnel dedicated to providing services to the CRE Portfolio pursuant to the Agreement, (ii) the costs and expenses of the Company related to maintaining the listing of its shares on a securities exchange and complying with regulatory and reporting obligations as a public company, and (iii) a fixed annual payment of $1,000,000. In connection with the execution of the AMA, CDS paid CAM a deposit in the aggregate amount of $2,500,000 pursuant to the AMA that will be credited against the Annual Fee to be paid to CAM in accordance with the AMA. The initial term of the AMA will terminate on December 31, 2022 (“Initial Term”). The AMA will automatically renew for successive additional one-year terms (each an “Extension Term”) unless CDS delivers written notice of non-renewal of the AMA at least 180 days prior to the termination date of the Initial Term or any Extension Term. CDS may terminate the AMA without cause upon 180 days advance written notice to CAM. In the event of such a termination, CDS will pay CAM any accrued Annual Fees due and payable as of the termination date. If a termination by CDS without cause is effective prior to January 1, 2020, CDS will pay CAM an additional termination fee equal to $500,000. CAM may terminate the AMA without cause upon 180 days advance written notice to CDS, in which event CDS will pay CAM any accrued Annual Fees due and payable as of the termination date. CDS and CAM will indemnify each other and their affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees, partners, members, stockholders, other equity holders agents and representatives from and against all expenses, losses, damages, liabilities and other claims incurred by any Indemnified Party related to the AMA, except for those arising from actions constituting bad faith, willful misconduct or gross negligence by an indemnified party.
 Employees
 At December 31, 2018, we had 82 full-time and 3 part-time employees. Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining agreements and we have never experienced a work stoppage. We believe we have good relations with our employees. With the integration of the new business segments, we expect the number of our employees will increase in 2019.
