The Company

Zomedica Pharmaceuticals Corp. ("Zomedica" or the “Company”) was incorporated on January 7, 2013 under the Business Corporations Act (Alberta) as Wise Oakwood Ventures Inc. (“WOW”) and was classified as a capital pool company, as defined in Policy 2.4 of the TSX Venture Exchange. ZoMedica Pharmaceuticals Inc. was incorporated on May 14, 2015 under the Canada Business Corporations Act.
​
On April 21, 2016, the Company closed its qualifying transaction (“Transaction”), consisting of the acquisition of ZoMedica Pharmaceuticals Inc. (“ZoMedica”) pursuant to a three-cornered amalgamation, whereby ZoMedica was amalgamated with 9674128 Canada Inc. (which was wholly-owned by WOW) and common shares and options of the Company were issued to former holders of ZoMedica securities as consideration. The amalgamated company changed its name to Zomedica Pharmaceuticals Ltd. and WOW subsequently changed its name to Zomedica Pharmaceuticals Corp. Prior to completion of the Transaction, WOW consolidated its common shares on the basis of the one post-consolidation common share for every 2.5 pre-consolidation common shares. The Transaction constituted WOW’s qualifying transaction under TSX Venture Exchange Policy 2.4 – Capital Pool Companies. The shares of Zomedica Pharmaceuticals Corp. began trading on the TSX Venture Exchange under the new symbol “ZOM” on Monday, May 2, 2016. On June 21, 2016, the Company filed Articles of Amalgamation and vertically amalgamated with its wholly-owned subsidiary, Zomedica Pharmaceuticals Ltd.
​
On November 10, 2017, our shares were approved for listing on the NYSE American under the symbol “ZOM”. On February 10, 2020, we effected the voluntary withdrawal of our common shares from listing on the TSX-V. On October 2, 2020, we changed our name to Zomedica Corp and on January 19, 2021, we changed the name of our U.S. subsidiary to Zomedica Inc. from Zomedica Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
​
On October 1, 2021, we acquired the shares of Branford PVT Acquiror, Inc. from Branford PVT Mid-Hold, LLC. Branford PVT Acquiror held all the shares of PVT Holdings, Inc. which in turn held all the membership interests of Pulse Veterinary Technologies, LLC. Pulse Veterinary Technologies held all the equity interests of HMT High Medical Technologies (Japan) Co. Ltd. and PVT NeoPulse Acquisition GmbH which held all the equity of NeoPulse GmbH. Effective July 1, 2022, we collapsed Branford PVT Acquiror, PVT Holdings, Inc. and Pulse Veterinary Technologies, LLC by merging these companies into Zomedica Inc. HMT High Medical Technologies (Japan) and PVT NeoPulse Acquisition are wholly owned subsidiaries of Zomedica Inc. 
​
Zomedica has one corporate subsidiary, Zomedica, Inc., which has two wholly owned subsidiaries, HMT High Medical Technologies (Japan) and PVT NeoPulse Acquisition, and PVT NeoPulse Acquisition has one wholly owned subsidiary, NeoPulse GmbH, all whose results and operations are included in these consolidated financial statements.

​
Diagnostic Products:
​

- | Our TRUFORMA® Bulk Acoustic Wave (BAW) point of care diagnostic platform is marketed with full diagnostic and thyroid panels for dogs and cats that include the only assays of these types available at the point of care to test for feline optimized TSH, endogenous ACTH, Free T4, and quantitative cortisol, along with a total T4 assay. We are continuing to invest in the development of additional assays which we believe will increase the utility of the TRUFORMA platform for our customers over time, including planned assays for non-infectious gastrointestinal disease and our first assays for horses for the diagnosis of equine Cushing’s disease.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

- | The VetGuardian™ zero-touch vital signs remote monitoring system, launched in January 2023 in collaboration with Structured Medical Products, enables contact-free, continuous monitoring of pets' vital signs, including temperature, pulse, and respiration ("TPR”) without harnesses or wired leads on the pet, thus allowing pet patients to rest comfortably during recovery at veterinary facilities. Veterinarians receive real-time notifications should the vital signs fall outside their customizable range, and they can remotely observe patient data from anywhere via a smart device.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Therapeutic Products:
​

- | Our PulseVet® electrohydraulic shockwave therapy platform, acquired in October of 2021, utilizes sound waves to treat a variety of musculoskeletal conditions in horses and small animals, including tendon and ligament injuries, difficult to heal wounds, osteoarthritis, and more. Historically, this treatment has been used primarily to treat horses, but since the introduction of the X-trode handpiece enabling it to be used without the need for sedation, is now being marketed to small animal veterinarians.

​
Development of Companion Animal Diagnostics and Therapeutic Devices

Currently, approximately 70% of U.S. households own pets, with 74% of those pets being dogs and/or cats. The level of pet ownership increased markedly during the pandemic with 11 million new pets being adopted. Younger consumers continue to drive two trends which create resiliency in animal health – the humanization of pets as well as the premiumization of their care, with the average cost of owning a pet now estimated at $1.5K per year. According to a survey conducted by Cowen in June of 2022 on the post COVID 19 impact on consumer behavior, only 8% of respondents who indicated they will cut spending in the face of economic uncertainty cited pet care expenses as an area they would cut. This response ranked lower than all other categories other than baby products and “other”. 
​
The Petcare industry reached $123.6 billion in 2021, of which vet care and products make up 24.1%. It is expected to maintain strong growth, more than doubling to $275 billion by 2030. Outside the US, developed markets in Europe, Asia, Australia/New Zealand, and South America are seeing similar trends among middle- and upper-income households.
​
The global equine healthcare market grew by 8.3% in 2022 to $1.3 billion. It is expected to continue strong growth through 2026 at a compound annual growth rate of 5.6% to $1.6 billion. The introduction of new diagnostics, which leads to better therapeutic outcomes, is a key driver of growth in this market.
​
Key drivers for the growth in the equine market include increased adoption of horses as pets, an increase in number of horses routinely seeing a vet, improved animal health awareness, and new medications driving improved outcomes. Additionally, among the professional competitive set, a keen focus on the ROI of racehorses has driven more competition and an increased utilization of veterinary services.
​
We believe that these factors, along with humanization of pets, longer pet lifespans, and the emotional benefits of pets and support animals, have and will continue to contribute to an increase in spending on pet healthcare.
​
The development of companion animal diagnostics and therapeutic devices continues to evolve, and it is our belief that focus will be on the following:
​

● | Enhanced capability to detect the frequency of occurrence and severity of diseases and conditions that impact companion animals;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Increased accuracy and faster means to obtain test results;
--+------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Wider availability of new diagnostic tools;
--+--------------------------------------------

​

● | Development and availability of new treatment options; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Enhanced economic benefits for veterinarians.
--+----------------------------------------------


Compared to human diagnostic and medical devices, the development of companion animal diagnostics and medical devices is generally faster and less expensive as it typically does not require formal clinical studies or prior approval of regulatory agencies. We believe that the lower cost of developing companion animal diagnostics and therapeutic devices enables us to develop and commercialize products less expensively than those intended for human use.

Product Portfolio

Diagnostic Products:
​
TRUFORMA® Platform

Our TRUFORMA platform utilizes patented Bulk Acoustic Wave (BAW) technology to provide a non-optical and fluorescence free system for the detection of disease at the point of care. We believe that the BAW technology enables us to develop unique assays that allow for precise and repeatable testing of companion animals at the point-of-care with results provided within 20 minutes.
​
Our strategic focus with this platform is to build an extensive installed base of customers utilizing the TRUFORMA instrument with our existing assays and develop and launch new assays. New assays will serve to both increase usage in the installed base and attract new additions to the installed base from veterinarians seeking the new assays. For example, we expect the first equine veterinarian customers for TRUFORMA once we launch the equine ACTH assay screen for equine Cushing’s disease. 
​
We are currently marketing our diagnostic instrument and related assays for:
​

- | TSH - canine and feline, the only feline optimized assay available at the point of care;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Total T4 - canine and feline;
--+------------------------------


- | Free T4 - canine, the only Free T4 assay available at the point of care ;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | eACTH – canine, the only endogenous ACTH available at the point of care; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Cortisol (Quantitative) - canine, the only quantitative cortisol assay available at the point of care.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
We intend to continue developing new assays for the TRUFORMA platform.
​
Under our transitional agreement with Qorvo Biotechnologies, LLC (“Qorvo”), as further described under the license agreement section below, Qorvo will complete development of tests for detection of non-infectious gastrointestinal disorders through assays for cobalamin, cPL (canine pancreatic lipase), and folate. We anticipate that the assays to detect cobalamin and folate will be available in one combined cartridge and will be ready to launch during 2023. These assays are not otherwise commercially available at the point-of-care, which results in a delay of one to several days to send samples and receive results from a reference laboratory. We believe that the availability of these assays at the point-of-care should allow veterinarians to make diagnostic decisions faster, leading to more timely initiation of treatment, and position them to retain profit margin that otherwise would have been paid to external referral laboratories.
​
Qorvo is also developing our first equine assay, for endogenous ACTH, to screen for equine Cushing’s disease. This is a serious condition for horses since if it is not diagnosed and treated, it may lead to laminitis which can lead to death. We believe that this will be widely adopted by equine veterinarians and horse owners and expect this to launch in 2023.
​
In addition to the assays being completed by Qorvo, we have now acquired a license from Qorvo to develop TRUFORMA assays on our own, and we intend to build a robust pipeline of assays during 2023 that will see completion and launch in 2024. Our goal is to build a steady stream of new assays that will establish a consistent cadence of launches to build the menu for the TRUFORMA instrument.
​
TRUVIEWTM Digital Microscopy Platform
​
As part of our acquisition of the assets of Revo Squared in June of 2022, we acquired rights to the MicroView® digital microscopy platform in development which we have rebranded as the TRUVIEW system. This technology features a cutting-edge liquid lens imaging platform to provide best in class microscopic images, while incorporating proprietary automated slide preparation technology, which we believe will both reduce staff time needed to prepare slides and also significantly reduce the number of slides that fail to provide a diagnostic image due to suboptimal slide manual slide preparation.
​

7



Our proprietary TRUVIEW platform, which is planned to launch in the first half of 2023, is intended to assist with a clinic’s critical slide prep needs in a number of ways, including:
​

- | Freeing up the veterinary technician, who traditionally would have invested 10 minutes or more in preparing a slide to capture digital images for pathologic diagnosis;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

- | Providing consistent automated preparation to help reduce errors that make an accurate diagnosis difficult; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

- | Improving workflow and allowing more economic control by providing flexibility to the veterinarian in either using the microscope to interpret the slides themselves, or if they choose, sending the images out digitally to be read by one of our contract pathologists This provides enhanced flexibility and reduced costs to the practices versus competitive systems, which often require all slides to be sent out to be read by a pathologist, at significantly higher cost than if the veterinarian does their own interpretation.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
TRUSOUND™ Ultrasound
​
In addition, and as part of our acquisition of the assets of Revo Squared in June of 2022, we acquired a line of digital ultrasound products that offer remote training and coaching (via telemedicine). We intend to rebrand these products as TRUSOUND Ultrasound to our customers in the United States. While ultrasound is less of a strategic growth imperative for Zomedica, we believe our private labeled system has advantages that customers have traditionally sought out from Revo Squared, including the ability to receive training and coaching in the use of ultrasound from our experts. We plan to continue offering ultrasound equipment through our field sales team and will leverage internal and external ultrasound experts to continue to offer telemedicine consultation and ultrasound training to our customers.
​
VetGuardianTM Zero-Touch Vital Signs Remote Monitoring Platform 
​
As part of a distribution agreement entered in January of 2023, we acquired the non-exclusive rights to distribute and commercialize the VetGuardian zero-touch vital signs remote monitoring system. This system enables contact-free, continuous monitoring of pets' vital signs, including temperature, pulse, and respiration ("TPR"). With its patented doppler technology, the VetGuardian monitor can capture vital signs in real time without harnesses or wired leads on the pet, thus allowing pet patients to rest comfortably during recovery at veterinary facilities. The system is easily set up by clinic staff and connected to the cloud using a smartphone app, after which monitoring of multiple monitors on a single screen is enabled by connecting to the MyZomedica® web portal. Veterinarians receive real-time notifications should the vital signs fall outside their customizable range, and they can remotely observe patient data from anywhere via a smart device.
​
Therapeutic Products
​
PulseVet® Electrohydraulic Shock Wave Platform
​
Our PulseVet products utilize electrohydraulic shock wave generation technology in which a submerged high voltage spark gap is used to generate an expansive plasma bubble in front of a focusing reflector. The resultant high pressure acoustic energy wave is directed and focused into the treatment animal to induce therapeutic healing effects. 
​
The PulseVet business reflects a ‘razor/razor-blade’ model in which the consumables are required to be refurbished after approximately 50 procedures. Customers purchase a ProPulse® generator unit as well as one or more handheld therapy delivery devices called “Trodes.” Each Trode has a defined duty cycle of 50,000 individual pulses, which will deliver approximately 50 therapy sessions depending on how many pulses the veterinarian prescribes for a particular treatment session. Once a Trode has reached the end of its duty cycle, the customer returns the unit to us, where it is refurbished and resold.
​
PulseVet shock wave therapy systems can treat a broad range of musculoskeletal issues, such as bone healing, tendonitis, torn ligaments, osteoarthritic and degenerative joint disease, including back and neck pain, and difficult to heal wounds such as a lick granuloma. As we have developed the PulseVet technology, the number of indications has increased, and we intend to continue investing in the development of new indications in the future.

8



In September of 2021, Pulse Veterinary Technologies introduced the X-Trode, a new handpiece which eliminates the need for sedating small animal patients in most cases. We have increased our focus on selling PulseVet products to small animal customers and have seen encouraging adoption in this market in 2022. The small animal market is significantly larger than the equine market, with approximately 12.5 times the number of small animal veterinary practices in the US compared with equine focused veterinary practices. Currently PulseVet products are used actively in approximately half of equine practices in the U.S.
​
We are conducting several clinical studies of shock wave therapy, including: 
​

● | a study designed to measure efficacy in treating osteoarthritis (“OA”) in small animals with the X-Trode. Animals are randomly divided into two groups, with and without shock wave treatment, and are be monitored for pain, functionality, and disease progression for 12 months. This study began in the third quarter of 2022 and data collection is expected to be completed two to three years after commencement; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | a study designed to measure safety and efficacy in treating pulmonary disease in horses. Historically, shock wave therapy has not been applied to the lungs. However, recent studies by independent equine veterinarians have shown that the lungs can be treated safely. Based on this early research, Zomedica is sponsoring an additional study to more fully evaluate this new indication. This study is examining the effect of shock wave therapy on exercise induced pulmonary hemorrhage in horses. This study began in the fourth quarter of 2022 and data collection is expected to be completed one year after commencement.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
We are also participating in studies that are being conducted by independent investigators, including: 
​

● | a randomized, double blinded, cross­over study of 24 dogs that previously had Tibial Plateau Leveling Osteotomy (“TPLO”) surgery and are currently presenting with OA. The animals will be treated with shock wave therapy and monitored for pain and functionality for 12 months. This study began in the first quarter of 2022 and data collection is expected two years after commencement; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | a study to document small animal tolerance of the X -Trode vs. the traditional trode. This study is examining pain caused by treatment with the X -Trode compared to a traditional trode in dogs without sedation. This study began in the first quarter of 2021.Data collection is now complete and data analysis is in progress.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Assisi® targeted Pulsed Electromagnetic Field Therapy (tPEMF) line of products.
​
Our Assisi products, including the Assisi Loop®, Assisi Loop Lounge®, and DentaLoop® devices, treat pain and inflammation through delivery of targeted pulsed electromagnetic field focused energy (tPEMF). Our Assisi Calmer Canine® devices utilize tPEMF to treat separation anxiety in small animals. 
​
Targeted Pulsed Electromagnetic Field (tPEMF™) therapy delivers a micro-current to damaged tissue that is precisely tuned to trigger an animal’s own natural anti-inflammatory process. The electromagnetic signal, which is one-one-thousandth the strength of a cell phone, stimulates cellular repair by upregulating the body’s own production of endogenous nitric oxide (NO).
​
The biological effect of that induced current is the functional therapeutic component of tPEMF technology. Enhancing nitric oxide, the body’s own anti-inflammatory molecule, has several biotherapeutic effects depending on the target tissue and the specific characteristics of the tPEMF waveform used.
​
We commercialize the Assisi tPEMF products primarily to our network of 4,000 veterinarians. We also offer the products for sale through numerous channels including for sale on our own website to both veterinarians and pet owners, through traditional veterinary distributors such as MWI, Midwest Veterinary Supply, and others, and through online retail channels such as Amazon.

License Agreements
​
TRUFORMA® Platform
​
In November of 2018, we entered into a development and supply agreement with Qorvo, focused on bringing their piezo-electric BAW sensor to the veterinary health sector. Under the terms of this agreement, we had exclusive global rights to develop and market Qorvo's investigational point-of-care diagnostic platform for veterinary use during the term. Under that agreement, we jointly collaborated with Qorvo on the development of our TRUFORMA instrument and related diagnostic assays. Although this joint development work initially targeted five assay cartridge candidates to detect thyroid and adrenal disorders in dogs and cats, we expanded work on these assays in 2020 to include a canine gastrointestinal panel with three additional assays. Under the legacy agreement, Qorvo not only developed our TRUFORMA instrument and assays, but also was responsible for the manufacture and supply of TRUFORMA instruments and cartridges to us.
​
In January of 2023, we entered into new agreements with Qorvo. The agreements include a worldwide exclusive license agreement, a transition services agreement, and a BAW sensor supply agreement. Collectively, these agreements expand our rights and responsibilities for the TRUFORMA product line. Under the license agreement, we paid an upfront license fee of $4,000 for global exclusive rights to the platform and will owe an additional license fee once we achieve installation qualification for the cartridge production equipment in our Roswell, GA facility. Additionally, we have the option to pay a license fee in year ten, which will extend our exclusivity under the license agreement in perpetuity, a right we did not have in the original agreement. 
​
Under the transition services agreement, we will pay Qorvo a market based hourly rate, for up to the next two years, for work to transition the manufacturing, research, and development practices around the TRUFORMA platform. This transition includes the sharing of industry knowledge, design history files, manufacturing equipment sourcing, and setup practices to our personnel.
​
We also entered into a new BAW sensor supply agreement with Qorvo. This agreement allows Zomedica to purchase Qorvo’s proprietary BAW sensors for use in the TRUFORMA instrument. It also provides for exclusivity provisions such that Qorvo will not sell BAW sensors for use in a diagnostic product in the animal health sector during the term of our supply agreement.
​
Collectively, these agreements will give Zomedica control of the future of the TRUFORMA platform, subject to royalty fees and BAW sensor supply requirements once the transition period is completed. We intend to accelerate investment in this platform which should benefit Zomedica in two key ways:
​

- | We are currently evaluating market opportunities for our next set of potential assays and will select the most attractive options for future development. We intend to invest additional resources to focus on expanding shelf life and seeking to improve temperature sensitivity of the cartridges; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

- | We believe we can implement measures to reduce the cost of manufacturing cartridges, thus potentially improving the margins of the TRUFORMA product line. This could provide more flexibility to respond to changes in demand for cartridges through its production scheduling.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 ​
PulseVet® Platform
​
The technology used in our PulseVet products is licensed to us pursuant to a license agreement with SANUWAVE, Inc. Under the license agreement, we have a worldwide, exclusive license under specified patents to develop and commercialize products in the veterinary field. In 2019, the license was converted to a worldwide, irrevocable and perpetual, exclusive license in exchange for a one-time payment. 
​
Assisi Loop® Platform
​
The technology used in our Assisi Loop product line is licensed to us pursuant to an amended license agreement from 2016 with Rio Grande Neurosciences Inc, a Delaware Corporation. Under this license agreement, we have a worldwide, 

10



exclusive license under specified patents to develop and commercialize products in the veterinary field. The license agreement has been paid for in full and no future royalties or milestone payments are owed.
​Legacy Programs 
​
As a result of an internal strategic review, we are focusing our development and commercialization efforts on our TRUFORMA®, PulseVet®, and Assisi Loop platforms, distributing and commercializing the VetGuardian® platform, and finalizing the development and launch of our TRUVIEWTM digital microscopy platform. We believe focusing on these will enable us to capitalize on our core strengths and accelerate the commercialization of these existing platforms.
​
Seraph Biosciences, Inc.
​
In May of 2018, we entered into a development, commercialization, and exclusive distribution agreement with Seraph Biosciences, Inc. ("Seraph") a human biomedical device company. Under the terms of this agreement, we have exclusive global veterinary industry rights, except for (i) food safety or animal product or byproduct applications and (ii) animal import/export control applications, to develop and market a novel pathogen detection system in the form of a point-of-care diagnostic instrument. The agreement covers potential development and validation of fecal/urine pathogen detection assays. 
 ​
Celsee, Inc.
​
In January of 2017, we entered into a collaborative research agreement with Celsee, Inc., (“Celsee”), a developer of diagnostics for the detection and quantification of cells and other markers. Subsequent to this agreement, in December 2017, we entered into a license and supply agreement with Celsee for exclusive global rights to develop and market Celsee’s liquid biopsy platform. The agreement with Celsee covers the potential development and commercialization of liquid biopsy assays and related consumables for the detection of cancer in companion animals.
​
In January of 2020, we amended and restated the Celsee agreement to acknowledge the completion of the initial development work and to provide for definitive supply and pricing terms for the liquid biopsy instrument and related consumables. In March of 2021, we amended the Celsee agreement to clarify certain exclusionary provisions related to rights granted to us. Under the terms of the restated agreement, we continue to have exclusive, veterinary oncology care, global rights to develop and market Celsee’s liquid biopsy platform for use by veterinarians as a cancer diagnostic. 
​
Celsee was subsequently acquired in April of 2020 by Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., which has focused their efforts on other internal programs. While a patent was issued to Zomedica Corp. by the United States Patent & Trademark Office in November of 2022 covering a portion of the early work done by Celsee before it was acquired, neither company has an active development project currently underway. 
​
Research and Development
​
We engage in development work on our diagnostic and therapeutic platforms through our internal R&D team and in conjunction with our strategic partners. We developed the TRUFORMA® platform in conjunction with Qorvo. Pursuant to the license agreement entered in January 2023, Qorvo will continue to work with us on the development of in-process assays, however, we plan to develop future assays through our internal R&D team. We collaborate with Structured Monitoring Products to guide development activities for VetGuardian™ products and engage contract research organizations (CROs) to support development work when needed. In connection with these activities, we have incurred and will continue to incur significant research and development expenses. Our research and development expenses were $2,578 for the year ended December 31, 2022, and $1,673 for the year ended December 31, 2021.
​
Sales and Marketing
​
We market our products in the U.S. through use of our own sales force, which includes 35 sales representatives, including inside sales, Professional Services Veterinarians, Sales Directors, and our Vice President of Sales as of December 31, 2022. 

11



While our products are generally sold directly to veterinary professionals or through on-line orders, we also use third party distributors in the U.S., particularly for the Assisi Loop® product line, and anticipate leveraging U.S. distributors for more of our products in the future.
​
Our TRUFORMA® platform strategy is (i) to build an installed base of instruments through our Customer Appreciation Program (“CAP”) in order to drive demand for our assays, and (ii) to bring new assays to market as rapidly as possible, both to increase revenue and to build the value proposition for the TRUFORMA instrument. Consistent with this strategy, we are currently offering to provide TRUFORMA instruments to veterinarians at no cost in exchange for a commitment by the customer to utilize the assays. We believe that this program will enable us to add future assays more quickly to the platform, with limited additional customer acquisition or training costs or added service burden.
​
As a part of the Revo Squared asset acquisition, we acquired a line of digital ultrasound products with remote training and coaching (via telemedicine). We offer these products to our customers in the United States, through both our field sales team and our inside sales team. While ultrasound is less of a strategic growth imperative for Zomedica, we believe our private labeled system has many advantages that customers have traditionally sought from Revo Squared, including the ability to receive training on use of ultrasound from some of our experts. We plan to continue offering ultrasound equipment through our field sales team and will leverage internal and external ultrasound experts to continue to offer telemedicine consultation and ultrasound training to our customers.
​
Our PulseVet® platform is sold directly to equine and small animal veterinarians in the U.S. and to Equine veterinarians in Japan through a wholly owned subsidiary. Outside the United States and Japan, we sell PulseVet products primarily through a network of distributors.
​
PulseVet products have traditionally been widely adopted in the equine market but had limited adoption in the small animal market due to the need to sedate small animals to comfortably provide treatments. In September of 2021 the PulseVet companies launched the X-Trode product for use in the small animal market. We believe that the X-Trode will significantly expand the market opportunity for the use of shock wave technology because small animal veterinarians will no longer need to sedate an animal in order to provide a comfortable treatment. Small animal adoption was a key focus of our US field sales force in 2022, and we saw significant interest and increased adoption in this segment versus prior years.
​
Our Assisi Loop product line includes the Loop Lounge® line of reusable treatment beds, the DentaLoop® for pain and inflammation of the teeth and gums, and the Calmer Canine® product for separation anxiety. We commercialize these products to veterinarians and end users alike through three channels: 1) we sell these products on our own website to both Veterinarians and pet owners, 2) we sell through traditional veterinary distributors such as MWI, Midwest Veterinary Supply and others, and 3) we sell through retail channels such as Amazon.
​
We provide a product warranty to customers in the event of defects in our products. The warranty period can vary from 12 months to 24 months and covers the cost of shipping a temporary unit while the customer's unit is being serviced.
​Manufacturing

PulseVet® Platform
​
We manufacture our PulseVet system in our newly renovated global manufacturing and operations center in Roswell, Georgia. We invested $1,100 in this facility to expand our footprint and capacity for planned trode refurbishment and sales growth as well as new product lines.
​
Our PulseVet products are assembled by us from readily available components. We assemble our products in Roswell, Georgia, and distribute our products in North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. We assemble and refurbish our Trodes in our facility in Roswell, Georgia and use a contract manufacturing company in Switzerland to assemble our products for sale in Japan. Although most components essential to our PulseVet business are generally available from multiple sources, we obtain printed circuit boards (“PCBs”) from two manufacturers. Palladium, a precious metal that is a key component in the production of our Trodes, is heavily mined and sourced from Russia and Ukraine. Although we have 

12



seen small disruptions in lead time due to the current conflict in the region, our use of multiple precious metal service companies and lack of sole sourcing has minimized the impact.
​
TRUFORMA® Platform
​
Currently TRUFORMA cartridges and instruments are manufactured by Qorvo, then shipped to our Roswell facility for distribution. Under the restructured TRUFORMA agreements, Qorvo will support the transition of instrument manufacturing from their contract manufacturer, and cartridge manufacturing from their facility in Plymouth, MN to our Roswell, GA facility. They will be compensated at an hourly rate for these transition services until we assume instrument and cartridge manufacturing responsibility, currently estimated to take place no later than the first half of 2024. 
​
Assisi® Products
​
The Assisi line of products is manufactured by two contract manufacturing organizations, ADM Tronics Unlimited, LLC in New Jersey and Evolve Manufacturing Technologies in California. Final packaging and shipping are currently provided by the Wheelership, LLC in New Jersey. Distribution of Assisi products will transition to our Roswell facility in 2023.
​
TRUVIEWTM Digital Microscopy
​
We anticipate manufacturing, warehousing, and shipping the TRUVIEW digital microscopy system at our Roswell, Georgia manufacturing facility beginning in the first half of 2023.
​
We purchase ultrasound components from a supplier in Europe for use in our proprietary ultrasound system. We complete final assembly and customization in Roswell, GA to include proprietary telemedicine components that enable our expert ultrasound technicians to view and control the customer’s system remotely in real time as they conduct training or coaching sessions.
​
Intellectual Property
​
We rely primarily upon a combination of in-licensed exclusive rights, patents, proprietary know-how, and confidentiality agreements to protect our processes, methods, and other technologies, to preserve any trade secrets, and to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of other parties, both in the United States and in other countries. 
​
Our TRUFORMA® instrument and the related assays, as well as our PulseVet® technology are dependent on intellectual property developed by our strategic partners and licensed to us. We do not own the intellectual property rights that underlie these technology licenses. Our rights to use the licensed technology are subject to the negotiation of, continuation of, and compliance with the terms of our licenses. In certain instances, we have continuing sale rights after the termination of the applicable license agreement.
​
We own two issued U.S. patents and have filed one additional U.S. patent application, in addition, we have filed two Patent Cooperation Treaty ("PCT") applications for international protection. These patents and applications are focused on inventions related to parasite detection, urinary tract infection detection, or identification of cancer cells in blood. While we are not currently developing products that use these inventions, we will continue to pursue these filings and maintain an active patent portfolio.
​
We acquired a portfolio of five U.S. patents, including one PCT and two continuation patents, together with sixteen foreign patent and patent applications for the Assisi Loop® and Assisi Calmer Canine® products. Following the acquisition of the Revo Squared assets, we expanded the original U.S. patent application by filing five continuation applications and also filed an additional four U.S. patent applications to cover the TRUVIEWTM microscope.
​
We depend upon the skills, knowledge, and experience of our management personnel, as well as that of our other employees, advisors, consultants, and contractors, none of which are patentable. To help protect our know-how, and any inventions for which patents may be difficult to obtain or enforce, we require all our employees, consultants, advisors, and other contractors to enter into customary confidentiality and assignment of inventions agreements that prohibit the 

13



disclosure of confidential information and, where applicable, require disclosure and assignment to us of the ideas, developments, discoveries, and inventions important to our business.
​
Competition

In the diagnostic market, our potential competitors include large veterinary diagnostics companies, small businesses focused on animal health, and reference laboratory services provided by academic institutions and in-clinic product providers. These competitors include Idexx Laboratories, Inc., Antech Diagnostics (a unit of Mars Inc.), Heska Corporation, Bionote USA Inc., and Zoetis Inc, and its wholly owned subsidiary, Abaxis, Inc.
​
In the shock-wave market we face competition from laser devices offered by entities such as Companion Animal Health, a division of LiteCure, LLC, Respond Systems Incorporated and Summus Medical Laser, LLC. Additionally, ELvation Medical GmbH markets a Piezo Shockwave system that competes with the PulseVet products and is sourced from Karl Storz in Germany. 
​
Assisi faces competition from Respond Systems Incorporated, which manufactures a line of Pulsed Electro Magnetic Therapy products, primarily in a bed format which most closely compares to the Assisi Loop Lounge® line of products.
​
In-clinic ultrasound can be an extremely versatile tool for veterinarians today. It can be useful in diagnosing, or ruling out a variety of cardiac, urinary, and GI conditions. The veterinary ultrasound equipment market is a highly competitive market, with major companies such as Sound, a division of Antech, Heska and Universal Imaging, among others providing equipment options to customers. In the services category, two smaller companies, Oncura Partners and WeeSeeYou each offer ultrasound training and interpretation services. We intend to offer our private label ultrasound system to customers and will include a limited amount of training with the purchase of each system. Once a customer exceeds the amount of included training, we would charge a modest fee per case. We are evaluating whether to offer more in-depth training programs for operators new to in-clinic ultrasound. 
​
Our TRUVIEW platform, which is in development and is expected to launch in the first half of the year, will also enter a competitive market. Several major competitors offer some type of digital microscopy system ranging from Zoetis’ Imagyst™ for fecal, urine and cytology testing, to Heska’s Element AIM™ which is optimized for fecal and urine testing, to Idexx’ Digital Cytology™ platform. 
​
Many of our competitors and potential competitors have substantially more financial, technical, and human resources than we do. Many also have more experience in the development, manufacture, regulation and worldwide commercialization of animal diagnostics and medical devices. If our intellectual property protection fails to provide us with exclusive marketing rights for some of our products, we may be unable to effectively compete in the markets in which we participate.
​
Government Regulation
​
There are no requirements for U.S. Food and Drug Administration, ("FDA") pre-market approval of medical devices intended for animal use. Animal medical devices and diagnostic aids are, however, subject to the general provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, ("FDC Act") that relate to misbranding and adulteration. For example, an animal medical device may be considered misbranded if the labeling fails to bear adequate directions for use by the layperson or an animal device is misbranded if it is dangerous to animal or human health when used in the manner prescribed, recommended, or suggested in labeling. The FDA relies on veterinarians and other users to report unsafe animal medical devices.
​
Human Capital
As of December 31, 2022, we had 85 employees. Of our employees, 5 are engaged in research and development activities, 45 are engaged in business development, sales and marketing activities, 16 are in operations and manufacturing, and 19 are engaged in corporate and administrative activities. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements.

1A. Risk Factors
(All amounts are expressed in thousands unless otherwise indicated)
​
Risks Related to our Business
We have a limited operating history, are not profitable, and may never become profitable. 
We are generating revenues from our products but we expect to continue to incur significant research and development costs and administrative expenses. Our net loss and comprehensive loss for the years ended December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, was $17,860 and $18,382. Our accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2022, was $136,404. As of December 31, 2022, we had total shareholders’ equity of $267,392. We expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future, as we continue our integration efforts in relation to the Assisi and Revo Squared asset acquisitions, the distribution of the VetGuardian product, and our product development and commercialization activities. Even if we succeed in developing and broadly commercializing our products, we expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future, and we may never become profitable. If we fail to achieve or maintain profitability, then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce or cease operations.
We have devoted and expect to continue to devote a significant portion of our financial and managerial resources on the development and commercialization of our products and cannot be certain that they will be successfully commercialized. 
The successful development and commercialization of our products will depend on several factors, including the following:

● | the successful validation, verification, and testing of new products to ensure efficient, accurate, and consistent performance;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our ability to provide a suite of products that customers believe address their needs and provide sufficient economic justification for acquiring them;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our ability to successfully market our products;
--+-------------------------------------------------


● | the availability, perceived advantages, relative cost, relative safety, and relative efficacy of our products compared to alternative and competing products;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the acceptance and utilization of our products by veterinarians, pet owners, and the animal health community;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our ability to convince the veterinary community of the clinical utility of our products and their potential advantages over existing tests and devices;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the willingness or ability of animal owners to pay for our products and the willingness of veterinarians to recommend our products; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the willingness of veterinarians to utilize our diagnostic tests and devices.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Many of these factors are beyond our control. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will be successful in developing or commercializing our current or any of our future products. If we are unsuccessful or are significantly delayed in developing and commercializing our products, our business and prospects will be materially adversely affected, and you may lose all or a portion of your investment.

15



We face unproven markets for our existing and future products.
The animal diagnostic and medical device markets are less developed than the related human markets and as a result no assurance can be given that our existing and future products will be successful. Animal owners, veterinarians, or other veterinary health providers in general may not accept or utilize any products that we may develop or acquire. The animal care industry is characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product introductions and enhancements, and evolving industry standards, all of which could make our products obsolete. Our future success will depend on our ability to keep pace with the evolving needs of our customers on a timely and cost-effective basis and to pursue new market opportunities that develop because of technological and scientific advances. We must continuously enhance our product offerings to keep pace with evolving standards of care. If we do not update our product offerings to reflect new scientific knowledge or new standards of care, our products could become obsolete, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Our existing and future products will face significant competition and may be unable to compete effectively.
The development and commercialization of veterinary diagnostics and medical devices is highly competitive, and our success depends on our ability to compete effectively with other products in the market and identify potential partners for additional development and commercialization.
There are several competitors in the companion animal diagnostic market that have substantially greater financial and operational resources and established marketing, sales and service organizations. We expect to compete primarily with commercial clinical laboratories, hospitals’ clinical laboratories, other veterinary diagnostic equipment manufacturers and other energy-based therapeutics companies. Our principal competitors in the veterinary diagnostic market are IDEXX Laboratories, Inc., Antech Diagnostics (a unit of Mars Inc.), Abaxis, Inc. (a wholly owned subsidiary of Zoetis Inc.), Heska Corporation, Zoetis Inc. In the veterinary therapeutic device market, our principal competitors are Companion Animal Health (a division of LiteCure, LLC), Summus Medical Laser, LLC, ELvation Vet USA, and other veterinary laser manufacturers. We must develop our distribution channels and build our direct sales force to compete effectively in the veterinary market.
The economic impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic (or other outbreaks, epidemics, pandemics, or public health crises) could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
​
For nearly the past three years, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and efforts to control its spread have significantly impacted the movement of people, goods and services worldwide, including in most or all of the regions in which we sell our products and services and conduct our business operations. The pandemic has resulted in and may continue to or at a later time result in, a global slowdown of economic activity, including travel restrictions, prohibitions of non-essential activities in some cases, disruption and shutdown of businesses and greater uncertainty in global financial markets. 
​
Deteriorating economic and political conditions caused by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, such as increased unemployment, decreased capital spending, declines in consumer confidence and economic slowdowns or recessions, have caused and could continue to cause a decrease in demand for our products and services. The severity, magnitude and duration of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is hard to predict due to uncertainty surrounding severity and transmission rates of new variants and rate of public acceptance and efficacy of vaccines and other treatments. We may not be able respond to the impacts of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on a timely basis to prevent near- or long-term adverse impacts to our results of operations. Although the immediate impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have been assessed and mitigated, the ultimate extent of the impact of this ongoing pandemic, including as a result of possible subsequent outbreaks of COVID-19 or of new variants thereof and measures taken in response thereto, will depend on future developments, which remain highly uncertain and cannot currently be predicted. Any negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows cannot be reasonably estimated at this time, but the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could lead to extended disruption of economic activity and the impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be material.
​
Although many health and safety restrictions have been lifted and vaccine distribution has increased, certain adverse consequences of the pandemic continue to impact the macroeconomic environment and may persist for some time, 

16



including labor shortages and disruptions of global supply chains, particularly in China and other parts of Asia. The growth in economic activity and in the demand for goods and services, coupled with labor shortages and supply chain disruptions, has also contributed to rising inflationary pressures and the risk of recession. Given the ongoing dynamic nature of variants of COVID-19, it is difficult to predict the full impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic outbreak on our business. As the result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the related adverse local and national economic consequences, we could be subject to a number of risks, any of which could have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and cash flow, results of operations, ability to execute our growth strategy. 
The Company’s operations and performance depend on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.
Adverse macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, slower growth or recession, geopolitical conflict, new or increased tariffs and other barriers to trade, changes to fiscal and monetary policy, tighter credit, higher interest rates, high unemployment and currency fluctuations can materially adversely affect demand for the Company’s products and services. In addition, consumer confidence and spending can be adversely affected in response to financial market volatility, negative financial news, conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets, declines in income or asset values, changes to fuel and other energy costs, labor and healthcare costs and other economic factors. In addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company’s products, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global or regional economic conditions can have a significant impact on the Company’s suppliers, logistics providers, distributors, and other channel partners. Potential effects include financial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance operations and purchases of the Company’s products; and insolvency.
Disruption in the global supply chain could increase our costs and delay, prevent or impair our ability to manufacture our products and satisfy customer demand, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
We rely on our developmental partners and third-party suppliers and manufacturers to develop and manufacture our products. Global supply chains have been significantly disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and other factors. For example, supply disruptions have led to a global shortage of semiconductor chips. In addition, shipping delays have increased, and transportation costs have risen significantly. As a result, component costs have increased, and the supply of materials has become less certain and more unpredictable. Any interruption or delay in the supply of parts and components for our products, or the inability to obtain those parts or components at acceptable prices and within a reasonable amount of time, could increase our costs and delay, prevent or impair our ability to manufacture our products and satisfy customer demand, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
Our dependence on suppliers could limit our ability to develop and commercialize certain products.
We rely on third-party suppliers to provide components in our products, manufacture products that we do not manufacture ourselves, and perform services that we do not provide ourselves. Because these suppliers are independent third parties with their own financial objectives, actions taken by them could have a materially negative effect on our results of operations. The risks of relying on suppliers include our inability to enter into contracts with third-party suppliers on reasonable terms, inconsistent or inadequate quality control, relocation of supplier facilities, supplier work stoppages and suppliers’ failure to comply with applicable regulations or their contractual obligations. Problems with suppliers could materially negatively impact our ability to complete development, supply the market, lead to higher costs or damage our reputation with our customers.
In addition, we currently purchase some products and materials from sole or single sources. Some of the products that we purchase from these sources are proprietary and, therefore, cannot be readily or easily replaced by alternative sources. To mitigate risks associated with sole and single source suppliers, we will seek when possible to enter into long-term contracts that provide for an uninterrupted supply of products at predictable prices. However, some suppliers may decline to enter into long-term contracts, and we are required to purchase products with short term contracts or on a purchase order basis. There can be no assurance that suppliers with which we do not have contracts will continue to supply our requirements for products, or that suppliers with which we do have contracts will always fulfill their obligations under these contracts, not 

17



exercise termination rights under the agreement, or that any of our suppliers will not experience disruptions in their ability to supply our requirements for products. In cases where we purchase sole and single source products or components under purchase orders, we are more susceptible to unanticipated cost increases or changes in other terms of supply. In addition, under some contracts with suppliers we have minimum purchase obligations, and our failure to satisfy those obligations may result in loss of some or all of our rights under these contracts or require us to compensate the supplier. If we are unable to obtain adequate quantities of products in the future from sole and single source suppliers, we may be unable to supply the market, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
Our strategic partnerships are important to our business. If we are unable to maintain any of these partnerships, or if these partnerships are not successful, our business could be adversely affected. 
We have entered into strategic relationships that are important to our business and we expect to enter into similar relationships as part of our growth strategy. These relationships may pose a number of risks, including:

● | partners may have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these relationships;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | partners may not perform their obligations as expected;
--+--------------------------------------------------------


● | partners may not pursue development of our product candidates or may elect not to continue or renew development based on development results, changes in the partners’ strategic focus or available funding, or external factors, such as an acquisition, that divert resources or create competing priorities;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | disagreements with partners, including disagreements over proprietary rights, contract interpretation or the preferred course of development, might cause delays or termination of the research and development of product candidates, might lead to additional responsibilities for us with respect to product candidates, or might result in litigation or arbitration, any of which would be time consuming and expensive;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | partners may not properly maintain or defend their intellectual property rights or may use proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate the intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | partners may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may expose us to litigation and potential liability;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | there may be conflicts between different partners that could negatively affect those partnerships and potentially others; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the number and type of our relationships could adversely affect our attractiveness to future partners or acquirers.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If any strategic alliances we enter into do not result in the successful development of our product candidates or if one of our partners terminates its agreement with us, we may not be able to successfully develop our product candidates, our continued development of our product candidates could be delayed, and we may need additional resources to develop additional product candidates. All of the risks relating to our product development, regulatory approval and commercialization also apply to the activities of our partners and there can be no assurance that our agreements will produce positive results or successful products on a timely basis or at all.
Additionally, subject to its contractual obligations to us, if a partner of ours is involved in a business combination or otherwise changes its business priorities, the partner might deemphasize or terminate the development of any technology licensed to it by us. If one of our partners terminates its agreement with us, we may find it more difficult to attract new partners and our perception in the business and financial communities and our stock price could be adversely affected.

18



We may in the future determine to partner with additional life science and technology companies for development of additional products. We face significant competition in seeking appropriate partners. Our ability to reach a definitive agreement for partnership will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the partner’s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed partnership and the proposed partner’s evaluation of a number of factors. If we are unable to reach agreements with suitable partners on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all, we may not be able to access technologies that are important for the future development of our business. If we elect to fund and undertake development activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional expertise and additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we fail to enter into future strategic alliances and do not have sufficient funds or expertise to undertake the necessary development activities, we may not be able to further develop our product candidates and our business may be materially and adversely affected.
If we fail to attract and keep senior management and key scientific personnel, we may be unable to successfully develop any of our existing or future product candidates, conduct our in-licensing and development efforts, and commercialize any of our existing or future products. 
Our success depends in part on our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified management and scientific personnel. We are highly dependent upon our senior management, particularly Larry Heaton, our Chief Executive Officer, Ann Marie Cotter, our Chief Financial Officer, Tony Blair, our Chief Operating Officer, Adrian Lock, our Vice President and General Sales Manager, and Karen DeHaan-Fullerton, our General Counsel. The loss of services of any of these individuals could delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives.
If we are not able to manage growth successfully, this could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Continued growth may place a significant strain on financial, operational, and managerial resources. We must continue to implement and enhance our managerial, operational, and financial systems, expand our operations, and continue to recruit and train qualified personnel. There can be no assurance that our strategic and operational planning will allow us to adequately manage anticipated growth. In addition, the expense associated with increased manufacturing and sales/marketing may exceed our expectations. Any inability to successfully manage growth could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
A failure of Zomedica’s information technology (IT) and data security infrastructure could adversely impact our business, operations, and reputation.
Zomedica relies upon the capacity, reliability, and security of its IT and data security infrastructure, as well as its ability to expand and continually update this infrastructure in response to the changing needs of its business. If Zomedica experiences a problem with the functioning of an important IT system or a security breach of our IT systems, including a potential ransomware attack, due to failure to timely upgrade systems or during system upgrades and/or new system implementations, the resulting disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business.
​
Zomedica and certain of its third-party vendors receive and store personal information in connection with Zomedica’s human resources operations and other aspects of our business. Despite implementation of security measures, our IT systems, like those of other companies, are vulnerable to damages from computer viruses, natural disasters, unauthorized access, cyber-attack, ransomware attack, and other similar disruptions. Any system failure, accident, or cyber security breach or incident could result in disruptions to our operations. A material network breach in the security of our IT systems could lead to vendor payments being paid to fraudulent bank accounts and the theft of intellectual property, trade secrets, customer information, human resources information, or other confidential information. To the extent that any disruptions or security breach results in a loss or damage to our data, or an inappropriate disclosure of confidential, proprietary or customer information, it could cause significant damage to our reputation, affect our relationships with its customers and vendors, lead to claims against us and ultimately harm our business. In addition, we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future.
​

19



We are now considered a smaller reporting company, and as such, are not required to provide the same level of information in our filings that a larger reporting company is. This reduction in the amount and depth of information could adversely affect investor insights and decision making.
​
We are a smaller reporting company as defined in the Exchange Act, and we will remain a smaller reporting company until the fiscal year following:
​

- | The determination that our voting and non-voting common stock held by non-affiliates is more than $250 million measured on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

- | Our annual revenue is more than $100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and our voting and non-voting common stock held by non-affiliates is more than $700 million measured on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Smaller reporting companies are able to provide simplified executive compensation disclosure and have certain other reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, being required to provide only two years of audited financial statements and not being required to provide selected financial data, supplemental financial information or risk factors. 
​
Further, as a non-accelerated filer, we will not be required to provide an auditor attestation of management's assessment of internal control over financial reporting, which is generally required for SEC reporting companies under Sarbanes-Oxley Act Section 404(b), and, in contrast to other reporting companies, we’ll have more time to file our annual and periodic reports.
​
We may choose to take advantage of the available exemptions for smaller reporting companies. We cannot predict whether investors will find our common stock less attractive if we rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our shares price may be more volatile.
​
Severe weather events, including the effects of climate change, are inherently unpredictable and may have a material adverse effect on our financial results and financial condition. In addition, climate change legislation, regulatory initiatives and litigation could result in increased operating costs or, in some instances, adversely impact demand for our products.
​
Climate change may affect the occurrence of certain natural events, the incidence and severity of which are inherently unpredictable, such as an increase in the frequency or severity of wind and thunderstorm events, and tornado or hailstorm events due to increased convection in the atmosphere; more frequent wildfires and subsequent landslides in certain geographies; higher incidence of deluge flooding; and the potential for an increase in severity of the hurricane events due to higher sea surface temperatures.
​
As a result, our business, including our customers and suppliers, may be exposed to severe weather events and natural disasters, such as tornadoes, tsunamis, tropical storms (including hurricanes), earthquakes, windstorms, hailstorms, severe thunderstorms, wildfires and other fires, which could cause operating results to vary significantly from one period to the next. These changes could negatively impact customer demand for our products and services as well as our costs and ability to produce and distribute our products and services.
​
We may incur losses in our business in excess of: (1) those experienced in prior years, (2) the average expected level used in pricing, or (3) current insurance coverage limits. The effects of climate change also may impact our decisions to construct new facilities or maintain existing facilities in any areas that are or become prone to physical risks, which could similarly increase our operating and material costs. We could also face indirect financial risks passed through the supply chain that could result in higher prices for our products and resources as well as the resources needed to produce them, including higher energy costs. Additionally, climate change may adversely impact the demand, price and availability of property and casualty insurance. Due to significant economic variability associated with future changing climate conditions, we are unable to predict the impact climate change will have on our business.

Risks Related to Our Recently Restructured Development and Commercialization Agreement with Qorvo
The failure to fully transition the appropriate knowledge and expertise from Qorvo could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.
As part of the transition agreement with Qorvo, both companies have agreed to a joint initiative to transfer applicable knowledge of processes and procedures. The quality of this transition is contingent on our ability to inquire, document, and absorb the information given and may be limited by several factors including time, quality and completeness of documentation provided by Qorvo, expertise at Zomedica to understand and interpret what is being provided, etc. Failure to adequately collect, document, and implement this information could lead to eventual delays in production, quality control issues, inventory shortfalls, an inability to meet customer demand, and other related matters that could hamper our relationships with both our suppliers and customer base.
We may not be able to leverage the same supplier relationships or production efficiencies that Qorvo was able to achieve, resulting in risk of increased costs, longer lead times, and a lower quality of product.
Qorvo has been able to build and leverage favorable relationships with their suppliers given their time in the industry and their significant volumes and related demand. Upon taking over the manufacturing process from Qorvo, we will need to build the same relationships with the same set of suppliers. Given our new entry into the market, this may prove difficult as some suppliers may not be willing to take on additional customers, we may not be able to get the same pricing as more established customers, and/or we may be given less priority in terms of demand. All of these could negatively impact the availability and cost of materials and impact our ability to produce and deliver products to our customers.
The long-term success envisioned when entering into this new agreement may not come to fruition if we are unable to attract, train, and keep the appropriate personnel required to manage the growth expected and the related changes in processes and procedures to effectively produce the cartridges on our own.
Transferring, implementing, and executing the production processes from Qorvo requires us to find personnel with specific skill sets that may not be readily available due in part to timing, availability, and geographic concerns. Should we struggle to find these skill sets, we could be forced to delay hiring or to hire those with less experience than required. While we feel we will eventually be able to train them to the appropriate levels, this could cause delays in the standing up of our production processes and an increase in the time needed to bring our products to market as a standalone company.
​
Failure of Qorvo to Provide BAW Sensors could lead to delays or an inability to manufacture cartridges.
​
Manufacturing the TRUFORMA cartridges is dependent on the supply of BAW Sensors from Qorvo. If Qorvo fails to deliver the sensors in accordance with forecast, modifies the sensors so that they can no longer work with the TRUFORMA products, discontinues production of the BAW sensors or otherwise terminates the BAW Sensor Supply Agreement, we could experience delays in manufacturing, or an inability to manufacture, cartridges.
​Risks Related to Our Recently Completed Acquisitions of the PulseVet Companies and the Assisi Animal Health and Revo Squared Assets
We have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant transaction and integration costs in connection with our recent acquisitions and they could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.
We have incurred significant costs associated with the negotiation and consummation of our recent acquisitions and expect to incur additional significant costs in connection with the integration of their operations. The substantial majority of the costs incurred to date will be non-recurring expenses and will consist of transaction costs (e.g., legal, accounting), facilities and systems consolidation costs, and employment-related costs. Additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of our businesses. These expenses could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.

The failure to integrate our acquisitions successfully into our business could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 
In order to realize the expected benefits of our acquisitions, we must successfully integrate their respective operations with our existing operations. The integration of these acquisitions will be a time-consuming and expensive process and could significantly disrupt our business. The anticipated benefits of these transactions, including the realization of revenue, tax benefits, financial benefits or returns and expense and other synergies, may not be fully realized, or may take longer to realize than expected, and the integration may be more expensive, require more senior management involvement than expected, or be more disruptive to our existing operations than anticipated. In addition, COVID-19 pandemic-related risks may result in unanticipated regulatory, planning, and/or operational delays that may adversely impact the anticipated timeline and achievement of our ongoing integration goals. The integration process may result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of ongoing business or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, and policies. Our failure to successfully integrate their operations or to otherwise realize any of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.
The failure to realize the anticipated growth opportunities from our acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
We may not realize the expected growth opportunities from our acquisitions even if we are able to integrate their operations successfully. We may incur unanticipated costs related to the operation of these acquisitions and we may not achieve the growth potential expected at the time of acquisition or on our expected time schedule as a result of a number of factors, including our inability to successfully cross-market their products. Accordingly, the benefits from the proposed acquisition may be offset by costs incurred or delays in integrating the companies, which could cause our operational and growth assumptions to be inaccurate. Our failure to realize the anticipated growth opportunities from our acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
The assumption of unknown liabilities (specific to the acquisition of the PulseVet Companies) could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
Because we acquired all of the equity interests of the PulseVet Companies, we own the PulseVet Companies subject to all liabilities, including contingent and unknown liabilities. Pursuant to the transaction documents for the acquisition, there are limitations and conditions to our ability to recoup unanticipated losses from the former owner of the PulseVet Companies. We may also learn additional information about the PulseVet business that could adversely affect us, such as the existence of unknown liabilities, or matters that potentially affect our ability to comply with applicable laws.
If the PulseVet Companies’ liabilities are greater than expected, or if there are material additional obligations of which we are not aware, and if we have no recourse against the former owner of the PulseVet Companies for such matters, such liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
Risks Related to Government Regulation 
Various government regulations could limit or delay our ability to develop and commercialize our products or otherwise negatively impact our business. 
Our existing and future products may be subject to post-market oversight by USDA-CBM and/or FDA-CVM regulations.
The manufacture and sale of our products, as well as our research and development processes, are subject to similar and potentially more stringent laws in foreign countries.
We are also subject to a variety of federal, state, local and international laws and regulations that govern, among other things, the importation and exportation of products; our business practices in the U.S. and abroad, such as anti-corruption and anti-competition laws; and immigration and travel restrictions. These legal and regulatory requirements differ among jurisdictions around the world and are rapidly changing and increasingly complex. The costs associated with compliance with these legal and regulatory requirements are significant and likely to increase in the future.

22



Any failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements could result in fines, penalties and sanctions; product recalls; suspensions or discontinuations of, or limitations or restrictions on, our ability to design, manufacture, market, import, export or sell our products; and damage to our reputation.
Legislative or regulatory reforms with respect to veterinary diagnostics, medical devices and test kits may make it more difficult and costly for us to obtain regulatory clearance or approval of any of our future products and to produce, market, and distribute our products after clearance or approval is obtained. 
From time to time, legislation is drafted and introduced in the U.S. Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the testing, regulatory clearance or approval, manufacture, and marketing of regulated and/or licensed products. In addition, FDA-CVM and USDA-CVB regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the FDA-CVM and USDA-CVB in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. Similar changes in laws or regulations can occur in other countries. Any new regulations or revisions or reinterpretations of existing regulations in the United States may impose additional costs or lengthen review times of any of our existing or future product candidates. We cannot determine what effect changes in regulations, statutes, legal interpretation or policies, when and if promulgated, enacted or adopted may have on our business in the future. Such changes could, among other things, require:
●changes to manufacturing methods;
●recall, replacement or discontinuance of certain products; and
●additional record-keeping.

Each of these would likely entail substantial time and cost and could materially harm our financial results. In addition, delays in receipt of or failure to receive regulatory clearances or approvals for any future products would harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Risks Related to Intellectual Property 
Our ability to obtain intellectual property protection for our products is limited. 
Certain of our diagnostic and therapeutic technologies are dependent on intellectual property developed by our strategic partners and licensed to us. We do not own the intellectual property rights that underlie these technology licenses. Our rights to use the technology we license are subject to the negotiation of, continuation of, and compliance with the terms of our licenses. Further, we do not control the prosecution, maintenance, or filing of the patents and other intellectual property licensed to us, or the enforcement of these intellectual property rights against third parties. The patents and patent applications underlying our licenses were not written by us or our attorneys, and we do not have control over the drafting and prosecution of such rights. Our partners might not have given the same attention to the drafting and prosecution of patents and patent applications as we would have if we had been the owners of the intellectual property rights and had control over such drafting and prosecution. We cannot be certain that drafting and/or prosecution of the licensed patents and patent applications has been or will be conducted in compliance with applicable laws and regulations or will result in valid and enforceable patents and other intellectual property rights.

Some of our products may or may not be covered by a patent. Further if an application is filed, it is not certain that a patent will be granted or if granted whether it will be held to be valid. All of which may impact our market share and ability to prevent others (competitor third parties) from making, selling, or using our products. 
We intend to rely upon a combination of patents, trade secret protection, confidentiality agreements, and license agreements to protect the intellectual property related to our existing and future products. We may not be successful in protecting our intellectual property rights, including our unpatented proprietary know-how and trade secrets, or in avoiding claims that we infringed on the intellectual property rights of others. In addition to relying on patent and trademark rights, we rely on unpatented proprietary know-how and trade secrets, and employ various methods, including confidentiality agreements with employees and consultants, customers and suppliers to protect our know-how and trade secrets. However, 

23



these methods and our patents and trademarks may not afford complete protection and there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop the know-how and trade secrets or develop better production methods than us. Further, we may not be able to deter current and former employees, contractors and other parties from breaching confidentiality agreements and misappropriating proprietary information and it is possible that third parties may copy or otherwise obtain and use our information and proprietary technology without authorization or otherwise infringe on our intellectual property rights. In the future, we may also rely on litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights and contractual rights, and, if not successful, we may not be able to protect the value of our intellectual property. Any litigation could be protracted and costly and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations regardless of its outcome.
If we are unable to obtain trademark registrations for our products, our business could be adversely affected.
We have trademark registrations for our company name and composite marks comprised of our company name, logo and/or slogan in the U.S., Canada, European Union, the United Kingdom, and Mexico. We also have an allowed application for our name in the U.S. for an expanded listing of diagnostic testing equipment. We have secured registrations for our MYZOMEDICA platform in the U.S., Canada, the European Union, and the United Kingdom. In addition, we have registrations for our “Voice of the Vet” mark in the U.S., Canada, European Union and the United Kingdom.
We have also secured registrations for our in-clinic biosensor testing platform, TRUFORMA, with several product names in the U.S., Canada, the European Union, and the United Kingdom.
We own four live federal trademark registrations, including one for the TRUFORMA testing platform product, along with PROPULSE, VERSATRODE and VERSATRON and the tradename PULSEVET.
We acquired a portfolio of trademarks for ASSISI, ASSISI LOOP, CALMER CANINE, ASSISI DENTALOOP, and composite marks including a logo and/or slogan in the U.S. and various countries throughout the world. The assets acquired from Revo Squared include registrations for REVO SQUARED, a stylized fan shaped logo, and MICROVIEW in the U.S. Trademark applications have been filed in the U.S. for TRUVIEW, TRUPREP, TRUSOUND, SONOVIEW, SUPERVIEW and MICROPREP.
Third parties may have intellectual property rights, which may require us to obtain a license or other applicable rights to make, sell or use our products. If such rights are not granted or obtained, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain, or license from third parties, patents, trademarks, trade secrets and similar proprietary rights without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties. Although we believe our intellectual property rights are sufficient to allow us to conduct our business without incurring liability to third parties, our products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of such persons. Furthermore, no assurance can be given that we will not be subject to claims asserting the infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties seeking damages, the payment of royalties or licensing fees and/or injunctions against the sale of our products. Any such litigation could be protracted and costly and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Risks Related to Our Common Shares 
We expect that the price of our common shares will fluctuate substantially. 
The market price of our common shares has been subject to significant fluctuations, and we expect that the market price of our common shares will remain volatile. At times, the price of our common shares has changed significantly unrelated to any change in our financial condition or results of operations that would explain such a change. Numerous factors, including many over which we have no control, may have a significant impact on the market price of our common shares. 
Examples of these include:
●any delays in, or suspension or failure of, any future studies;

24



●delays in the commercialization of our existing or future products;
●manufacturing and supply issues related to our existing or future products;

● | quarterly variations in our results of operations or those of our competitors;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | changes in our earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts or adverse publicity about us or our product candidates;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | announcements by us or our competitors of new products, significant contracts, commercial relationships, acquisitions or capital commitments;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | announcements relating to future development or license agreements including termination of such agreements;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | adverse developments with respect to our intellectual property rights or those of our principal collaborators;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | commencement of litigation involving us or our competitors;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


● | any major changes in our board of directors or management;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


● | new legislation in the United States and abroad relating to our markets or our industry;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | announcements of regulatory approval or disapproval of any of our future products or of regulatory actions affecting us or our industry;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | product liability claims, other litigation or public concern about the safety of our existing or future products;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | market conditions in the animal health industry, or in the sectors in which we participate, in particular, including performance of our competitors;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the impact of social media posts by third parties that may draw attention to our company and increase trading in our common shares by retail investors; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | general economic conditions in the United States and abroad.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------

In addition, the stock market, in general, or the market for stocks in our industry may experience broad market fluctuations, which may adversely affect the market price or liquidity of our common shares. Any sudden decline in the market price of our common shares could trigger securities class-action lawsuits against us. If any of our shareholders were to bring such a lawsuit against us, we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit and the time and attention of our management would be diverted from our business and operations. We also could be subject to damages claims if we are found to be at fault in connection with a decline in our stock price.
Our Articles of Amalgamation (as amended) authorize us to issue an unlimited number of common shares and preferred shares without shareholder approval and we may issue additional equity securities or engage in other transactions that could dilute your ownership interest, which may adversely affect the market price of our common shares.
Except for as required under the continued listing requirements of NYSE American, where our common shares are listed for trading, our Articles of Amalgamation (as amended) authorize our Board of Directors, subject to the provisions of the Business Corporations Act (Alberta), or ABCA to issue an unlimited number of common shares and preferred shares without shareholder approval. Our Board of Directors may determine from time to time to raise additional capital by issuing common shares, preferred shares or other equity securities. We are not restricted from issuing additional securities, 

25



including securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, common shares or preferred shares. Because our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing, or nature of any future offerings, or the prices at which such offerings may be affected. Additional equity offerings may dilute the holdings of our existing shareholders or reduce the market price of our common shares, or both. Holders of our common shares are not entitled to pre-emptive rights or other protections against dilution. New investors also may have rights, preferences and privileges that are senior to, and that adversely affect, the then current holders of our common shares. Additionally, if we raise additional capital by making offerings of debt or preference shares, upon our liquidation, holders of our debt securities and preferred shares, and lenders with respect to other borrowings, may receive distributions of our available assets before the holders of our common shares.
We have never and do not, in the future, intend to pay dividends on our common shares, and your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the market price of our common shares. 
We have never paid and do not expect to pay dividends on our common shares in the future. We intend to invest our future earnings, if any, to fund our growth and not to pay any cash dividends on our common shares. Since we do not intend to pay dividends, your ability to receive a return on your investment will depend on any future appreciation in the market price of our common shares. There is no assurance that our common shares will appreciate in price.
We are subject to the continued listing requirements of the NYSE American. If we are unable to comply with such requirements, our common shares would be delisted from the NYSE American, which would limit investors’ ability to effect transactions in our common shares and subject us to additional trading restrictions.
Our common shares are currently listed on the NYSE American. In order to maintain our listing, we must maintain certain share prices, financial and share distribution targets, including maintaining a minimum amount of shareholders’ equity and a minimum number of public shareholders. In addition to these objective standards, the NYSE American may delist the securities of any issuer if, in its opinion, the issuer’s financial condition and/or operating results appear unsatisfactory; if it appears that the extent of public distribution or the aggregate market value of the security has become so reduced as to make continued listing on the NYSE American inadvisable; if the issuer sells or disposes of principal operating assets or ceases to be an operating company; if an issuer fails to comply with the NYSE American’s listing requirements; if an issuer’s common stock sells at what the NYSE American considers a “low selling price” (generally trading below $0.20 per share for an extended period of time); or if any other event occurs or any condition exists which makes continued listing on the NYSE American, in its opinion, inadvisable. Although the average trading price of our common shares was over $0.20 per share during 2022, there was a period during the year when it dropped below.
If the NYSE American delists our common shares from trading on its exchange and we are not able to list our securities on another national securities exchange, we expect our common shares would qualify to be quoted on an over-the-counter market. If this were to occur, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including:

● | a limited availability of market quotations for our securities;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


● | reduced liquidity for our securities;
--+--------------------------------------


● | a determination that our common shares are a “penny stock” which will require brokers trading in our common shares to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a limited amount of news and analyst coverage; and
--+---------------------------------------------------


● | a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Risks Related to Income Taxes
We have generated U.S. NOLs, but our ability to use these U.S. NOLs is limited and any future U.S. NOLs we generate may be limited or impaired by future ownership changes.
Our U.S. businesses have generated consolidated net operating loss carryforwards (“U.S. NOLs”) for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes of $32,456 as of December 31, 2022. Our ability to utilize any U.S. NOLs after an “ownership change” is subject to the rules of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) Section 382. An ownership change occurs if, among other things, the shareholders (or specified groups of shareholders) who own or have owned, directly or indirectly, five (5%) percent or more of the value of our shares or are otherwise treated as five (5%) percent shareholders under Section 382 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder increase their aggregate percentage ownership of the value of our shares by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage of the value of the shares owned by these shareholders over a three year rolling period. An ownership change could also be triggered by other activities, including the sale of our shares that are owned by our five (5%) shareholders.
In the event of an ownership change, Section 382 imposes an annual limitation on the amount of taxable income we may offset with U.S. NOLs. This annual limitation is generally equal to the product of the value of our shares in the US operating entity on the date prior to the ownership change multiplied by the long-term tax-exempt rate in effect on the date of the ownership change. The long-term tax-exempt rate is published monthly by the IRS. Any unused Section 382 annual limitation may be carried over to later years until the applicable expiration date for the respective U.S. NOLs (if any).
We concluded that, due to the limitations under Section 382 of the Code, it is likely our U.S. NOL carryforwards for the periods prior to February 11, 2021, for $21,013 are limited to zero, and are not available to offset taxable income generated in the US in future periods. Our U.S. NOL carryforwards are now $11,443. In the event another ownership change, as defined under Section 382 of the Code occurs in the future, our ability to utilize any U.S. NOLs may be substantially limited. The consequence of this limitation could be the potential loss of a significant future cash flow benefit because we would no longer be able to substantially offset future taxable income with U.S. NOLs. There can be no assurance that such ownership change will not occur in the future.
We have generated net operating loss carryforwards for Canadian income tax purposes, but our ability to use these net operating losses may be limited by our inability to generate future taxable income in Canada. 
Our Canadian businesses have generated net operating loss carryforwards of $46,384 (“Canadian NOLs”) for Canadian federal and provincial income tax purposes. These Canadian NOLs can be available to reduce Canadian income taxes that might otherwise be incurred on future Canadian taxable income. However, there can be no assurance that we will generate the taxable income in the future necessary to utilize these Canadian NOLs. Our Canadian NOLs have expiration dates. There can be no assurance that, if and when we generate Canadian taxable income in the future, we will generate such taxable income before our Canadian NOLs expire.
Our ability to use any U.S. NOLs may be limited by our inability to generate future taxable income.
U.S. NOLs may be available to reduce income taxes that might otherwise be incurred on future U.S. taxable income. The utilization of these U.S. NOLs could have a positive effect on our cash flow. However, there can be no assurance that we will generate the taxable income in the future necessary to utilize these U.S. NOLs and realize the positive cash flow benefit.
We have generated Canadian NOLs, but our ability to reserve and use these Canadian NOLs may be limited or impaired by future ownership changes.
Our ability to utilize the Canadian NOLs after a “loss restriction event” is subject to the rules of the Income Tax Act (Canada). A loss restriction event will occur if, among other things, there is change of control (which would generally occur if a person or group of related persons acquired more than 50% of our voting shares). If we experience a “loss 

27



restriction event”: (i) we will be deemed to have a year-end for Canadian tax purposes and (ii) we will be deemed to realize any unrealized capital losses and our ability to utilize and carry forward Canadian NOLs will be restricted.
We believe that we will be a “passive foreign investment company,” or PFIC, for the current taxable year, which could subject certain U.S. investors to materially adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences. 
We believe we were classified as a PFIC during our taxable year ended December 31, 2022, and based on current business plans and financial expectations, we believe we may be a PFIC for the current and future taxable years. If we are a PFIC for any year in which you hold common shares and you are a U.S. holder, then you generally will be required to treat any gain realized upon a disposition of such common shares, or any so-called “excess distribution” received on your common shares, as ordinary income, and to pay an interest charge on a portion of such gain or distribution. In certain circumstances, the sum of the tax and the interest charge may exceed the total amount of proceeds you realize on the disposition or the amount of the excess distribution you receive. Subject to certain limitations, these tax consequences may be mitigated if you make a timely and effective Qualified Electing Fund election, or QEF Election, or a mark-to-market election, or Mark-to-Market Election. Subject to certain limitations, such elections may be made with respect to our common shares. If you are a U.S. holder and make a timely and effective QEF Election, you generally must report on a current basis your share of our net capital gain and ordinary earnings for any year in which we are a PFIC, whether or not we distribute any amount to you, thus giving rise to so-called “phantom income” and to a potential tax liability. However, U.S. holders should be aware that we do not intend to satisfy the record keeping requirements that apply to a “qualified electing fund,” or supply U.S. holders with information that such U.S. holders require to report under the QEF Election rules, in the event that we are a PFIC and a U.S. holder wishes to make a QEF Election. Thus, if you are a U.S. holder, you may not be able to make a QEF Election. If you are a U.S. Holder and make a timely and effective Mark-to-Market Election, you generally must include as ordinary income each year the excess of the fair market value of your common shares over your tax basis therein, thus also possibly giving rise to phantom income and a potential tax liability. Ordinary loss generally is recognized only to the extent of net mark-to-market gains previously included in income. Any holder of our common shares who is a U.S. taxpayer should consult its own tax advisors regarding the PFIC rules and the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership, and disposition of our common shares.
If the Internal Revenue Service determines that we are not a PFIC and you previously paid taxes pursuant to a QEF Election or a Mark-to- Market Election, you may pay more taxes than you legally owe. 
If the Internal Revenue Service, or the IRS, makes a determination that we are not a PFIC and you previously paid taxes pursuant to a QEF Election or Mark-to-Market Election, then you may have paid more taxes than you legally owed due to such election. If you do not, or are unable to, file a refund claim before the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, you will not be able to claim a refund for those taxes.
