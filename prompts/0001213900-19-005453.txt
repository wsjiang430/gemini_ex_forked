ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements that appear elsewhere in this Report.
 
As used in this Report and unless otherwise indicated, the terms “C-Bond Systems, Inc.,” “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our” refer to C-Bond Systems, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, C-Bond Systems, LLC, C-Bond R&D Solutions, LLC, C-Bond Industrial Solutions, LLC, and C-Bond Security Solutions, LLC, as the context may require.
 
Overview
 
We are a materials development company and the sole owner of the patented, proprietary nanotechnology, which we call our C-Bond™ technology.  We currently sell our technology primarily to the glass industry. Our product, called C-Bond, is designed to significantly increase the strength of glass, enhance glass flexibility, and improve the structural integrity of glass. The product is scalable across various target segments and industry verticals.  To date, we have focused on automotive glass, including windshields, and architectural glass.  In the future, other glass segments such as electronics, including display glass, and glass packaging, including bottles, may be targeted, but we have not entered these markets yet. 
 
The C-Bond technology provides strength and improved functional performance to brittle materials.  Currently focused on the glass industry, the C-Bond technology enables ordinary glass to dissipate energy by permeating the glass surface and detecting microscopic flaws and defects that are randomly distributed all over the glass surface. C-Bond’s unique qualities then work to locate and repair the identified surface imperfections that weaken the glass composite structure and ultimately act as failure initiators. The C-Bond formula is engineered to maintain original glass design integrity while increasing the mechanical performance of the glass. 
 
Our Business
 
Product and Service Offerings 
 
C-Bond current products are patented, low-cost technologies that significantly increase the mechanical performance of glass. We have implemented the following product structure integrating a “new strategic product platform” that has enhanced performance capabilities and market reach with a “legacy product platform” that is still generating incremental revenue and earnings. 
New Strategic Product Platform
 
C-Bond Transportation Windshield Performance Solution. 
 
C-Bond NanoShield™ is a patented nanotechnology windshield glass strengthening and hydrophobic (water repellent) all-in-one performance system. It is designed to improve windshield safety and performance by increasing windshield chip and crack resistance and improving windshield visibility in wet weather conditions to provide extended driver reaction time.  We believe that C-Bond NanoShield is unique in the market and that the product has no direct competitors. With C-Bond NanoShield, we intend to create new markets and channels in the aftermarket automotive windshield segment, including fleets, automotive dealers, and service providers.
Legacy Product Platform
 
C-Bond I Glass Strengthening Primer and Window Film Mounting Solution. 
 
C-Bond I is a patented, non-toxic, water-based nanotechnology solution designed to significantly increase the strength of glass and improve the performance properties of window film-to-glass products. C-Bond I improves the performance of window film-to-glass products by reducing glass breakage from impact and stress environments, and fills the capillary voids on the glass surface preventing the trapping of moisture and impurities that impede cure time and adhesion between the glass and any succeeding window film product. This is important because when glass does break, this nanotechnology improves the chances that no large shards/pieces will escape the immediate area of the glass surface and result in serious laceration or personal injury.  C-Bond I has been tested against untreated glass by third-party laboratories and shown to outperform untreated glass in this capacity.  C-Bond I faces market competition from basic soap and water products (such as baby shampoo and dishwashing soap) as the recognized industry standard window film application solution, which we believe provide no structural benefits and are designed to wash hair and dishes, respectively. C-Bond I increases overall glass strength, improves window film product performance, and can be used in conjunction with any manufacturer’s film product. 
C-Bond BRS (Ballistic Resistant Film System)
 
C-Bond BRS is a patented nanotechnology Ballistic Resistant Film System that increases the structural integrity of glass and provides National Institute of Justice (NIJ) Level I, Level II and Underwriter Laboratories (UL) 752 ballistic resistant protection. C-Bond BRS includes a specified glass thickness and glass type, the C-Bond window film mounting solution to improve the glass mechanical strength, and the C-Bond window film product. This product is targeted to police, fire, emergency services, schools, airports, and mass transit government buildings due to the utility of ballistic resistant glass protection in their respective fields. The C-Bond BRS system seeks to combine simplicity and affordability with a one-way capability (the ability to shoot-out but prevent shooting in) ballistic protection as compared to other costlier ballistic resistant material (polycarbonate and glass laminate) products.

Commercial Market Strategy
 
We utilize a distributor model to reach potential customers.  This approach takes advantage of existing resources and facilitates relationships between us and our enterprise partner in order to leverage their collective strengths.  We require industry partners to generate economic growth, support commercialization activities, provide more developed business networks, knowledge of and access to supply and demand channels, and supplement limited financial resources. We and our industrial partners work together to determine scalability, adaptability, affordability, usability and intellectual property. From a business perspective, the long-term scope and strategic benefits of our plug and play business strategy is to be able to carry out business on a global basis at a lower cost and becoming better informed and more adaptive to changing market conditions, which is dependent on securing these relationships.
C-Bond Authorized Distributor Network
 
On April 1, 2016, we officially launched our Authorized Distributor Program focused on channeling distribution agreements with industry specific business-to-business and original equipment manufacturing customers to develop a global distribution network. This program aims to partner with high quality distributors that can grow revenues and margins. Our present distribution channels span the United States from Florida to Hawaii and consist of 56 distribution channels, including international sales in Brazil, Columbia, United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Australia, Canada and the UAE. For the year ended December 31, 2018, three customers accounted for approximately 43.3% of our total sales (11.2%, 13.9% and 18.2%, respectively). For the year ended December 31, 2017, one customer accounted for approximately 15% of our total sales. A reduction in sales from or loss of such customers would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations and financial condition.
Suppliers
 
Currently, we rely on one main supplier, Madico, Inc., for our window film and one main supplier, Gelest, Inc., for our chemicals.  However, we believe that, if necessary, alternate suppliers could be found without material disruption to our business.
Intellectual Property
 
To date, we have filed, licensed and/or acquired a total of 22 individual patents and patent applications spanning core and strategic nano-technology applications and processes. We intend to continue to expand our patent coverage. Our focus remains on building a patent portfolio that protects our core intellectual property and delivers shareholder value.
 
We own five provisional United States patents and licenses, five United States patents, and 12 foreign patents on a non-exclusive basis from William Marsh Rice University (“Rice University”) with claims directed toward various aspects of our current products and products under development including the use of nanotechnology for glass strengthening and the processes and composition of our products.
 
Pursuant to an agreement dated April 8, 2016, between us and Rice University, Rice University has granted a non-exclusive license to us, in nanotube-based surface treatment for strengthening glass and related materials under Rice’s intellectual property rights, to use, make, distribute, offer and sell the licensed products specified in the agreement. In consideration, we had to pay a one-time non-refundable license fee of $10,000 and royalty payments of 5% of net sales of the licensed products during the term of the agreement and a sell-off period of 180 days from termination. In addition, we are required to pay for the maintenance of the patents.  This agreement will continue until the expiration of the last to expire of the licensed property rights, unless terminated earlier in accordance with the terms of the agreement.
 
The “C-Bond™” and “C-Bond NanoShield™” names and logos are registered trademarks issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.
 
Research and Development
 
During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we incurred research and development costs of $258,294 and $214,112, respectively.  These costs were incurred to continue to upgrade C-Bond products.


Competition
 
C-Bond Nanoshield Windshield Performance System
 
We believe we have no direct competition in the windshield glass strengthening space.
 
C-Bond NanoShield also provides a complementary hydrophobic or water repellent quality.  There are competitors in this space, including Rain-X, AquaPel, and Diamond Fusion. We believe these products do not provide chip or crack resistance and have hydrophobic properties that degrade sooner than C-Bond NanoShield. Accordingly, management believes there is no product that is truly comparable to C-Bond NanoShield currently on the market.  We had the performance of C-Bond NanoShield verified at our request, based on a modified chip test for paint on metal parts, SAEJ 400, to provide windshield glass chip protection when compared to untreated glass.

C-Bond I Glass Strengthening Primer and Window Film Mounting Solution
 
C-Bond I faces competition from alternative window film mounting products in the market; however, all these products have similar ingredients to a soap and water mix, which we believe provides no structural benefit.  These solutions are used to provide a window film installer the ability to slip or move the film on the surface to which it is applied.  The industry standard solution most commonly used to apply window film products to glass is a mixture containing commonly available baby shampoo or dishwashing soap and water that we believe has the following negative attributes: provides no structural benefits, often bubbles or yellows and scatters light, can only be applied within a limited temperature range, and may require 30 to 120 days of “dry” time to set completely depending on the film thickness.  C-Bond-I provides the same slip properties while also strengthening the glass and improving film adhesion.
 
C-Bond BRS
 
C-Bond BRS faces competition from alternative bullet proof or bullet resistant glass products in the market. Alternative bullet proof solutions use a polycarbonate or glass laminate materials that are expensive, thick, heavy, often require reframing and retrofit of existing structure and revised building codes, and yellow and discolor over time.  These alternative solutions are often cost prohibitive to cost sensitive customers such as educational and municipal facilities.  C-Bond BRS allows for increased safety and security at affordable costs.  Most importantly, it provides a deterrent to an intruder and valuable time to secure the facility.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had seven full-time employees. We have established an extensive network of external partners, contractors, and consultants to outsource to in an effort to minimize administrative overhead and maximize efficiency.
