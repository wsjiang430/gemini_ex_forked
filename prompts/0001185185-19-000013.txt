 Item 1. Business.
 
In this Report, we use the terms “Company,” “XsunX,” “we,” “us,” and “our,” unless otherwise indicated, or the context otherwise requires, to refer to XsunX, Inc.
Organization
 
XsunX, Inc. (“XsunX,” the “Company” or the “issuer”) is a Colorado corporation formerly known as Sun River Mining Inc. “Sun River”). The Company was originally incorporated in Colorado on February 25, 1997. Effective September 24, 2003, the Company completed a plan of reorganization and name change to XsunX, Inc.
 
Business Overview/Summary
 
XsunX specializes in the sale, design, and installation of solar photovoltaic power generation (PV), energy storage in the form of managed battery systems, and energy use management technologies to provide our clients long term savings, predictability, and control of their energy costs. Making solar and managed energy solutions a sound investment for our clients is our mission.
 
We service the commercial self-generation energy market in California, and to a lesser extent the residential solar PV marketplace. We provide project assessment and installation services to our customers including technology selection, system engineering, procurement, permitting, construction, grid connection, warranty service, system monitoring and maintenance. We offer a wide variety of energy production and management technologies, design our systems in-house to ensure that the performance of the systems we deliver match the financial projections, and our full-time project management and licensed assembly crews ensure a seamless process, from start to finish.
 
The Company operates as licensed contractor in California, and our executive management provides over 30 years of extensive experience in all aspects of construction and project assembly to ensure the accuracy and quality of systems, the continued integrity of the improved building or site, and compliance with construction codes.
 
We guide our performance by striving to deliver consistently on the following core objectives:
 
● Commitment – to keeping the customer’s best interests at the forefront at all times; and,
 
● Value – through a focus on performance and follow through that meets or exceeds customer expectations.
 
Recent Developments
 
In the 2017 period we expanded our product group to include managed energy storage systems, and demand charge management software.  We believe that the Company’s development of design and installation expertise for these products and services provided us with a competitive advantage that we plan to continue to leverage for the foreseeable future.
 
The addition of these products was in response to rising and shifting time-of-use and demand-based charges (measured in kilowatts) by utilities. Pairing solar PV with energy storage, and energy use management can significantly boost project returns through the monitoring and comparison of utility time-of-use and demand charges to real-time facility energy needs to then deliver renewable or stored energy when it provides the greatest savings for operations. This product group focuses primarily on commercial facilities and can be installed as a stand-alone technology or paired with our commercial solar rooftop, carport, truckport, and covered storage canopy systems.
 
In the 2017 period we established in-house capabilities to design, directly source all the major system components, and install solar canopy systems to provide us with what we believe is an advantage over other solar contractors whom typically rely on costly third-party specialty contractors to install canopy systems for their solar projects. We believe that offering canopy design/build services to solar contractors creates an opportunity to expand sales for these services for which this group of contractor/customers were already seeking assistance with.
 
In the 2018 we saw our efforts to offer our solar canopy design/build capabilities to solar contractors and developers begin to gain momentum with the sale of services, scheduled to commence in the spring of 2019, to structurally update and repair forty-three existing solar canopies located on the campus of the University of California San Diego.

Market Drivers for Solar Power
 
We believe that a significant demand for solar power and energy management solutions is continuing to develop in response to the following drivers:
 

• | Solar and energy management technologies provide the ability to control and predict future energy costs. Our customers invest in the ability to self-generate power and to manage the use and delivery of energy to their operations. These investments provide predictability and control of energy costs and can significantly reduce overall energy costs while insulating clients from rising retail electricity prices. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Maturity and dependability of solar and energy management technologies. The results and benefits from investments in solar power systems, facility wide energy use management technology and, the growing effectiveness of new battery chemistries have produced extensive statistical performance data. This historical performance data allows investment benefits for near and long-term future operations to be accurately estimated. This provides customers greater reliance on future results, and the confidence to make investments. 
• | Rapid capital recovery of energy management investments. Reports provided by U.S. Energy Department continue to indicate that the installed price reductions for solar PV and energy storage systems are driving growth for installation demand. These cost reductions for the major components allow us to provide per watt pricing for solar PV and per kilowatt hour pricing for energy storage that, coupled with tax and operating benefits, can often result in capital investment recovery within 3 to 4 years. 
• | Government Incentives. Helping to further facilitate the market for investments into self-generated power are Federal, State, and local government tax-based investment incentives. Federal, state and local government bodies provide incentives to owners, operators, and end users of solar and energy storage systems to promote self-generation energy in the form of rebates, tax credits, and exclusion of solar energy systems from property tax assessments. These incentives help to drive customer acceptance of self-generation energy as an alternative to utility-provided power. The Federal government currently offers a 30% Investment Tax Credit (“ITC”) under Section 48(a) of the Internal Revenue Code for the installation of certain solar power facilities through December 31, 2019, after which it will fall to 26 percent in 2020, 22 percent in 2021 and 10 percent in 2022 for future periods. The investment economics for purchasing a solar or energy storage system are also increased through eligibility for accelerated depreciation, also known as the modified accelerated cost recovery system, or MACRS, which allows for the depreciation of equipment according to an accelerated schedule set forth by the Internal Revenue Service. This acceleration of the investment depreciation creates a valuable tax benefit that reduces the overall cost of the solar energy system and improves the return on solar investment.

We use information related to our customer’s energy usage, utility rate tariffs, system costs, current or planned operations, and tax basis to determine optimal technology and investment sizing. We combine this data and provide customers with 25-year investment projections that detail capital recovery expectations, system performance and energy savings, tax and operating benefits, and property re-sale value improvement estimates. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Financing. We have established relationships with lenders and have been approved to offer their finance options to prospective customers. Through our lender association network, we offer customers financing options that include commercial equipment loans, lease options, power purchase agreements (PPA’s), PACE & HERO financing through property tax assessment, and through our lender network we offer clients the option to apply tax or local utility incentives towards system purchase buy-downs thereby reducing up front out of pocket expenditures or the amount of capital financed.


• | Design & Engineering. To ensure accuracy we perform our site surveys directly and do not rely on third party services. We then finalize designs that will match proposed financial results, and work with a highly skilled team of qualified engineers with extensive commercial experience to ensure compliance with all codes, and best practices for systems operation.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Installation. We make the installation process simple for our customers. Once we complete the design and engineering of an energy system, we obtain all necessary building permits. Then, acting as the general contractor and construction manager, we provide all materials and components and use qualified licensed contractors with commercial electrical and solar experience to provide on-site assembly of systems, utility interconnections, and roofing or structural work. We manage and ensure local building department approvals and arrange for interconnection to the power grid with the utility.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Monitoring, Maintenance, and Service. We provide our customers with real-time facility wide monitoring of energy generation, and facility wide energy consumption. In addition to providing clients with a better understanding of their energy usage, and the opportunity to modify their usage to realize savings, these monitoring systems allow us to confirm the continuing proper operation of installed solar energy systems. We also service what we sell and provide customers with a single source for all system maintenance or warranty coordination and service.

Customers
 
The majority of our revenue comes from sales to commercial customers in California.   We anticipate that through our efforts to promote the sale of our solar canopy and managed energy storage offerings our revenues for commercial sales will continue to outpace residential sales through the 2019 period.
 
Our commercial system sales service the needs of property owners installing solar PV systems typically larger than 20kW, and energy storage systems that start at 60 kilowatt hours of storage capacity.  However, system size and installation type can vary significantly to meet the needs of the customers energy use and technology needs. The average cycle time for commercial rooftop installs range approximately 8 to 10 weeks. Installations of solar canopies such as carports, truck ports, and covered storage require as much as twelve to twenty weeks due to additional permitting requirement and reviews. We help to facilitate financing options to fit the specific needs of each customer.
 
 Our residential sales address the needs of property owners typically installing systems smaller than 15kW.  The average cycle time for residential rooftop installs is approximately 2 weeks. We help to facilitate financing options to fit the specific needs of each customer.
 
Sales, Marketing, and Planned Operations
 
We have focused our sales efforts and operations on the delivery of commercial solar power and energy management systems in the California market. We believe that our focus provides us long term benefits for brand development as a commercial specialist within a market that we believe to be in the early stages of growth and poised for a broad adoption of solar power generation.

We see this as a significant business development opportunity as our management has the skillset associated with construction management, the licensing qualifications necessary for us to operate as a contractor in California, we have extensive experience associated with solar PV technologies and the design requirements associated with the delivery of a commercial power systems, and there is a market demand available for us to provide these services to.
 
For the foreseeable future we plan to continue to market and offer managed energy systems comprised of solar PV, solar canopy systems, energy storage, and energy use management technology.  Pairing solar PV with energy storage and energy use management can significantly boost project returns through the monitoring and comparison of utility time-of-use and demand charges to real-time facility energy needs to then deliver renewable or stored energy when it provides the greatest savings for operations. This product group focuses primarily on commercial facilities and can be installed as a stand-alone technology or paired with our commercial solar rooftop, carport, truckport, and covered storage canopy systems.
 
Additionally, our efforts in the 2018 period to offer our solar canopy design/build capabilities to solar contractors and developers began to gain momentum with the sale of services, scheduled to commence in the spring of 2019, to structurally update and repair forty-three existing solar canopies located on the campus of the University of California San Diego. We intend to continue to market our canopy design/build services to solar contractors for the foreseeable future.
 
While residential rooftop solar will continue to offer sales growth opportunities, we believe that our focus on non-residential solar power, managed energy storage, and solar canopy systems can, in many instances, provide us with opportunities to offer customers diverse installation options, larger project sizing, greater energy savings, and the ability to differentiate XsunX from competitors.
 
We plan to continue to focus our marketing efforts in the 2019 period highlighting the advantages of these product groups through efforts that include web advertising, direct outside sales, targeted direct marketing, commissioned consultants, and the referral of satisfied customers. 
 
Operations and Supply
 
We purchase all of our system components such as solar panels, inverters, batteries, charge controllers, energy management software, and solar module mounting hardware directly from manufacturers and supply houses. When possible, we have established direct factory purchasing relationships. We have selected these suppliers and components based on cost, reliability, availability, warranty coverage, ease of installation, application design and suitability, and technology advantages.
 
Additionally, to compete favorably we have established relationships with lenders through which we can introduce financing options for the systems we design and install. These financing options provide an alternative cash management solution for our target customers, and a sales inducement to purchase systems.
 
For the foreseeable future we anticipate that we will purchase the system components for each project on an as-needed basis from suppliers at the then-prevailing prices pursuant to purchase orders issued. Due to the volatility of component pricing we do not anticipate any supplier arrangements that will contain long-term pricing or volume commitments. Should our sales results, volume, and market conditions warrant we may in the future elect to make purchase commitments to ensure sufficient supply and reduced pricing of the components that we use.
 
Our operations focus is to provide complete project design, management of engineering, facility preparation, installation of systems, and repair or restoration to all affected areas resulting from the installation process. To accomplish this, we use the services of licensed service professionals in each of the representative trades or specialties necessary. Additionally, we provide qualified staff to supervise project operations, inspections, and system start up and energizing. In the 2019 fiscal period we anticipate that our sales may increase, and we plan to expand our direct project management capabilities through the addition of qualified field supervisory and engineering staff.
 
Competition
 
We compete with companies that offer solar and energy saving technologies. Many of these competitors have greater resources and access to broader national markets than we do. Our primary areas of competition in the California markets we serve are on pricing, the ability to deliver designs and technology integration that match client needs and the ability to arrange financing. However, when competing for solar installation projects our experience has shown that there is no clear preferred competitor in the markets in which we compete.

We also compete with traditional utilities who have well-established relationships with our target customers providing the ease of a status quo relationship without upfront investment costs. The advantages we offer over traditional utilities is that we offer customers the opportunity to create and to manage the use of their own electricity, minimize the traditional electrical grid dependency, and create profitable long-term investments in energy.
 
Intellectual Property
 
The following is an outline of certain patents and technologies we have developed, attempted to develop, have acquired, or licensed:
 
In September 2003, the Company was assigned the rights to three patents as part of an Asset Purchase Agreement with Xoptix Inc., a California corporation. The patents acquired were No. 6,180,871 for Transparent Solar Cell and Method of Fabrication (Device), granted on January 30, 2001; No. 6,320,117 for Transparent Solar Cell and Method of Fabrication (Method of Fabrication), granted on November 20, 2001; and No. 6,509,204 for Transparent Solar Cell and Method of Fabrication (formed with a Schottky barrier diode and method of its manufacture), granted on January 21, 2003. Because of technological and business developments within the solar industry, we believe that these patents no longer provide business opportunities for the Company to pursue and we have abandoned maintenance of these patents.
 
On July 10, 2012, the United States Patent and Trademark Office issued a certificate of registration No. 4,172,218 granting the Company a trademark for the use of “CIGSolar”. Because of not having used this trademark during the previous fiscal years we elected to abandon any continued use of this trade mark and allowed the registration to expire in the 2017 fiscal period.
 
We rely on trademark and copyright law, trade secret protection and confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, customers, partners and others to protect our proprietary rights. We have not been subject to any intellectual property claims.
 
Company History
 
XsunX is a Colorado corporation formerly known as Sun River Mining Inc. (“Sun River”). The Company was originally incorporated in Colorado on February 25, 1997. Effective September 24, 2003, the Company completed a Plan of Reorganization and Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Plan”).
 
Pursuant to the Plan, the Company acquired the following three patents from Xoptix, Inc., a California corporation for Seventy Million (70,000,000) shares of common stock (post reverse split one for twenty): No. 6,180,871 for Transparent Solar Cell and Method of Fabrication (Device), granted on January 30, 2001; No. 6,320,117 for Transparent Solar Cell and Method of Fabrication (Method of Fabrication), granted on November 20, 2001; and No. 6,509,204 for Transparent Solar Cell and Method of Fabrication (formed with a Schottky barrier diode and method of its manufacture), granted on January 21, 2003.
 
Pursuant to the Plan, the Company authorized the issuance of 110,530,000 (post reverse split) common shares. Prior to the Plan, the Company had no tangible assets and insignificant liabilities. Subsequent to the Plan, the Company completed its name change from Sun River Mining, Inc. to XsunX, Inc. The transaction was completed on September 30, 2003.
 
Government Contracts
 
There are no government contracts as of the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018.

Compliance with Environmental Laws and Regulations
 
The operations of the Company are subject to local, state and federal laws and regulations governing environmental quality and pollution control. Compliance with these regulations by the Company has required that, when necessary, we retain the use of engineering and design firms of systems related to equipment operations, and occupancy fire and safety construction standards to deal with compliance of safety standards. We do not anticipate that these costs will have a material effect on the Company’s operations or competitive position as these requirements apply to our competition as well, and the cost of such compliance is typically incorporated into projects costs. The Company is unable to assess or predict at this time what effect additional regulations or legislation could have on its activities.
 
The solar systems we sell require interconnection permission from the applicable local primary electric utility prior to operation. In almost all cases, interconnection permissions are issued on the basis of a standard process that has been pre-approved by the public utility commission or other regulatory body with jurisdiction over utility net metering procedures. As such, no additional regulatory approvals are required once interconnection permission is given.
 
 Our operations are subject to federal, state and local laws, including regulations governing the occupational health and safety of our employees and wage regulations.
 
Employees and Consultants
 
As of the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, we had three full-time employees including Mr. Tom Djokovich who is President and CEO. While we do add to, and reduce, the size of our workforce based on current project needs this represents one full-time employee change to the same period ended 2017. To compensate our need for additional staff the Company also relies on qualified consultants and licensed professionals to perform specific functions that otherwise would require an employee. As we expand our business developments efforts, we may need to add staff to adequately respond to sales inquiries, project management, and general labor as warranted. We consider relations with our employees and consultants to be good.
Seasonality
 
Our operations have, in the past, experienced some seasonality for commercial sales with increased demand early and later in in each year. We believe that this trend may be related to late year project sales stemming from client interest in accessing same year tax benefits for solar investments, and early year sales related to fiscal budgeting for energy projects to be installed.
