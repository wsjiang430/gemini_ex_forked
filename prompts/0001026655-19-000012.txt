ITEM 1. BUSINESS
HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS OF CORE MOLDING TECHNOLOGIES, INC. 
In 1996, RYMAC Mortgage Investment Corporation (“RYMAC”) incorporated Core Molding Technologies, Inc. (“Core Molding Technologies” or the “Company”), formerly known as Core Materials Corporation before changing its name on August 28, 2002, for the purpose of acquiring the Columbus Plastics unit of Navistar, Inc. (“Navistar”), formerly known as International Truck & Engine Corporation. On December 31, 1996, RYMAC merged with and into the Company, with the Company as the surviving entity. Immediately after the merger, the Company acquired substantially all the assets and liabilities of the Columbus Plastics unit from Navistar in return for a secured note, which has been repaid, and 4,264,000 shares of newly issued common stock of the Company. On July 18, 2007, the Company entered into a stock repurchase agreement with Navistar, pursuant to which the Company repurchased 3,600,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, from Navistar. On August 16, 2013, Navistar sold its remaining 664,000 shares of common stock in a series of open market sales.
In 1998, the Company opened a second compression molding plant located in Gaffney, South Carolina as part of the Company’s growth strategy to expand its customer base. This facility provided the Company with additional capacity and a strategic location to serve both current and prospective customers. 
In October 2001, the Company incorporated Core Composites Corporation as a wholly owned subsidiary under the laws of the State of Delaware. This entity was established for the purpose of holding and establishing operations for Airshield Corporation’s assets, which the Company acquired on October 16, 2001 (the “Airshield Asset Acquisition”) as part of the Company’s diversified growth strategy. Airshield Corporation was a privately held manufacturer and marketer of fiberglass reinforced plastic parts primarily for the truck and automotive aftermarket industries. The Company purchased substantially all of the assets of Airshield Corporation through the United States Bankruptcy Court as Airshield Corporation had been operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection since March 2001. 
In conjunction with establishment of operations for the assets acquired in the Airshield Asset Acquisition, the Company established a Mexican subsidiary and leased a production facility in Mexico. In October 2001, the Company (5% owner) and Core Composites Corporation (95% owner) incorporated Corecomposites de Mexico, S. de R.L. de C.V. (“Corecomposites”) in Matamoros, Mexico. Corecomposites was organized to operate under a maquiladora program whereby substantially all products produced are exported back to Core Composites Corporation which sells such products to United States based external customers. In June of 2009, the Company completed construction and took occupancy of a new production facility in Matamoros, Mexico that replaced its leased facility. 
In August 2005, the Company formed Core Composites Cincinnati, LLC, ("Core Composites Cincinnati") a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. This entity was formed for the purpose of establishing operations and holding assets acquired from the Cincinnati Fiberglass Division of Diversified Glass Inc., which the Company acquired in August, 2005. The Cincinnati Fiberglass Division of Diversified Glass, Inc. was a privately held manufacturer and distributor of fiberglass reinforced plastic components supplied primarily to the heavy-duty truck market. As a result of this acquisition, the Company leases a manufacturing facility in Batavia, Ohio. 
In March 2015, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of CPI Binani, Inc., a Minnesota based manufacturer and producer of direct long fiber thermoplastic ("D-LFT") products, and a wholly owned subsidiary of Binani Industries Limited, located in Winona, Minnesota ("CPI"). The purpose of the acquisition was to increase the Company's process capabilities and diversify the Company's customer base.
On January 16, 2018, 1137925 B.C Ltd., subsequently renamed Horizon Plastics International Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the "Agreement") with Horizon Plastics International Inc.,1541689 Ontario Inc., 2551024 Ontario Inc. and Horizon Plastics de Mexico, S.A. de C.V. (collectively "Horizon Plastics"). Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement the Company acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of Horizon Plastics. Horizon Plastics is a custom low-pressure structural plastic molder, which utilizes both structural foam and structural web process technologies, operating within two manufacturing facilities located in Cobourg, Canada and Escobedo, Mexico. The purpose of the acquisition was to increase the Company's process capabilities to include structural foam and structural web molding, expand its geographical footprint, and diversify the Company's customer base.

Core Molding Technologies and its subsidiaries operate in the composites market in a family of products known as “structural composites.” Structural composites are combinations of resins and sometimes reinforcing fibers (typically glass or carbon) that are molded to shape. Core Molding Technologies is a manufacturer of sheet molding compound ("SMC") and molder of thermoset and thermoplastic products. The Company specializes in large-format moldings and offers a wide range of processes, including compression molding of SMC, glass mat thermoplastics ("GMT"), bulk molding compounds ("BMC") and direct long fiber thermoplastics ("D-LFT"), spray-up, hand-lay-up, resin transfer molding ("RTM"), structural foam and structural web injection molding ("SIM"), and reaction injection molding ("RIM"), utilizing dicyclopentadiene technology. 
Structural composites compete largely against metals and have the strength to function well during prolonged use. Management believes that structural composite components offer many advantages over metals, including:
•heat resistance;
•corrosion resistance;
•lighter weight;
•lower cost;
•greater flexibility in product design;
•part consolidation for multiple piece assemblies;
•lower initial tooling costs for lower volume applications;
•high strength-to-weight ratio; and
•dent-resistance in comparison to steel or aluminum.
 4

The largest markets for structural composites are transportation (automotive and truck), agriculture, construction, marine, and industrial applications. As of December 31, 2018, the Company operated seven production facilities in Columbus, Ohio; Batavia, Ohio; Gaffney, South Carolina; Winona, Minnesota; Matamoros and Escobedo, Mexico; and Cobourg, Canada, which produce structural composite products. Our manufacturing facilities utilize various production processes; however, end products are similar and are not unique to a facility or customer base. Operating decision makers (officers of the Company) are headquartered in Columbus, Ohio and oversee all manufacturing operations for all products as well as oversee customer relationships with all customers. The Company supplies structural composite products to truck manufacturers, automotive suppliers, and manufacturers of marine and other commercial products. In general, product growth and diversification are achieved in several different ways: (1) resourcing of existing structural composite product from another supplier by an original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”); (2) obtaining new structural composite products through a selection process in which an OEM solicits bids; (3) successful marketing of structural composite products for previously non-structural composite applications; (4) successful marketing of structural composite products to OEMs outside of our traditional markets; (5) developing of new materials, technology and processes to meet current or prospective customer requirements; and (6) acquiring an existing business. The Company's efforts continue to be directed towards all six areas.
MAJOR COMPETITORS
The Company believes that it is one of the largest compounders and molders of structural composites using the SMC, spray-up, hand-lay-up, RTM, SIM, and D-LFT molding processes in North America.  The Company faces competition from a number of other molders including, most significantly, Molded Fiber Glass Companies, Continental Structural Plastics, Ashley Industrial Molding, Sigma Industries, and The Composites Group.  The Company believes that it is well positioned to compete based primarily on manufacturing capability and location, product quality, engineering capability, cost, and delivery.  However, the industry remains highly competitive and some of the Company's competitors have greater financial resources, research and development facilities, design engineering, manufacturing, and marketing capabilities.
MAJOR CUSTOMERS
The Company had four major customers, Navistar, Volvo Group ("Volvo"), PACCAR Inc. ("PACCAR"), and Universal Forest Products ("UFP"), in 2018. Major customers are defined as customers whose current year sales individually consist of more than ten percent of total sales during any annual or interim reporting period in the current year. The loss of a significant portion of sales to one of these customers would have a material adverse effect on the business of the Company. 
The North American truck market in which Navistar, Volvo, and PACCAR compete is highly competitive and the demand for heavy and medium-duty trucks is subject to considerable volatility as it moves in response to cycles in the overall business environment and is particularly sensitive to the industrial sector, which generates a significant portion of the freight tonnage hauled. Truck demand also depends on general economic conditions, among other factors. 
UFP supplies forestry-based products to three market segments:  retail, industrial, and construction.  This is a highly-competitive business, with suppliers competing for a share of available shelf space at large “big box” retailers and independent contractors.  As a discretionary product category, suppliers must also strive continuously to differentiate their products with unique designs, colors, and features, in addition to maintaining a constant focus on cost reduction.  Demand for these products is driven by residential and commercial construction and general economic conditions, among other influences.
Relationship with Navistar
The Company has historically had a Comprehensive Supply Agreement with Navistar that provides for the Company to be the primary supplier of Navistar’s original equipment and service requirements for fiberglass reinforced parts, as long as the Company remains competitive in cost, quality, and delivery. The Company's current Comprehensive Supply Agreement with Navistar is effective through November 2, 2021. 
The Company makes products for Navistar's Springfield, Ohio; Tulsa, Oklahoma; and Escobedo, Mexico assembly plants, as well as aftermarket products for service distribution centers. The Company works closely on new product development with Navistar's engineering and research personnel. Products sold to Navistar include hoods, roofs, air deflectors, cab extenders, fender extensions, splash panels, and other components. Sales to Navistar amounted to approximately 20%, 25% and 24% of total sales for 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.
 5

Relationship with Volvo
The Company makes products for Volvo’s New River Valley (Dublin, Virginia) and Macungie, Pennsylvania assembly plants, as well as aftermarket products for service distribution centers. The Company works closely on new product development with Volvo’s engineering and research teams. Products sold to Volvo include hoods, roofs, sunvisors, air deflectors, cab extenders and other components. Sales to Volvo amounted to approximately 17%, 22%, and 29% of total sales for 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.
Relationship with PACCAR

The Company makes products for PACCAR's Chillicothe, Ohio; Denton, Texas; Renton, Washington; St. Therese (Canada); and Mexicali, Mexico assembly plants, as well as aftermarket products for service distribution centers. The Company also works closely on new product development with PACCAR's engineering and research personnel. Products sold to PACCAR include hoods, roofs, back panels, air deflectors, air fairings, fenders, splash panels, cab extenders, and other components. Sales to PACCAR amounted to approximately 16%, 18%, and 16% of total sales for 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.
Relationship with UFP
The Company manufactures a line of outdoor living and home decor products as part of UFP's broad offerings to "big box" retailers. These products are labeled and packaged for direct placement onto retail shelves, and are shipped to UFP distribution facilities primarily throughout North America. The Company works directly with UFP on innovative product advances that reduce cost and extend the appeal of the products to consumers. Sales to UFP amounted to approximately 10%, 0%, and 0% of total sales for 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.
OTHER CUSTOMERS
The Company also produces products for other truck manufacturers, the automotive industry, marine industry, commercial product industries, automotive aftermarket industries, and various other customers and industries. Sales to these customers individually were all less than 10% of total sales for interim and annual reporting during 2018. Sales to these customers amounted to approximately 37%, 35% and 31% of total sales for 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.

PRODUCTS
Sheet Molding Compound (“SMC”)
SMC is primarily a combination of resins, fiberglass, fillers, and catalysts compounded and cured in sheet form, which is then used to manufacture compression-molded products, as discussed below. The Company also sells SMC to other molders.
The Company incorporates a sophisticated computer program in the process of compounding various complex SMC formulations tailored to meet customer needs. The program provides for the control of information during various production processes and data for statistical batch controls.
Closed Molded Products
The Company manufactures plastic products using compression molding, resin transfer molding, and injection molding. As of December 31, 2018, the Company owned 74 molding presses in its Columbus, Ohio facility (16); Matamoros, Mexico facility (21); Cobourg, Canada facility (19); Gaffney, South Carolina facility (10); Winona, Minnesota facility;(4) and Escobedo, Mexico (4). The Company's molding presses range in size from 250 to 5,000 tons.
Compression Molding of SMC - Compression molding is a process whereby SMC is molded to form by matched die steel molds through which a combination of heat and pressure are applied via a molding press. This process produces high quality, dimensionally consistent products. This process is typically used for high volume products. Higher volumes justify the customer's investment in matched die steel molds.
Large platen, high tonnage presses (2,000 tons or greater) provide the ability to mold very large reinforced plastic parts. The Company believes that it possesses a significant portion of the large platen, high tonnage molding capacity in the industry. To enhance the surface quality and the paint finish of our products, the Company uses both in-mold coating and vacuum molding processes. 
In-mold coating is the process of injecting a liquid over the molded part surface and then applying pressure at elevated temperatures during an extended molding cycle. The liquid coating serves to fill and/or bridge surface porosity as well as provide a barrier against solvent penetration during subsequent top-coating operations. 
Vacuum molding is the removal of air during the molding cycle for the purpose of reducing the amount of surface porosity. The Company believes that it is among the industry leaders in in-mold coating and vacuum molding applications, based on the size and complexity of parts molded.
Resin Transfer Molding (“RTM”) - This process employs two molds, typically a core and a cavity, similar to matched die molding. The composite is produced by placing glass mat, chopped strand, or continuous strand fiberglass in the mold cavity in the desired pattern. Parts used for cosmetic purposes typically have a gel coat applied to the mold surface. The core mold is then fitted to the cavity, and upon a satisfactory seal, a vacuum is applied. When the proper vacuum is achieved, the resin is injected into the mold to fill the part. Finally, the part is allowed to cure and is then removed from the mold and trimmed to shape. Fiberglass reinforced products produced from the RTM process exhibit a high quality surface on both sides of the part and excellent part thickness. The multiple insert tooling technique can be utilized in the RTM process to improve throughput based upon volume requirements.
Structural Foam and Web Injection Molding (“SIM”) - Structural foam and structural web are low-pressure injection molding processes that develop high-strength, rigid parts at low weight.  This is accomplished by mixing a foaming agent (usually, nitrogen gas) with the melted polymer (structural foam process), or by injecting nitrogen gas into the mold cavity immediately after the plastic resin is injected (structural web molding).  Structural foam produces a cellular interior structure that can provide twice the rigidity of a solid plastic molding.  The structural web process pushes the plastic out to the mold cavity walls, uniformly packing out the entire mold and hollowing out thicker sections to create products of varying wall thicknesses.  As a result, structural web molded parts have a smoother, glossier finish than other low pressure parts.  Both processes give part designers flexibility when designing products that need strength and stiffness at low weight.
Direct Long-Fiber Thermoplastics (“D-LFT”) - D-LFT molding employs two molds, typically a core and a cavity, similar to matched die molding. This is a process for compounding and molding thermoplastic materials with "long" fibers (typically, 0.5 inch or longer). Engineered thermoplastic pellets and performance additives are compounded in a screw extruder, to which chopped reinforcements (typically, glass fibers) are added and further extruded. A "charge" of material is cut to a precise weight, and this "charge" is directly moved to a compression or injection-transfer process, where it is molded into a finished part. The process 
 7

allows for direct processing of the compounded material, bypassing the expense and delay of producing an intermediate product (pellets or sheets) as is used in other fiber-reinforced thermoplastic molding processes. The D-LFT process is an attractive option for products that have complex geometry, require high strength and stiffness, and benefit from the recyclability of a thermoplastic resin.
Reaction Injection Molding (“RIM”) - This is a process whereby a composite is produced through the injection of a two-component thermoset resin system utilizing dicyclopentadiene (“DCPD”) technology. DCPD technology involves injecting a liquid compound into matched die aluminum molds to form the part.  In this process the mold is prepared, closed and the liquid compound is injected into the tool then cured. Additional finishing is required when the part is designated for top coat painting.  The RIM process is an alternative to other closed mold processes for mid-volume parts that require a high level of impact resistance.
Open Molded Products
The Company produces reinforced plastic products using both the hand lay-up and spray-up methods of open molding at our Batavia, Ohio and Matamoros, Mexico locations. Part sizes weigh from a few pounds to several hundred pounds with surface quality tailored for the end use application.
Hand Lay-Up - This process utilizes a shell mold, typically the cavity, where glass cloth, either chopped strand or continuous strand glass mat, is introduced into the cavity. Resin is then applied to the cloth and rolled out to achieve a uniform wet-out from the glass and to remove any trapped air. The part is then allowed to cure and is removed from the mold. After removal, the part typically undergoes trimming to achieve the shape desired. Parts used for cosmetic purposes typically have a gel coat applied to the mold surface prior to the lay-up to improve the surface quality of the finished part. Parts produced from this process have a smooth outer surface and an unfinished or rough interior surface. These fiberglass-reinforced products are typically non-cosmetic components or structural reinforcements that are sold externally or used internally as components of larger assemblies.
Spray-Up - This process utilizes the same type of shell mold as hand-lay-up, but instead of using glass cloth to produce the composite part, a chopper/spray system is employed. Glass rovings and resin feed the chopper/spray gun. The resin coated, chopped glass is sprayed into the mold to the desired thickness. The resin coated glass in the mold is then rolled out to ensure complete wet-out and to remove any trapped air. The part is then allowed to cure, is removed from the mold, and is then trimmed to the desired shape. Parts used for cosmetic purposes typically have a gel coat applied to the mold surface prior to the resin-coated glass being sprayed into the mold to improve the surface quality of the finished part. Parts produced from this process have a smooth outer surface and an unfinished or rough interior surface. 
Assembly, Machining, and Paint Products
Many of the products molded by the Company are assembled, machined, and prime painted or topcoat painted to result in a completed product used by the Company's customers.
The Company has demonstrated manufacturing flexibility that accommodates a range of low volume hand assembly and machining work, to high volume, highly automated assembly and machining systems. Robotics are used as deemed productive for material
handling, machining, and adhesive applications. In addition to conventional machining methods, water-jet cutting technology is also used where appropriate. The Company also utilizes paint booths and batch ovens in its facilities. The Company generally contracts with outside providers for higher volume applications that require top coat paint.
RAW MATERIALS
The principal raw materials used in the Company's processes are unsaturated polyester; vinyl ester; polyethylene, polypropylene and dicyclopentadiene resins; fiberglass; and filler. Other significant raw materials include adhesives for assembly of molded components, in-mold coating, gel-coat, prime paint for preparation of cosmetic surfaces, and hardware (primarily metal components). Many of the raw materials used by the Company are crude oil based, natural gas based and downstream components, and therefore, the costs of certain raw materials can be affected by changes in costs of these underlying commodities. Due to fluctuating commodity prices, suppliers are typically reluctant to enter into long-term contracts. The Company generally has supplier alternatives for each raw material, and regularly evaluates its supplier base for certain supplies, repair items, and components to improve its overall purchasing position.
BACKLOG
The Company relies on production schedules provided by its customers to plan and implement production. These schedules are normally provided on a weekly basis and typically considered firm for approximately four weeks. Some customers update these 
 8

schedules daily for changes in demand, allowing them to run their inventories on a “just‑in‑time” basis. The ordered backlog of four weeks of expected shipments was approximately $22.7 million (all of which the Company shipped during the first month of 2019) and $13.2 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS
Capacity utilization is measured based on standard cycle times and a standard work week, which can range from five days per week, three-shifts per day to seven days per week, three-shifts per day, depending on the facility and molding process. During times when demand exceeds the standard five day, three-shift capacity, the Company will work weekends to create additional capacity, which can provide capacity utilization percentages greater than 100%. During 2018, the Company has used various methods from overtime to a weekend manpower crew to support the customers' production requirements.  
The approximate SMC production line capacity utilization was 77% and 54% for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  
The Company measures facility capacity in terms of its large molding presses (2,000 tons or greater) for the Columbus, Ohio, Gaffney, South Carolina, Winona, Minnesota and the SMC molding at the Matamoros, Mexico facility. The Company owned 27 large molding presses at these facilities at December 31, 2018. The combined approximate large press capacity utilization in these production facilities was 91% and 63% for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increased utilization mainly resulted from increase demand from customers in the heavy truck and marine markets.

The Company measures facility capacity in terms of its large molding presses (750 tons or greater) for the Cobourg, Canada facility. The Company owned 8 large molding presses at this facility at December 31, 2018. The combined approximate large press capacity utilization in this facility was 52% for the year ended December 31, 2018.
CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Capital expenditures totaled approximately $5.8 million, $4.3 million and $2.9 million in 2018, 2017, and 2016 respectively. These capital expenditures primarily consisted of building and equipment improvements and additional production equipment to manufacture parts. 
The Company continuously engages in product development. Research and development activities focus on developing new material formulations, new structural composite products, new production capabilities and processes, and improving existing products and manufacturing processes. The Company does not maintain a separate research and development organization or facility, but uses its production equipment, as necessary, to support these efforts and cooperates with its customers and its suppliers in research and development efforts. Likewise, manpower to direct and advance research and development is integrated with the existing manufacturing, engineering, production, and quality organizations. Management of the Company has estimated that costs related to research and development were approximately $1,032,000, $848,000 and $965,000 in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.
ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE
The Company's manufacturing operations are subject to federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations, which impose limitations on the discharge of hazardous and non-hazardous pollutants into the air and waterways.  The Company has established and implemented standards for the treatment, storage, and disposal of hazardous waste. The Company's policy is to conduct its business with due regard for the preservation and protection of the environment. The Company's environmental waste management process involves the regular auditing of hazardous waste accumulation points, hazardous waste activities, authorized treatment, and storage and disposal facilities.  As part of the Company's environmental policy, all manufacturing employees are trained on waste management and other environmental issues.  
The Company holds various environmental operating permits for its production facilities in the U.S., Mexico, and Canada as required by U.S., Mexican and Canadian state and federal regulations. The Company has substantially complied with all requirements of these operating permits.

PATENTS, TRADE NAMES, AND TRADEMARKS
The Company will evaluate, apply for, and maintain patents, trade names, and trademarks where it believes that such patents, trade names, and trademarks are reasonably required to protect its rights in its products.  The Company has increased its activity related to trademark protection in recent years, including the federal registration of the trademarks N-sulGuard®, Featherlite®, Airilite®, FeatherliteXL®, Econolite®, and Hydrilite®. However, the Company does not believe that any single patent, trade name, or trademark or related group of such rights is materially important to its business or its ability to compete.
SEASONALITY & BUSINESS CYCLE
The Company's business is affected annually by the production schedules of its customers. Certain of the Company's customers typically shut down their operations on an annual basis for a period of one to several weeks during the Company's third quarter. Certain customers also typically shut down their operations during the last week of December. As a result, demand for the Company's products typically decreases during the third and fourth quarters. Demand for medium and heavy-duty trucks, marine, automotive, and commercial products also fluctuates on an economic, cyclical and seasonal basis, causing a corresponding fluctuation for demand of the Company's products.
