ITEM 1 | BUSINESS
-------+---------

 American Vanguard Corporation (“AVD”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in January 1969 and operates as a holding company. Unless the context otherwise requires, references to the “Company” or the “Registrant,” in this Annual Report refer to AVD. The Company conducts its business through its subsidiaries, AMVAC Chemical Corporation (“AMVAC”), GemChem, Inc. (“GemChem”),  AMVAC Mexico Sociedad de Responsabilidad Limitada (“AMVAC M”), AMVAC de Costa Rica Sociedad de Responsabilidad Limitada (“AMVAC CR Srl”), AMVAC do Brasil Representácoes Ltda (“AMVAC B”), AMVAC C.V. (“AMVAC CV”), AMVAC Netherlands BV (“AMVAC BV”), Envance Technologies, LLC (“Envance”), TyraTech Inc. (“TyraTech”), AMVAC Singapore Pte, Ltd (“AMVAC Sgpr”), Huifeng AMVAC Innovation Co. Limited (“Hong Kong JV”), OHP Inc. (“OHP”) and Grupo AgriCenter (including the parent AgriCenter S.A. and its subsidiaries (“AgriCenter”)).
 Based on similar economic and operational characteristics, the Company’s business is aggregated into one reportable segment. Refer to Part II, Item 7 for selective enterprise information.
 AVD operates its business through its principle operating subsidiaries including AMVAC for its domestic business and AMVAC BV for its international business. 
 AMVAC is a California corporation that traces its history from 1945 and is a specialty chemical manufacturer that develops and markets products for agricultural, commercial and consumer uses. It manufactures and formulates chemicals for crops, turf and ornamental plants, and human and animal health protection. These chemicals, which include insecticides, fungicides, herbicides, molluscicides, growth regulators, and soil fumigants, are marketed in liquid, powder, and granular forms. In prior years, AMVAC considered itself a distributor-formulator, but now AMVAC primarily synthesizes, formulates, and distributes its own proprietary products or custom manufactures, formulates or distributes for others. In addition, the Company has carved out a leadership position in closed delivery systems, currently offers certain of its products in SmartBox, Lock ‘n Load and EZ Load systems, and is developing a precision application technology known as SIMPAS (see “Intellectual Property” below) which will permit the delivery of multiple products (from AMVAC and/or other companies) at variable rates in a single pass.  AMVAC has historically expanded its business through both the acquisition of established chemistries (which it has revived in the marketplace), the development and commercialization of new formulations or compounds through licensing arrangements and by expanding our distribution network to gain market access. 
 AMVAC BV is a Netherlands Corporation that was established in 2012 and is based in Houton, near Amsterdam in the Netherlands. AMVAC BV sells product through sales based subsidiaries in various international territories. 
 Below is a description of the Company’s acquisition/licensing activity over the past five years.
 On December 28, 2018, the Company’s international subsidiary AMVAC BV completed the purchase of certain assets related to the quizalofop product family from E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company. Quizalofop is an herbicide marketed under the name Assure II for use on canola, soybeans and pulse (among other things) in Canada and the United States. This transaction includes acquisition of registrations, registration data, trademarks, inventory, commercial sales information, and the transfer of existing product supply arrangements.

On December 14, 2018, AMVAC completed the purchase of certain assets related to the trichlorfon product family from Bayer AG and Bayer CropScience AG (“Bayer”). Trichlorfon is an insecticide marketed under the name Dylox in turf, ornamental and other markets. This transaction includes registrations, trademarks and manufacturing know-how. AMVAC will manufacture and supply formulated end use products to Bayer for the latter’s distribution.
 On November 9, 2018, AMVAC completed the purchase of all of the outstanding shares of TyraTech, Inc. and, in the process, delisted TyraTech from the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange. TyraTech develops non-toxic insecticides and green solutions for pest control. Their patented technology platform leverages synergistic essential oil combinations to target invertebrate pest receptors that are not active in humans and other mammals.
 On June 20, 2018, AMVAC completed the purchase of certain intangible assets related to the Bromacil product family and included end use registrations in the United States. The assets were purchased from Bayer AG. From June 20, 2018 until October 25, 2018, Bayer continued to act as the Company’s agent in the market place. Bromacil is a broad spectrum residual herbicide used for non-agricultural industrial vegetation control and on many crops such as pineapples, citrus, agave and asparagus. Marketed under the Hyvar® and Krovar® brands, Bromacil herbicides are valued and long established weed control tools. AMVAC previously purchased these brands from DuPont Crop Protection in 2015 for markets outside of US and Canada including Japan, Thailand, Mexico, Cost Rica and Brazil. 
 On October 27, 2017, the Company’s Netherlands-based subsidiary, AMVAC BV, completed the purchase of AgriCenter S.A., a distribution company based in Costa Rica. AgriCenter markets and distributes end-use chemical and biological products throughout Central America, primarily for crop applications. The acquired assets included product registration, trade names and trademarks, customer lists, personnel, fixed assets, goodwill and working capital.
 On October 2, 2017, AMVAC acquired substantially all of the assets of OHP, a US-based distribution company specializing in the greenhouse and nursery production markets. The acquired assets included existing product rights, trade names, customer relationships, personnel, goodwill, fixed assets and working capital.
 On August 22, 2017, AMVAC BV, completed the acquisition of certain selective herbicides and contact fungicides including chlorothanonil, ametryn, and isopyrazam, sold in the Mexican agricultural market. The assets were purchased from Syngenta AG and used on various crops such as sugarcane, tomatoes, potatoes and hot peppers. The acquired assets included product registrations, trademarks and trade names, customer lists, and associated inventory.  
 On June 6, 2017, AMVAC, completed an acquisition of certain herbicides, fungicides and insecticides assets relating to the abamectin, chlorothalonil and paraquat product lines from a group of companies, including Adama Agricultural Solutions, Ltd. These products are used on a wide range of crops such as citrus, cotton, nuts, fruits and vegetables.  The acquired assets included product registrations, trademarks and trade names, customer lists, and associated inventory.
 On January 13, 2017, AMVAC acquired from The Andersons, Inc. certain assets relating to proprietary formulations containing PCNB, chlorothalonil and propiconazole which are marketed under the name FFII and FFIII. The acquired assets included end use registrations.  
 On June 27, 2017, both AMVAC BV and Huifeng made individual capital contributions of $950 to the Hong Kong JV. On July 7, 2017, the Hong Kong JV purchased 100% of the shares of Profeng Australia Pty Ltd. (“Profeng”), for a total consideration of $1,900. 
 On February 29, 2016, AMVAC BV purchased shares constituting a 15% interest in BiPA NV/SA, a Belgian company specializing in the development and early commercialization of biological products for use in agriculture. Through this investment, AMVAC BV obtained possible future access to a pipeline of new biological products for potential commercialization either individually in certain territories or in combination with the Company’s existing product portfolio.
 Seasonality
 The agricultural chemical industry, in general, is cyclical in nature. The demand for AVD’s products tends to be seasonal. Seasonal usage, however, does not necessarily follow calendar dates, but more closely follows varying growing seasonal patterns, weather conditions, geography, weather related pressure from pests and customer marketing programs.
Backlog
 AVD does not believe that backlog is a significant factor in its business. The Company primarily sells its products on the basis of purchase orders, although from time to time it has entered into requirements contracts with certain customers.

Customers
 The Company’s largest three customers accounted for 12%, 9% and 8% of the Company’s sales in 2018; 13%, 10% and 10% in 2017; and 15%, 11% and 8% in 2016.
 Distribution
 AVD manages its US business through its principal operating subsidiary, AMVAC. AMVAC predominantly distributes its products domestically through national distribution companies and buying groups or co-operatives, which purchase AMVAC’s goods on a purchase order basis and, in turn, sell them to retailers/growers/end-users. AVD manages its international sales through AMVAC BV, which has sales offices in Mexico, Costa Rica and several other countries in Central America, and sales force executives, sales agents or wholly owned distributors in other territories. The Company’s domestic and international distributors, agents and customers typically have long-established relationships with retailers/end-users, far-reaching logistics, transportation capabilities and/or customer service expertise. The markets for AVD products vary by region, target crop, use and type of distribution channel. AVD’s customers are experts at addressing these various markets. 
Competition
 In its many marketplaces, AVD faces competition from both domestic and foreign manufacturers. Many of our competitors are larger and have substantially greater financial and technical resources than AVD. AVD’s capacity to compete depends on its ability to develop additional applications for its current products and/or expand its product lines and customer base. AVD competes principally on the basis of the quality and efficacy of its products, price and the technical service and support given to its customers.
 Generally, the treatment against pests of any kind is broad in scope, there being more than one way, or one product, for treatment, eradication, or suppression. In some cases, AVD has positioned itself in smaller niche markets, which are no longer addressed by larger companies. In other cases, for example in the Midwest corn market, the Company competes directly with larger competitors.
 Manufacturing
 Through its four domestic manufacturing facilities (see Item 2, Properties), AVD synthesizes many of the technical grade active ingredients that are in its end-use products. Further, the Company formulates and packages its end use products at its own facilities or at the facilities of third-party formulators.
Raw Materials
 AVD utilizes numerous companies to supply the various raw materials and components used in manufacturing its products. Many of these materials are readily available from domestic sources. In those instances where there is a single source of supply or where the source is not domestic, AVD seeks to secure its supply by either long-term (multi-year) arrangements or purchasing on long lead times from its suppliers. 
Intellectual Property
 AVD’s proprietary product formulations are protected, to the extent possible, as trade secrets and, to a lesser extent, by patents. Certain of the Company’s closed delivery systems are patented and the Company has made applications for related inventions to expand its equipment portfolio, particularly with respect to its Smart Integrated Multi-Product Precision Application System, (“SIMPAS”) technology. Further, AVD’s trademarks bring value to its products in both domestic and foreign markets. AVD considers that, in the aggregate, its trademarks, licenses, and patents constitute a valuable asset. While it does not regard its current business as being materially dependent upon any single trademark, license, or patent, it believes that patents will play an increasingly important role in its developmental equipment technology in future years.

EPA Registrations
 In the United States, AVD’s products also receive protection afforded by the terms of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (“FIFRA”) legislation. The legislation makes it unlawful to sell any pesticide in the United States, unless such pesticide has first been registered by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“USEPA”). Substantially all of the Company’s products, sold in United States, are subject to USEPA registration and periodic re-registration requirements and are registered in accordance with FIFRA. This registration by USEPA is based, among other things, on data demonstrating that the product will not cause unreasonable adverse effects on human health or the environment, when used according to approved label directions. In addition, each state requires a specific registration before any of AVD’s products can be marketed, or used in that state. State registrations are predominantly renewed annually with a smaller number of registrations that are renewed on a multiple year basis. Foreign jurisdictions typically have similar registration requirements by statute. 
 The USEPA, state, and foreign agencies have required, and may require in the future, that certain scientific data requirements be performed on registered products sold by AVD. AVD, on its own behalf and in joint efforts with other registrants, has furnished, and is currently furnishing, required data relative to specific products. Under FIFRA, the federal government requires registrants to submit a wide range of scientific data to support U.S. registrations. This requirement results in operating expenses in such areas as regulatory compliance, with USEPA and other such bodies in the markets in which the Company sells its products. In addition, the Company is required to generate new formulations of existing products or to produce new products in order to remain compliant. The Company expensed $16,047, $14,232 and $11,544, during 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, on these activities.

Environmental
 During 2018, AMVAC continued activities to address environmental issues associated with its facility in Commerce, CA. (the “Facility”). An outline of the history of those activities follows.
 In 1995, the California Department of Toxic Substances Control (“DTSC”) conducted a Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) Facility Assessment (“RFA”) of those facilities having hazardous waste storage permits. In March 1997, the RFA culminated in DTSC accepting the Facility into its Expedited Remedial Action Program. Under this program, the Facility was required to conduct an environmental investigation and health risk assessment.   This activity then took two paths: first, the RCRA permit closure and second, the larger site characterization.
 With respect to the RCRA permit closure, in 1998, AMVAC began the formal process to close its hazardous waste permit at the Facility (which had allowed AMVAC to store hazardous waste longer than 90 days) as required by federal regulations. Formal regulatory closure actions began in 2005 and were completed in 2008, as evidenced by DTSC’s October 1, 2008 acknowledgement of AMVAC’s Closure Certification Report.
 With respect to the larger site characterization, soil and groundwater characterization activities began in December 2002 in accordance with the Site Investigation Plan that was approved by DTSC. Additional activities were conducted from 2003 to 2014, with oversight provided by DTSC. In 2014, the Company submitted a remedial action plan (“RAP”) to DTSC, under the provisions of which, the Company proposed not to disturb sub-surface contaminants, but to continue monitoring, maintain the cover above affected soil, enter into restrictive covenants regarding the potential use of the property in the future, and provide financial assurances relating to the requirements of the RAP.  In January 2017, the RAP was circulated for public comment.  DTSC responded to those comments and, on September 29, 2017, approved the RAP as submitted by the Company. The Company intends to prepare an operation and maintenance plan, to record covenants on certain affected parcels and to obtain further clarification on financial assurance obligations relating to the RAP.  At this stage, the Company does not believe that costs to be incurred in connection with the RAP will be material. 
 AMVAC is subject to numerous federal and state laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental matters and employee health and safety at its four manufacturing facilities. The Company continually adapts its manufacturing process to the environmental control standards of the various regulatory agencies. The USEPA and other federal and state agencies have the authority to promulgate regulations that could have an impact on the Company’s operations.

AMVAC expends substantial funds to minimize the risk of discharge of materials in the environment and to comply with the governmental regulations relating to protection of the environment. Wherever feasible, AMVAC recovers and recycles raw materials and increases product yield in order to partially offset increasing pollution abatement costs.
 The Company is committed to a long-term environmental protection program that reduces emissions of hazardous materials into the environment, as well as to the remediation of identified existing environmental concerns.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, the Company employed 624 employees.  The Company employed 605 employees as of December 31, 2017 and 395 employees as of December 31, 2016. From time to time, due to the seasonality of its business, AVD uses temporary contract personnel to perform certain duties primarily related to packaging of its products. None of the Company’s employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. The Company believes it maintains positive relations with its employees.
 Domestic operations
 AMVAC is a California corporation that was incorporated under the name of Durham Chemical in August 1945. The name of the corporation was subsequently changed to AMVAC in January 1971. As the Company’s main operating subsidiary, AMVAC owns and/or operates the Company’s domestic manufacturing facilities and is also the parent company (owns 99%) of AMVAC CV. AMVAC manufactures, formulates, packages and sells its products in the USA and is a wholly owned subsidiary of AVD.
 GemChem is a California corporation that was incorporated in 1991 and was subsequently purchased by the Company in 1994. GemChem sells into the pharmaceutical, cosmetic and nutritional markets, in addition to purchasing key raw materials for the Company. GemChem is a wholly owned subsidiary of AVD.
 DAVIE owns real estate for corporate use only. See also Part I, Item 2 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. DAVIE is a wholly owned subsidiary of AVD.
 Envance is a Delaware Limited Liability Company and is a majority owned subsidiary of the Company.  It was formed in 2012 with joint venture partner, TyraTech.  AMVAC’s initial shareholding was 60% and its shareholding increased to 87% in 2015. On November 8, 2018, the Company acquired TyraTech which was previously the minority shareholder in Envance. As of November 9, 2018, the Company owned 100% of Envance. Envance has the rights to develop and commercialize pesticide products and technologies made from natural oils in global consumer, commercial, professional, crop protection and seed treatment markets and has begun bringing products to market. 
 On October 2, 2017, AMVAC, through a wholly-owned acquisition subsidiary, subsequently renamed OHP, purchased substantially all of the assets of OHP, a domestic distribution company specializing in products for the turf and ornamental market. OHP markets and sells end use products for third parties, either under the third party brand or else as own label products. 
 As noted above, on November 8, 2018, the Company acquired the remaining 65.62% of the shares of TyraTech Inc. and, as a result, TyraTech became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company from November 9, 2018.
 International operations
 In July 2012, the Company formed AMVAC CV, which is incorporated in the Netherlands, for the purpose of managing foreign sales on behalf of the Company. AMVAC CV is owned jointly by AMVAC as the general partner, and AVD International, LLC (also formed in July 2012 as a wholly owned subsidiary of AMVAC), as the limited partner, and is therefore a wholly owned subsidiary of AMVAC.
 AMVAC BV is a registered Dutch private limited liability company that was formed in July 2012. AMVAC BV is located in the Netherlands and is wholly owned by AMVAC CV. During 2018, the international business sold the Company’s products in 54 countries, as compared to 63 countries in 2017.

Risk Management
 The Company regularly monitors matters, whether insurable or not, that could pose material risk to its operations, the safety of its employees and neighbors, and its financial performance. The Risk Committee of the Board of Directors (“Board”) was formed in 2010, consists of three members of the Board and meets regularly. All members of the Board are invited to and typically attend Risk Committee meetings. Working with senior management, the committee continuously evaluates the Company’s risk profile, identifies mitigation measures and ensures that the Company is prudently managing these risks. In support of the Risk Committee, senior management has appointed a risk manager and designated several senior executives to lead teams focused on addressing each of the most material risks facing the Company; these groups perform analysis with the benefit of operational knowledge. The top risks identified by management and being addressed by risk teams (in no particular order) include: adverse political and regulatory climate; managing inventory and optimizing manufacturing efficiency; succession planning and bench strength; maintaining a competitive edge in the marketplace; the possibility of an environmental event; undervaluation of the Company; availability of acquisition and licensing targets and cyber-terrorism. In addition, the Company continually evaluates insurance levels for product liability, property damage and other potential areas of risk. Management believes its facilities and equipment are adequately insured against loss from usual business risks including cyber-terrorism.
