Products and Product Mix
Diversified Industrial Segment
The Diversified Industrial segment is comprised of manufacturers of engineered niche industrial products, with leading market positions in many of the markets they serve. The businesses in this segment distribute products to customers through their sales personnel, outside sales representatives and distributors in North and South America, Europe, Australia, Asia and several other international markets. Below is additional information related to the businesses within the Diversified Industrial segment.
Joining Materials - The Joining Materials business primarily fabricates precious metals and their alloys into brazing alloys. Brazing alloys are used to join similar and dissimilar metals, as well as specialty metals and some ceramics, with strong, hermetic joints. The Joining Materials business offers these metal joining products in a wide variety of alloys, including gold, silver, palladium, copper, nickel, aluminum and tin. These brazing alloys are fabricated into a variety of engineered forms and are used in many industries, including electrical, appliance, transportation, construction and general industrial, where dissimilar material and metal joining applications are required. Operating income from precious metal products is principally derived from the "value-added" of processing and fabricating and not from the direct purchase and resale of precious metals. The Joining Materials business enters into commodity futures and forward contracts to mitigate the impact of price fluctuations on its precious and certain non-precious metal inventories that are not subject to fixed price contracts.
Tubing - The Tubing business manufactures a wide variety of stainless and low carbon steel tubing products. The Tubing business manufactures some of the world's longest continuous seamless stainless steel tubing coils, up to 6,000 feet, serving primarily the petrochemical and oil and gas infrastructure markets. We believe that the Tubing business is also a leading manufacturer of mechanical and fluid-carrying welded low carbon tubing used for diverse industries, including the automotive, heavy truck, heating, cooling and oil and gas markets. Products are delivered in continuous lengths from 2 inches to 30,000 feet in coil, cut or spool packaging styles. 
Building Materials - The Building Materials business manufactures and supplies products primarily to the commercial construction and building industries. It manufactures fasteners, adhesives and fastening systems for the U.S. commercial low-slope roofing industry, which are sold to building and roofing material wholesalers, roofing contractors and private label roofing system manufacturers, and a line of engineered specialty fasteners for the building products industry for fastening applications in the remodeling and construction of homes, decking and landscaping.
Performance Materials - The Performance Materials business manufactures woven substrates of fiberglass, quartz, carbon and aramid materials for specialty applications in a wide expanse of markets requiring highly engineered components. Its products are used in a wide range of advanced composite applications, such as commercial and military aerospace components, printed electronic circuit boards, automotive and industrial components, and substrates for commercial and military armor applications.
Electrical Products - The Electrical Products business designs, manufactures and markets power electronics, motion control, power protection, power quality electromagnetic equipment, and custom ball-screws, gears and gearboxes used in a variety of medical, commercial and military aerospace, computer, datacom, industrial, specialty LED lighting, test and measurement, and telecom applications. Its products are generally incorporated into larger systems to improve operating performance, safety, reliability and efficiency.
Kasco Blades and Route Repair Services ("Kasco") - The Kasco business provides meat-room blade products, repair services and distributed products for the meat and deli departments of supermarkets, restaurants, meat and fish processing plants, and for distributors of electrical saws and cutting equipment, principally in North America and Europe. The Kasco business also provides cutting blades for bakeries, in addition to wood cutting blade products for the pallet manufacturing, pallet recycler and portable saw mill industries in North America.
Metallized Films - The Metallized Films business includes Dunmore Corporation in the U.S. and Dunmore Europe GmbH in Germany (collectively, "Dunmore"), which manufacture and distribute coated, laminated and metallized films for engineered applications in the imaging, aerospace, insulation and solar photo-voltaic markets and also provide products for custom and special applications.
Energy Segment
The Energy segment provides drilling and production services to the oil and gas industry and owns a youth sports business. Below is additional information related to the consolidated businesses within the Energy segment.
Steel Energy - The Energy business provides completion, recompletion and production services to exploration and production companies in the oil and gas business. The services provided include well completion and recompletion, well maintenance and workover, flow testing, down hole pumping, plug and abandonment, well logging and perforating wireline services. The Energy segment primarily provides its services to customers' extraction and production operations in North Dakota and Montana in the Bakken basin, Colorado and Wyoming in the Niobrara basin, Texas in the Permian basin and New Mexico in the San Juan basin. It relies primarily on its local operations to sell and market its services.
Steel Sports - Steel Sports is a social impact company committed to creating a new standard in youth sports and coaching while forging the next generation of leaders. The organization strives to provide a first-class youth sports experience emphasizing positive experiences and instilling the core values of Teamwork, Respect, Integrity and Commitment.
Financial Services Segment
Through our subsidiary WebFinancial Holding Corporation, we own 100% of WebBank, which is an FDIC–insured state chartered industrial bank headquartered in Utah. WebBank is subject to comprehensive regulation, examination and supervision of the FDIC and the State of Utah Department of Financial Institutions ("UDFI"). WebBank is not considered a "bank" for Bank Holding Company Act purposes and, as such, SPLP is not regulated as a bank holding company. WebBank's deposits are insured by the FDIC up to maximum allowed by law. WebBank engages in a full range of banking activities including originating loans, issuing credit cards and taking deposits that are federally insured. WebBank originates and funds consumer and small business loans through lending programs with unaffiliated companies that market and service the programs ("Marketing Partners"), where the Marketing Partners subsequently purchase the loans (or interests in the loans) that are originated by WebBank. WebBank also has private-label financing programs that are branded for a specific retailer, manufacturer, dealer channel, proprietary network and bank card programs. WebBank participates in syndicated commercial and industrial as well as asset based credit facilities and asset based securitizations through relationships with other financial institutions. Through its subsidiary, National Partners PFco, LLC ("National Partners"), WebBank provides commercial premium finance solutions for national insurance brokerages, independent insurance agencies and insureds in key markets throughout the U.S. National Partners was acquired in April 2019.
Corporate and Other
Corporate and Other consists of several consolidated subsidiaries, including Steel Services, as well as equity method and other investments, and cash and cash equivalents. Its income or loss includes certain unallocated general corporate expenses. Steel Services has management services agreements with certain of our consolidated subsidiaries and other related companies. For additional information on these service agreements see Note 20 - "Related Party Transactions" to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Report.
Business Strategy
We are focused on reducing costs, including but not limited to our corporate overhead, and the sale of non-core assets. We expect the savings and proceeds will be used to pay down debt and repurchase our units. We continuously evaluate the retention and disposition of existing operations, as well as investigate possible strategic acquisitions. We continue to focus on simplifying our organizational structure and improving our free cash flow and our returns on invested capital.
We strive to enhance the business operations of our companies through balance sheet improvements, strategic allocation of capital, and operational and growth initiatives. We use a set of tools and processes called the Steel Business System to drive operational and commercial efficiencies across each of our businesses. The Steel Business System utilizes a strategy deployment process to execute strategic initiatives for each of our businesses to improve their performance, including objectives relating to manufacturing improvement, idea generation, product development, and global sourcing of materials and services. Our operational initiatives include creating efficiencies through consolidated purchasing and materials sourcing through shared purchasing programs and reducing costs for, and providing other benefits to, a number of our companies. We are focused on reducing corporate overhead of our companies by centralizing certain administrative and corporate services through Steel Services, which provides management, consulting and advisory services.
Raw Materials
The major commodities and raw materials used by the businesses within the Diversified Industrial segment are as follows:
The Joining Materials business uses precious metals such as silver, gold and palladium to produce certain of its products. These precious metals are generally obtained under a consignment arrangement with a financial institution. In addition to precious metals, the raw materials used in the Joining Materials, Tubing, Building Materials, Electrical Products and Kasco businesses consist principally of stainless, silicon and carbon steel, aluminum, copper, tin, nickel alloys, a variety of high-performance alloys, permanent magnets, electronic and electrical components, chemicals and various plastic compositions. The raw materials used in the operations of the Performance Materials business consist principally of fiberglass, quartz and aramid yarns. The raw materials used in the Metallized Films business consist principally of polyester scrim fabric, PET film, organic solvents, aluminum, resins, pigments and adhesives. Raw materials are generally purchased at open market prices from domestic and foreign suppliers. The Diversified Industrial segment businesses have not experienced any significant problem in obtaining the necessary quantities of raw materials. Prices and availability, particularly of raw materials purchased from foreign suppliers, are affected by world market conditions and government policies. The Company enters into commodity futures and forward contracts to mitigate the impact of price fluctuations on its precious and certain non-precious metal inventories that are not subject to fixed price contracts. The raw materials used by these businesses are generally readily available from more than one source.
The businesses in our Diversified Industrial segment also require significant amounts of electricity, oil and natural gas to operate their facilities, and they are subject to price changes in these commodities. A shortage of electricity, oil or natural gas, or a government allocation of supplies resulting in a general reduction in supplies, could increase costs of production and could cause some curtailment of production.
Intellectual Property
The Company's businesses depend in part on trademarks and patents that they own, or the licenses they hold to use others' brand names, proprietary technology and manufacturing techniques. In addition to trademark and patent protection, these businesses rely on copyrights, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect their intellectual property rights. 
Capital Investments
SPLP believes that in order to be and remain competitive, its businesses must continuously strive to increase revenue, improve productivity and product quality, and control and/or reduce manufacturing costs. Accordingly, SPLP expects to continue to make capital investments that reduce overall manufacturing costs, improve the quality of products produced and services provided and broaden the array of products offered to the industries it serves, as well as replace equipment as necessary to maintain compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. SPLP's capital expenditures for 2022 and 2021 were $47,541 and $52,326, respectively. SPLP anticipates funding its capital expenditures in 2023 from funds generated by operations and borrowed funds. For more information, see Part II, Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources” of this Report.
Employees
As of December 31, 2022, the Company employed approximately 4,100 employees worldwide. Of these employees, 312 were covered by collective bargaining agreements, all in the Diversified Industrial segment. The Energy segment also hires additional full-time and part-time employees during peak seasonal periods.
Human Capital Management 
Human capital management is a key driver of the Company's success. The Company's core values are Teamwork, Respect, Integrity and Commitment. By embracing its core values, the Company strives to create an environment where its employees can all be productive, innovative and true to themselves. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics establishes the baseline requirements of our integrity and compliance program and aims to promote an environment where everyone is treated fairly with dignity and respect.
The following programs are crucial to support and work to improve the Company's workplace environment:
•Steel Grow Program: The Company began the Steel Grow initiative (1) to formalize employee development throughout Steel Partners with the goal of identifying its high performing employees and (2) to recruit, retain and reward the best talent available for the Company, in each case, without discrimination or harassment on the basis of race, color, religion, age, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, national origin, citizenship, disability, marital status, pregnancy (including unlawful discrimination on the basis of a legally protected pregnancy/maternity leave), veteran status, genetic information or any other characteristic protected by law. Management is committed to promoting from within when the opportunity is right for the employee and the Company, and in 2022 we promoted over 400 employees, a 15% increase over 2021. 
•Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Program: The Company continued conducting a comprehensive Diversity, Equity and Inclusion survey in the U.S. for a second year and oversaw a comprehensive global rollout. Guided by our core values, the Company is committed to creating a company where our employees are included and respected, and where we support each other in reaching our full potential individually and as a company. In 2022, the Company launched a Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Council comprised of representatives across all locations. Each operating company's Diversity, Equity and Inclusion team has an executive sponsor, team lead and trainer/communicator. The objective of this council is to support the operating companies as they establish local goals and build an inclusive workplace environment in which employees of all backgrounds and demographic characteristics can work together. 
•Steel Wellness Council: Our Steel Wellness Council, with representatives from all our businesses, focuses on sharing best practices that maximize the overall wellness of employees, empowering them to help create positive change in communities where we work and live. Our initiatives include mental, physical and financial wellbeing along with healthcare education and community support. Community support includes using our coaching system to enhance the education of our employees who coach and lead children in our communities. 
•Steel Environmental Health and Safety Council: The Steel Environmental Health and Safety Council is comprised of the health and safety teams at the Company's affiliate companies and representatives from the legal and human resources departments who are dedicated to the safety of our employees.
Employee Health, Safety and Well-Being
The Company continues to take actions to ensure the health and safety of its employees and their families, customers, suppliers and the greater communities where the Company operates. Many of our office workers continue to telecommute; 
however, where our essential workers continue at our facilities, the Company has established a number of safety protocols, including face coverings, barriers and physical distance requirements, along with enhanced cleaning, temperature checks, work zones and quarantines as situations require. 
Competition
There are many companies, larger and smaller, domestic and foreign, which manufacture products or provide services of the type offered by our businesses. Some of these competitors have financial resources greater than our subsidiaries. Some of these competitors enjoy certain other competitive advantages, including greater name recognition, technical, marketing and other resources, a larger installed base of customers and well-established relationships with current and potential customers.
Competition in the Diversified Industrial segment is based on quality, technology, performance, service, reputation, price, and in some industries, new product introduction.
The Energy business operates in a highly competitive industry that is influenced by price, capacity, reputation and experience. In times of high demand, capacity, reputation and experience are major competitive forces. In times of low demand, service providers will compete on price to attract customers. In addition, the Energy business needs to maintain a safe work environment and a well-trained workforce to remain competitive. Energy services are affected by seasonal factors, such as inclement weather, fewer daylight hours and holidays during the winter months. Heavy snow, ice, wind or rain can make it difficult to operate and to move equipment between work sites, which can reduce its ability to provide services and generate revenues. These seasonal factors affect competitors as well. Because they have conducted business together over several years, the members of our local operations have established strong working relationships with certain of their clients. These strong client relationships provide a better understanding of region-specific issues and enable us to better address customer needs. 
The market for Steel Sports' baseball facility services and soccer camps and leagues is very fragmented, and its competitors are primarily small local or regional operations.
The market for banking and related financial services is highly competitive. WebBank competes with other providers of financial services, including a broad range of banks and other nontraditional lending and banking companies that offer financial services. Some of our competitors are larger and may have more financial resources, while some of our competitors enjoy fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures. The financial services industry has become more competitive as technology advances have lowered barriers to entry, enabling more companies, including nonbank companies, to provide financial services.
Governmental Regulation
As a public company with several subsidiaries based in the United States and abroad, we are subject to many U.S. federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations. These requirements, which differ among jurisdictions, include, but are not limited to, those related to environmental protection and management, labor, employment, worker health and safety, import and export, customs and tariffs, cybersecurity, intellectual property, privacy and protection of user data. In addition, WebBank is subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by the FDIC and legal requirements in connection with the consumer and business lending programs that it originates.
These laws and regulations are constantly evolving and may be interpreted, applied, created or amended in a manner that could harm our businesses. Historically, the cost of compliance with these requirements have not had a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with all such laws and regulations and that we have obtained all material licenses and permits that are required for the operation of our businesses. For more information regarding regulatory risks, see the information in Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors - Risks Related to our Business" and "Risks Related to Taxation," and Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Environmental Liabilities" of this Report.
