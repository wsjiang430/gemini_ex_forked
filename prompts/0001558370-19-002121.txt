 Item 1.  Business
 As used herein, unless the context otherwise requires, ISG, the registrant, is referred to in this Form 10‑K annual report (“Form 10‑K”) as the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our.” Our Company
 ISG (Information Services Group) (Nasdaq: III) is a leading global technology research and advisory firm. A trusted business partner to more than 700 clients, including more than 70 of the top 100 enterprises in the world, ISG is committed to helping corporations, public sector organizations, and service and technology providers achieve operational excellence and faster growth. The firm specializes in digital transformation services, including automation, cloud and data analytics; sourcing advisory; managed governance and risk services; network carrier services; technology strategy and operations design; change management; market intelligence and technology research and analysis. Founded in 2006, and based in Stamford, Conn., ISG employs more than 1,300 digital-ready professionals operating in more than 20 countries—a global team known for its innovative thinking, market influence, deep industry and technology expertise, and world-class research and analytical capabilities based on the industry’s most comprehensive marketplace data. For more information, visit www.isg-one.com.
 Our Company was founded in 2006 with the strategic vision to become a high‑growth, leading provider of information‑based advisory services. We continue to believe that our vision will be realized through the acquisition, integration, and successful operation of market‑leading brands within the data, analytics and advisory industry. Following the initial announcement of the merger of our individual corporate brands into one globally integrated go-to-market business under the ISG brand in January 2012, we continue to add the businesses we acquire into the ISG brand, creating one unified company.  Including our most recent acquisitions, we operate in over 20 countries and employ approximately 1,300 professionals specializing in digital transformation services, including automation, cloud and data analytic, sourcing advisory, managed governance and risk services, network carrier services, technology strategy and operation design, change management, market intelligence and technology research and analysis.
 Our private and public sector clients continue to face significant technological, business and economic challenges that will continue to fuel demand for the professional services we provide. In the private sector, for example, we believe that companies will continue to face significant challenges associated with globalization and technological innovation, including the need to decrease operating costs, increase efficiencies and deal with increasing numbers of emerging and transformational technologies such as cloud computing. Similarly, public sector organizations at the national, regional and local levels increasingly must deal with the complex and converging issues of outdated technology systems, significantly impaired revenue sources and an aging workforce.
 Overall, we believe that the global marketplace dynamics at work in both the private and public sectors support the increased demand of the professional services, analytics and advice ISG can provide. In this dynamic environment, the strength of our client relationships greatly depends on the quality of our advice and insight, the independence of our thought leadership and the effectiveness of our people in assisting our clients to implement strategies that successfully address their most pressing operational challenges.

 Our Services
 ISG specializes in digital transformation services, including automation, cloud and data analytics; sourcing advisory; managed governance and risk services; network carrier services; technology strategy and operations design; change management; market intelligence and technology research and analysis.  ISG supports both private and public sector organizations to transform and optimize their operational environments.  During periods of expansion or contraction, for enterprises large or small, public or private, in the Americas, Europe or Asia Pacific, our services have helped organizations address their most complex operational issues. The functional domain experience of our experts and deep empirical data resources help clients better understand their strategic options. We provide four key lines of service:
 Research.  We utilize our extensive experience and proprietary data assets to provide subscription and custom research services to senior business and IT executives, technology and software vendors and business/IT services providers. Our mission is to help our clients make better business decisions and create new business value through trusted and objective insights into the key market trends and emerging technologies driving real change. Our combined data sources, compiled from over 30 years of servicing global corporations, provide a rich source of benchmark data into the comparative cost and quality of operational alternatives. For enterprise clients, we use these data sources to provide them with in‑depth analysis into the implications of different service strategies, allowing them to compare and contrast and make informed decisions regarding strategic change. For service providers, our views into the buying behaviors, needs and objectives of global corporations examining transformation of their operations provide unique insights that help them tailor and market their offerings to these enterprises. ISG’s research will continue to play a supporting role for digital services with the production of our Index Reports which include coverage of technology providers, SaaS providers, Cloud and automation platforms in addition to the traditional service provider outsourcing industry. 
 Consulting.  We help private and public sector organizations transform and optimize their operational environments with a complete range of consulting services, focusing on information technology, business process transformation, program management services and enterprise resource planning. ISG consulting services include: Business Advisory Services, Data & Analytics, Digital Solutions, Network Advisory Services, Operating Model Design & Implementation, Operations Benchmarking, Organizational Change Management, Performance Management, Qualitative Assessment, Renegotiations, RFX Services, Robotic Process and Cognitive Automation, Software Advisory Services, Strategy, Transition and Transformation. We assist clients with envisioning, designing and implementing change in their operational environments. We evaluate existing practices and operating costs, identifying potential improvement opportunities to enhance service delivery, optimize operations or reduce costs. Solutions are customized by a client situation and may include internal transformation, the adoption of external strategies, or some combination of both. In all cases, we assist with the selection, implementation and ongoing support for these strategic initiatives.

 Managed Services.  Our Managed Services offerings helps clients realize the cost savings and operating eﬃciencies they expect from their sourcing arrangements. We provide operational governance services to our clients to ensure seamless end‑to‑end service. Our systems, tools and controls are designed to consistently govern third-party agreements, and our expertise in service integration and management helps clients achieve operational excellence in multi-supplier environments.  These offerings assist clients with monitoring and managing their supplier relationships, providing them with real‑time accurate market intelligence and insights into all aspects of provider performance and cost, allowing them to focus on the more strategic aspects of supplier management.
 Events. ISG Events offers a range of industry-leading conferences including,  the ISG Sourcing Industry Conference (SIC) series, the premier annual event for service and technology providers in the Americas, EMEA and India; the ISG Executive Provider Summit, a high-value gathering of C-suite provider executives and ISG partners; the ISG Digital Business Summit series, regional events focused on emerging business technologies; the ISG Automation Summit, a conference focused on the latest trends in automation; and the ISG Paragon Awards™, honoring organizations for their contributions to the continuing evolution of sourcing.
 Our Competitive Advantages
 We believe that the following strengths differentiate us from our competition:
 Independence and Objectivity.  We are not a service provider. We are an independent, fact‑based data, analytics and advisory firm with no material conflicting financial or other interests. This enables us to maintain a trusted advisor relationship with our clients through our unbiased focus and ability to align our interests with those of our clients.
 Domain Expertise.  Averaging over 20 years of experience, our strategic consulting teams bring a wealth of industry and domain‑specific knowledge and expertise to address our clients’ most complex transformational needs.
 Strong Brand Recognition.  ISG continues to gain marketplace traction as a leading brand in our industry.  ISG offers an integrated product and service offering for our clients.
 Proprietary Data Assets and Market Intelligence.  We have assembled a comprehensive and unique set of data, analytics and market intelligence built over more than thirty years of data collection and analysis, providing insight into the comparative cost and quality of a variety of operational alternatives.
 Global Reach.  We possess practical experience in global business operations, and we understand the significance of interconnected economies and companies. Our resources in the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific make us a truly global advisory firm able to consistently serve the strategic and implementation needs of our clients.
 We believe that the strengths disclosed above are central to our ability to deal successfully with the challenges that we face.

 Our Strategy
 We intend to use our competitive strengths to develop new services and products, sustain our growth and strengthen our existing market position by pursuing the following strategies:
 Preserve and Expand Our Market Share Positions.  We expect the trend toward globalization and greater operating efficiency and technological innovation to play an increasing role in the growth of demand for our services.  We plan to leverage our combined operating platform to serve the growing number of private and public enterprises utilizing outside advisors when undertaking transformational projects. We are focused on growing our existing client base with broader services.  In addition, we will seek to continue to expand our products and services and the geographic markets we serve opportunistically as global competition spurs demand for cost savings and value creation.
 Strengthen Our Industry Expertise.  We have strengthened our market facing organization to drive increased revenue around seven key areas — (i) Banking and Financial Services; (ii) Insurance; (iii) Manufacturing, Communications and Multimedia; (iv) Energy, Life Sciences and Healthcare;  (v) Technology; (vi) Consumer Industries Group; (vii) Private Equity; and (viii) Public Sector/Government.
 Expand Geographically.  Historically, we generated the majority of our revenues in North America.  Beginning in 2011, we made significant investments in Europe and Asia Pacific to capitalize on emerging demand for advisory, benchmarking and analytical insight in these geographic regions. During 2018, we realized the benefits of our previous investments in Europe, which resulted in double-digit revenue growth.
 Aggressively Expand Our Market Focus.  We are seeking to drive our service portfolio and relationships with clients further into: Digital Advisory Services including Cloud Solutions, Automation, Business Advisory Services, Strategy, Data & Analytics, Transition and Organization & Operations are all areas where we are investing additional focus to drive increased revenues and expanded relationships with clients.
 Further Develop Digital and Cloud Competency.  There is a nexus of distinct, yet complementary, technology trends that are creating a perfect storm of disruption for some companies. Among the most significant technology trends are the speed with which products get to market, large‑scale digitization, the efficiency of the cloud and the immediacy with which new disruptors can become omnipresent. ISG plans to expand resources and intellectual property (“IP”) around digitization and the cloud. Digitization is the ‘softwarization’ of business. Processes that were once executed over analog channels (such as phone and ‘real life’) increasingly happen over software. Also, digitization has elevated the profile of software. Software no longer merely supports business processes, but is central to the enterprise strategy. Our purpose in the digital marketplace is to be the trusted advisor, guiding our clients through the digital transformation toward practical innovation of their business models, leveraging strategic partners, emerging technology and thought leadership. 

Our digital services now span a volume of offerings and have become embedded as part of even our traditional transaction service. Advancements continue to be made to ‘digitize’ further our traditional services.  For example, we have continued the modernization of our traditional sourcing services toward digital through with the launch of ISG FutureSourceTM approach in 2017, which

has brought agility and nimbleness to the process of sourcing, RFP’s and contracting.  We have also expanded the reach of ISG GovernXTM. This proprietary ISG software platform continues to drive broader insights from additional market and performance data, while delivering increased value to our clients.  ISG Governance Services now are deployed using automation, cognitive and other digital technologies to greatly enhance the value and quality of service given to our clients.  Our digital service offerings also include Robotic Process and Cognitive Automation Technology where we help clients navigate the myriad challenges, risks and opportunities from software selection to building their bot workforce to leverage the technology to transform and improve business outcomes.
 Expand Emerging Services.  The focus will be on creating repeatable methods used to drive growth of emerging services including Robotic Process and Cognitive Automation Technology, Engineering Services and Service Providers as a Business.
 1.Robotic Process and Cognitive Automation Technology:  ISG’s capabilities and service offerings include implementation services for Robotic Process and Cognitive Automation Technology.  The Automation market size is expected to grow significantly over the next few years.  Robotic Process Automation (“RPA”) is fundamentally reshaping the world of Information Technology Outsourcing (“ITO”) and Business Process Outsourcing (“BPO”). Increasingly mature RPA solutions are enabling automated 24/7/365 execution of business processes at a fraction of the cost of human equivalents, as well as the potential to dramatically reengineer and improve key business processes. We help customers and service providers navigate the myriad risks and seize the significant transformational opportunities offered by robotics and automation.  Our solutions will work to optimize repetitive processes using ‘bots’ instead of human labor.  RPA services will continue to be marketed by industry (e.g. claims processing for insurance) and by back office functions (e.g. accounting).
 2.Engineering Services:  We will continue to advance our position, bringing together solutions that leverage digital advancements for engineering services. Our digitally focused engineering services of the future will allow our clients to rapidly harness the power of Internet of Things (“IoT”), enabling the digitization of products, platforms and processes.
 3.HR Technology & Delivery Services: Advances in technology are transforming the business of HR. From intuitive and mobile self-service software to predictive analytics and integrated talent management suites, technological solutions are changing the way leaders acquire, develop and engage their employees. New applications, enhanced functionality and competition among software providers make it difficult to stay on top of this ever-evolving space. ISG provides deep subject matter expertise, market data and financial frameworks to help organizations develop and execute HR technology strategies that are right for them.
 4.Providers as a Business (“PaaB”):  Historically, ISG had targeted traditional service providers for these types of services, which included a combination of consulting and research solutions.  These services include market intelligence, client retention programs, pursuit effectiveness, satisfaction benchmarking, go-to-market consulting and health checks.

 Expand “Recurring Revenue Streams.”  These include such annuity-based ISG offerings as Managed Services, Research, Software as a Subscription (RPA licenses), Benchmarking as a Subscription and the multi-year Public Sector contracts. All are characterized by subscriptions (i.e., renewal‑centric as opposed to project centric revenue streams) or multi‑year contracts.  As companies begin to recognize the importance of managing the post‑sourcing‑transaction period, managed services has emerged as a revenue driver for us where our offerings are delivered through multi‑year managed services contracts. We believe that our experience with outsourcing transactions and software implementation initiatives make us uniquely equipped to provide research insights and direct support to help our clients manage their transformational projects or act as a third‑party administrator.  We will continue to pursue opportunities to leverage our experience to make research and managed services an even greater revenue generator for us. The U.S. public sector, particularly state governments, local municipalities, and higher education—presents a significant opportunity to ISG. Systems are typically outdated, maintenance is expensive, and the workforce charged with maintenance is ageing. There is a need to refurbish systems to reduce the cost of operations (particularly because governments’ tax revenues are under pressure). We are well-positioned as a third party, objective advisory group with no affiliation to the software providers.  ISG will continue to invest in the digitization of these services, driving up automation, greater profitability and even more value for our clients. ISG continues to invest in the digitization of these services, leveraging automation and cognitive technologies to deliver greater value to our clients 
 Consider Acquisition and Other Growth Opportunities.  The business services, information and advisory market is highly fragmented.  We believe we are well‑positioned to leverage our leading market positions and strong brand recognition to expand through acquisitions. Acquiring firms with complementary services and products allows us to further develop and broaden our service offerings and domain expertise.  We will consider and may pursue opportunities to enter into joint ventures and to buy or combine with other businesses.
 Retool Our Resource and Delivery Model.  The goal is to evolve our workforce to achieve a more efficient distribution of resources globally and a more flexible staffing model. This will provide ISG’s clients with better value for their money while also improving ISG’s margins.
 Our Proprietary Data Assets and Market Intelligence

This intellectual property underpins the independent nature of our operational assessments, strategy development, deal‑structuring, negotiation and other consulting services we provide to our clients.
 With each engagement we conduct, we enhance both the quantity and quality of the intellectual property we employ on behalf of our clients, thus providing a continuous, evolving and unique source of information, data and analytics.
 This intellectual property is proprietary and we rely on multiple legal and contractual provisions and devices to protect our intellectual property rights.  We recognize the value of our intellectual property and vigorously defend it.  As a result, the Company maintains strict policies and procedures regarding ownership, use and protection with all parties, including our employees.

 Clients
 We operate in over 20 countries and across numerous industries. Our private sector clients operate primarily in the financial services, telecommunications, healthcare and pharmaceuticals, manufacturing, transportation and travel and energy and utilities industries.  Our private sector clients are primarily large businesses ranked in the Forbes Global 2000 companies annually. Our public sector clients are primarily state and local governments (cities and counties) and authorities (airport and transit) in the United States and national and provincial government units in the United Kingdom, Italy and Australia. Competition
 Competition in the sourcing, data, information and advisory market is primarily driven by independence and objectivity, expertise, possession of relevant benchmarking data, breadth of service capabilities, reputation and price. We compete with other sourcing advisors, research firms, strategy consultants and sourcing service providers. A significant number of independent sourcing and advisory firms offer similar services. In our view, however, these firms generally lack the benchmarking data, scale and diversity of expertise that we possess. In addition, most research firms do not possess the data repository of recent, comparable transactions and benchmarking data. Management consultants bring strategic service capabilities to the sourcing and advisory market. However, they generally lack the depth of experience that sourcing, data and advisory firms such as ISG possess. In addition, management consultants do not possess the sourcing and technology implementation expertise nor the benchmarking data capabilities that are critical to implementing and managing successful transformational projects for businesses and governments. Other service providers often lack the depth of experience, competitive benchmarking data and independence critical to playing the role of “trusted advisor” to clients. Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, we employed 1,310 people worldwide.
 Our employee base includes executive management, service leads, partners, directors, advisors, analysts, technical specialists and functional support staff.
 We recruit advisors from service providers and consulting firms with direct operational experience. These advisors leverage extensive practical expertise derived from experiences in corporate leadership, consulting, research, financial analysis, contract negotiations and operational service delivery.
 All employees are required to execute confidentiality, conflict of interest and intellectual property agreements as a condition of employment. There are no collective bargaining agreements covering any of our employees.
 Our voluntary advisor turnover rate has ranged between 8% and 22% over the last three years.
