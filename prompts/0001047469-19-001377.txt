     ITEM 1.    BUSINESS 
        Unless we state otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to "we," "our," "us" or "the Company" refer to Sterling Bancorp, Inc., a Michigan corporation, and its subsidiaries, including Sterling Bank & Trust, F.S.B., which we sometimes refer to as "Sterling Bank," "the Bank" or "our Bank."
         We are a unitary thrift holding company headquartered in Southfield, Michigan with our primary branch operations in San Francisco and Los Angeles, California. Through our wholly owned bank subsidiary, Sterling Bank and Trust, F.S.B., we offer a broad range of loan products to the residential and commercial markets, as well as retail banking services. 
         In November 2017, we consummated a public offering of 15 million shares of our common stock and listed our common stock on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol "SBT." The Company sold 7,692,308 shares of common stock and certain selling shareholders sold 7,307,692 shares of common stock. We received net proceeds of $85.5 million from the offering. 
         We have a large and growing portfolio of adjustable rate residential mortgage loans. In our key residential loan program, we manage residential credit risks through a financial documentation process and programs with low loan to value ratios. Our risk management includes a thorough review of ability to repay, liquidity analysis and face-to-face customer interaction. 
         We also operate substantial and growing commercial and construction lending businesses, utilizing a traditional community banking relationship-focused culture to identify strong borrowers with projects and operations in our branch network areas. We manage credit risks in our commercial and construction business through financial and relationship diligence with our customers and by financing projects within our branch footprint almost exclusively backed by personal guarantees. 
         We believe growth should not come at the expense of asset quality. We have historically been able to focus on long-term returns and remain committed to responsible growth. We also believe our strong sales team, disciplined underwriting and culture of cost management have driven consistent earnings and exemplary net interest margins, efficiency metrics and shareholder returns. 
   Our History 
         Sterling Bank is a federally chartered thrift institution founded in 1984 in Southfield, Michigan by members of the Seligman family. By 2004 we had 10 branches in the Detroit metropolitan area. However, in the early 1990s, our owners and management recognized an opportunity to shift the Bank's focus to a rapidly growing market less dependent, as Detroit was, on a single industry. In 1994, the Bank established its first branch in San Francisco, California. In 2004, we made a strategic decision to sell all but one of our Detroit-area branches and focus nearly exclusively on the California market. In 2004, we divested 10 Michigan branches and by 2006, substantially reduced new lending in Michigan. 
         Between 2004 and 2008, we expanded our San Francisco presence by opening an additional seven branches. Since 2013, we have grown our branch network from 16 branches to our current total of 29 branches, including 20 branches in the San Francisco area, five in greater Los Angeles, two branches in New York City, one branch in the greater Seattle market and our headquarters' branch in Michigan. 
   Lending Activities 
         General.    Our lending strategy is to offer a broad range of loan products to the residential and commercial markets, tailored to our customers' needs. The majority of our loan portfolio consists of residential real estate mortgages, which accounted for 84% of our loan portfolio as of December 31, 
 2

   2018. The balance of our loan portfolio consists of commercial real estate, construction, and commercial and industrial loans, lines of credit. 
  One- to Four-Family Residential Loans.    The origination of mortgage loans to enable borrowers to purchase or refinance existing homes comprises the largest portion of our loan portfolio. We offer fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgage loans with terms of up to 30 years. Among our significant products is our Advantage Loan program, which consists of one, three, five, or seven-year adjustable rate mortgages with a minimum 35% down payment requirement. We offer this product to underserved home buyers who have good credit, but may have limited credit history. Our Advantage Loan program constituted 80% of our residential loan portfolio as of December 31, 2018. Another significant product is our tenant-in-common, or TIC, loan program, which is similar to traditional co-op loans. Our primary market areas of San Francisco and Los Angeles contain a substantial number of two to six-unit residential buildings and a large amount of condominium conversions. Through our TIC program, we lend to owners of individual units within the building based on their relative ownership share. Our TIC loans generally consist of three, five and seven-year adjustable rate mortgages, with an average balance of approximately $0.5 million, and total outstanding loans of $433 million as of December 31, 2018. We also offer conventional conforming fixed-rate loans with terms of either 15, 20, or 30 years for mortgages of less than $0.6 million. The bulk of our conforming mortgage portfolio is held for sale, after which we typically retain servicing rights. In addition, we have a jumbo loan program for residential loans of between $0.6 million and $2.5 million, for which we offer both fixed and adjustable rates, which are generally held for sale. Across our portfolio, our adjustable-rate mortgage loans are based on a 30-year amortization schedule and generally interest rates and payments adjust annually after a one, three, five, or seven-year initial fixed period. Interest rates on our adjustable-rate loans generally are adjusted to a rate typically equal to 350 to 433 basis points above the one-year LIBOR. Across our residential portfolio, our loan-to-value ratio was 62% as of December 31, 2018. 
         We have a loan approval process through which we require not only financial and other information from our borrowers, but our loan officers are required to meet face-to-face with each of our borrowers in our Advantage program and produce a narrative documentation recommending the loan. 
         Our single-family residential real estate portfolio is secured by real estate. Adverse developments affecting real estate values in our market areas could therefore increase the credit risk associated with these loans, impair the value of property pledged as collateral on loans, and affect our ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure without a loss or additional losses. Loans held for sale consist primarily of first trust deed mortgages on single-family residential properties. 
         Commercial Loans.    We offer a variety of commercial loan products, consisting primarily of commercial real estate loans, construction loans, and commercial and industrial loans, lines of credit. The majority of our commercial loans are secured by real estate or other business assets. Our commercial loans are almost exclusively recourse loans, as we endeavor to secure personal guaranties on each loan we underwrite. 
  Commercial Real Estate.    Our commercial real estate portfolio includes single room occupancy hotels, office, industrial, retail, multifamily and mixed-use properties. We focus almost exclusively on projects within or contiguous to our branch footprint, focusing on what we believe to be high quality credits with income-producing properties, strong cash flow characteristics and strong collateral profiles. At December 31, 2018, approximately 88% of the commercial real estate loan portfolio consisted of adjustable rate loans with an average reset of 33 months. Our loan-to-value policy limits are 75% for commercial real estate loans and 80% for multifamily. 
 3

           The total commercial real estate portfolio totaled $251 million and $247 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, of which $3 million and $9 million, respectively, were secured by owner occupied properties. 
         A primary repayment risk for commercial real estate loans is the interruption or discontinuance of operating cash flows from the properties or businesses involved, which may be influenced by economic events, changes in governmental regulations or other events not under the control of the borrower. Additionally, adverse developments affecting commercial real estate values in our market areas could increase the credit risk associated with these loans, impair the value of property pledged as collateral for these loans, and affect our ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure without a loss or additional losses. 
  Construction loans.    Our construction loans are comprised primarily of residential construction, commercial construction and mixed-use development. We focus primarily on renovation projects, as opposed to ground-up developments. We believe that opportunities for construction lending will remain strong, particularly in our San Francisco market, where historic preservation ordinances and other regulations limit the number of ground-up projects. Interest reserves are generally established on real estate construction loans. These loans are typically based on the prime rate of interest and typically have maturities of less than 18 months. Our loan-to-value policy limits are 80% for construction and 65% for land loans. The total construction portfolio totaled $177 million and $192 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 
         The risks inherent in construction lending may affect adversely our results of operations. Such risks include, among other things, the possibility that contractors may fail to complete, or complete on a timely basis, construction of the relevant properties, substantial cost overruns in excess of original estimates and financing, market deterioration during construction, and lack of permanent take-out financing or presold properties. Loans secured by such properties also involve additional risk because they have no operating history. In these loans, loan funds are advanced upon the security of the project under construction (which is of uncertain value prior to completion of construction) and the estimated operating cash flow/sale proceeds to be generated by the completed project. 
  Commercial Lines of Credit and Consumer Loans.    We also offer commercial lines of credit to businesses and individuals for business purposes. We seek to streamline the application process and provide quick decision-making to allow our customers to access credit quickly. These lines of credit are typically secured by real estate, inventory, equipment, accounts receivable and all assets. The total commercial line of credit and consumer loan portfolio totaled $38 million and $41 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 
   Investment Portfolio 
         As of December 31, 2018, the fair value of our investment portfolio totaled $149 million, with an average effective yield of 2.50%. The estimated duration on the fixed income portion of our investment portfolio (fair value of $145 million) is 0.60 years. The primary objectives of the investment portfolio are to provide liquidity, generate economic value, and to be responsive to cash needs and assist in managing interest rate risk. The majority of our investment portfolio, or 96%, consists of U.S. treasuries, with 4% in collateralized mortgage and debt obligations or equity securities. We regularly evaluate the composition of our investment portfolio as the interest rate yield curve changes and may sell investment securities from time to time to adjust our exposure to interest rates or to provide liquidity to meet loan demand. 
         Our investment policy is reviewed at least annually by our board of directors. Overall investment goals are established by our board, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and members of our Asset and Liability Committee ("ALCO"). Our board of directors has delegated the responsibility of monitoring our investment activities to our management ALCO. Day-to-day activities pertaining to 
 4

   the securities portfolio are conducted under the supervision of the Bank's Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer. We actively monitor our investments on an ongoing basis to identify any material changes in the securities. We also review our securities for potential other-than-temporary impairment at least quarterly. 
   Deposits 
         The quality of our deposit franchise and access to stable funding are key components of our business. We offer traditional depository products, including checking, savings, money market, IRAs and certificates of deposits, to individuals and businesses through our branch network throughout our market areas. Deposits at the Bank are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") up to statutory limits. We offer customers traditional retail deposit products through our branch network and the ability to access their accounts through online and mobile banking platforms. We seek to grow our deposits through cross-selling to our loan customers, use of competitive rates, a focused marketing campaign, and multi-product clubs in which we offer varying benefits depending on the overall relationship with the customer. Our bankers are incentivized to acquire and maintain quality, core deposits as we depend on deposits to fund the majority of our loans. We believe that our long-standing and high quality relationships with our depositors who provide us with long-term funding are due to the convenience, rates and dedicated service we offer. We leverage our branch locations and deep network of customer relationships in our market areas to provide low-cost funding sources for our lending business. 
 Distribution Channels 
         The primary markets in which we operate are San Francisco and greater Los Angeles, and our 25 branch network in these areas is our core distribution channel. In addition, we have opened two branches in New York City and one branch in the greater Seattle market. We strive to take advantage of our core footprint, new markets and deep-rooted relationships to target local customers with a diversified product offering. 
         Our expansive local branch network enables us to gather deposits, promote the Sterling brand and customer loyalty, originate loans and other products and maintain relationships with our customers through regular community involvement. Our branch network is fundamental to our ability to achieve successful customer outreach in line with our culture, which promotes high-touch engagement with our customers and proactive solutions. 
   Risk Management 
         We believe that effective risk management is of primary importance to our organization. Risk management refers generally to the activities by which we identify, measure, monitor, evaluate and manage the risks we face in the course of our banking activities. These include liquidity, interest rate, credit, operational, cyber/technological, legal, compliance, regulatory, strategic, financial and reputational risk exposures. Our board of directors and management team have created a risk-conscious culture that is focused on quality growth, which includes infrastructure capable of addressing the evolving risks we face, as well as the changing regulatory and compliance landscape. Our risk management approach employs comprehensive policies and processes to establish robust governance and emphasizes personal ownership and accountability for risk with our employees. We believe a disciplined and conservative underwriting approach has been the key to our strong asset quality. 
         Our management of interest rate risk is overseen by our board of directors ALCO, and implemented by our management ALCO based on a risk management infrastructure approved by our board of directors that outlines reporting and measurement requirements. In particular, this 
 5

   infrastructure sets limits, calculated quarterly, for various interest rate-related metrics, our economic value of equity and net interest income simulations involving parallel shifts in interest rate curves. Steepening and flattening yield curves and various prepayment and deposit duration assumptions are prepared at least annually. Our interest rate management policies also require periodic review and documentation of all key assumptions used, such as identifying appropriate interest rate scenarios, setting loan prepayment rates and deposit durations based on historical analysis. 
   Competition 
         The financial services industry is highly competitive as we compete for loans, deposits and customer relationships in our market. Competition involves efforts to retain current clients, make new loans and obtain new deposits, increase the scope and sophistication of services offered and offer competitive interest rates paid on deposits and charged on loans. Within our branch footprint, we primarily face competition from national, regional and other local financial institutions that have established branch networks throughout the San Francisco and Los Angeles areas as well as our new markets, giving them visible retail presence to customers. 
         In mortgage banking, we face competition from a wide range of national financial institutions, regional and local community banks, as well as credit unions and national mortgage underwriters. In commercial banking, we face competition to underwrite loans to sound, stable businesses and real estate projects at competitive price levels that make sense for our business and risk profile. Our major commercial bank competitors include larger national, regional and local financial institutions that may have the ability to make loans on larger projects than we can or provide a larger mix of product offerings. We also compete with smaller local financial institutions that may have aggressive pricing and unique terms on various types of loans and, increasingly, financial technology platforms that offer their products exclusively through web-based portals. 
         In retail banking, we primarily compete with national and local banks that have visible retail presence and personnel in our market areas. The primary factors driving competition in consumer banking are customer service, interest rates, fees charged, branch location and hours of operation and the range of products offered. We compete for deposits by advertising, offering competitive interest rates and seeking to provide a higher level of personal service. We also face competition from non-traditional alternatives to banks such as credit unions, internet based banks, money centers, money market mutual funds and cash management accounts. 
         We believe our ability to provide a flexible, sophisticated product offering and an efficient process to our customers allows us to stay competitive in the financial services environment. Our local presence and hands-on approach enables us to provide a high level of service that our customers value. 
   Other Subsidiaries 
         Quantum Capital Management.    In April 2017 the Bank acquired Quantum, an investment management platform that historically focused on hedged equity and mid-cap, small-cap and micro-cap portfolio strategies. As of December 31, 2018, Quantum had $194 million in assets held under management, which have declined since acquisition date due to slight customer attrition. 
  Sterling Wealth Management.    Sterling Wealth Management, a subsidiary of the Bank, provides wealth management services to our customers. We have a customer service representative program through which we intend to establish a traditional fee-based, wealth management platform that will deliver a revenue stream for the Bank while providing clients with an enhanced level of investment advisory services.

     Information Technology Systems 
         We devote significant resources to maintain stable, reliable, efficient and scalable information technology systems. We utilize our own single, highly integrated core processing system that improves cost efficiency and protects us against escalating rates and termination fees from third party providers and positions us to be in control of new product development and time to market. We work with our third-party vendors to monitor and maximize the efficiency of our use of their applications. We use integrated systems to originate and process loans and deposit accounts, which reduces processing time, improves customer experience and reduces costs. 
         We have an Information Security Officer who reports to the General Counsel, whom we charge with the review and implementation of strategies, policies, managed services, technology, and any other resource that could aid in the effort against cybercrime. Our Information Systems Department proactively identifies and monitors systems to analyze risk to the organization and implement mitigating controls where appropriate. Formal business continuity and disaster recovery exercises are conducted annually. Additionally, we involve independent firms to perform an audit and internal and external penetration tests on our information systems on at least an annual basis. 
   SUPERVISION AND REGULATION 
   General 
         As a federal savings bank, Sterling Bank is subject to primary examination and regulation by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ("OCC") and, as an insured depository institution, the FDIC. The federal system of regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which Sterling Bank may engage and is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the FDIC's Deposit Insurance Fund rather than our shareholders. Sterling Bank also is a member of, and owns stock in, the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis, which is one of the 11 regional banks in the Federal Home Loan Bank System. 
         As a unitary thrift holding company, Sterling Bancorp is required to comply with the rules and regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System ("FRB"). It is required to file certain reports with the FRB and is subject to examination by and the enforcement authority of the FRB. Sterling Bancorp is also subject to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission under the federal securities laws. 
         Under this system of regulation, the regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory, enforcement, rulemaking and examination activities and policies, including rules or policies that: establish minimum capital levels; restrict the timing and amount of dividend payments; govern the classification of assets; determine the adequacy of loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes; and establish the timing and amounts of assessments and fees. Moreover, as part of their examination authority, the banking regulators assign numerical ratings to banks and savings institutions relating to capital, asset quality, management, liquidity, earnings and other factors. These ratings are inherently subjective and the receipt of a less than satisfactory rating in one or more categories may result in enforcement action by the banking regulators against a financial institution. A less than satisfactory rating may also prevent a financial institution, such as Sterling Bank or Sterling Bancorp, from obtaining necessary regulatory approvals to access the capital markets, pay dividends, acquire other financial institutions or establish new branches. 
         In addition, we must comply with significant anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism laws and regulations, Community Reinvestment Act laws and regulations, and fair lending laws and regulations. Government agencies have the authority to impose monetary penalties and other sanctions on institutions that fail to comply with these laws and regulations, which could significantly affect our 
 7

   business activities, including our ability to expand our branch network or acquire other financial institutions. 
         Any change in applicable laws or regulations, whether by the OCC, the FDIC, the FRB or Congress, could have a material adverse impact on the operations and financial performance of Sterling Bancorp and Sterling Bank. 
         Set forth below is a brief description of material regulatory requirements that are or will be applicable to Sterling Bank and Sterling Bancorp. The description is limited to certain material aspects of the statutes and regulations addressed, and is not intended to be a complete description of such statutes and regulations and their effects on Sterling Bank and Sterling Bancorp. 
   The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act of 2018 
         On May 24, 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act of 2018 (the "EGRRCPA") was enacted, which repeals or modifies certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and eases regulations on all but the largest banks. The EGRRCPA's highlights include, among other things: (i) creating a new category of "qualified mortgages" presumed to satisfy ability-to-repay requirements for loans that meet certain criteria and are held in portfolio by banks with less than $10 billion in assets from the ability-to-repay requirements for certain qualified residential mortgage loans held in portfolio; (ii) not require appraisals for certain transactions valued at less than $400,000 in rural areas; (iii) exempt banks that originate fewer than 500 open-end and 500 closed-end mortgages from the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act's expanded data disclosures; (iv) clarify that, subject to various conditions, reciprocal deposits of another depository institution obtained using a deposit broker through a deposit placement network for purposes of obtaining maximum deposit insurance would not be considered brokered deposits subject to the FDIC's brokered-deposit regulations; and (v) simplify capital calculations by requiring regulators to establish for institutions under $10 billion in assets a community bank leverage ratio (tangible equity to average consolidated assets) at a percentage not less than 8% and not greater than 10% that such institutions may elect to replace the general applicable risk-based capital requirements for determining well-capitalized status. 
 Federal Banking Regulation 
         Business Activities.    A federal savings bank derives its lending and investment powers from the Home Owners' Loan Act, as amended, and applicable federal regulations. Under these laws and regulations, Sterling Bank may invest in mortgage loans secured by residential and commercial real estate, commercial business and consumer loans, certain types of debt securities and certain other assets, subject to applicable limits. Sterling Bank may also establish subsidiaries that may engage in certain activities not otherwise permissible for Sterling Bank, including wealth and investment management. 
         Capital Requirements.    Until the community bank leverage ratio is implemented, or if Sterling Bancorp and Sterling Bank elect not to opt in, Federal regulations will continue to require Sterling Bancorp and Sterling Bank to meet several minimum capital standards. In the case of Sterling Bank, minimum capital standards include a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 6.0%, a total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 8.0%, and a 4.0% Tier 1 capital to adjusted average total assets leverage ratio. These capital requirements were effective January 1, 2015 and are the result of a final rule implementing recommendations of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act. 
         In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, all assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets (e.g., recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests) are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations based 
 8

   on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk. Common equity Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common shareholders' equity and retained earnings. Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common equity Tier 1 and additional Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus, meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt. Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for loan losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets and, for institutions that have exercised an opt-out election regarding the treatment of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), up to 45% of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values. Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations. In assessing an institution's capital adequacy, the OCC takes into consideration not only these numeric factors, but qualitative factors as well, and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual institutions where deemed necessary. 
         In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a "capital conservation buffer" consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The capital conservation buffer requirement was phased in, a process which began January 1, 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increasing each year until the buffer was implemented at 2.5% of risk-weighted assets on January 1, 2019. During 2018, the capital conversation buffer was 1.875% of risk-weighted assets. 
         Notwithstanding the foregoing, the EGRRCPA is expected to simplify capital calculations by requiring regulators to establish for institutions under $10 billion in assets a community bank leverage ratio (tangible equity to average consolidated assets) at a percentage not less than 8% and not greater than 10% that such institutions may elect to replace the general applicable risk-based capital requirements under the Basel III capital rules. Such institutions that meet the community bank leverage ratio will automatically be deemed to be well-capitalized, although the regulators retain the flexibility to determine that the institution may not qualify for the community bank leverage ratio test based on the institution's risk profile. Until the community bank leverage ratio is established by the regulators in accordance with EGRRCPA, the Basel III risk-based and leverage ratios remain in effect. The effective date and the specific community bank leverage ratio is currently unknown. 
         At December 31, 2018, the Company and the Bank met all regulatory capital requirements to which they are subject. 
  Loans-to-One Borrower.    Generally, a federal savings bank may not make a loan or extend credit to a single or related group of borrowers in excess of 15% of unimpaired capital and surplus. An additional amount may be loaned, equal to 10% of unimpaired capital and surplus, if the loan is secured by readily marketable collateral, which generally does not include real estate. As of December 31, 2018, Sterling Bank was in compliance with the loans-to-one borrower limitations. 
  Qualified Thrift Lender Test.    As a federal savings bank, Sterling Bank must satisfy the qualified thrift lender, or "QTL," test. Under the QTL test, Sterling Bank must maintain at least 65% of its "portfolio assets" in "qualified thrift investments" (primarily residential mortgages and related investments, including mortgage-backed securities) in at least nine months of the most recent 12-month period. "Portfolio assets" generally means total assets of a savings bank, less the sum of specified liquid 
 9

   assets up to 20% of total assets, goodwill and other intangible assets, and the value of property used in the conduct of the savings bank's business. 
         Sterling Bank also may satisfy the QTL test by qualifying as a "domestic building and loan association" as defined in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. This test generally requires a savings bank to have at least 75% of its deposits held by the public and earn at least 25% of its income from loans and U.S. government obligations. Alternatively, a savings bank can satisfy this test by maintaining at least 60% of its assets in cash, real estate loans and U.S. Government or state obligations. 
         A savings bank that fails the qualified thrift lender test must operate under specified restrictions set forth in the Home Owners' Loan Act. The Dodd-Frank Act made noncompliance with the QTL test subject to agency enforcement action for a violation of law. At December 31, 2018, Sterling Bank satisfied the QTL test. 
         Capital Distributions.    Federal regulations govern capital distributions by a federal savings bank, which include cash dividends, stock repurchases and other transactions charged to the savings bank's capital account. A federal savings bank must file an application with the OCC for approval of a capital distribution if:
 

 the total capital distributions for the applicable calendar year exceed the sum of the savings bank's net income for that year to date plus the
savings bank's retained net income for the preceding two years; 
 the savings bank would not be at least adequately capitalized following the distribution; 
 the distribution would violate any applicable statute, regulation, agreement or regulatory condition; or 
 the savings bank is not eligible for expedited treatment of its filings, generally due to an unsatisfactory CAMELS rating or being subject to a
cease and desist order or formal written agreement that requires action to improve the institution's financial condition. 

         Even if an application is not otherwise required, every savings bank that is a subsidiary of a unitary thrift holding company, such as Sterling Bank, must still file a notice with the FRB at least 30 days before the board of directors declares a dividend or approves a capital distribution. FRB approval is also required for any repurchase of capital stock by a financial institution, such as Sterling Bancorp, with over $3 billion in assets. 
         A notice or application related to a capital distribution or share repurchase may be disapproved if:
 

 the federal savings bank would be undercapitalized following the distribution; 
 the proposed capital distribution raises safety and soundness concerns; or 
 the capital distribution would violate a prohibition contained in any statute, regulation or agreement. 

         In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act provides that an insured depository institution may not make any capital distribution if, after making such distribution, the institution would fail to meet any applicable regulatory capital requirement. 
  Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Laws.    Under the Community Reinvestment Act, or "CRA," as implemented by federal regulations, all federal savings banks have a continuing and affirmative obligation, consistent with its safe and sound operation, to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low- and moderate-income borrowers. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution's discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community, consistent with the CRA. 
 10

          
        In connection with its examination of a federal savings bank, the OCC is required to assess the federal savings bank's record of compliance with the CRA. A savings bank's failure to comply with the provisions of the CRA could, at a minimum, result in denial of certain corporate applications such as branch expansion or mergers, or in restrictions on its activities. The CRA requires the FDIC, in connection with its examination of a state savings bank, to assess the institution's record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by such institution, including applications to acquire branches and other financial institutions. The CRA requires a written evaluation of an institution's CRA performance utilizing a four-tiered descriptive rating system. All institutions insured by the FDIC must publicly disclose their rating. Sterling Bank received a "satisfactory" CRA rating in its most recent federal examination. 
         In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act prohibit lenders from discriminating in their lending practices on the basis of characteristics specified in those statutes. The failure to comply with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act could result in enforcement actions by the OCC, as well as other federal regulatory agencies and the Department of Justice. 
  Transactions with Related Parties.    A federal savings bank's authority to engage in transactions with its affiliates is limited by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and federal regulation. An affiliate is generally a company that controls, or is under common control with, an insured depository institution such as Sterling Bank. Sterling Bancorp is an affiliate of Sterling Bank because of its control of Sterling Bank. A subsidiary of a bank that is not also a depository institution or a "financial subsidiary" under federal law is not treated as an affiliate of the bank for the purposes of Sections 23A and 23B; however, the OCC has the discretion to treat subsidiaries of a bank as affiliates on a case-by-case basis. Section 23A limits the extent to which a bank or its subsidiaries may engage in "covered transactions" with any one affiliate to 10% of the bank's capital stock and surplus. There is an aggregate limit of 20% of the bank's capital stock and surplus for such transactions with all affiliates. The term "covered transaction" includes, among other things, the making of a loan to an affiliate, a purchase of assets from an affiliate, the issuance of a guarantee on behalf of an affiliate and the acceptance of securities of an affiliate as collateral for a loan. All such transactions are required to be on terms and conditions that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices and no transaction may involve the acquisition of any "low quality asset" from an affiliate. Certain covered transactions, such as loans to or guarantees on behalf of an affiliate, must be secured by collateral in amounts ranging from 100 to 130 percent of the loan amount, depending upon the type of collateral. In addition, Section 23B requires that any covered transaction (and specified other transactions) between a bank and an affiliate must be on terms and conditions that are substantially the same, or at least as favorable, to the bank, as those that would be provided to a non-affiliate. 
         A bank's loans to its executive officers, directors, any owner of more than 10% of its stock (each, an "insider") and certain entities affiliated with any such person (an insider's "related interest") are subject to the conditions and limitations imposed by Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and the FRB's Regulation O. The aggregate amount of a bank's loans to any insider and the insider's related interests may not exceed the loans-to-one-borrower limit applicable to national banks. Aggregate loans by a bank to its insiders and insiders' related interests may not exceed the bank's unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus. With certain exceptions, such as education loans and certain residential mortgages, a bank's loans to its executive officers, may not exceed the greater of $25,000 or 2.5% of the bank's unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus, but in no event more than $100,000. Regulation O also requires that any loan to an insider or a related interest of an insider be approved in advance by a majority of the board of directors of the bank, with any interested director not participating in the voting, if the loan, when aggregated with any existing loans to that insider or the insider's related interests, would exceed the lesser or $500,000 or 5% of the bank's unimpaired capital and surplus. Generally, such loans must be made on substantially the same terms and follow credit 
 11

   underwriting procedures that are no less stringent than, those that are prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons and must not present more than a normal risk of collectability. An exception is made for extensions of credit made pursuant to a benefit or compensation plan of a bank that is widely available to employees of the bank and that does not give any preference to insiders of the bank over other employees of the bank. As of December 31, 2018, none of our insiders had any outstanding loans with the Bank. 
  Enforcement.    The OCC has primary enforcement responsibility over federal savings banks and has authority to bring enforcement action against all "institution-affiliated parties," including directors, officers, shareholders, attorneys, appraisers and accountants who knowingly or recklessly participate in wrongful action likely to have an adverse effect on a federal savings bank. Formal enforcement action by the OCC may range from the issuance of a capital directive, formal agreement or cease and desist order to removal of officers and/or directors of the institution and the appointment of a receiver or conservator. Civil penalties cover a wide range of violations and actions, and range up to $25,000 per day, unless a finding of reckless disregard is made, in which case penalties may be as high as $1 million per day. The FDIC also has the authority to terminate deposit insurance or recommend to the OCC that enforcement action be taken with respect to a particular savings bank. If such action is not taken, the FDIC has authority to take the action under specified circumstances. 
         Standards for Safety and Soundness.    Federal law requires each federal banking agency to prescribe certain standards for all insured depository institutions. These standards relate to, among other things, internal controls, information systems and audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, compensation and other operational and managerial standards as the agency deems appropriate. Interagency guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. If the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, the agency may require the institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard. If an institution fails to meet these standards, the appropriate federal banking agency may require the institution to implement an acceptable compliance plan. Failure to implement such a plan can result in further enforcement action, including the issuance of a cease and desist order or the imposition of civil money penalties. 
  Interstate Banking and Branching.    Federal law permits well capitalized and well managed holding companies to acquire banks in any state, subject to FRB approval, certain concentration limits and other specified conditions. Interstate mergers of banks are also authorized, subject to regulatory approval and other specified conditions. In addition, among other things, certain amendments made by the Dodd-Frank Act permit banks to establish de novo branches on an interstate basis provided that branching is authorized by the law of the host state for the banks chartered by that state. 
  Prompt Corrective Action.    Federal law requires, among other things, that federal bank regulators take "prompt corrective action" with respect to institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. For this purpose, the law establishes five capital categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. An institution is deemed to be "well capitalized" if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 6.5% or greater. An institution is "adequately capitalized" if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of 4.0% or greater and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 4.5% or greater. An institution is "undercapitalized" if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a leverage ratio of less than 4.0% or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 4.5%. An institution is deemed to be "significantly undercapitalized" if it has a total risk-based capital 
 12

   ratio of less than 6.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0%, a leverage ratio of less than 3.0% or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 3.0%. An institution is considered to be "critically undercapitalized" if it has a ratio of tangible equity (as defined in the regulations) to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0%. 
         At each successive lower capital category, an insured depository institution is subject to more restrictions and prohibitions, including restrictions on growth, restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, restrictions or prohibitions on payment of dividends, and restrictions on the acceptance of brokered deposits. Furthermore, if an insured depository institution is classified in one of the undercapitalized categories, it is required to submit a capital restoration plan to the appropriate federal banking agency, and the holding company must guarantee the performance of that plan. Based upon its capital levels, a bank that is classified as well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, or undercapitalized may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency, after notice and opportunity for hearing, determines that an unsafe or unsound condition, or an unsafe or unsound practice, warrants such treatment. An undercapitalized bank's compliance with a capital restoration plan is required to be guaranteed by any company that controls the undercapitalized institution in an amount equal to the lesser of 5.0% of the institution's total assets when deemed undercapitalized or the amount necessary to achieve the status of adequately capitalized. If an "undercapitalized" bank fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is "significantly undercapitalized." "Significantly undercapitalized" banks must comply with one or more of a number of additional restrictions, including but not limited to an order by the applicable regulatory authority to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized, requirements to reduce total assets, cease receipt of deposits from correspondent banks or dismiss directors or officers, and restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, compensation of executive officers and capital distributions by the parent holding company. "Critically undercapitalized" institutions are subject to additional measures including, subject to a narrow exception, the appointment of a receiver or conservator within 270 days after it obtains such status. 
         At December 31, 2018, Sterling Bank was considered "well capitalized." 
  Federal Insurance of Deposit Accounts.    The Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC insures deposits at FDIC-insured financial institutions such as Sterling Bank. Deposit accounts in Sterling Bank are insured by the FDIC generally up to a maximum of $250,000 per separately insured depositor. The FDIC charges insured depository institutions premiums to maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund. 
         Under the FDIC's risk-based assessment system, insured institutions are assigned to one of four risk categories based on supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels and certain other risk factors. Rates are based on each institution's risk category and certain specified risk adjustments. Institutions deemed to be less risky pay lower rates while institutions deemed riskier pay higher rates. Assessment rates (inclusive of possible adjustments) currently range from 21/2 to 45 basis points of each institution's total assets less tangible capital. The FDIC may increase or decrease the scale uniformly, except that no adjustment can deviate more than two basis points from the base scale without notice and comment rulemaking. The FDIC's current system represents a change, required by the Dodd-Frank Act, from its prior practice of basing the assessment on an institution's deposits. 
         The Dodd-Frank Act increased the minimum target Deposit Insurance Fund ratio from 1.15% of estimated insured deposits to 1.35% of estimated insured deposits. The FDIC must seek to achieve the 1.35% ratio by September 30, 2020. Insured institutions with assets of $10 billion or more are supposed to fund the increase. The Dodd-Frank Act eliminated the 1.5% maximum fund ratio, instead leaving it to the discretion of the FDIC, which has exercised that discretion by establishing a long range fund ratio of 2%. 
 13

           The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments. Any significant increases would have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of Sterling Bank. We cannot predict what assessment rates will be in the future. 
         Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or regulatory condition imposed by the FDIC. We do not know of any practice, condition or violation that might lead to termination of our deposit insurance. 
         In addition to the FDIC assessments, the Financing Corporation ("FICO") is authorized to impose and collect, with the approval of the FDIC, assessments for anticipated payments, issuance costs and custodial fees on bonds issued by the FICO in the 1980s to recapitalize the former Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. The bonds issued by the FICO are due to mature by 2019. For the expense paid in the year ended December 31, 2018, the total FDIC assessment was equal to 5.59 basis points of total assets less tangible capital, and the annualized FICO assessment was equal to 0.31 basis points of total assets less total tangible capital. The Federal Housing Finance Agency ("FHFA") projects that the last FICO assessment will be collected in March 2019. There is a possibility that FICO may need to conduct another assessment in June 2019, which would occur only if the March collection did not yield sufficient monies to make the remaining interest payment on the FICO bonds. 
         Supervisory Assessments.    OCC-chartered banks are required to pay supervisory assessments to the OCC to fund its operations. The amount of the assessment paid by a federally-chartered bank to the OCC is calculated on the basis of the institution's total assets, including consolidated subsidiaries, as reported to the OCC. During the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Bank paid supervisory assessments to the OCC totaling $586,000 and $470,000, respectively. 
  Privacy Regulations.    Federal regulations generally require that Sterling Bank disclose its privacy policy, including identifying with whom it shares a customer's "non-public personal information," to customers at the time of establishing the customer relationship and annually thereafter. In addition, Sterling Bank is required to provide its customers with the ability to "opt-out" of having their personal information shared with unaffiliated third parties and not to disclose account numbers or access codes to non-affiliated third parties for marketing purposes. Sterling Bank currently has a privacy protection policy in place and believes that such policy is in compliance with the regulations. 
  USA Patriot Act.    Sterling Bank is subject to the USA PATRIOT Act, which gives federal agencies additional powers to address terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures, expanded surveillance powers, increased information sharing, and broadened anti-money laundering requirements. The USA PATRIOT Act contains provisions intended to encourage information sharing among bank regulatory agencies and law enforcement bodies and imposes affirmative obligations on financial institutions, such as enhanced recordkeeping and customer identification requirements. 
  Prohibitions Against Tying Arrangements.    Federal savings banks are prohibited, subject to some exceptions, from extending credit to or offering any other service, or fixing or varying the consideration for such extension of credit or service, on the condition that the customer obtain some additional service from the institution or its affiliates or not obtain services of a competitor of the institution. 
   Other Regulations 
         Interest and other charges collected or contracted for by Sterling Bank are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates. Loan operations are also subject to state and federal laws applicable to credit transactions, such as the:


 Truth-In-Lending Act, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers; 

 14

   

 Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to
determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves; 
 Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors in extending credit; 
 Fair Debt Collection Act, governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies; 
 Truth in Savings Act; governing disclosure of information about deposit accounts to customers; 
 Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1978, governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies; and 
 Rules and regulations of the various federal and state agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing such federal and state laws. 

         The deposit operations of Sterling Bank also are subject to, among others, the:
 

 Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for
complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records; 
 Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act (also known as "Check 21"), which gives "substitute checks," such as digital check images and
copies made from that image, the same legal standing as the original paper check; and 
 Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E promulgated thereunder, which govern automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit
accounts and customers' rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services. 

 Federal Reserve System 
         Under FRB regulations, Sterling Bank is required to maintain reserves at the Federal Reserve Bank against its transaction accounts, including checking and NOW accounts. The FRB regulations generally require that reserves be maintained against aggregate transaction accounts as follows: Transaction accounts aggregating $124.2 million or less (which may be adjusted by the FRB) the reserve requirement is 3.0% and the amounts greater than $124.2 million require a 10.0% reserve (which may be adjusted annually by the FRB between 8.0% and 14.0%). The first $16.3 million of otherwise reservable balances (which may be adjusted by the FRB) are exempted from the reserve requirements. The Bank is in compliance with these requirements. The requirements are adjusted annually by the FRB. The FRB began paying interest on reserves in 2008, currently 2.40%. 
 Federal Home Loan Bank System 
         Sterling Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, which consists of 11 regional Federal Home Loan Banks. The Federal Home Loan Bank provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions. Members of the Federal Home Loan Bank are required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank. Sterling Bank was in compliance with this requirement at December 31, 2018. Based on redemption provisions of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis, the stock has no quoted market value and is carried at cost. Sterling Bank reviews for impairment, based on the ultimate recoverability, the cost basis of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis stock. As of December 31, 2018, no impairment has been recognized.

     Holding Company Regulation 
         Sterling Bancorp is a unitary thrift holding company subject to regulation and supervision by the FRB. The FRB has enforcement authority over Sterling Bancorp and its non-savings institution subsidiaries. Among other things, this authority permits the FRB to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a risk to Sterling Bancorp. 
         As a unitary thrift holding company, Sterling Bancorp's activities are limited to those activities permissible by law for financial holding companies. A financial holding company may engage in activities that are financial in nature, incidental to financial activities or complementary to a financial activity. Such activities include lending and other activities permitted for bank holding companies under Section 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act, insurance and underwriting equity securities. 
         Federal law prohibits a unitary thrift holding company, directly or indirectly, or through one or more subsidiaries, from acquiring more than 5% of another savings institution or unitary thrift holding company without prior written approval of the FRB, and from acquiring or retaining control of any depository institution. In evaluating applications by holding companies to acquire savings institutions, the FRB must consider such things as the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the company and institution involved, the effect of the acquisition on and the risk to the federal deposit insurance fund, the convenience and needs of the community and competitive factors. A unitary thrift holding company may not acquire a savings institution in another state and hold the target institution as a separate subsidiary unless it is a supervisory acquisition under Section 13(k) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act or the law of the state in which the target is located authorizes such acquisitions by out-of-state companies. 
  Capital Requirements.    As a unitary thrift holding company, Sterling Bancorp is subject to consolidated regulatory capital requirements that are similar to those that apply to Sterling Bank. See "Supervision and RegulationFederal Banking RegulationCapital Requirements." 
         The Dodd-Frank Act extended the "source of strength" doctrine to unitary thrift holding companies. The FRB has promulgated regulations implementing the "source of strength" policy that require holding companies to act as a source of strength to their subsidiary depository institutions by providing capital, liquidity and other support in times of financial stress. 
         The FRB has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends and the repurchase of shares of common stock by bank holding companies and unitary thrift holding companies. In general, the policy provides that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the holding company appears consistent with the organization's capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Regulatory guidance provides for prior regulatory consultation with respect to capital distributions in certain circumstances such as where the company's net income for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid over that period, is insufficient to fully fund the dividend or the company's overall rate of earnings retention is inconsistent with the company's capital needs and overall financial condition. The ability of a holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized. The policy statement also states that a holding company should inform the Federal Reserve Board supervisory staff prior to redeeming or repurchasing common stock or perpetual preferred stock if the holding company is experiencing financial weaknesses or if the repurchase or redemption would result in a net reduction, as of the end of a quarter, in the amount of such equity instruments outstanding compared with the beginning of the quarter in which the redemption or repurchase occurred. These regulatory policies may affect the ability of Sterling Bancorp to pay dividends, repurchase shares of common stock or otherwise engage in capital distributions. 
         In order for Sterling Bancorp to be regulated as a unitary thrift holding company by the Federal Reserve Board, rather than as a bank holding company, Sterling Bank must qualify as a "qualified 
 16

   thrift lender" under federal regulations or satisfy the "domestic building and loan association" test under the Internal Revenue Code. Under the qualified thrift lender test, a savings institution is required to maintain at least 65% of its "portfolio assets" (total assets less: (i) specified liquid assets up to 20% of total assets; (ii) intangible assets, including goodwill; and (iii) the value of property used to conduct business) in certain "qualified thrift investments" (primarily residential mortgages and related investments, including certain mortgage-backed and related securities) in at least nine out of each 12 month period. At December 31, 2018, Sterling Bank maintained 90% of its portfolio assets in qualified thrift investments and was in compliance with the qualified thrift lender requirement. 
   Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 
         The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 is intended to improve corporate responsibility, to provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies and to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures pursuant to the securities laws. We have policies, procedures and systems designed to comply with these regulations, and we review and document such policies, procedures and systems to ensure continued compliance with these regulations. 
   Change in Control Regulations 
         Under the Change in Bank Control Act, no person may acquire control of a unitary thrift holding company such as Sterling Bancorp unless the Federal Reserve Board has been given 60 days prior written notice and has not issued a notice disapproving the proposed acquisition, taking into consideration certain factors, including the financial and managerial resources of the acquirer and the competitive effects of the acquisition. Control, as defined under federal law, means ownership, control of or holding irrevocable proxies representing more than 25% of any class of voting stock, control in any manner of the election of a majority of the institution's directors, or a determination by the regulator that the acquiror has the power, directly or indirectly, to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of the institution. Acquisition of more than 10% of any class of a unitary thrift holding company's voting stock constitutes a rebuttable determination of control under the regulations under certain circumstances including where, as in our case, the company has registered securities under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 
         In addition, federal regulations provide that no company may acquire control of a unitary thrift holding company without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board. Any company that acquires such control becomes subject to registration, examination and regulation by the Federal Reserve Board. 
   Emerging Growth Company Status 
         The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (H.R. 1) (the "JOBS Act"), which was enacted in April 2012, has made numerous changes to the federal securities laws to facilitate access to capital markets. Under the JOBS Act, a company with total annual gross revenues of less than $1.07 billion during its most recently completed fiscal year qualifies as an "emerging growth company." Sterling Bancorp, Inc. qualifies as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act. 
         An "emerging growth company" may choose not to hold shareholder votes to approve annual executive compensation (more frequently referred to as "say-on-pay" votes) or executive compensation payable in connection with a merger (more frequently referred to as "say-on-golden parachute" votes). An emerging growth company also is not subject to the requirement that its auditors attest to the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting, and can provide scaled disclosure regarding executive compensation. Finally, an emerging growth company may elect to comply with new or amended accounting pronouncements in the same manner as a private company, but must make such election when the company is first required to file a registration statement. Such an election 
 17

   is irrevocable during the period a company is an emerging growth company. Sterling Bancorp, Inc. has elected to comply with new or amended accounting pronouncements in the same manner as a non-emerging growth public company. 
         A company loses emerging growth company status on the earlier of: (i) the last day of the fiscal year of the company during which it had total annual gross revenues of $1.07 billion or more; (ii) the last day of the fiscal year of the issuer following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of common equity securities of the company pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933; (iii) the date on which such company has, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt; or (iv) the date on which such company is deemed to be a "large accelerated filer" under Securities and Exchange Commission regulations (generally, at least $700 million of voting and non-voting equity held by non-affiliates). 
   Employees 
         As of December 31, 2018, we had 352 full-time equivalent employees. None of our employees are represented by any collective bargaining unit or are parties to a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that our relations with our employees are good.
