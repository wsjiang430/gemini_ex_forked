ITEM 1: BUSINESS.
Overview
Verano Holdings Corp., a British Columbia corporation (“Verano”, the “Company” or “we”) is a leading vertically-integrated multi-state cannabis operator as one of the largest publicly traded multi-state operators in the United States by reported annual revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022. An operator of licensed cannabis cultivation, processing, wholesale distribution and retail facilities, our goal is the ongoing development of communal wellness by providing responsible access to regulated medical and adult-use cannabis products to discerning customers. As of March 28, 2023, through our subsidiaries and affiliates we are licensed to conduct business in 14 states and actively operate businesses in 13 states, including 125 retail dispensaries and 14 production facilities with over 1,000,000 square feet of cultivation capacity. We produce a wide variety of high quality cannabis products sold under our portfolio of consumer brands, including Encore™, Avexia™, MÜV™, Savvy™, BITS™ and Verano™. We also design, build and operate branded retail environments including Zen Leaf™ and MÜV™ dispensaries that deliver a cannabis shopping experience in both medical and adult-use markets.
Notwithstanding the permissive regulatory environment of medical, and in some cases also adult-use (i.e., recreational) cannabis at the state level, it remains illegal under U.S. federal law to cultivate, manufacture, distribute, sell or possess cannabis in the United States. Because U.S. federal law prohibits transporting any federally restricted substance across state lines, cannabis cannot be transported across state lines. As a result of current federal law prohibitions, the U.S. cannabis industry is conducted on a state-by-state basis. To date, in the United States 37 states plus the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories of Puerto Rico, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands have authorized comprehensive medical cannabis programs, 22 states plus the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories of Guam and the Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands have authorized comprehensive programs for medical and adult-use cannabis, and 11 states allow the use of low THC (delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, the main psychoactive ingredient in cannabis), high cannabidiol (“CBD”) cannabis products for specified medical uses. Strict compliance with state and local laws with respect to cannabis may neither absolve the Company of liability under U.S. federal law, nor may it provide a defense to any federal proceeding which may be brought against the Company or any of its subsidiaries.
Verano operates within states where cannabis use, medical or both medical and adult-use, has been approved by state and local regulatory bodies. For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, medical-use sales and adult-use sales comprised approximately 60% and 40% of our consolidated revenues, respectively.
All of the Company’s business, operating results and financial condition relate to U.S. cannabis-related activities. Our strategy is to vertically integrate as a single cohesive company in multiple states through the consolidation of seed-to-sale cultivating, manufacturing, distributing, and dispensing cannabis brands and products at scale. Our cultivation, processing and wholesale distribution of cannabis consumer packaged goods are designed to guarantee shelf-space in our national retail dispensary chains, as well as to develop and foster long term wholesale supply relationships with third-party retail operators. Our model includes geographic diversity by establishing a footprint to allow us to adapt to changes in both industry and market conditions.
Verano is a reporting issuer under applicable securities legislation in all of the provinces and territories of Canada and the Company’s Class A subordinate voting shares (the “Subordinate Voting Shares”) are listed on the Canadian Securities Exchange (the “CSE”) under the symbol “VRNO.” The Subordinate Voting Shares are also quoted for trading in the U.S. on the OTCQX under the symbol “VRNOF.”

History of the Company
Verano LLC
Verano Holdings, LLC, a subsidiary of the Company (“Verano LLC”), was the start of Verano’s business operations. Verano LLC is a Delaware limited liability company that was co-founded by George Archos, our current Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, in September 2017. Verano LLC was formed as a Chicago, Illinois based holding company to consolidate cannabis operations initially in Illinois, including cultivation and production facilities and retail dispensaries.
Beginning in August 2018, Verano LLC began to acquire control, management, ownership, and other rights to medical and adult-use cannabis licenses in U.S. states where Verano LLC or Verano LLC’s co-founders held an existing ownership or management stake.
Starting in January 2019, Verano LLC implemented an expansion strategy whereby Verano LLC, either directly or through subsidiaries or affiliates, began acquiring control, management, ownership, and other rights to medical and adult-use cannabis businesses across multiple U.S. states, including cultivation, production, wholesale distribution and retail dispensaries.
REVERSE TAKEOVER TRANSACTION (“RTO”)
On December 14, 2020, Verano LLC, Majesta Minerals, Inc., an Alberta corporation (“Majesta Minerals”), 1276268 B.C. Ltd., a British Columbia corporation (“Verano FinCo”), 1277233 B.C. Ltd, a British Columbia corporation, and 1278655 B.C. Ltd., a British Columbia corporation, entered into an Arrangement Agreement (as amended on January 26, 2021, the “Arrangement Agreement”), pursuant to which the Company would result from a reverse takeover transaction as a British Columbia public reporting company (the “RTO”).
In accordance with the plan of arrangement forming part of the Arrangement Agreement (the “Plan of Arrangement”), Majesta Minerals completed a consolidation of its common shares on the basis of 100,000 issued and outstanding common shares on a post-consolidation basis. Majesta Minerals also reorganized its capital by altering its notice of articles and articles to (i) attach special rights and restrictions to its common shares, (ii) change the identifying name of its common shares to Subordinate Voting Shares and (iii) create a new class of Class B proportionate voting shares (the “Proportionate Voting Shares”). As part of the Plan of Arrangement, Majesta Minerals also changed its name to “Verano Holdings Corp.” prior to the RTO.
The Company’s dual class structure consists of Proportionate Voting Shares, each of which is convertible into 100 Subordinate Voting Shares, and Subordinate Voting Shares, each of which is convertible into 1/100 Proportionate Voting Share. The rights, preferences and protections of the Subordinate Voting Shares and the Proportionate Voting Shares are the same and based upon the deemed conversion ratio of 100 Subordinate Voting Shares for one Proportionate Voting Share, such that each Subordinate Voting Share is entitled to one vote and each Proportionate Voting Share is entitled to 100 votes and each Proportionate Voting Share would receive 100 times the amount of any dividends or distributions that are payable for one Subordinate Voting Share.
In connection with the RTO and Plan of Arrangement, the Company consummated a private placement conducted on a commercially reasonable best-efforts basis (the “Financing”), whereby 10,000,000 subscription receipts (the “Subscription Receipts”) were issued by Verano FinCo prior to the RTO in January 2021, at a price per Subscription Receipt of $10, for aggregate gross proceeds of $100,000,000. The net proceeds of the Financing were transferred to the Company, as the resulting corporation in the RTO.
Upon the consummation of the RTO, Verano’s authorized capital consisted of an unlimited number of Subordinate Voting Shares, and an unlimited number of Proportionate Voting Shares. The shareholders of Verano FinCo received one Subordinate Voting Share for each share of Verano FinCo for a total of 10,000,000 Subordinate Voting Shares. The members of Verano LLC, and third-party owners of some of Verano LLC’s subsidiaries, through a series of transactions, exchanged their ownership interests in Verano LLC and such subsidiaries for an aggregate of 96,892,040 Subordinate Voting Shares and an aggregate of 1,172,382 Proportionate Voting Shares, resulting in Verano LLC and its subsidiaries becoming subsidiaries of the Company.

The Subordinate Voting Shares were listed on the CSE and began trading on February 17, 2021 under the trading symbol “VRNO.”
AME Merger Agreement
On November 6, 2020, Verano LLC entered into an agreement and plan of merger (as amended on December 14, 2020 and February 5, 2021, the “AME Merger Agreement”) with Alternative Medical Enterprises LLC (“AltMed”), Plants of Ruskin GPS, LLC and RVC 360, LLC (together, “Plants of Ruskin” and, collectively with AltMed, the “AME Parties”), pursuant to which the Company, as the assignee of all of Verano LLC’s rights and obligations thereunder, acquired the AME Parties and their subsidiaries and ownership and control interests (collectively with the AME Parties, the “AME Group”) via a series of merger transactions. The merger transactions were contingent upon, and were consummated contemporaneously with, the RTO. The members of the AME Parties, through a series of transactions, exchanged their membership interests in the AME Parties for an aggregate of 18,092,987 Subordinate Voting Shares and 470,984 Proportionate Voting Shares, plus cash consideration of $35,000,000, of which $20,000,000 was paid at the closing of the mergers. An additional $10,000,000 was paid in August 2021, and the $5,000,000 balance was paid in February 2022.
The RTO and the merger transactions with the AME Parties (collectively, the “Go Public Transactions”), each closed on February 11, 2021, resulting in the creation of the Company as a Canadian publicly-traded company and the parent holding company of Verano LLC, the AME Parties and their respective subsidiaries and ownership and control interests. Because of this holding company structure, Verano has no business operations and to the extent it cannot raise funds through the issuance of debt or equity securities, it is dependent on the financial health and operating performance of its subsidiaries and affiliates to meet its financial obligations. The ability of our subsidiaries and affiliates to pay dividends and other distributions to us or any of our other subsidiaries will depend on their operating results and will be subject to applicable laws and regulations which require that solvency and capital standards be maintained, as well as contractual restrictions on dividends and distributions that may be contained in mortgages, credit facilities and other similar agreements. In the event of a liquidation or reorganization of any of our subsidiaries, lenders and trade creditors may be entitled to payment of their claims from the assets of such subsidiary before us.

Dispositions
Canna Cuzzos, LLC (“Canna Cuzzos”) is a medical marijuana licensee for a retail dispensary in Waldorf, Maryland. In 2017, a subsidiary of the Company entered into a management services agreement with Canna Cuzzos and provided operating and other services to Canna Cuzzos’ dispensary. In 2018, Verano LLC acquired options to purchase all the ownership interests of a Maryland limited liability company (the “LLC”), which held a 40% ownership interest in the sole owner of Canna Cuzzos, resulting in such options being exercisable for an indirect 40% ownership interest in Canna Cuzzos. On January 31, 2022 all the ownership interests of Canna Cuzzo’s sole owner were sold to a third party for a cash purchase price of approximately $5,000,000, subject to adjustment based on working capital levels and outstanding liabilities. Prior to the sale being consummated, Verano LLC consented to the sale, amended its purchase options to receive an assignment of the LLC’s sale proceeds thereunder of approximately $2,000,000 on an unadjusted basis, and agreed to provide the LLC administrative services in connection with the sale transaction. Upon consummation of the sale, the management services agreement with Canna Cuzzos was terminated.
NH Medicinal Dispensaries, LLC (“NHM”) is the holder of two marijuana licenses which allows it to operate two retail dispensaries in Illinois: the Clinic Effingham dispensary (“TCE”) and the Charleston dispensary. NHM is a wholly-owned subsidiary of ILDISP, LLC (“ILDISP”), and in March 2016, Verano LLC entered into a joint venture agreement and acquired 50% of ILDISP. On March 1, 2022, the Company sold the 50% ownership interest in ILDISP, LLC to the joint venture partner for $22,393,000 subject to certain adjustments.
Product Launches
On August 15, 2022, the Company announced the launch of Savvy™, a new brand featuring larger-format cannabis products, catering to more value-oriented patients and consumers. Savvy™ became available in Zen Leaf™ and MÜV™ dispensaries beginning September 2022, followed by additional third-party retail locations across six core markets - Arizona, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maryland, Nevada and Ohio - with additional launches planned for New Jersey and Pennsylvania.
On August 18, 2022, the cannabis company of legendary boxer, entrepreneur, and cannabis advocate Mike Tyson, Tyson 2.0, Inc. announced the launch of its Ric Flair Drip Cannabis line in partnership with the Company.

Each of BITS™ five initial flavors offer a blend of 5 milligrams of THC, complementary cannabinoids and adaptogens designed to enhance not overtake, and to make the cannabis edible experience less intimidating, more accessible and enjoyable.
Credit Agreement
On October 27, 2022, Verano and its subsidiaries and affiliates from time-to-time party thereto (collectively, the “Borrowers”), entered into a Credit Agreement (the “2022 Credit Agreement”) with Chicago Atlantic Admin, LLC (“CAA”), as administrative agent for the lenders from time-to-time party thereto, pursuant to which the lenders advanced the Borrowers a $350,000,000 senior secured term loan, all of which was used to repay the principal indebtedness outstanding under the Company’s prior credit agreement, dated as of May 10, 2021 (as amended and restated, the “Prior Credit Agreement”). In connection with such repayment, the Prior Credit Agreement was terminated and is no longer in force or effect.
The 2022 Credit Agreement provides the Borrowers with the right, subject to conditions, to request an additional incremental term loan in the aggregate principal amount of up to $100,000,000; provided that the lenders elect to fund such incremental term loan. 
The 2022 Credit Agreement also provides the Borrowers with the right to (i) incur up to $120,000,000 of additional indebtedness from third-party lenders secured by real estate excluded as collateral under the 2022 Credit Agreement, (ii) incur additional mortgage financing from third-party lenders secured by real estate acquired after the funding date of the 2022 Credit Agreement, and (iii) upon the SAFE Banking Act or similar legislation making banking services available to U.S. cannabis companies being passed by the United States Congress, incur up to $50,000,000 pursuant to a revolving credit facility from third-party lenders that is pari passu or subordinated to the 2022 Credit Agreement obligations, each of which is subject to customary conditions.
Table of Contents

The obligations under the 2022 Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Borrowers, excluding vehicles, specified parcels of real estate and other customary exclusions.
The 2022 Credit Agreement provides for a floating annual interest rate equal to the prime rate then in effect plus 6.50%, which rate may be increased by 3.00% upon an event of default or 6.00% upon a material event of default as provided in the 2022 Credit Agreement.
The funded loan requires scheduled amortization payments of $350,000 per month and the remaining principal balance is due in full on October 30, 2026.
At any time, the Borrowers may voluntarily prepay up to $100,000,000 of the principal balance, subject to a $1,000,000 prepayment premium, and may prepay the remaining outstanding principal balance for a prepayment premium at varying rates based on the timing of the prepayment. The Borrowers may not voluntarily prepay more than $100,000,000 of the principal balance without prepaying the entire outstanding principal balance of the loan.
The 2022 Credit Agreement includes customary representations, warranties and covenants and customary events of default, including payment defaults, breaches of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, cross-defaults to material indebtedness, and events of bankruptcy and insolvency.
The 2022 Credit Agreement also includes customary negative covenants limiting the Borrowers’ ability to incur additional indebtedness and grant liens that are otherwise not permitted, and the ability to enter into definitive documents or consummate acquisitions or dispositions that are not otherwise permitted thereunder, among others. Additionally, the 2022 Credit Agreement requires the Borrowers to meet financial tests regarding minimum cash balances, minimum levels of Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the 2022 Credit Agreement) and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio.
As of December 31, 2022, the Company was in compliance with such covenants.
George Archos, the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Founder of the Company, participated in the 2022 Credit Agreement as a lender funding $1,000,000 of the $350,000,000 principal amount. Mr. Archos is excluded from certain approval rights of the lenders.
Organizational Structure
Verano is a holding company and conducts its business operations through subsidiaries and affiliates. The following chart sets forth the corporate structure of the Company and its primary subsidiary, Verano LLC. We operate our business through direct and indirect subsidiaries and affiliates of the Company. As part of the implementation of the Go Public Transactions, through a series of transactions we formed two levels of subsidiaries above Verano LLC that include Verano Holdings USA Corp., a Delaware corporation (“BlockerCo”), and five subsidiaries of BlockerCo, those being ZNN Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, Nuuvn Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, ZenNorth LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, A&T SPV II LLC, a Texas limited liability company, and SGI 1 LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (collectively, the “Blocker Subsidiaries”). BlockerCo and the Blocker Subsidiaries have no business or operations and exist solely to affect the Go Public Transactions and the taxation of Verano as a U.S. corporation rather than a British Columbia corporation.

From time to time, we may reorganize our operating subsidiaries through consolidations, mergers, contributions, distributions and similar corporate restructurings in order to integrate acquired companies, enhance efficiencies, streamline operations, group borrowers under the 2022 Credit Agreement and align financial reporting. After giving effect to any corporate reorganization, all operating entities remain as indirect subsidiaries of BlockerCo and the Company. See Exhibit 21.1 to this Form 10-K for a list of subsidiaries of the Company as of December 31, 2022.
Our Strategy
As an operator of licensed cannabis cultivation, processing, wholesale distribution and retail facilities, Verano’s goal is the ongoing development of communal wellness by providing responsible access to regulated cannabis products to discerning customers.
Our strategy is to vertically integrate as a single cohesive company in multiple states through consolidation of seed-to-sale cultivating, processing, wholesale distributing, and dispensing branded products at scale. The Company’s cultivation, processing and wholesale distribution of cannabis consumer packaged goods are designed to support our national retail dispensary chains that operate under brand names including Zen Leaf™ and MÜV™. We developed this model to guarantee shelf-space in our retail dispensaries, as well as to develop and foster long term wholesale supply relationships with third-party retail dispensary operators though supply arrangements and sales.
Our strategy includes geographic diversity by establishing a footprint that enables us to adapt to changes in both industry and market conditions. We have pursued this strategy of geographic diversity through acquisitions and organic growth funded by internally generated cashflow, the issuance of Subordinate Voting Shares and Proportionate Voting Shares, deferred purchase price payments and the incurrence of indebtedness for borrowed money.
We believe that the following business objectives have positioned Verano for continued growth.
•The Company’s business plan centers around four foundational pillars: cultivation, production, brand creation and retail.
Table of Contents

•Diversity in revenue streams positions the Company to respond proactively to changes in economics, regulations and healthcare, as well as navigating ever-evolving consumer habits.
•The Company strives to operate and manage the entire vertical cannabis operation and supply chain from seed-to- sale.
•The Company focuses on a current potential market size of nearly 115 million adult Americans, based on U.S. Census Bureau estimations as of July 1, 2022, which includes the total adult population in the 13 states that we have active operations, those states being Arizona, Arkansas, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia.
•The Company aims for a “first-mover” competitive advantage in emerging markets by seeking early entry into states with approved medical-use cannabis programs and then establishing a footprint and vertical operations in anticipation of the future authorization of adult-use cannabis.
•The Company emphasizes developing high-quality products at various price points pursuing quality in order to elevate its products’ market desirability and value.
•The Company adheres to standard operating procedures across all of its cultivation and processing facilities, growing pesticide-free and implementing compliance programs to meet product testing, inventory controls and other state regulatory requirements.
•The Company espouses a customer and patient driven business philosophy to deliver value to its downstream patients and consumers.
Regulatory Framework in the United States
The U.S. regulatory scheme varies in its terminology and definitions, using “cannabis”, “marijuana” and “hemp” as distinct terms. For purposes of this Form 10-K, the term “cannabis” means “marijuana” as set forth in the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. § 811) (the “Controlled Substances Act”) and is used interchangeably with the term “marijuana.”
To date in the United States, 37 states plus the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories of Puerto Rico, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands have authorized comprehensive medical marijuana programs, 22 states plus the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories of Guam and the Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands have authorized comprehensive programs for both medical and adult-use marijuana, and 11 states allow the use of low THC, high CBD products for specified medical uses. Notwithstanding the permissive regulatory environment of medical, and in some cases, adult-use marijuana, at the state level, it remains illegal under U.S. federal law to cultivate, manufacture, distribute, sell or possess marijuana in the United States. Because federal law prohibits transporting any federally restricted substance across state lines, cannabis cannot be transported across state lines. As a result of federal law prohibitions, the U.S. cannabis industry is conducted on a state-by-state basis and we rely on newly established and developing laws and regulations in the states and local jurisdictions in which we operate. In addition, financial transactions involving proceeds generated by, or intended to promote, cannabis-related business activities in the U.S. may form the basis for prosecution under applicable U.S. federal money laundering legislation.

Regulation of Cannabis at the U.S. Federal Level
The U.S. federal government’s approach to enforcement of marijuana laws has trended toward deference to state laws where a robust state regulatory framework exists. In August 2013, the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) issued a memorandum known as the “Cole Memorandum” to all U.S. Attorneys’ offices. The Cole Memorandum generally directed U.S. Attorneys not to prioritize the enforcement of federal marijuana laws against individuals and businesses that comply with state marijuana programs. The Cole Memorandum, while not legally binding and only a policy statement, assisted in managing the tension between state and federal laws concerning all medical and adult-use state-regulated marijuana businesses.
In January 2018, the Cole Memorandum was rescinded by former Attorney General Jeff Sessions. While this did not create a change in federal law, the revocation added to the uncertainty of U.S. federal enforcement of the Controlled Substances Act in states where marijuana use is regulated. Former Attorney General Jeff Sessions also issued a one-page memorandum known as the “Sessions Memorandum” which confirmed the rescission of the Cole Memorandum and explained that the Cole Memorandum was “unnecessary” due to existing general enforcement guidance as set forth in the U.S. Attorney’s Manual. While the Sessions Memorandum does emphasize that marijuana is a Schedule I controlled substance, it does not otherwise indicate that the prosecution of marijuana-related offenses is a heightened DOJ priority. The Sessions Memorandum explicitly describes itself as a guide to prosecutorial discretion, which remains in the hands of U.S. Attorneys when deciding whether or not to prosecute marijuana-related offenses. No direction was given to federal prosecutors in the Sessions Memorandum as to the priority they should ascribe to such cannabis activities, and the Sessions Memorandum did not address the treatment of medical cannabis by federal prosecutors.
President Biden, who assumed office in January 2021, stated a policy goal of federal cannabis decriminalization. On October 6, 2022, President Biden issued a Proclamation on Granting pardon for the Offense of Simple Possession of Marijuana stating that President Biden grants a full, complete, and unconditional pardon to (1) all current U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents who committed the offense of simple possession of marijuana in violation of the Controlled Substances Act or in violation of D.C. Code 48–904.01(d)(1), on or before the date of the Proclamation, regardless of whether they have been charged with or prosecuted for this offense on or before the date of the Proclamation; and (2) all current U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents who have been convicted of the offense of simple possession of marijuana in violation of the Controlled Substances Act or in violation of D.C. Code 48–904.01(d)(1); which pardon shall restore to them full political, civil, and other rights. President Biden further asked the Secretary of Health and Attorney General Merrick Garland to promptly reevaluate cannabis as a Schedule I substance under the Controlled Substances Act. In December 2022, President Biden enacted The Medical Marijuana and Cannabidiol Research Expansion Act. This Act, the first standalone cannabis bill to be passed by Congress, reduces federal barriers to cannabis research, creates a mechanism for the Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) to approve products derived from cannabis, protects doctors who certify patients for medical cannabis use, requires the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to report on the potential therapeutic benefits of cannabis, and requires the Attorney General to annually review whether a sufficient amount of cannabis is being produced to meet the needs of medical cannabis research. In March 2021, Merrick Garland was appointed U.S. Attorney General by President Biden. Mr. Garland indicated he would generally act in accordance with the Cole Memorandum, when, at his confirmation hearing, he said, “It does not seem to me, a useful use of limited resources that we have, to be pursuing prosecutions in states that have legalized and that are regulating the use of marijuana, either medically or otherwise.”
The Company is also subject to a variety of federal laws and regulations in the U.S. and Canada that relate to money laundering, financial recordkeeping and proceeds of crime, including the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act of 1970 (commonly known as the “Bank Secrecy Act”), as amended by Title III of the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (USA PATRIOT Act), the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act (Canada), the Criminal Code (Canada), in each case as amended and any related or similar rules, regulations or guidelines of governmental authorities in the U.S. and Canada. Further, under U.S. federal law, banks or other financial institutions that provide a cannabis business with a checking account, debit or credit card, small business loan, or any other service could be found guilty of money laundering, aiding and abetting, or conspiracy.

Additionally, under U.S. federal law it may be a violation of federal money laundering statutes for financial institutions to take any proceeds from the sale of cannabis or any other Schedule I controlled substance. Banks and other financial institutions, particularly those that are federally chartered in the U.S., could be prosecuted and possibly convicted of money laundering for providing services to cannabis businesses. The Company may also be considered in violation of federal money laundering statutes for “federal health care law violations,” which include violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938 (“FDCA”).
In February 2014, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the Treasury Department issued a memorandum (the “FinCEN Memorandum”) providing instructions to banks seeking to provide services to marijuana-related businesses. The FinCEN Memorandum clarifies how financial institutions can provide services to marijuana-related businesses consistent with their Bank Secrecy Act obligations. It refers to supplementary guidance that Deputy Attorney General Cole issued to federal prosecutors relating to the prosecution of money laundering offenses predicated on cannabis-related violations of the Controlled Substances Act and independently lists the federal government’s enforcement priorities as related to cannabis. Although the original FinCEN Memorandum is still in place, this supplementary DOJ guidance that accompanied the FinCEN Memorandum was rescinded when former Attorney General Sessions rescinded the Cole Memorandum. It is unclear whether the current Biden administration will follow the guidelines of the FinCEN Memorandum. Despite the attempt to legitimize cannabis banking, in practice the FinCEN Memorandum guidance has not made banks much more willing to provide services to cannabis businesses. The current law does not guarantee banks immunity from prosecution, and it also requires banks and other financial institutions to undertake time-consuming and costly due diligence on each cannabis business they take as a customer.
Due to financial institutions concerns of being implicated in or prosecuted for money laundering, cannabis businesses are often forced into becoming “cash-only” businesses. As banks and other financial institutions in the U.S. are generally unwilling to risk a potential violation of federal law without guaranteed immunity from prosecution, most refuse to provide any kind of services to cannabis businesses. The few credit unions who have agreed to work with cannabis businesses are limiting those accounts in relation to their total deposits. Since the federal government could change the banking laws as it relates to cannabis businesses at any time and without notice, these credit unions must keep sufficient cash on hand to be able to return the full value of all deposits from cannabis businesses in a single day, while also servicing the need of their other customers.
In the absence of comprehensive reform of federal cannabis legislation that would decriminalize the cannabis industry, a growing number of members of the U.S. Congress (“Congress”) have expressed support for federal legislation that would eliminate the financing activity of businesses operating under state-sanctioned cannabis programs from the scope of federal money laundering statutes. In September 2019, the U.S. House of Representatives (the “House”) first passed the Secured and Fair Enforcement Banking Act of 2019 (commonly known as the “SAFE Banking Act”), which aims to provide safe harbors and guidance to financial institutions that work with legal U.S. cannabis businesses, as a standalone bill but it failed to be taken up by the U.S. Senate (“Senate”). Since then the language of the SAFE Banking Act has been attached to various proposed legislation, but the language has not been included in any final legislation. To date, the SAFE Banking Act has passed the House a total of six times either as a standalone bill or attached to other legislation, most recently in February 2022 as an amendment to the America Competes Act. However, the amendment was removed from the Senate version of the bill and was not included in the final version of the COMPETES Act amendment.
In June 2022, a variation on the SAFE Banking Act’s federal banking and financing protections was introduced. The bipartisan Capital Lending and Investment for Marijuana Businesses Act (the “CLIMB Act”) would amend any applicable federal law to allow cannabis operators access to traditional financial institutions (e.g., national U.S. securities exchanges and commercial banks). The CLIMB Act further proposes the express federal protection of third-party providers that work with legitimate cannabis and cannabis-related businesses. Such third-party business assistance includes, but is not limited to, sale of insurance or surety products; sale, leasing, or renting of real estate; provision of legal, accounting, marketing, information technology and accounting services; and the provision of equipment, parts, substances or testing services to cannabis business operators. Cannabis companies must currently pay a premium for many of these standard business services as a result of the cannabis plant’s present status under federal law, which can result in increased operating expenses.

Other legislation that has been introduced in the U.S. that would make cannabis transactions easier and more predictable, include the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act (the “MORE Act”), the Cannabis Administration and Opportunities Act (the “CAO Act”), the Preparing Regulators Effectively for a Post-Prohibition Adult Use Regulated Environment Act (the “PREPARE Act”) and legislation proposed by Representative Nancy Mace of South Carolina. The MORE Act was introduced in 2019 and if it were to become law, the MORE Act, among other things, would remove cannabis as a Schedule I controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act, create cannabis tax and grant programs and make available U.S. Small Business Administration funding for regulated cannabis operators. Although the House passed the MORE Act in December 2020, it failed to pass in the Senate prior to the end of the 2020 legislative session. The House passed the MORE Act a second time on April 1, 2022, however, the bill stalled in the Senate. The Senate’s own comprehensive bill, the CAO Act, was released as a discussion draft in July 2021, and if it were to become law it would, among other things, remove cannabis from the definition of a controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act, impose a federal tax on cannabis of 10% in its first year of enactment (eventually increasing to 25% in 5% increments), enshrine the current state cannabis licensing regimes and introduce additional federal legislation permitting cannabis wholesalers and blocking states from prohibiting interstate commerce of regulated cannabis across their borders. The CAO Act was reintroduced in the Senate on July 21, 2022; however, it was not heard in committee prior to the adjournment of the 117th Congress on January 3, 2023.
In November 2021, Representative Nancy Mace of South Carolina introduced legislation to federally decriminalize cannabis, a measure directed at giving states freer rein to pass their own laws and regulations without the risk of federal reprisals. In announcing the bill, Representative Mace said the bill would aim to regulate cannabis similarly to alcohol and prohibit its use for anyone under 21 years of age. The measure would decriminalize cannabis at the federal level, but it would not change local-level restrictions, meaning that states would still determine their own cannabis statutes. Representative Mace’s bill would also levy a 3% federal excise tax on all cannabis products, proceeds from which would go to small businesses, retraining law enforcement and mental health services, among other services. The measure would also expunge nonviolent, cannabis-only related offenses. The PREPARE Act was introduced in the House in April 2022 to prepare the U.S. federal government for the “inevitable end to cannabis prohibition.” The proposed legislation would direct the U.S. Attorney General to establish a federal commission to oversee the development of a regulatory and revenue framework modeled after the alcohol industry while also respecting the cannabis laws of each state.
Despite the rescission of the Cole Memorandum, one legislative safeguard for the medical cannabis industry remains in place. Since 2015 Congress has used a rider known as the Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment (also known as the Rohrabacher–Farr amendment) (the “RBA”) to prevent the federal government from using congressionally appropriated funds to enforce federal cannabis laws against regulated medical cannabis actors operating in compliance with state and local law. However, this measure does not protect adult-use cannabis businesses. Congress has repeatedly renewed the RBA. In 2021, President Biden became the first president to propose a budget with the RBA included. Currently the RBA has been renewed through the signing of the FY 2023 omnibus spending bill, effective through September 30, 2023.
There can be no assurance that the SAFE Banking Act, the CLIMB Act, the CAO Act, the MORE Act, Representative Mace’s bill, the PREPARE Act or similar comprehensive legislation that would de-schedule and de-criminalize cannabis will be passed in the near future or at all, particularly as other priorities such as rising inflation and the war in Ukraine are expected to be priorities. There can be no assurance that the RBA will be renewed beyond September 30, 2023. If any such legislation is passed, there is no guarantee that it will include provisions that preserve the current state-based cannabis programs under which the Company’s subsidiaries and affiliates operate or that such legislation will otherwise be favorable to the Company and its business.
An additional federal law challenge to cannabis businesses is that the provisions of Section 280E of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as amended (the “Code”), are being applied by the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) to businesses operating in the medical and adult-use cannabis industry. Section 280E of the Code prohibits cannabis businesses from deducting their ordinary and necessary business expenses, forcing them to pay higher effective U.S. federal tax rates than similar companies in other industries. The effective tax rate on a cannabis business depends on how large its ratio of non-deductible expenses is to its total revenues. Therefore, businesses in the state legalized cannabis industry may be less profitable than they would otherwise be if Section 280E were not applied to their businesses.

Violations of any U.S. federal laws and regulations could result in significant fines, penalties, administrative sanctions, convictions or settlements arising from civil proceedings conducted by either the federal government or private citizens, or criminal charges, including, but not limited to, disgorgement of profits, cessation of business activities, civil forfeiture or divestiture. This could have a material adverse effect on the Company, including our reputation and ability to conduct business, our cannabis licenses in the U.S., the listing and trading of our securities on stock exchanges and platforms, our financial position, operating results, profitability, liquidity and the market price of our publicly traded shares. In addition, it is difficult for the Company to estimate the time or resources that would be needed for the investigation of any such matters or its final resolution because, in part, the time and resources that may be needed are dependent on the nature and extent of any information requested by the applicable authorities involved, and such time and resources could be substantial.
Regulation of Cannabis at the U.S. State and Local Levels
Because federal law prohibits transporting any federally restricted substance across state lines, cannabis cannot be transported across state lines. This prohibition applies to, among other things, transporting cannabis between states that have legalized cannabis use and transporting cannabis that has been legally acquired in a state. Because of current federal law, the U.S. cannabis industry is conducted on a state-by-state basis, and we rely on newly established and developing laws and regulations in the states and local jurisdictions in which we operate. The cannabis industry is subject to state and local laws, regulations and guidelines relating to, among other matters, the cultivation, processing, distribution, sale, storage and disposal of medical and adult-use cannabis, with each state newly establishing laws and regulations for that particular state upon approval of medical or adult-use cannabis in such state. States and localities currently require licenses and permits to engage in the cannabis industry with the laws and regulations varying from state to state. In many states, there are specific license caps that create high barriers to entry. In addition to stringent application requirements, licenses may be limited in scope of business. States also may enact social equity programs to foster an inclusive and equitable cannabis industry by increasing diversity in the number of license holders, which may further limit available licenses. Generally, any change in ownership of a license holder or other deemed sale, assignment or transfer of a license requires prior approval by the applicable state regulators, which approval process may be lengthy and rigorous.
For each of our licenses, the states impose strict license renewal requirements that vary state by state. We generally must complete the renewal application process within a prescribed period of time prior to the expiration date and pay an application fee. The state licensing body can deny or revoke licenses and renewals for a variety of reasons, including, among others, (i) submission of materially inaccurate, incomplete or fraudulent information, (ii) failure of the Company or any of its directors or officers to comply, or have a history of non-compliance, with any applicable law or regulation, including laws relating to minimum age of customers, safety and non-diversion of cannabis or cannabis products, taxes, child support, workers compensation and insurance coverage, or failure to otherwise remain in good standing (iii) failure to submit or implement a plan of correction for any identified violation, (iv) attempting to assign registration to another entity without state approval, (v) insufficient financial resources, (vi) committing, permitting, aiding or abetting of any illegal practices in the operation of a facility, (vii) failure to cooperate or give information to relevant law enforcement related to any matter arising out of conduct at a licensed facility and (viii) lack of responsible operations, as evidenced by negligence, disorderly or unsanitary facilities or permitting a person to use a registration card belonging to another person. Some jurisdictions also require licensees to attend a public hearing or forum in connection with their initial license application and license renewal application. Any unexpected delays or costs associated with the licensing renewal process could impede our ongoing or planned operations and could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.
Below is a general summary overview of the current licensing and regulatory framework in the states where we operated under cultivation, processing or retail licenses or have rights to operate under such licenses as of March 28, 2023. In addition to the states listed below, in the ordinary course of business we may also conduct pre-licensing activities in other markets. In these markets, we may have either applied for licenses, or plan on applying for licenses, but we do not currently own or manage businesses with cultivation, processing, or retail licenses. See Appendix A to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a list of the licenses and permits, by state, held by the Company for the cultivation, processing, wholesale distribution and retail sale of cannabis products as of March 28, 2023.

Arizona
Cannabis licenses in Arizona may be vertically integrated. Marijuana establishment licensees may operate all of the following: (i) a single retail location at which the licensee may sell marijuana and marijuana products to consumers, cultivate marijuana and manufacture marijuana products; (ii) a single off-site cultivation location at which the licensee may cultivate marijuana, process marijuana and manufacture marijuana products, but from which marijuana and marijuana products may not be transferred or sold to consumers; and (iii) a single off-site location at which the licensee may manufacture marijuana products and package and store marijuana and marijuana products, but from which marijuana and marijuana products may not be transferred or sold to consumer.
Arizona state licenses are renewed biennially. Every other year, licensees are required to submit a renewal application. While renewals are biennial, there is no ultimate expiry after which no renewals are permitted. Additionally, in respect of the renewal process, provided that the requisite renewal fees are paid, the renewal application is submitted in a timely manner, and there are no material violations noted against the applicable licenses, a licensee would expect to receive the applicable renewed license in the ordinary course of business.
See Appendix A to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a list of the licenses issued to us with respect to our operations in Arizona.
Arkansas
Subject to state regulations, Arkansas currently allows access to cannabis for medical use. The Company and its subsidiaries have entered into agreements or arrangements with a dispensary licensee that holds one license in the State of Arkansas that provides contractual rights with respect to ownership, management services, consulting or licensing, or a combination thereof, with respect to the license and related cannabis business being conducted pursuant thereto (any such agreement or arrangement, a “Management Agreement”).
Arkansas regulations apply to all aspects of cannabis seed-to-sale including record keeping, reporting, inventory quality, inventory tracking, storage, testing, security and transportation. Only qualified patients and designated caregivers may purchase medical cannabis. Delivery of medical cannabis is allowed in accordance with state regulations.
Licenses issued in the State of Arkansas expire one year after the date of issuance. The Arkansas Medical Marijuana Commission is required under the legislation to issue a renewal dispensary or a renewal cultivation facility license within ten days to any entity that complies with Arkansas’ regulatory requirements, including the payment of a renewal fee. Provided that the requisite renewal fees are paid, the renewal application is submitted in a timely manner, and there are no material violations noted against the applicable licenses, license holders expect to receive renewed licenses in the ordinary course of business.
See Appendix A to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a list of the licenses issued to us with respect to our operations in Arkansas.
California
Subject to state regulations, California currently allows access to cannabis for both medical and adult-use. Verano LLC is party to a joint venture formed with two other companies to extract cannabis oil and manufacture and distribute cannabis products in the State of California. The Company does not consider California to be a state with active operations.
California was the first U.S. state to legalize medical marijuana in 1996. This legalized the use, possession and cultivation of medical marijuana by patients with a physician recommendation for treatment of a variety of illnesses, including any for which marijuana provides relief. In 2016 voters in California passed legislation creating an adult-use marijuana program for adults 21 years of age or older.
Table of Contents

In order to legally operate a medical or adult-use cannabis business in California, the operator must have both local approval and State licensure for each type of commercial cannabis activity conducted at a specified business premises. This requires license holders to operate in cities with cannabis licensing programs. Municipalities in California are allowed to determine the number of licenses they will issue to cannabis operators or can choose to ban cannabis businesses outright. The renewal process for local entitlements is different in each jurisdiction and for each type of entitlement. State licenses must be renewed annually. In respect of the renewal process at the state level, provided that the requisite renewal fees are paid, the renewal application is submitted in a timely manner, there are no material violations noted against the applicable license, and there are no changes in ownership of the business or major changes to the operations of the business, a license holder would expect to receive the applicable renewed license in the ordinary course of business. California regulations apply to all aspects of cannabis seed-to-sale including record keeping, reporting, inventory quality, inventory tracking, testing, storage, security and transportation.
See Appendix A to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a list of the licenses issued to us with respect to our operations in California.
Connecticut
Subject to state regulations, Connecticut allowed access to cannabis for medical use beginning in 2012. In July 2021, legislation went into effect allowing for the purchase and use of cannabis by any adult over the age of 21. Adult retail sales began in January 2023. Connecticut regulations apply to all aspects of cannabis seed-to-sale including record keeping, reporting, inventory quality, inventory tracking, storage, security and transportation.
Connecticut state licenses are renewed annually. Each year, licensees are required to submit a renewal application. While renewals are annual, there is no ultimate expiry after which no renewals are permitted. Additionally, in respect of the renewal process, provided that the requisite renewal fees are paid, the renewal application is submitted at least forty-five days prior to license expiration, and there are no material violations noted against the applicable licenses, a licensee would expect to receive the applicable renewed license in the ordinary course of business.
See Appendix A to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a list of the licenses issued to us with respect to our operations in Connecticut.
Florida
Subject to state regulations, Florida currently allows access to cannabis for medical use. The Florida operation includes a call center for all state operations.
There is one principal license category in Florida: the vertically-integrated license which licenses cultivation, harvesting, processing and selling, dispensing and delivering medical cannabis products. Any change from the original application for the license requires variance approval from the Florida regulators. License applicants are required to provide comprehensive business plans with demonstrated knowledge and experience on execution, detailed facility plans, forecasted performance and robust financial resources. Technical ability on plant and medical cannabis cultivation, infrastructure, processing, dispensing and safety are also assessed.
Similar to other states, Florida regulations apply to all aspects of cannabis seed-to-sale including record keeping, reporting, inventory quality, inventory tracking, storage, security and transportation. Florida regulators may conduct announced or unannounced inspections of licensees to assess compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
See Appendix A to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a list of the licenses issued to us with respect to our operations in Florida.

Illinois
Subject to state regulations, Illinois currently allows access to cannabis for both medical and adult-use. Illinois has issued a limited amount of dispensary, cultivation, and processing licenses. Applicants for cannabis business licenses must meet, among others, the following requirements: (i) the location for a dispensary must be suitable for public access; (ii) the location must not pose a detrimental impact to the surrounding community; (iii) demonstrate compliance with safety procedures for dispensary employees, patients, and caregivers, and safe delivery and storage of cannabis and currency; (iv) provide an adequate plan for recordkeeping, tracking and monitoring inventory, quality control, destruction and disposal of cannabis, and procedures to discourage unlawful activity; (v) develop a business plan specifying products to be sold; and (vi) demonstrate knowledge of, experience, and proven record of ensuring optimal safety and accuracy in the dispensing and sale of cannabis.
Once a license is granted, licensees have a continuing obligation to ensure no cannabis is sold, delivered, transported, or distributed to a location outside of Illinois. Licenses are valid for one year, and after the initial term, licensees are required to submit renewal applications. Illinois requires on-going compliance by license holders to regulations regarding the requirements of the application which include suitable locations, safety procedures, procedures for compliance with laws, record keeping, reporting, storage, inventory quality, inventory tracking, security and transportation. Registration renewal applications may be denied if the licensee has a history of non-compliance and penalties.
Following an approximate three-year delay in Illinois’s 2020 licensing application process, new adult-use dispensary, infuser, craft grower, and transporter licenses have now begun to operationalize. The Company has established strong relationships with Illinois customers and the communities in which it operates, and will work with new licensees to build profitable new business relationships. While the operationalization of new cannabis business licenses does increase the level of retail competition within this state market, it also presents additional wholesale opportunities for the Company’s cultivation and manufacturing operation in this state market.
See Appendix A to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a list of the licenses issued to us with respect to our operations in Illinois.
Maryland
Subject to state regulations, Maryland currently allows access to cannabis for medical use. In November 2022, Maryland voters approved a state constitutional amendment that legalizes the adult-use of cannabis.  The new law goes into effect on July 1, 2023. The legislature enacted companion legislation that establishes first steps toward adult-use legalization.
There are three principal license categories in Maryland: (i) cultivation, (ii) processing and (iii) dispensary. Maryland has limited the number of cultivation, processing and dispensary licenses, and allows a dispensary licensee to have a direct interest in up to four dispensaries at one time. The retail dispensary license permits the licensee to purchase medical cannabis from cultivation facilities, cannabis and cannabis products from product manufacturing facilities and cannabis from other retail stores and allows the sale of cannabis and cannabis products to registered patients. The cultivation license permits the licensee to acquire, possess, cultivate, deliver, transfer, have tested, transport, supply or sell cannabis and related supplies to medical marijuana dispensaries, and medical cannabis cultivation facilities. The processing license permits the licensee to purchase medical cannabis from cultivation facilities, manufacture cannabis products, and sell those products to licensed medical cannabis dispensaries. Maryland licenses are valid for a period of six years and are subject to four-year renewals after required fees are paid and provided that the business remains in good standing.
Maryland requires on-going compliance with laws and regulations regarding record keeping, reporting, storage, inventory quality, inventory tracking, security and transportation. The license holder must ensure that no cannabis may be sold, delivered, transported or distributed by a producer from or to a location outside of the State. Registration renewal applications may be denied if the licensee has a history of non-compliance and penalties.
See Appendix A to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a list of the licenses issued to us with respect to our operations in Maryland.

Massachusetts
Subject to state regulations, Massachusetts currently allows access to cannabis for both medical and adult-use. On the medical side, there is one principal state license category in Massachusetts: a vertically-integrated license. On the adult-use side, there are many state license categories, but the two principal ones are cultivator and establishment (dispensary). Municipalities may individually determine what local permits or licenses are required if a licensee wishes to establish an operation within its boundaries. Medical use licensees are “vertically-integrated,” which means they grow, process, and dispense their own cannabis. As such, each medical use licensee is required to have a retail facility as well as cultivation and processing operations. Under certain conditions, medical use licensees are able to acquire up to 45% of their annual inventory of product from other medical use licensees. Medical use licensees that elect to do cultivation, processing and retail operations all in one location, are commonly referred to as a “co-located” operation.
Massachusetts mandates a comprehensive application process for licensees. Each applicant must submit charter documents, comprehensive financial statements, a character competency assessment, and employment and education histories of the senior partners and individuals responsible for the day-to-day security and operations. Each Massachusetts dispensary, grower and processor license is valid for one year.
Licensees are heavily regulated with on-going requirements related to operations, security, storage, transportation, inventorying, personnel, and more. As in other states where cannabis is legal, Massachusetts regulators can deny or revoke licenses and renewals for multiple reasons. Additionally, license holders must ensure that no cannabis is sold, delivered, or distributed by a producer from or to a location outside of Massachusetts.
See Appendix A to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a list of the licenses issued to us with respect to our operations in Massachusetts.
Michigan
Subject to state regulations, Michigan currently allows access to cannabis for both medical and adult-use. Michigan administrates five types of licenses: (i) grower licenses, (ii) processor licenses, (iii) secure transporter licenses, (iv) provisioning center licenses and (v) safety compliance facility licenses. There are no stated limits on the number of licenses that can be made available on a state level; however, regulatory authorities have discretion over the approval of applications and municipalities can pass additional restrictions.
Licensees are heavily regulated with on-going requirements related to operations, security, storage, transportation, inventorying, personnel, and more. As in other states where cannabis is legal, Michigan regulators can deny or revoke licenses and renewals for multiple reasons. Additionally, license holders must ensure that no cannabis is sold, delivered, or distributed by a producer from or to a location outside of Michigan.
Michigan state licenses are renewed annually. Every year, licensees are required to submit a renewal application with requisite renewal fees, including maintaining and providing proof of commercial general liability insurance and coverage for bodily injury resulting from sale of marijuana products. If all is submitted within 90 days, but before 30 days, of the license’s expiration, a licensee would expect to receive the applicable renewed license in the ordinary course of business.
See Appendix A to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a list of the licenses issued to us with respect to our operations in Michigan.

Nevada
Subject to state regulations, Nevada currently allows access to cannabis for both medical and adult-use. Nevada is not a vertically integrated system, and there are three principal license categories in Nevada: (i) cultivation, (ii) processing and (iii) dispensary. The cultivation licenses permit the licensee to acquire, cultivate, deliver, supply or sell marijuana and related supplies to marijuana dispensaries and facilities for the production of edible marijuana products and marijuana-infused products. The processing license permits the licensee to acquire, manufacture, deliver, supply or sell edible marijuana products or marijuana infused products to other marijuana production facilities or marijuana dispensaries. The dispensary licenses permit the licensee to purchase marijuana from cultivation facilities, marijuana and marijuana products from product manufacturing facilities and marijuana from other retail stores, as well as allow the sale of marijuana and marijuana products.
Nevada licenses are valid for one year and are subject to annual renewals after required fees are paid and provided that the business remains in good standing. Nevada requires on-going compliance with laws and regulations regarding record keeping, reporting, storage, inventory quality, inventory tracking, security and transportation. The license holder must ensure that no cannabis may be sold, delivered, transported or distributed by a producer from or to a location outside of the State. Registration renewal applications may be denied if the licensee has a history of non-compliance and penalties.
See Appendix A to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a list of the licenses issued to us with respect to our operations in Nevada.
New Jersey
Subject to state regulations, New Jersey currently allows access to cannabis for medical use and as of April 2022, adult-use. New Jersey permits the operation of vertically integrated marijuana licenses which allows the licensee to cultivate, process, and sell medical marijuana products to registered qualified patients and caregivers. There are also non-vertically integrated licenses, which principally include: (i) cultivators and manufacturers, which may cultivate marijuana and manufacture medical marijuana products, and (ii) dispensaries which may sell medical marijuana and products to registered qualified patients and caregivers. For adult-use cannabis, New Jersey administers six license classes, the principal of which are: (a) cultivator, which may grow recreational use cannabis, (b) manufacturers, which may produce recreational use cannabis in additional approved forms, and (c) retailer, which may sell recreational cannabis to consumers over the age of 21. ATCs may expand into adult-use sales if approved by New Jersey’s Cannabis Regulatory Commission.
Licensees are heavily regulated with on-going requirements related to operations, security, storage, transportation, inventorying, personnel, and more. As in other states where cannabis is legal, New Jersey regulators can deny or revoke licenses and renewals for multiple reasons. Additionally, license holders must ensure that no cannabis is sold, delivered, or distributed by a producer from or to a location outside of New Jersey.

Ohio
Subject to state regulations, Ohio currently allows access to cannabis for medical use. There are three principal license categories in Ohio: (i) cultivation, (ii) processing and (iii) dispensary. On at least a biennial basis, regulators consider whether enough medical marijuana dispensaries exist, considering the state population, the number of patients seeking to use medical marijuana and the geographic distribution of dispensary sites. More licenses may be issued based on those findings. The medical cultivation licenses permit the licensee to acquire, possess, cultivate, manufacture and process into medical marijuana products, deliver, transfer, have tested, transport, supply or sell marijuana and related supplies to medical marijuana dispensaries. The medical processor license permits the licensee to manufacture and produce medical marijuana products. The dispensary licenses permit the licensee to purchase marijuana and marijuana products from cultivation and processing facilities, as well as allow the sale of marijuana and marijuana products to registered patients. On at least a biennial basis, regulators consider whether enough medical marijuana dispensaries exist, considering the state population, the number of patients seeking to use medical marijuana and the geographic distribution of dispensary sites. More licenses may be issued based on those findings.
Ohio requires on-going compliance with laws and regulations regarding record keeping, reporting, storage, inventory quality, inventory tracking, security and transportation. The license holder must ensure that no cannabis may be sold, delivered, transported or distributed by a producer from or to a location outside of the State. Registration renewal applications may be denied if the licensee has a history of non-compliance and penalties.
See Appendix A to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a list of the licenses issued to us with respect to our operations in Ohio.
Pennsylvania
Subject to state regulations, Pennsylvania currently allows access to cannabis for medical use. The principal permit categories in Pennsylvania are: (i) cultivation, (ii) processing, and (iii) dispensary. The cultivation and processing permits allow the holder to acquire, possess, cultivate, manufacture and process into medical marijuana products and medical marijuana-infused products, deliver, transfer, have tested, transport, supply or sell marijuana and related supplies to medical marijuana dispensaries. The retail dispensary permits allow the holder to purchase marijuana and marijuana products from cultivation and processing facilities, as well as allow the sale of marijuana and marijuana products.
Pennsylvania state licenses are renewed annually, and licensees are required to submit a renewal application every year. There is no ultimate expiry after which no renewals are permitted. In respect of the renewal process, the renewal application must be submitted within six months, but no later than four months of the license’s expiration and requires detailed information regarding the licensee’s operations.
Permit holders are heavily regulated with on-going requirements related to operations, security, storage, transportation, inventorying, personnel, and more. As in other states where cannabis is legal, Pennsylvania regulators can deny or revoke permits and renewals for multiple reasons. Additionally, permit holders must ensure that no cannabis is sold, delivered, or distributed by a producer from or to a location outside of Pennsylvania.
See Appendix A to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a list of the licenses issued to us with respect to our operations in Pennsylvania.
West Virginia
Subject to state regulations, West Virginia currently allows access to cannabis for medical use. West Virginia’s Office of Medical Cannabis administers three permit types: (i) growers, which grow and cultivate medical cannabis, (ii) processors, which manufacture medical cannabis into approved forms other than usable medical marijuana, and (iii) dispensaries, which dispense medical cannabis and medical cannabis products to patients and caregivers. Licenses must be annually renewed.
West Virginia requires on-going compliance with laws and regulations regarding record keeping, reporting, storage, inventory quality, inventory tracking, security and transportation. The license holder must ensure that no cannabis may be sold, delivered, transported or distributed by a producer from or to a location outside of the State. Registration renewal applications may be denied if the licensee has a history of non-compliance and penalties.
Table of Contents

See Appendix A to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a list of the licenses issued to us with respect to our operations in West Virginia.
It is impossible to determine the extent of the impact of new federal and state and local laws, regulations or initiatives that may be proposed. The regulatory uncertainty surrounding the cannabis industry may adversely affect our business and operations, including without limitation by increasing costs to remain compliant with applicable laws, the impairment of our business by enhanced restrictions and restrictions on our ability to raise additional capital.
We will continue to monitor proposed changes to existing cannabis laws and regulations, the enactment of new cannabis laws and regulations and our compliance with applicable existing cannabis laws and regulations on an ongoing basis in accordance with our compliance program and standard operating procedures. While we believe our operations are in compliance with all applicable state and local laws, regulations and licensing requirements, such activities remain illegal under federal law. For the reasons described above and the risks further described in the section entitled “Risk Factors,” there are significant risks associated with our business. Readers of this Form 10-K are strongly encouraged to carefully read all of the risk factors contained in Item 1A—“Risk Factors.”
State and Local Licenses and Permits
The Company, through our subsidiaries and affiliates, holds all licenses and permits that are necessary to comply with state and local cannabis medical and adult-use laws and regulations applicable to our operations. All such permits and licenses are current and in effect. We are dependent upon the maintenance and renewal of our cannabis licenses and permits in the states and localities in which our business is operated. Maintenance and renewal of these licenses and permits requires us to remain in compliance with state and local laws and the rules and regulations promulgated by state and local jurisdictions.
See Appendix A to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a list of the licenses and permits, by state, held by the Company for the cultivation, processing, wholesale distribution and retail sale of cannabis products as of March 28, 2023.
State and local laws and associated rules and regulations may change in the future, and we may be required to obtain additional or supplemental licenses or permits at such times. Our growth strategy includes the acquisition of additional state licensed businesses or assets that may require us to obtain prior state regulatory approval to a change of ownership of the license holder or to a deemed transfer, assignment or sale of the applicable license, which regulatory approval may be conditioned on stringent requirements, in particular if such businesses or assets reside in states or local jurisdictions where we do not currently have operations. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to our Business and Operations - The Cannabis Industry”.
Regulatory Compliance Program
Our compliance group oversees, maintains, and implements our regulatory compliance program. The compliance group also prepares, submits and processes our applications for new licenses, renewals, approvals for changes to our existing licenses and approvals for change of ownership of licensees or deemed sales, transfers or assignments of licenses that arise with acquisitions and dispositions. In addition to our internal regulatory group and legal group, we have engaged state regulatory legal counsel, consultants and advisors in many jurisdictions.
The compliance group oversees training for cultivation, production and dispensary managers and employees, along with other department leaders and other persons as needed, on compliance with state and local laws and regulations. The compliance group also monitors all new, and changes to, laws and regulations and compliance notifications from the regulators and inspectors and leads the effort to timely resolve any issues identified.
Our compliance program includes the following compliance objectives.
•Ensure the operations of our subsidiaries (or third parties, in the jurisdictions where we have Management Agreements) are compliant with all licensing requirements by the applicable state, county, municipality, town, township, borough, and other administrative divisions.
•Ensure our business activities adhere to the scope of the licensing obtained. In the states where only medical cannabis is permitted, the cannabis products are only sold to patients who hold the necessary documentation to permit the possession of the cannabis being sold, and in the states where cannabis is permitted for adult-use, the cannabis products are only sold to individuals who meet the requisite age requirements.
Table of Contents

•Perform due diligence on cannabis businesses we may acquire, including on the policies and procedures in place to ensure that cannabis products are not distributed to minors, reviewing the ownership to ensure that no profits or revenues are used for the benefit of criminal enterprises and that the business has not been involved in violations of law.
•Ensure our businesses adhere to our policies, procedures and practice standards with sufficient checks and balances to ensure that no revenue is distributed to criminal enterprises.
•Review inventory tracking systems and procedures to ensure that the compliance system is effective at tracking inventory and ensuring that there is no diversion of cannabis or cannabis products into the states where cannabis is not permitted by state law or cross state lines in general.
•Review financial records to ensure that our business activity is not used as a cover or pre-text for trafficking of other illegal drugs or engaged in other illegal activity or any activities that are contrary to any applicable anti-money laundering statutes.
•Conduct background checks to ensure that our directors and management are of good character, and have not been involved with other illegal drugs, engaged in illegal activity or activities involving violence, or use of firearms in the cultivation, manufacturing or distribution of cannabis.
•Review activities of each of our subsidiary and affiliate businesses, the premises on which our subsidiaries and affiliates operate and adherence with the policies and procedures that are related to the possession of cannabis or cannabis products outside of licensed premises, including that there is no possession or use of cannabis on federal property or manufacturing or cultivation of cannabis on federal lands.
•Conduct reviews of products and product packaging to ensure that the products and packaging comply with applicable regulations and contain necessary disclaimers about the contents of the products to prevent adverse public health consequences from cannabis use and prevent violations related to motor vehicle, labor and other laws applicable to individuals.
We have comprehensive standard operating procedures that apply to seed-to-sale across all our locations that include, among others, procedures for receiving inventory, inventory tracking, testing, quality control, storage, record keeping, record retention, required reporting, security and transportation, as well as procedures for performing inventory reconciliation and ensuring the accuracy of recordkeeping. Regular audits of cannabis and cannabis products inventories are conducted in order to detect any possible diversion. In addition, security and compliance staff conduct unscheduled, unannounced audits to prevent complacency or the perception thereof. Adherence to the Company’s standard operating procedures is mandatory in order to ensure that our operations are compliant with the rules set forth by the applicable state and local laws, regulations, ordinances, licenses and other requirements.
Products
We derive our revenues from our wholesale business and our retail dispensary chains. The retail business includes the design, build-out and operation of branded dispensaries in both medical and adult-use markets. Our primary retail presence is traditional brick and mortar. However, as regulations allow, we expect to continue to expand our e-commerce, in-store guest pick-up and direct to consumer delivery capabilities as part of our commitment to providing a consistent retail brand experience no matter where the consumer might be.
We distribute our portfolio of products to the majority of cannabis retail stores in our active markets, including our own retail stores. Ownership of both wholesale and retail operations supports our strategy of distributing our brands at scale by enabling the Company to capture market share, generate brand awareness, and earn customer loyalty in our operating markets not only through our managed dispensaries but also through third party wholesale customers.
We manufacture and sell a comprehensive array of cannabis products that we design and develop with consumer segments in mind in both the medical and adult-use markets. Our products include a proprietary portfolio of over 1,000 product stock keeping units (SKUs) and include flower, concentrates for dabbing and vaporizing, edibles, and topicals. Our consumer brands include Encore™, Avexia™, MÜV™, Savvy™, BITS™ and Verano™. Our retail dispensaries operate under brands including Zen Leaf™ and MÜV™.
Table of Contents

All products sold are subject to third-party testing required by applicable state law in order to assure that they do not contain impermissible levels of toxins, microbials and other harmful substances. We utilize seed-to-sale tracking software to inventory products, assess quality assurance and minimize product slippage and deviated inventory.
Operational Foundation & Current Geographic Markets
We are engaged in the cultivation, processing and distribution of cannabis products with both wholesale and retail business operations. Processing is done on-site in kitchens and in processing facilities and distribution of products is only from these facilities. We do not own or lease any warehouses to store cannabis.
Our current active operations are located in Arizona, Arkansas, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Our active operations include cultivation, processing, wholesale distribution and retail. In California, we are part of a joint venture formed with two other companies to process, manufacture and distribute cannabis products. All of these markets are subject to state regulations that vary state-by-state, and many of these regulations have, from time to time, been modified and amended. In addition, municipalities may individually determine what local permits or licenses are required to operate within their boundaries. We actively monitor state and local developments in laws and regulations which may impact our business interests and operations. See “—Regulatory Framework in the United States— Regulation of Cannabis at the U.S. State and Local Levels” above for additional information.
NATIONAL FOOTPRINT
Our business plan includes the continued growth of our wholesale and retail operations by entering new markets and expansion in our current markets. Growth plans include applying for new licenses, acquiring existing licensed businesses in limited license markets and maximizing operations under our existing licenses.

Research and Development
Our research and development activities have primarily focused on the development and improvement of efficient and sustainable cannabis cultivation and manufacturing methodologies and technologies to increase yields and maintain and improve the quality of our products. This includes research on lighting methods, air controls, racking and stacking, growing media, nutrient mixtures, pest management techniques, ambient controls, and automation.
We also engage in research and development activities focused on creating new extracted or infused products, and breeds of new cannabis strains and varietals. Our product development team includes members from all relevant product disciplines, who actively monitor existing and prospective markets, as well as test and evaluate the financial viability of all new proposed products.
Intellectual Property
We believe that brand awareness is an important part of our business strategy. We regularly seek to protect our intellectual property rights in connection with our operating names, our consumer packaged goods and certain goods and services. The U.S. trademark statute, The Lanham Act, allows for the protection of trademarks and service marks on products and services used, or intended for use, lawfully. Because cannabis-related products and services remain illegal at the U.S. federal level under the Controlled Substances Act, we are not able to protect all our intellectual property at the U.S. federal level; therefore, we currently seek trademark protections at the state level where commercially feasible. Nonetheless, our success depends upon other areas of our business such as brand awareness, product development and design, production and marketing and not exclusively upon trademarks, patents and trade secrets.
The Company, through our subsidiaries and affiliates, has a suite of 124 trademarks registered or pending registration with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or other state and non-U.S. governmental entities, including trademarks with respect to products and retail branding. Product trademarks include Encore™, Avexia™, MÜV™, Savvy™, BITS™ and Verano™, and trademark dispensary brands include Zen Leaf™ and MÜV™. We anticipate feedback on outstanding submitted applications on a rolling basis. As such, we will continue to rely on common law protection for these brands during the trademark registration process. We plan to renew our trademarks as they come up for renewal and we plan to proactively seek intellectual property protection for brand expansions in current markets as well as any new market expansion.
From the time our subsidiaries became licensed to cultivate cannabis, we have developed proprietary cultivation techniques for operating ethanol, butane, and carbon dioxide extraction machinery, including what we believe are best production practices, procedures, and methods. This requires specialized skills in cultivation, extraction and refining. Six patents and patent applications are held by our subsidiaries and affiliates for cannabinoid formulations related to transdermal and oral delivery. For additional details, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors- Risks Related to Our Business and Operations - Information Technology, Cybersecurity and Intellectual Property.”
During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, the Company entered into a trademark license agreement with TYSON 2.0, pursuant to which Tyson licensed intellectual property rights to the Company to allow the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates to produce Tyson-branded cannabis products in exchange for a licensing fee.
We have several website domains, including www.verano.com, numerous social media accounts across all major platforms and various phone and web application platforms.
We rely on non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. To the extent the Company describes or discloses its proprietary cultivation or extraction techniques in its applications for cultivation or processing licenses, the Company’s policy is to redact or request redactions of such information prior to public disclosure. For additional details on the risks associated with the Company’s intellectual property, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors- Risks Related to Our Business and Operations - Information Technology, Cybersecurity and Intellectual Property.”

Competitive Conditions
The fast-growing market for legalized cannabis in the U.S. has created a competitive environment for cannabis producers as well as other types of companies who provide goods and services to the cannabis industry. We compete with a variety of different operators across the several states in which we currently operate. In many of these states, there are specific license caps that create high barriers to entry. Management of the Company views multi-state operators that have vertical operations as our most direct competition, including the following U.S. based public reporting companies: Green Thumb Industries Inc., Cresco Labs, Inc., Curaleaf Holdings, Inc., and Trulieve Cannabis Corp.
Aside from existing direct competition in states in which we currently operate, out-of-state operators that are capitalized well enough to enter state markets through acquisitions are also considered part of the competitive landscape. Similarly, as we pursue our national footprint growth strategy, operators in our target markets will inevitably become direct competitors. Additionally, we, along with all legally operating competitors, face competition from the illicit markets. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors- Risks Related to our Business and Operations – The Cannabis Industry.” However, as state and local regulators increase scrutiny on these illicit markets, management of the Company believes this competitive threat will be meaningfully reduced.
There remains a significant lack of traditional sources of bank lending and equity capital available to fund the operations of companies in the cannabis sector. Financing for companies in the cannabis sector is more difficult than other sectors, particularly in the U.S., due to the fact that cannabis is still classified as a Schedule I drug under the Controlled Substance Act and illegal at a federal level, which creates barriers to entry. The dynamics of the changing regulatory environment at a state level further complicate financing for companies in the cannabis sector. Competitors may have better access than we do to financing sources and the capital markets.
Marketing and Sales
As of March 28, 2023, through our subsidiaries and affiliates we are licensed to conduct business in 14 states and actively operate businesses in 13 states, including 125 retail dispensaries and 14 production facilities with over 1,000,000 square feet of cultivation. Our sales revenue is derived from our wholesale business and our national chain of retail dispensaries operating under our brands, including Zen Leaf™ and MÜV™.
For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 27.7% of our consolidated sales were generated by our wholesale operations and approximately 72.3% of our consolidated sales were generated by our retail dispensary operations. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, medical-use sales and adult-use sales contributed approximately 60% and 40% of our consolidated revenues, respectively.
For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 22% of our consolidated sales were generated in Illinois where 79% of our consolidated sales were in adult-use products. Approximately 25% of our consolidated sales were generated by our Florida operations, where all sales are medical products and generated by our retail stores given the vertical integration requirements of Florida’s cannabis regulations. Verano is not dependent upon any single customer, or a few customers and the loss of any single customer or a few customers would not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial results.
Some of the states in which we operate have regulations that restrict marketing and sales activities of cannabis products. Restrictions may specify what, where and to whom cannabis product information and descriptions may appear or be advertised. Marketing, advertising, packaging and labeling regulations for cannabis products also vary from state to state, potentially limiting the consistency and scale of consumer branding communications and product education efforts. We strive to deploy a diverse range of marketing and brand recognition strategies that comply with applicable local and state laws and regulations.
In medical cannabis markets we seek to educate patients and potential patients about our products and medical dispensaries through certifying physicians, community outreach events and on-going staff training and education. For adult-use markets, we seek to educate customers and potential customers about our products and retail dispensaries through community outreach events and on-going staff training and education. In Florida we operate a patient care call center with more than 30 staff for direct phone, email and online chat support.

Market data for medical and adult-use cannabis is limited and unreliable due to ongoing regulatory changes and unreliable market information on supply levels.  Market data for more established markets expanding into adult-use of cannabis are generally more reliable than market data for medical cannabis in states launching their initial programs. We rely largely on our own market research to forecast sales based upon historical sales, demographics, regulatory changes, demand, competition and similar consumer driven research. 
Cultivation and Production
The cultivation and production of cannabis products requires licensing and permitting by each state where operations are conducted. As of March 28, 2023, we actively operate 14 production facilities with over 1,000,000 square feet of cultivation capacity.
Each manufacturing suite is built to ISO 8 clean room specifications and employs advanced nutritional and pharmaceutical formulations technology for the most optimal delivery methods. Our cultivation grows pesticide-free to meet testing, inventory and other applicable state regulatory requirements. We have implemented and adhere to standard operating procedures across all of our cultivation and manufacturing facilities.
Although cannabis is an agricultural product, our cultivation methodologies employ a perpetual harvest system whereby plants are propagated and harvested on a staggered schedule. This ensures limited variability in the availability of finished products and minimizes the otherwise cyclical or seasonal nature of the plant-based business.
Components
The principal components in the production of our consumer packaged products include cannabis grown internally or acquired through wholesale channels, other agricultural products, and packaging materials (including glass, plastic and cardboard) acquired through wholesale channels. Almost all raw material input, except packaging materials, used to produce our cannabis consumer packaged goods are cultivated or processed internally for further use in the manufacturing process.
Due to the U.S. federal prohibition on cannabis, we must source cannabis within each individual state in which we operate. While there are opportunities for centralized sourcing of some packaging materials, given each state’s unique regulatory requirements, we believe multi-state operators currently do not have access to nationwide packaging solutions.
Environmental
Similar to traditional agricultural practices, the cultivation and processing of cannabis can impact the environment through waste, energy use, air pollutants, agriculture water runoff and soil degradation, with the extent of these environmental impacts being contingent on the methods of cultivation and production employed. The cannabis industry has been in its early stages and as the cannabis industry continues to mature and expand in connection with increasing legalization, we believe the industry will develop industry-wise business practices that include comprehensive environmental sustainability in accordance with emerging state regulatory requirements. The establishment of cooperative policies and standards across local, state, regional, and national levels for both cannabis and hemp markets will be pivotal to advancing environmental sustainability across the cannabis industry.
Organic plant waste and single-use consumer packaging make up a significant portion of the waste generated from the industrial-scale cultivation and processing of cannabis. In many states, cannabis waste must be rendered “unusable” and “unrecognizable” before it is then required to be mixed with non-cannabis waste to achieve a ratio of 50% cannabis waste and 50% non-cannabis waste. While many states offer various alternatives that may be mixed with cannabis waste, cultivation sites may be unable to provide sufficient volumes of non-cannabis waste to reach the necessary ratio without adding superfluous waste or having to haul in additional waste to augment.

Cannabis is an energy-intensive crop, especially when cultivated indoor. Energy is needed for lighting, environmental controls, and hydration at indoor cultivation operations. Access to energy infrastructure (power grids) can be a challenge that can cause a temporary reliance on generators that run on fossil fuels that impact air quality. Indoor cultivation is our primary method of cultivating cannabis due to the market demand for consistent, high-quality cannabis products year-round, regardless of adverse weather and fluctuating daylight. According to the National Cannabis Industry Association, as of October 2020, an estimated 63% of commercial cannabis cultivation has been conducted indoors with another 20% conducted in partial indoor operations, such as greenhouses. In 2021 and currently, almost all of the Company’s cultivation is indoor. We expect to conduct substantially all cultivation and production in indoor facilities.
In addition to generated electricity, the cultivation and processing of cannabis and the transportation of cannabis products all contribute to air emissions. Cannabis, like many other crops, often relies upon water supplied through artificial irrigation. Agricultural runoff from cannabis cultivation can contain wastewater pollutants, which can have an impact on the environment. Soil erosion, nutrient loss, reduction in organic carbon stored within the soil, and increased acidity are all linked to traditional agriculture practices, although such environmental impacts are more prevalent in outdoor cultivation.
We believe that cannabis businesses that incorporate environmentally sustainable practices must start with a comprehensive plan for cultivation and production that enables operators to consider the short, medium, and long-term impacts of their operations. Such a plan must have timelines for implementation, objective metrics to gauge progress, standards to monitor compliance and periodic evaluation of the plan itself.
We are in the process of evaluating our operations in order to structure a comprehensive cultivation plan that considers the short, medium, and long-term environmental impacts of the Company’s operations, and in doing so we have identified emerging agricultural practices that promote environmental sustainability that could be applied to the cannabis industry. An early-stage practice for managing plant waste involves on-site anaerobic digestion that uses the plant waste to generate and capture methane, carbon dioxide, and nutrient-rich fertilizer which provides diversion from landfills and the reuse of plant waste. Cultivation and retail cannabis facilities could collaborate on establishing practices that promote and integrate reusable and refillable containers for their products, instead of disposable single-use packaging designs. Through proactive planning and the leveraging of business networks, the cannabis industry could collaboratively pursue more energy-efficient practices. Implementing LED lighting and more efficient HVAC systems helps reduce energy use in indoor grow facilities. Optimizing space utilization and scheduling the use of high energy equipment around peak demand can also reduce the energy impacts of the cannabis industry. Existing emission control technologies have the potential to be broadly applied across the cannabis industry to mitigate adverse air quality impacts. Industry best practices could focus on minimizing water usage and agriculture runoff as well as eliminating adverse impacts to water quality from any discharges back into the environment.
Federal legalization of cannabis would open access to federal programs, such as the U.S. Department of Agriculture for financial and technical assistance, the Small Business Administration for loan assistance, the Environmental Protection Agency for grants, technical assistance, education, research, and traditional funding through nationally recognized financial institutions. Federal legalization also can advance the industry while protecting consumers and the environment with a national regulatory structure that considers environmental sustainability.
We believe we are compliant with all applicable environmental regulations and laws and properly dispose of toxic and hazardous substances used in the Company’s operations. Expenditures for compliance with environmental laws and regulations historically have not been material to the Company’s financial results, but could become an increasing expense for the Company as we develop and implement a comprehensive plan for environmentally sustainable practices and if enhanced environmental laws and regulations are enacted for the cannabis industry.
Employees and Human Capital
The Company recruits, hires and promotes individuals that it believes are best qualified for each position, priding itself on using a selection process that recruits people who are trainable, cooperative and share our core values as a company. As of March 28, 2023, the Company had approximately 3,780 employees across its consolidated operating jurisdictions, including corporate, retail, cultivation and processing, both full- and part-time employees, and including but not limited to: finance and accounting, legal, human resources, regulatory and compliance, supply chain and operations, sales and marketing, commercial and cannabis agriculture, chemists, customer service, construction and project management, and real estate.

We have established training and education tools designed to align employee training efforts and resources with our core principles and strategic goals. Employees are expected to complete continued training and education annually. Our training tools are designed to be flexible to include new policies and procedures, and can be revised as necessary based on new or ongoing operational concerns, management observations, regulatory changes and new or improved practices. Our employees undergo significant and diverse training, tailored to each employee based on their function and business-lines. Training includes but is not limited to the following topics: (i) applicable laws, rules, and regulations; (ii) propagation, cloning, and nursery management; (iii) transplanting and vegetative growth; (iv) fertigation and nutrient management; (v) irrigation and water conservation; (vi) integrated pest management and biosecurity; (vii) flower canopy management; (viii) harvesting; (ix) drying and curing; (x) waste and disposal procedures; (xi) trimming and packaging preparation; (xii) sampling, laboratory testing, and quality assurance; (xiii) extraction, infusion, and food handling; (xiv) surveillance and security; (xv) inventory control; (xvi) emergency preparedness and response; (xvii) diversion control and prevention; (xviii) health, safety, sanitation and hygiene; (xix) recordkeeping and reporting: (xx) recall and quarantine procedures; (xxi) regulatory inspection preparedness; and (xxii) law enforcement interactions.
Social Equity
We believe that a more diverse and community focused cannabis industry leads to a more sustainable, inclusive and responsible one. We aim to foster a more equitable industry where participation and success are possible regardless of the numerous factors that have historically held many people, businesses, and communities back. To support the growth of an inclusive cannabis industry, we are implementing social equity initiatives at the national level and in states and municipalities in which we operate. The social equity programs are generally designed to develop and carry out initiatives that seek to provide support and create opportunities in the cannabis industry for deprived communities, people of color and other disadvantaged minorities. In each state of operation, we seek to partner with local organizations to provide education, entrance into the cannabis industry, or other growth opportunities to both our employees and the community. To date, we have partnered with Legal Aid Chicago to host a virtual expungement and record sealing clinic to provide relief for those with nonviolent cannabis offenses. Throughout 2022, we also orchestrated an effort across all 13 states we actively operate in to generate awareness and funds benefiting Mission Green, an organization that provides clemency, expungement and pardon support and advocacy for nonviolent individuals convicted of cannabis-related crimes, which yielded more than $140,000 in proceeds. In Florida, we provide medical cannabis education through certifying physicians, community outreach events and ongoing staff education, all of which are supported by a patient care call center with dozens of staff members for direct phone, email and online chat support. At the state and local level, we have focused on the region to create volunteer opportunities for employees and donate to charitable organizations, including matching employee donations.
Nationally, Verano has made major charitable contributions to the Lynn Sage Breast Cancer Foundation, provided endowments for first generation college students, and hosted employee volunteer days. We plan to continue and expand these partnerships and events at the national, state and local levels to increase social equity in the cannabis industry.
Many states and cities have implemented social equity programs in connection with the legalization of medical or adult-use cannabis. These programs attempt to ensure that people of color, other disadvantaged minorities and those with marijuana offenses prior to legalization, be afforded an opportunity to participate in a meaningful way in the cannabis industry. As new medical and adult-use legislation is passed, multi-state operators such as the Company may be prevented, limited or discouraged from obtaining new licenses, renewing licenses or from participating in new markets or existing markets.

Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company
The Company qualifies as an “Emerging Growth Company” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, as amended (the “JOBS Act”). As an Emerging Growth Company, the Company may take advantage of specified reduced disclosure and other exemptions from requirements that are otherwise applicable to public companies that are not Emerging Growth Companies. These provisions include:

● | Reduced disclosure about the Company’s executive compensation arrangements; 
● | Exemption from new or revised financial accounting standards applicable to public companies until such standards are also applicable to private companies;
● | Exemptions from non-binding shareholder advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements; and 
● | Exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. 

The Company may take advantage of these exemptions until the Company no longer qualifies as an Emerging Growth Company. The Company has elected not to use the extended transition period for adopting new or revised financial accounting standards and, as a result, we will comply with new or revised financial accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for other public companies that are not Emerging Growth Companies.
The Company would cease to be an Emerging Growth Company on the first to occur of the following: (i) if the Company has more than $1.07 billion in annual revenues as of the end of a fiscal year, (ii) if the Company is deemed to be a “large accelerated filer” under the rules of the SEC, (iii) if the Company issues more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period, and (iv) five years after an offering to the public of the Company’s equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act. We would be deemed to be a “large accelerated filer” if the following three conditions are met: (a) the market value of the Subordinate Voting Shares held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of the Company’s most recently completed second fiscal quarter, (b) we were subject to Exchange Act reporting requirements for at least 12 calendar months and (c) we filed at least one annual report on Form 10-K with the SEC.
