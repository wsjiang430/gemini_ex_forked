Item 1. BUSINESS.
General
 Virginia National Bankshares Corporation (the “Company”) was incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia on February 21, 2013 at the direction of the Board of Directors of Virginia National Bank (the “Bank”) for the purpose of acquiring all of the outstanding shares of the Bank and becoming the holding company of the Bank. On June 19, 2013, the shareholders of the Bank approved the Reorganization Agreement and Plan of Share Exchange, dated March 6, 2013, whereby the Bank would reorganize into a holding company structure (the “Reorganization”).
 On December 16, 2013, when the Reorganization became effective, the Bank became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and each share of the Bank’s common stock was exchanged for one share of the Company’s common stock. The Company is regulated under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (“BHC Act”), and is subject to inspection, examination and supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve Board” or “Federal Reserve”). The Company is also under the jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and is subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the “Exchange Act”) as administered by the SEC. Virginia National Bankshares Corporation is headquartered at 404 People Place, Charlottesville, Virginia.
 Virginia National Bank, the principal operating subsidiary of the Company, was organized in 1998 under federal law as a national banking association to engage in a general commercial and retail banking business. The Bank received its charter from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the “OCC”) and commenced operations on July 29, 1998. The Bank is headquartered in Charlottesville, Virginia. The Bank’s deposits are insured up to the maximum amount provided by the Federal Deposit Insurance Act by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”). Prior to July, 2018, the Bank had one wholly owned subsidiary, VNBTrust, National Association (“VNBTrust”), a national trust bank formed in 2007. Effective July 1, 2018, VNBTrust was merged into Virginia National Bank, and the Bank continues to offer investment management, wealth advisory and trust and estate administration services under the name of VNB Wealth Management, also referred to herein as “VNB Wealth”. The Bank is subject to the supervision, examination and regulations of the OCC.
 During 2018, the Company changed the structure of its VNB Wealth lines of business. The Company formed Masonry Capital Management, LLC (“Masonry Capital”), a registered investment adviser, to offer investment advisory and management services to clients through separately managed accounts and through one or more private investment fund(s). The Company believes the formation of Masonry Capital will allow the Company to offer its investment strategy to a wider range of clients.
 References to the Company’s subsidiaries in this document include both the Bank and Masonry Capital Management, LLC.
 As of December 31, 2018, the Company and its subsidiaries occupied five full-service banking facilities in the cities of Charlottesville and Winchester and the County of Albemarle, Virginia, as well as a drive-through facility with additional office space in Charlottesville. Refer to Item 2. Properties for additional information regarding locations.
 The multi-story office building at 404 People Place, Charlottesville, Virginia, also serves as the Company’s corporate headquarters and operations center, as well as the headquarters for Masonry Capital. Additionally, the Company has a loan production office in Harrisonburg, Virginia.
 Products and Services
 The Bank offers a full range of banking and related financial services, including checking accounts, NOW accounts, money market deposit accounts, certificates of deposit, individual retirement accounts, Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service (CDARS™), Insured Cash Sweep® (ICS®) and other depository services. The Bank actively solicits such accounts from individuals, businesses and charitable organizations within its trade area. Other services offered by the Bank include automated teller machines (“ATMs”), internet banking, treasury and cash management services and merchant card services. In addition, the Bank is affiliated with Visa®, which is accepted worldwide and offers debit cards to consumer and business customers.

The Bank also offers short to long term commercial, real estate and consumer loans. The Bank is committed to being a reliable and consistent source of credit, providing loans that are priced based upon an overall banking relationship, easy access to the Bank’s local decision makers who possess strong local market knowledge, local delivery, fast response, and continuity in the banking relationship. The Bank originates residential mortgage loans and sells on the secondary market those loans which the Bank does not wish to retain for its own loan portfolio due to the interest rate risks that are inherent with long-term fixed rate loans.
 Investment management, wealth advisory and trust and estate administration services are offered through VNB Wealth. Investment management services are also offered through Masonry Capital. The flagship product for managed accounts employs a value-based, catalyst-driven investment strategy. The financial instruments used include common and preferred stock, corporate bonds, bank loans and other debt securities, convertible securities, Exchange Traded Funds (“EFTs”), options, warrants and cash equivalents. More information on VNB Wealth Management is available at www.vnbwealth.com and on Masonry Capital is available at www.mansonrycap.com.
 Investment advisory, brokerage, annuity and insurance services and products are offered under the name of VNB Investment Services pursuant to networking agreements with a registered broker/dealer and a registered investment adviser to provide services through representatives who are also employees of the Company.
 The Bank primarily serves the Virginia communities in and around the City of Charlottesville, Albemarle County and the City of Winchester. The Bank also has a loan production office in Harrisonburg, Virginia. The Bank’s office locations are well-positioned in attractive markets. Within its market area, there are various types of industry including higher education, medical and professional services, research and development companies and retail. The Bank closed its Orange, Virginia office effective April 13, 2018; expanded messenger service continues to be available to the customers within and surrounding Orange, Virginia.
 Competition
 The Company engages in highly competitive activities. Each activity involves competition with other banks, as well as with non-banking enterprises that offer financial products and services that compete directly with the Company’s product and service offerings. The Company actively competes with other banks in its efforts to obtain deposits and make loans, in the scope and types of services offered, in interest rates paid on time deposits and charged on loans, and in other aspects of banking.
 In addition to competing with other commercial banks within and outside its primary service areas, the Company competes with other financial institutions engaged in the business of making loans or accepting deposits, such as credit unions, insurance companies, small loan companies, finance companies, mortgage companies, certain governmental agencies and other enterprises. Competition for money market accounts with securities brokers and mutual funds is strong. Additional competition for deposits comes from government and private issuers of debt obligations and other investment alternatives for depositors such as money market funds.
 The market areas served by the Company are highly competitive with respect to banking. Competition for loans to businesses and professionals is intense, and pricing is important. Many of the Company’s competitors have substantially greater resources and lending limits than the Company and offer certain services such as extensive and established branch networks that the Company does not expect to match. Deposit competition is also very strong. Management believes, however, that a market exists for the personal and customized financial services an independent, community bank can offer.
 Supervision and Regulation
 The Company and the Bank are extensively regulated under both federal and state laws. The following description briefly addresses certain historic and current provisions of federal and state laws and certain regulations, proposed regulations and the potential impacts on the Company and the Bank. To the extent statutory or regulatory provisions or proposals are described in this report, the description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statutory or regulatory provisions or proposals.
The Company
 General. As a bank holding company registered under the BHC Act, the Company is subject to supervision, regulation, and examination by the Federal Reserve. The Company is also registered under the bank holding company laws of Virginia and is subject to supervision, regulation, and examination by the Virginia State Corporation Commission (the “SCC”).
 5


Permitted Activities. The permitted activities of a bank holding company are limited to managing or controlling banks, furnishing services to or performing services for its subsidiaries, and engaging in other activities that the Federal Reserve determines by regulation or order to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. In determining whether a particular activity is permissible, the Federal Reserve must consider whether the performance of such an activity reasonably can be expected to produce benefits to the public that outweigh possible adverse effects. Possible benefits include greater convenience, increased competition, and gains in efficiency. Possible adverse effects include undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest, and unsound banking practices. Despite prior approval, the Federal Reserve may order a bank holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any activity or to terminate ownership or control of any subsidiary when the Federal Reserve has reasonable cause to believe that a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of any bank subsidiary of that bank holding company may result from such an activity.
 Banking Acquisitions; Changes in Control. The BHC Act and related regulations require, among other things, the prior approval of the Federal Reserve in any case where a bank holding company proposes to (i) acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the outstanding voting stock of any bank or bank holding company (unless it already owns a majority of such voting shares), (ii) acquire all or substantially all of the assets of another bank or bank holding company, or (iii) merge or consolidate with any other bank holding company. In determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition, the Federal Reserve will consider, among other factors, the following: the effect of the acquisition on competition; the public benefits expected to be received from the acquisition; any outstanding regulatory compliance issues of any institution that is a party to the transaction; the projected capital ratios and levels on a post-acquisition basis; the financial condition of each institution that is a party to the transaction and of the combined institution after the transaction; the parties’ managerial resources, as well as risk management and governance processes and systems; the parties’ compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering requirements; and the acquiring institution’s performance under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 and its compliance with fair housing and other consumer protection laws.
 Subject to certain exceptions, the BHC Act and the Change in Bank Control Act, together with applicable regulations, require Federal Reserve approval (or, depending on the circumstances, no notice of disapproval) prior to any person or company’s acquiring “control” of a bank or bank holding company. A conclusive presumption of control exists if an individual or company acquires the power, directly or indirectly, to direct the management or policies of an insured depository institution or to vote 25% or more of any class of voting securities of any insured depository institution. A rebuttable presumption of control exists if a person or company acquires 10% or more but less than 25% of any class of voting securities of an insured depository institution and either (i) the institution has registered its securities with the SEC under Section 12 of the Exchange Act or (ii) no other person will own a greater percentage of that class of voting securities immediately after the acquisition. The Company’s common stock is registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act.
 In addition, Virginia law requires the prior approval of the SCC for (i) the acquisition by a Virginia bank holding company of more than 5% of the voting shares of a Virginia bank or a Virginia bank holding company, or (ii) the acquisition by any other person of control of a Virginia bank holding company or a Virginia bank.
 Source of Strength. Federal Reserve policy has historically required bank holding companies to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to their subsidiary banks. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”) codified this policy as a statutory requirement. Under this requirement, the Company is expected to commit resources to support the Bank, including at times when the Company may not be in a financial position to provide such resources. Any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to depositors and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary banks. In the event of a bank holding company’s bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment.
 Safety and Soundness. There are a number of obligations and restrictions imposed on bank holding companies and their subsidiary banks by law and regulatory policy that are designed to minimize potential loss to the depositors of such depository institutions and the FDIC insurance fund in the event of a depository institution insolvency, receivership, or default. For example, under the Federal Deposit Insurance Company Improvement Act of 1991, to avoid receivership of an insured depository institution subsidiary, a bank holding company is required to guarantee the compliance of any subsidiary bank that may become “undercapitalized” with the terms of any capital restoration plan filed by such subsidiary with its appropriate federal bank regulatory agency up to the lesser of (i) an amount equal to 5% of the institution’s total assets at the time the institution became undercapitalized, or (ii) the amount that is necessary (or would have been necessary) to bring the institution into compliance with all applicable capital standards as of the time the institution fails to comply with such capital restoration plan.

Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (“FDIA”), the federal bank regulatory agencies have adopted guidelines prescribing safety and soundness standards. These guidelines establish general standards relating to capital management, internal controls and information systems, internal audit systems, information systems, data security, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure and risk management, vendor management, corporate governance, and asset growth, as well as compensation, fees, and benefits. In general, the guidelines require, among other things, appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risk and exposures specified in the guidelines.
 Capital Requirements. The Federal Reserve imposes certain capital requirements on bank holding companies under the BHC Act, including a minimum leverage ratio and a minimum ratio of “qualifying” capital to risk-weighted assets. These requirements are described below under “The Bank – Capital Requirements.” Subject to its capital requirements and certain other restrictions, the Company is able to borrow money to make a capital contribution to the Bank, and such loans may be repaid from dividends paid by the Bank to the Company.
 Limits on Dividends and Other Payments. The Company is a legal entity, separate and distinct from its subsidiaries. A significant portion of the revenues of the Company result from dividends paid to it by the Bank. There are various legal limitations applicable to the payment of dividends by the Bank to the Company and to the payment of dividends by the Company to its shareholders. The Bank is subject to various statutory and regulatory restrictions on its ability to pay dividends to the Company. The OCC has advised that a national bank should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings. Under current regulations, prior regulatory approval is required if cash dividends declared by the Bank in any given year exceed net income for that year, plus retained net profits of the two preceding years. The payment of dividends by the Bank or the Company may be limited by other factors, such as requirements to maintain capital above regulatory guidelines. Bank regulatory agencies have the authority to prohibit the Bank or the Company from engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting its respective business. The payment of dividends, depending on the financial condition of the Bank or the Company, could be deemed to constitute such an unsafe or unsound practice.
 Under the FDIA, insured depository institutions, such as the Bank, are prohibited from making capital distributions, including the payment of dividends, if, after making such distributions, the institution would become “undercapitalized” (as such term is used in the statute). Based on the Bank’s current financial condition, the Company does not expect that this provision will have any impact on its ability to receive dividends from the Bank.
 The Bank
 General. The Bank is supervised and regularly examined by the OCC. The various laws and regulations administered by the OCC and the other bank regulatory agencies affect corporate practices, such as the payment of dividends, incurrence of debt, and acquisition of financial institutions and other companies; they also affect business practices, such as the payment of interest on deposits, the charging of interest on loans, types of business conducted and location of offices. Certain of these laws and regulations are referenced above under “The Company.”
 Capital Requirements. The OCC and the other federal bank regulatory agencies have issued risk-based and leverage capital guidelines applicable to U.S. banking organizations. Those regulatory agencies may from time to time require that a banking organization maintain capital above the minimum levels because of its financial condition or actual or anticipated growth.
 The federal banking agencies have adopted final rules regarding capital requirements and calculations of risk-weighted assets to implement the Basel III regulatory capital reforms from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the “Basel Committee”) and certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act (the “Basel III Capital Rules”).
 7


The Basel III Capital Rules require banks and bank holding companies to comply with the following minimum capital ratios: (i) a ratio of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, plus a 2.5% “capital conservation buffer” (effectively resulting in a minimum ratio of common equity Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7%); (ii) a ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0%, plus the 2.5% capital conservation buffer (effectively resulting in a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%); (iii) a ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0%, plus the 2.5% capital conservation buffer (effectively resulting in a minimum total capital ratio of 10.5%); and (iv) a leverage ratio of 4%, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to balance sheet exposures plus certain off-balance sheet exposures (computed as the average for each quarter of the month-end ratios for the quarter). The phase-in of the capital conservation buffer requirement began on January 1, 2016, at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets, increasing by the same amount each year until it was fully implemented at 2.5% on January 1, 2019. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking organizations with a ratio of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the conservation buffer face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases, and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall.
 The Tier 1, common equity Tier 1, total capital to risk-weighted assets, and leverage ratios of the Company were 13.58%, 13.58%, 14.52% and 11.14%, respectively, as of December 31, 2018, thus exceeding the minimum requirements. The Tier 1, common equity Tier 1, total capital to risk-weighted assets, and leverage ratios of the Bank were 13.47%, 13.47%, 14.41% and 11.05%, respectively, as of December 31, 2018, also exceeding the minimum requirements.
 With respect to the Bank, the “prompt corrective action” regulations pursuant to Section 38 of the FDIA were revised, effective as of January 1, 2015, to incorporate a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio and to increase certain other capital ratios. To be “well capitalized” under the revised regulations, a bank must have the following minimum capital ratios: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of at least 8.0%; (iii) a total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of at least 10.0%; and (iv) a leverage ratio of at least 5.0%. The Bank exceeds the thresholds to be considered well capitalized as of December 31, 2018.
 The Basel III Capital Rules also changed the risk weights of assets to better reflect credit risk and other risk exposures. These include a 150% risk weight for certain high volatility commercial real estate acquisition, development and construction loans and nonresidential mortgage loans that are 90 days past due or otherwise on nonaccrual status, a 20% credit conversion factor for the unused portion of a commitment with an original maturity of one year or less that is not unconditionally cancelable, a 250% risk weight for mortgage servicing rights and deferred tax assets that are not deducted from capital, and increased risk-weights for equity exposures.
 In December 2017, the Basel Committee published standards that it described as the finalization of the Basel III post-crisis regulatory reforms (the standards are commonly referred to as “Basel IV”). Among other things, these standards revise the Basel Committee’s standardized approach for credit risk (including by recalibrating risk weights and introducing new capital requirements for certain “unconditionally cancellable commitments,” such as unused credit card lines of credit) and provide a new standardized approach for operational risk capital. Under the proposed framework, these standards will generally be effective on January 1, 2022, with an aggregate output floor phasing-in through January 1, 2027. Under the current capital rules, operational risk capital requirements and a capital floor apply only to advanced approaches institutions, and not to the Company. The impact of Basel IV on the Company and the Bank will depend on the manner in which it is implemented by the federal bank regulatory agencies.
 On August 28, 2018, the Federal Reserve issued an interim final rule required by the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act of 2018, which was signed into law on May 24, 2018 (the “EGRRCPA”), that expands the applicability of the Federal Reserve’s small bank holding company policy statement (the “SBHC Policy Statement”) to bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of less than $3 billion (up from the prior $1 billion threshold). Under the SBHC Policy Statement, qualifying bank holding companies have additional flexibility in the amount of debt they can issue and are also exempt from the Basel III Capital Rules (subsidiary depository institutions of qualifying bank holding companies are still subject to capital requirements). The Company currently has less than $3 billion in total consolidated assets and would likely qualify under the revised SBHC Policy Statement. However, the Company does not currently intend to issue a material amount of debt or take any other action that would cause its capital ratios to fall below the minimum ratios required by the Basel III Capital Rules.
 8


On November 21, 2018, the federal banking agencies jointly issued a proposed rule required by the EGRRCPA that would permit qualifying banks and bank holding companies that have less than $10 billion in consolidated assets to elect to be subject to a 9% leverage ratio that would be applied using less complex leverage calculations (commonly referred to as the community bank leverage ratio or “CBLR”). Under the proposed rule, banks and bank holding companies that opt into the CBLR framework and maintain a CBLR of greater than 9% would not be subject to other risk-based and leverage capital requirements under the Basel III Capital Rules and would be deemed to have met the well capitalized ratio requirements under the “prompt corrective action” framework. The rule is in proposed form so the content and scope of the final rule, and its impact on the Company and the Bank (if any), cannot be determined.
 Deposit Insurance. The deposits of the Bank are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) of the FDIC and are subject to deposit insurance assessments based on average total assets minus average tangible equity to maintain the DIF.
 As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC has adopted a large-bank pricing assessment structure; set a target “designated reserve ratio” of 2 percent for the DIF, in lieu of dividends; and provided for a lower assessment rate schedule when the reserve ratio reaches 2 percent and 2.5 percent. An institution's assessment rate is based on a statistical analysis of financial ratios that estimates the likelihood of failure over a three year period, which considers the institution’s weighted average CAMELS component rating. At December 31, 2018, total base assessment rates for institutions that have been insured for at least five years range from 1.5 to 40 basis points, with rates of 1.5 to 30 basis points applying to banks with less than $10 billion in assets. In 2018 and 2017, the Company expensed $189,000 and $276,000, respectively, in deposit insurance assessments.
 The Dodd-Frank Act transferred to the FDIC increased discretion with regard to managing the required amount of reserves for the DIF, or the “designated reserve ratio.” Among other changes, the Dodd-Frank Act (i) raised the minimum designated reserve ratio to 1.35 percent and removed the upper limit on the designated reserve ratio, (ii) requires that the reserve ratio reach 1.35 percent by September 2020, and (iii) requires the FDIC to offset the effect on institutions with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion of raising the reserve ratio from 1.15 percent to 1.35 percent – which requirement was met by rules adopted by the FDIC during 2016. On June 30, 2016, the reserve ratio rose to 1.17 percent, which triggered three major changes to deposit insurance assessments beginning for the third quarter of 2016: (i) the range of initial assessment rates for all institutions declined from 5 to 35 basis points to 3 to 30 basis points (which are included in the total base assessment rates in the above paragraph); (ii) surcharges equal to an annual rate of 4.5 basis points began for insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more; and (iii) the revised assessment method described above was implemented. The FDIA requires that the FDIC consider the appropriate level for the designated reserve ratio on at least an annual basis.
 The FDIC adopted a DIF restoration plan to ensure that the fund reserve ratio reached 1.35 percent by September 30, 2020, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act. At September 30, 2018, the reserve ratio was 1.36 percent. Banks with less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets will receive credits to offset the portion of their assessments that help to raise the reserve ratio to 1.35 percent. Beginning when the reserve ratio is at or above 1.38 percent, the FDIC will automatically apply such a bank’s credits to reduce its regular DIF assessment up to the entire amount of the assessment.
 Transactions with Affiliates. Pursuant to Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation W, the authority of the Bank to engage in transactions with related parties or “affiliates” or to make loans to insiders is limited. Loan transactions with an affiliate generally must be collateralized and certain transactions between the Bank and its affiliates, including the sale of assets, the payment of money or the provision of services, must be on terms and conditions that are substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the Bank, as those prevailing for comparable nonaffiliated transactions. In addition, the Bank generally may not purchase securities issued or underwritten by affiliates.
 Loans to executive officers, directors, or to any person who directly or indirectly, or acting through or in concert with one or more persons, owns, controls, or has the power to vote more than 10% of any class of voting securities of a bank (“10% Shareholders”), are subject to Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and their corresponding regulations (Regulation O) and Section 13(k) of the Exchange Act relating to the prohibition on personal loans to executives (which exempts financial institutions in compliance with the insider lending restrictions of Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act). Among other things, these loans must be made on terms substantially the same as those prevailing on transactions made to unaffiliated individuals and certain extensions of credit to those persons must first be approved in advance by a disinterested majority of the entire Board of Directors. Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act prohibits loans to any of those individuals where the aggregate amount exceeds an amount equal to 15% of an institution’s unimpaired capital and surplus plus an additional 10% of unimpaired capital and surplus in the case of loans that are fully secured by readily marketable collateral, or when the aggregate amount on all of the extensions of credit outstanding to all of these persons would exceed the Bank’s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus. Section 22(g) of the Federal Reserve Act identifies limited circumstances in which the Bank is permitted to extend credit to executive officers.

Prompt Corrective Action. Federal banking regulators are authorized and, under certain circumstances, required to take certain actions against banks that fail to meet their capital requirements. The federal bank regulatory agencies have additional enforcement authority with respect to undercapitalized depository institutions. “Well capitalized” institutions may generally operate without additional supervisory restriction. With respect to “adequately capitalized” institutions, such banks (i) cannot normally pay dividends or make any capital contributions that would leave it undercapitalized, (ii) cannot pay a management fee to a controlling person if, after paying the fee, it would be undercapitalized, and (iii) cannot accept, renew, or roll over any brokered deposit unless the bank has applied for and been granted a waiver by the FDIC.
 Immediately upon becoming “undercapitalized,” a depository institution becomes subject to the provisions of Section 38 of the FDIA, which: (i) restrict payment of capital distributions and management fees; (ii) require that the appropriate federal banking agency monitor the condition of the institution and its efforts to restore its capital; (iii) require submission of a capital restoration plan; (iv) restrict the growth of the institution’s assets; and (v) require prior approval of certain expansion proposals. The appropriate federal banking agency for an undercapitalized institution also may take any number of discretionary supervisory actions if the agency determines that any of these actions is necessary to resolve the problems of the institution at the least possible long-term cost to the DIF, subject in certain cases to specified procedures. These discretionary supervisory actions include: (a) requiring the institution to raise additional capital; (b) restricting transactions with affiliates; (c) requiring divestiture of the institution or the sale of the institution to a willing purchaser; and (d) any other supervisory action that the agency deems appropriate. These and additional mandatory and permissive supervisory actions may be taken with respect to significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized institutions. The Bank met the definition of being “well capitalized” as of December 31, 2018.
 As described above in “The Bank – Capital Requirements,” the capital requirement rules issued by the OCC incorporate new requirements into the prompt corrective action framework.
 Community Reinvestment Act. The Bank is subject to the requirements of the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (“CRA”). The CRA imposes on financial institutions an affirmative and ongoing obligation to meet the credit needs of the local communities, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The CRA requires the appropriate federal banking agency, in connection with its examination of a bank, to assess the bank’s record in meeting such credit needs. In addition, in order for a bank holding company, like the Company, to commence any new activity permitted by the BHC Act, or to acquire any company engaged in any new activity permitted by the BHC Act, each insured depository institution subsidiary of the bank holding company must have received a rating of at least “satisfactory” in its most recent examination under the CRA. Under the CRA, institutions are assigned a rating of “outstanding,” “satisfactory,” “needs to improve,” or “substantial non-compliance.” The Bank received a “satisfactory” CRA rating in its most recent examination.
 Confidentiality of Customer Information. The Company and the Bank are subject to various laws and regulations that address the privacy of nonpublic personal financial information of customers. A financial institution must provide to its customers information regarding its policies and procedures with respect to the handling of customers’ personal information. Each institution must conduct an internal risk assessment of its ability to protect customer information. These privacy laws and regulations generally prohibit a financial institution from providing a customer’s personal financial information to unaffiliated parties without prior notice and approval from the customer.
 Required Disclosure of Customer Information. The Company and the Bank are also subject to various laws and regulations that attempt to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. The Bank Secrecy Act requires all financial institutions to, among other things, create a system of controls designed to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism, and also imposes recordkeeping and reporting requirements. The USA Patriot Act (i) added further regulations to facilitate information sharing among governmental entities and financial institutions for the purpose of combating terrorism and money laundering, (ii) imposed standards for verifying customer identification at account opening, and (iii) required financial institutions to establish anti-money laundering programs. The Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), which is a division of the Treasury, is responsible for helping to ensure that United States entities do not engage in transactions with “enemies” of the United States, as defined by various Executive Orders and Acts of Congress. If the Bank finds a name of an “enemy” of the United States on any transaction, account, or wire transfer that is on an OFAC list, it must freeze such account or place transferred funds into a blocked account, and report it to OFAC.

Volcker Rule. The Dodd-Frank Act prohibits insured depository institutions and their holding companies from engaging in proprietary trading except in limited circumstances, and prohibits them from owning equity interests in excess of 3% of Tier 1 capital in private equity and hedge funds (known as the “Volcker Rule”). On December 10, 2013, the federal bank regulatory agencies adopted final rules implementing the Volcker Rule. These final rules prohibit banking entities from (i) engaging in short-term proprietary trading for their own accounts and (ii) having certain ownership interests in and relationships with hedge funds or private equity funds. The final rules are intended to provide greater clarity with respect to both the extent of those primary prohibitions and of the related exemptions and exclusions. The final rules also require each regulated entity to establish an internal compliance program that is consistent with the extent to which it engages in activities covered by the Volcker Rule, which must include (for the largest entities) making regular reports about those activities to regulators. Although the final rules provide some tiering of compliance and reporting obligations based on size, the fundamental prohibitions of the Volcker Rule apply to banking entities of any size, including the Company and the Bank. The final rules were effective April 1, 2014, with full compliance being phased in over a period that ended on July 21, 2016. The final rules did not have a material impact on the Company's financial position in 2018 and 2017.
 Consumer Financial Protection. The Bank is subject to a number of other federal and state consumer protection laws that extensively govern its relationship with its customers. These laws include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Servicemembers’ Civil Relief Act, Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act, laws governing flood insurance, federal and state laws prohibiting unfair and deceptive business practices, foreclosure laws, and various regulations that implement some or all of the foregoing. These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with customers when taking deposits, making loans, collecting loans, and providing other services. If the Bank fails to comply with these laws and regulations, it may be subject to various penalties. Failure to comply with consumer protection requirements may also result in failure to obtain any required bank regulatory approval for merger or acquisition transactions the Bank may wish to pursue or being prohibited from engaging in such transactions even if approval is not required.
 The Dodd-Frank Act centralized responsibility for consumer financial protection by creating a new agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”), and giving it responsibility for implementing, examining, and enforcing compliance with federal consumer protection laws. The CFPB focuses on (i) risks to consumers and compliance with the federal consumer financial laws; (ii) the markets in which firms operate and risks to consumers posed by activities in those markets; (iii) depository institutions that offer a wide variety of consumer financial products and services; and (iv) non-depository companies that offer one or more consumer financial products or services. The CFPB is responsible for implementing, examining and enforcing compliance with federal consumer financial laws for institutions with more than $10 billion of assets. While the Bank, like all banks, is subject to federal consumer protection rules enacted by the CFPB, because the Company and the Bank have total consolidated assets of $10 billion or less, the OCC oversees the application to the Bank of most consumer protection aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act and other laws and regulations.
 The CFPB has broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer financial laws that apply to all banks, including, among other things, the authority to prohibit “unfair, deceptive, or abusive” acts and practices. Abusive acts or practices are defined as those that materially interfere with a consumer’s ability to understand a term or condition of a consumer financial product or service or take unreasonable advantage of a consumer’s (i) lack of financial savvy, (ii) inability to protect himself in the selection or use of consumer financial products or services, or (iii) reasonable reliance on a covered entity to act in the consumer’s interests. The CFPB can issue cease-and-desist orders against banks and other entities that violate consumer financial laws. The CFPB may also institute a civil action against an entity in violation of federal consumer financial law in order to impose a civil penalty or injunction. Further, regulatory positions taken by the CFPB with respect to financial institutions with more than $10 billion in assets may influence how other regulatory agencies apply the subject consumer financial protection laws and regulations.

Mortgage Banking Regulation. In connection with making mortgage loans, the Company and the Bank are subject to rules and regulations that, among other things, establish standards for loan origination, prohibit discrimination, provide for inspections and appraisals of property, require credit reports on prospective borrowers, in some cases restrict certain loan features and fix maximum interest rates and fees, require the disclosure of certain basic information to mortgagors concerning credit and settlement costs, limit payment for settlement services to the reasonable value of the services rendered, and require the maintenance and disclosure of information regarding the disposition of mortgage applications based on race, gender, geographical distribution and income level. The Company and the Bank are also subject to rules and regulations that require the collection and reporting of significant amounts of information with respect to mortgage loans and borrowers.
 The Company’s and the Bank’s mortgage origination activities are subject to Regulation Z, which implements the Truth in Lending Act. Certain provisions of Regulation Z require creditors to make a reasonable and good faith determination based on verified and documented information that a consumer applying for a mortgage loan has a reasonable ability to repay the loan according to its terms. Creditors are required to determine consumers’ ability to repay in one of two ways. The first alternative requires the creditor to consider the following eight underwriting factors when making the credit decision: (i) current or reasonably expected income or assets; (ii) current employment status; (iii) the monthly payment on the covered transaction; (iv) the monthly payment on any simultaneous loan; (v) the monthly payment for mortgage-related obligations; (vi) current debt obligations, alimony, and child support; (vii) the monthly debt-to-income ratio or residual income; and (viii) credit history. Alternatively, the creditor can originate “qualified mortgages,” which are entitled to a presumption that the creditor making the loan satisfied the ability-to-repay requirements. In general, a “qualified mortgage” is a mortgage loan without negative amortization, interest-only payments, balloon payments, or terms exceeding 30 years. In addition, to be a qualified mortgage, the points and fees paid by a consumer cannot exceed 3% of the total loan amount, and the consumer’s debt-to-income ratio (“DTI”) must be below the prescribed threshold. Qualified mortgages that are “higher-priced” (e.g. subprime loans) garner a rebuttable presumption of compliance with the ability-to-repay rules, while qualified mortgages that are not “higher-priced” (e.g. prime loans) are given a safe harbor of compliance. Small creditors, as described below, may originate qualified mortgages that are not restricted by the specific DTI threshold (however, the DTI must still be considered). Small creditors are those financial institutions that meet the following requirements: (i) have assets below $2 billion (adjustable annually by CFPB); (ii) originated no more than 500 first-lien, closed-end residential mortgages subject to the ability-to-repay requirements in the preceding calendar year; and (iii) hold the qualified mortgage loan in its portfolio after origination. The Company, as a small creditor, does comply with the “qualified mortgage rules” and the other applicable Truth in Lending requirements.
 Incentive Compensation. In 2010, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued comprehensive final guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of financial institutions do not undermine the safety and soundness of such institutions by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The Interagency Guidance on Sound Incentive Compensation Policies, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of financial institutions, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon the key principles that a financial institution’s incentive compensation arrangements should (i) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the institution’s ability to effectively identify and manage risks; (ii) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management; and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the financial institution’s Board of Directors.
 The Federal Reserve and the OCC will review, as part of the regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of financial institutions, such as the Company and the Bank, that are not “large, complex banking organizations.” These reviews will be tailored to each financial institution based on the scope and complexity of the institution’s activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements. The findings of the supervisory initiatives will be included in reports of examination. Deficiencies will be incorporated into the institution’s supervisory ratings, which can affect the institution’s ability to make acquisitions and take other actions. Enforcement actions may be taken against a financial institution if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk-management control or governance processes, pose a risk to the institution’s safety and soundness and the financial institution is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies.
 In 2016, the SEC and the federal banking agencies proposed rules that prohibit covered financial institutions (including bank holding companies and banks) from establishing or maintaining incentive-based compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risk taking by providing covered persons (consisting of senior executive officers and significant risk takers, as defined in the rules) with excessive compensation, fees, or benefits that could lead to material financial loss to the financial institution. The proposed rules (i) outline factors to be considered when analyzing whether compensation is excessive and whether an incentive-based compensation arrangement encourages inappropriate risks that could lead to material loss to the covered financial institution and (ii) establishes minimum requirements that incentive-based compensation arrangements must meet to be considered to not encourage inappropriate risks and to appropriately balance risk and reward. The proposed rules also impose additional corporate governance requirements on the boards of directors of covered financial institutions and impose additional record-keeping requirements. The comment period for these proposed rules has closed, and final rules have not yet been published.

Cybersecurity. The federal bank regulatory agencies have adopted guidelines for establishing information security standards and cybersecurity programs for implementing safeguards under the supervision of a financial institution’s board of directors. These guidelines, along with related regulatory materials, increasingly focus on risk management and processes related to information technology and the use of third parties in the provision of financial products and services. The federal bank regulatory agencies expect financial institutions to establish lines of defense and to ensure that their risk management processes address the risk posed by compromised customer credentials, and also expect financial institutions to maintain sufficient business continuity planning processes to ensure rapid recovery, resumption and maintenance of the institution’s operations after a cyberattack. If the Company or the Bank fails to meet the expectations set forth in this regulatory guidance, the Company or the Bank could be subject to various regulatory actions, including financial penalties. Risks and exposures related to cybersecurity attacks are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats and the expanding use of technology-based products and services. The Company is, however, taking measures to combat these types of threats and manage risk to the Company and its customers.
 In October 2016, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued proposed rules on enhanced cybersecurity risk-management and resilience standards that would apply to very large financial institutions and to services provided by third parties to these institutions. The comment period for these proposed rules has closed, and final rules have not been published. Although the proposed rules would apply only to bank holding companies and banks with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets, these rules could influence the federal bank regulatory agencies’ expectations and supervisory requirements for information security standards and cybersecurity programs of financial institutions with less than $50 billion in total consolidated assets.
 Future Regulation
 From time to time, various legislative and regulatory initiatives are introduced in Congress and state legislatures, as well as by regulatory agencies. Such initiatives may include proposals to expand or contract the powers of bank holding companies and depository institutions or proposals to substantially change the financial institution regulatory system. Such legislation could change banking statutes and the operating environment of the Company and the Bank in substantial and unpredictable ways. If enacted, such legislation could increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities, or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions, and other financial institutions. The Company cannot predict whether any such legislation will be enacted, and, if enacted, the effect that it, or any implementing regulations, would have on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company or the Bank.
Effect of Governmental Monetary Policies
 The Company’s operations are affected not only by general economic conditions but also by the policies of various regulatory authorities. In particular, the Federal Reserve uses monetary policy tools to impact money market and credit market conditions and interest rates to influence general economic conditions. These policies have a significant impact on overall growth and distribution of loans, investments, and deposits; they affect market interest rates charged on loans or paid for time and savings deposits. Federal Reserve monetary policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks, including the Company, in the past and are expected to do so in the future.

Tax Reform
 On December 22, 2017, the President of the United States signed into law the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Tax Act”). The legislation made key changes to the U.S. tax law, including the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from a maximum of 35% to a flat 21%, effective January 1, 2018. As a result of the reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate to 21% under the Tax Act, the Company revalued its ending net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2017 and recognized a $963,000 tax expense in the Company’s consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2017.
Reporting Obligations under Securities Laws; Availability of Information
 The Company is subject to the periodic and other reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, including the filing of annual, quarterly and other reports with the SEC. Prior to the Reorganization, the Bank filed the periodic and annual reports required under the Exchange Act with the OCC. Annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K, plus any amendments to these reports, are available, free of charge, at www.vnbcorp.com. The Company’s SEC filings are posted and available as soon as reasonably practicable after the reports are filed electronically with the SEC. The information on the Company’s website is not incorporated into this report or any other filing the Company makes with the SEC. The SEC maintains an internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC at www.sec.gov.
Employees
 At December 31, 2018, the Company had 86 full time equivalent employees. None of its employees are represented by any collective bargaining unit. The Company considers relations with its employees to be good.
 The Company owns Bank Owned Life Insurance (“BOLI”) policies on executives and other key personnel of the Company. BOLI is a bank-eligible asset designed to recover costs of providing pre- and post-retirement benefits and/or to finance general employee benefit expenses. Under BOLI policies, the executives and other key personnel are the insured, and the Company is the owner and beneficiary of the policies. The insured has no claim to the insurance policy or to the policy’s cash value. Under separate split dollar agreements, a portion of any death benefit may be paid to the beneficiaries of the insured employees, subject to the terms and restrictions of the split dollar endorsement agreement between the insured employee and the Company.
