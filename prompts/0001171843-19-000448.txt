Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

Overview
 
We operate in the gold mining industry, primarily focused on advancing permitting of the Donlin Gold project in Alaska. The Donlin Gold project is held by Donlin Gold LLC (“Donlin Gold”), a limited liability company owned equally by wholly-owned subsidiaries of NOVAGOLD and Barrick Gold Corporation (“Barrick”). In 2018, we completed the sale of our interest in the Galore Creek copper-gold-silver project in British Columbia, Canada. The Galore Creek project is now held by a partnership owned by Teck Resources Limited (“Teck”) and a subsidiary of Newmont Mining Corporation (“Newmont”) (formerly a wholly-owned subsidiary of NOVAGOLD prior to completion of the sale transaction on July 27, 2018) where each partner owns a 50% interest.
 
We do not produce gold or any other minerals, and do not currently generate operating earnings. Funding to explore our mineral properties and to operate the Company was acquired primarily through previous equity financings consisting of public offerings of our common shares and warrants and through debt financing consisting of convertible notes. We expect to continue to raise capital through additional equity and/or debt financings, through the exercise of stock options, and otherwise.
 
We were incorporated by memorandum of association on December 5, 1984, under the Companies Act (Nova Scotia) as 1562756 Nova Scotia Limited. On January 14, 1985, we changed our name to NovaCan Mining Resources (l985) Limited and on March 20, 1987, we changed our name to NOVAGOLD RESOURCES INC. On May 29, 2013, our shareholders approved the continuance of the corporation into British Columbia. Subsequently, we filed the necessary documents in Nova Scotia and British Columbia and we continued under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) effective as of June 10, 2013. The current addresses, telephone and facsimile numbers of our offices are:

Recent Developments
 
Donlin Gold Project
 
On August 13, 2018, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (the “Corps”), the lead federal agency for the Donlin Gold Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), and the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) issued a favorable joint Federal Record of Decision (ROD) for the Donlin Gold project following completion of the federal National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process. Along with the ROD, the Corps issued a combined permit under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (CWA) and Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act. Additionally, the BLM issued the Offer to Lease for the right-of-way for those portions of the natural gas pipeline that would cross federal lands. The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration previously issued a special permit for the natural gas pipeline on June 5, 2018. To support issuance of the ROD, the Corps completed required consultation under the National Historic Preservation Act, Endangered Species Act, and Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act which protects essential fish habitat.
 
Several major State of Alaska permits were also issued and advanced during the year. After a public notice and comment period, the State of Alaska issued a Certificate of Reasonable Assurance under CWA Section 401 on August 10, 2018, indicating that the CWA 404 permit complies with the State’s water quality standards. The Alaska Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (APDES) water discharge permit was issued on May 24, 2018 and with no appeal, became effective on July 1, 2018. The State of Alaska Department of Fish and Game issued Title 16 Fish Habitat permits for the mine area and transportation corridor on August 30, 2018. In October 2018, the State of Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation approved an extension by which construction of the Donlin Gold project as authorized by the Prevention of Significant Deterioration air quality permit must begin of June 30, 2020. On July 9, 2018, the State issued a 30-day public notice for proposed approval of the Donlin Gold Reclamation and Closure Plan. The public notice period was subsequently extended to 60 days until September 6, 2018, with a public hearing held on August 27, 2018, in Bethel. The draft waste management permit was issued for public comment in the first quarter of 2018.
 
The final approval of the Donlin Gold Reclamation and Closure Plan and final Waste Management Permit were issued on January 18, 2019. The proposed state portion of the pipeline Right-of-Way Lease and other state land use approvals are anticipated to be issued for public comment in the first half of 2019. The Alaska Dam Safety certificates require additional fieldwork and more detailed engineering that will commence in 2019 and require a multi-year commitment.


During 2018, a group called the Yukon-Kuskokwim River Alliance (YKRA) was formed to protect salmon habitat in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta. This organization along with 12 of the 56 village councils in the Calista Region (Native Village of Kasigluk, Orutsararmiut Native Council (ONC), Native Village of Eek, Tuluksak Native Community, Tununak Council, Native Village of Nunapitchuk, Chuloonawick Tribal Council, Native Village of Kwigillingok, Native Village of Kongiganak, Chefornak Traditional Council, Chevak Native Village, and Native Village of Napakiak) have adopted resolutions opposing development of the Donlin Gold project. Earthjustice, representing ONC, Akiak Native Community IRA Council, Organized Village of Kwethluk, Native Village of Kwigillingok, Chuloonawick Tribal Council, and the YKRA, requested an informal review of the State of Alaska’s 401 certification by the Director of the Division of Water in the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation. In October 2018, the Director granted this request and a decision is expected in the first quarter of 2019. YKRA and ONC also requested that the Alaska Department of Fish and Game reconsider the issuance of the Title 16 Fish Habitat permits. The Commissioner of the Department of Fish and Game explained the Department’s evaluation of and basis for the decision to issue the permits and declined the request for reconsideration. Donlin Gold LLC, with support from NOVAGOLD and Barrick, remains actively engaged in environmental sustainability projects and extensive outreach efforts with local stakeholders, through multiple traditional village council meetings, regional tribal gatherings, events and village visits across the Yukon-Kuskokwim (Y-K) region. Donlin Gold LLC collaborated with Calista and TKC (owners of the mineral and surface rights, respectively) on grants, scholarships and community outreach efforts. In November 2018, Alaska voters rejected by a 62 to 38 percent margin Ballot Measure No. 1, the Stand for Salmon initiative, that would have created a new multi-tiered system of fish habitat permits and may have made it difficult for Donlin Gold to obtain new or modified fish habitat permits required for the project.
 
The Donlin Gold LLC board must approve a construction program and budget before the Donlin Gold project can be developed. The timing of the required engineering work and the Donlin Gold LLC board’s approval of a construction program and budget, the receipt of all required governmental permits and approvals, and the availability of financing, commodity price fluctuations, risks related to market events and general economic conditions among other factors, will affect the timing of and whether to develop the Donlin Gold project. Among other reasons, project delays could occur as a result of public opposition, litigation challenging permit decisions, requests for additional information or analysis, limitations in agency staff resources during regulatory review and permitting, or project changes made by Donlin Gold LLC.

The owners of the Donlin Gold project (Barrick and NOVAGOLD) continue to study ways to improve the project’s value and to reduce initial capital outlays through enhanced project design and execution, engagement of third-party operators for certain activities, and potential for financing of some capital-intensive infrastructure. To date, these additional studies have identified opportunities that have the potential to benefit the project were the owners to decide to update the Donlin Gold feasibility study and to initiate the engineering work necessary to advance the project design from feasibility level to basic and then detailed engineering. Barrick and NOVAGOLD will take all this work into account before reaching a construction decision and will advance the Donlin Gold project in a financially-disciplined manner with a strong focus on environmental stewardship and social responsibility.

Galore Creek Project
 
On July 27, 2018, we completed the sale of our 50% interest in the Galore Creek Partnership (GCP) and our 40% interest in the Copper Canyon mineral property to a subsidiary of Newmont. We intend to apply the proceeds toward the advancement of the Donlin Gold project. The Company received proceeds of $100.0 million on closing, a note for $75.0 million receivable upon the earlier of the completion of a new Galore Creek project pre-feasibility study or July 27, 2021 and a note for $25.0 million receivable upon the earlier of the completion of a Galore Creek project feasibility study or July 27, 2023, respectively. An additional $75.0 million will be receivable if and when a Galore Creek project construction plan is approved by the owner(s).
 
For further information, see section Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, below.
 
Reclamation
 
We will generally be required to mitigate long-term environmental impacts by stabilizing, contouring, re-sloping and re-vegetating various portions of a site after mining and mineral processing operations are completed. These reclamation efforts will be conducted in accordance with detailed plans, which must be reviewed and approved by the appropriate regulatory agencies. In addition, financial assurance acceptable to the regulatory authority with jurisdiction over reclamation must be provided in an amount that the authority determines to be sufficient to allow the authority to implement the reclamation plan in the event that we fail to complete the work as provided in the plan.
Government and Environmental Regulations
 
Our exploration and development activities are subject to various national, state, provincial and local laws and regulations in the United States and Canada, which govern prospecting, development, mining, production, exports, taxes, labor standards, occupational health, waste disposal, protection of the environment, mine safety, hazardous substances and other matters. We have obtained or have pending applications for those licenses, permits or other authorizations currently required to conduct our exploration and development programs. We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable mining, health, safety and environmental statutes and regulations in the United States and Canada. There are no current orders or directions relating to us with respect to the foregoing laws and regulations. For a more detailed discussion of the various government laws and regulations applicable to our operations and potential negative effects of these laws and regulations, see section Item 1A, Risk Factors, below.
 
Competition
 
We compete with other mineral resource exploration and development companies for financing, technical expertise and the acquisition of mineral properties. Many of the companies with whom we compete have greater financial and technical resources. Accordingly, these competitors may be able to spend greater amounts on the acquisition, exploration and development of mineral properties. This competition could adversely impact our ability to finance further exploration and to obtain the financing necessary for us to develop our mineral properties.
Availability of Raw Materials and Skilled Employees
 
Most aspects of our business require specialized skills and knowledge. Such skills and knowledge include the areas of geology, drilling, metallurgy, mine planning, logistical planning, preparation of feasibility studies, permitting, construction and operation of a mine, financing, legal and accounting. Historically, we have found that we can locate and retain appropriate employees and consultants and we believe we will continue to be able to do so.

All of the raw materials we require to carry on our business are readily available through normal supply or business contracting channels in the United States and Canada. Historically, we have been able to secure the appropriate equipment and supplies required to conduct our contemplated programs. As a result, we do not believe that we will experience any shortages of required equipment or supplies in the foreseeable future.
Seasonality
 
Our business is seasonal as our mineral exploration and development activities take place in southwestern Alaska. Due to the northern climate, work on the Donlin Gold project can be limited due to excessive snow cover and cold temperatures. In general, surface work often is limited to late spring through early fall, although work in some locations, which may more efficiently be accessed while frozen, occurs in the winter.
Gold Price History
 
The price of gold is volatile and is affected by numerous factors, all of which are beyond our control, such as the sale or purchase of gold by various central banks and financial institutions, inflation, recession, fluctuation in the relative values of the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies, changes in global and regional gold demand, in addition to international and national political and economic conditions.
 
The following table presents the high, low and average afternoon fixed prices in U.S. dollars for an ounce of gold on the London Bullion Market over the past five calendar years:
