Development of Scanner Technology Business
 
Defense Technologies International Corp. (the “Company”) acquired the world-wide exclusive rights to the Passive Security Scan™ a ‘next generation, walk-through personnel scanning system. This patented product (US Patent: 7408461) is an advanced passive scanning technology for detection and identifying concealed threats to be used for the security of schools and other public venues.
 
On October 19, 2016, the Company entered into a Definitive Agreement with Controlled Capture Systems, LLC ("CCS"), representing the inventor of the technology and assets that include a new exclusive Patent License Agreement and Independent Contractor agreement.  Under the license agreement with CCS, the Company acquired the world-wide exclusive rights and privileges to the CCS security technology, patents, products and improvements.  The term of the License Agreement shall be from October 19, 2016 until the expiration of the last to expire of the licensed issued patents or patents to be issued.
 
 The Company agreed to pay CCS an initial licensing fee of $25,000 and to pay ongoing royalties at the end of each six-month period at the rate of the greater of 5% of gross sales used or sold, or the minimum royalty payment of $25,000.  The Company also agreed to compensate investors that have provided funding for the development of CCS's technology with 2,667 shares of the Company's common stock.  Additionally, CCS will be entitled to receive 167 shares of the Company's common stock upon completed sales of 1,000 passive scanner units based on the CCS technology. On December 14, 2017, the Company issued 20,000 shares of Series B preferred stock to Controlled Capture Systems, LLC to extend the exclusive rights to the Passive Security Scan to March 15, 2018.


 On May 30, 2018 the Company and Control Capture Systems, LLC amended their license agreement as follows:
 

1. | Royalty payments of 5% of gross sale from the license agreement will be calculated and paid quarterly with a minimum of $12,500 paid each quarter. 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | All payment will be in US dollars or stock of the Company and or its subsidiary. The value of the stock will be a discount to market of 25% of the average trading price for the 10 days prior to conversion. The number of shares received by Control Capture prior to any reverse split are anti-dilutive. 
3. | Invoices for parts and materials will be billed separate of the license fees noted above. 

 
The Company capitalized the costs to acquire the License Agreement, including the $25,000 initial licensing fee and the estimated value of $353,600 of the 2,667 shares of the Company's common stock issued on November 10, 2016 to the CCS investors, which value was based on the closing market price of the Company's common stock on the date of the Definitive Agreement. The Company has recorded a current liability of $36,000 for the remaining obligation in its consolidated balance sheet as of April 30, 2019  Once sales of products based on the CCS technology begin, the Company will amortize the capitalized costs over the estimated life of the license agreement as determined by the legal life of patents issued. To date no sales of the product have been completed. The Company reviewed the valuation of the license agreement and determined to impair the asset of $378,600.

Effective January 12, 2017, Passive Security Scan, Inc. ("PSSI") was incorporated in the state of Utah as a wholly owned subsidiary.  The Company merged its wholly-owned subsidiary, Long Canyon Gold Resources Corp. ("Long Canyon"), into PSSI, with PSSI the surviving entity.  The Company transferred to PSSI its exclusive world-wide license to the defense, detection and protection security products previously acquired by the Company.  The Company currently owns 76.28% of PSSI with 23.72% acquired by several individuals and entities.  With the merger of Long Canyon into PSSI, the Company discontinued its mineral exploration business.  The Company concluded the initial development of the technology and will proceed to put the system through the required Beta Test at a high-school near Austin Tx. All sales and marketing activities will be executed through PSSI.
 
The security products licensed from CCS as developed by the Company are designed for personal and collateral protection.  The proposed detection technology is intended to provide passive security scanning units for either walk-through or hand-held use to improve security for schools and other public facilities.  The units use electromagnets and do not emit anything (such as x-rays) through the subject.  The Company, in consultation with CCS, recently completed a prototype with optional “Digital Imaging” which will give the user of the scanner the ability to recall the entire traffic passing through the scanner at any time thereafter.  The prototype scanner unit has successfully passed elaborate lab testing and is ready for deployment and demonstration.
 
Competition
 
We believe we have the only known passive scanner technology based on earth magnetic technology that does not cause any harm to the subject passing through the scanner.  Our scanners are therefore uniquely suited for school systems and other public venues.  Our competitors’ technology is based on X-Ray, microwave or radio signals, all of which are harmful over time.  We believe this provides an advantage to our scanners over those developed by our competition.
Sales and Marketing
 
Through our newly appointed Marketing Director, we have made contact with several schools that have expressed interest in having the Passive Security Scan Unit presented at the school for demonstration and evaluation.  Furthermore, as funding permits, we plan to install a demonstration unit in every state free of charge via the state’s Governor’s Office. We expect major exposure through this program.
 
We will also plan to announce the availability of distributorships.  A distributor will get a 20% discount on Gross Sales, but is required to purchase a minimum of 25 units at time of signing for a distributorship.  General referrals will earn a 10% discount.
 
With the completion of requisite funding, we expect to place the first units during the fall of 2019 and commence a major marketing campaign at the same time.  We believe that we will start production and sales within the coming three to six months.
 
With the start of initial sales, we believe that we will be able to raise major funding through more conventional sources for our production.
 
Trademarks and Copyrights
 
We acquired the world-wide exclusive rights and privileges to the CCS security technology, patents, products and improvements.  The term of the License Agreement shall be from October 19, 2016 until the expiration of the last to expire of the licensed issued patents or patents to be issued.  CCS currently owns 3 patents and 2 patents pending related to the technology.
Employees
 
We presently do not have any employees and do not anticipate adding employees until our business operations and financial resources so warrant. The Independent Contractor Agreement between the Company and CCS provides that CCS will provide support for the development of the security technology and products.  The management of our Company is provided through a series of service agreements with our officers and directors and key consultants.
