     Item 1.    Business 
  Overview 
         Rite Aid Corporation ("Rite Aid" or the "Company") is the third largest retail drugstore chain in the United States based on both revenues and number of stores. As of March 2, 2019, we operated 2,469 stores in 18 states across the country. 
         Our headquarters are located at 30 Hunter Lane, Camp Hill, Pennsylvania 17011, and our telephone number is (717) 761-2633. Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the trading symbol of "RAD." We were incorporated in 1968 and are a Delaware corporation. 
  Termination of the Merger AgreementOn February 18, 2018, Rite Aid entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") with Albertsons, Ranch Acquisition II LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of Albertsons ("Merger Sub II") and Ranch Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of Merger Sub II ("Merger Sub" and, together with Merger Sub II, the "Merger Subs"). On August 8, 2018, Rite Aid, Albertsons and the Merger Subs entered into a Termination Agreement (the "Merger Termination Agreement") under which the parties mutually agreed to terminate the Merger Agreement. Subject to limited customary exceptions, the Merger Termination Agreement mutually releases the parties from any claims of liability to one another relating to the contemplated merger (the "Merger"). Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, neither Rite Aid nor Albertsons is responsible for any payments to the other party as a result of the termination of the Merger Agreement and Rite Aid is no longer subject to the interim operating covenants and restrictions contained in the Merger Agreement. 
         While the Company believed in the merits of the combination with Albertsons, management of the Company heard the views expressed by stockholders and has been and continues to be committed to executing Rite Aid's strategic plan as a standalone company. This includes remaining focused on leveraging Rite Aid's network of conveniently located retail pharmacies, the EnvisionRxOptions PBM and its trusted brand of health and wellness offerings. Rite Aid is also focused on building momentum for key areas of its business like its innovative Wellness store format, highly successful customer loyalty program and expanded pharmacy service offerings, as it also enhances its omni-channel and own brand offerings to strengthen the Company's competitive position and create long-term value for stockholders. 
         Asset SaleOn September 18, 2017, we entered into the Amended and Restated Asset Purchase Agreement (the "Amended and Restated Asset Purchase Agreement") with WBA and Walgreen Co., an Illinois corporation and wholly-owned direct subsidiary of WBA ("Buyer"), which amended and restated in its entirety the previously disclosed Asset Purchase Agreement (the "Original Asset Purchase Agreement"), dated as of June 28, 2017, by and among Rite Aid, WBA and Buyer. Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Amended and Restated Asset Purchase Agreement, Buyer agreed to purchase from Rite Aid 1,932 Acquired Stores, three distribution centers, related inventory and other specified assets and liabilities related thereto for a purchase price of approximately $4.375 billion, on a cash-free, debt-free basis (the "Asset Sale" or "Sale"). We announced on September 19, 2017 that the waiting period under the HSR Act expired with respect to the Sale. We completed the store transfer process in March of 2018, which resulted in the transfer of all 1,932 stores and related assets to WBA and have received cash proceeds of $4.157 billion. On September 13, 2018, we completed the sale of one of our distribution centers and related assets to WBA for proceeds of $61.2 million. The transfer of the two remaining distribution centers and related assets remains subject to minimal customary closing conditions applicable only to the distribution centers being transferred at such distribution center closings, as specified in the Amended and Restated Asset Purchase Agreement.

           Based on its magnitude and because we are exiting certain markets, the Sale represents a significant strategic shift that has a material effect on our operations and financial results. Accordingly, we have applied discontinued operations treatment for the Sale, as required by generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). 
         In fiscal 2019, we continued reporting our business in two distinct segments. Our Retail Pharmacy Segment consists of Rite Aid stores, RediClinic and Health Dialog. Our Pharmacy Services Segment consists of EnvisionRx, our PBM, that has been rebranded as EnvisionRxOptions ("EnvisionRx" or "EnvisionRxOptions"). 
  Retail Pharmacy SegmentIn our Rite Aid retail stores, we sell prescription drugs and a wide assortment of other merchandise, which we call "front-end" products. In fiscal 2019, prescription drug sales accounted for 66.6% of our total drugstore sales. We believe that pharmacy operations will continue to represent a significant part of our business due to industry trends such as an aging population, increased life expectancy, anticipated growth in the federally funded Medicare Part D prescription program as "baby boomers" continue to enroll and the discovery of new and better drug therapies. We carry a full assortment of front-end products, which accounted for the remaining 33.4% of our total drug store sales in fiscal 2019. Front-end products include over-the-counter medications, health and beauty aids, personal care items, cosmetics, household items, food and beverages, greeting cards, seasonal merchandise and numerous other everyday and convenience products. 
         We differentiate our stores from other national chain drugstores, in part, through our wellness+ Rewards loyalty program, our Wellness format stores, innovative merchandising, owned brands and our strategic partnership with GNC, a leading retailer of vitamin and mineral supplements. We offer a wide variety of products through our portfolio of owned brands, which contributed approximately 18.6% of our front-end sales in fiscal 2019. 
         The average size of each store in our chain is approximately 13,600 square feet, and average store size is larger for our locations in the western United States. As of March 2, 2019, 58% of our stores were freestanding; 54% of our stores included a drive-thru pharmacy; and 62% included a GNC store within a Rite Aid store. 
         RediClinic, based in Houston, is an operator of retail clinics. RediClinics are staffed by board-certified nurse practitioners and physician assistants, who are trained and licensed to treat common conditions and provide preventative services, in collaboration with local physicians who are affiliated with a leading health care system in each market. Patients can be treated for more than 30 common medical conditions and RediClinic's clinicians are able to write prescriptions for these conditions when appropriate. Additionally, RediClinics provide a broad range of preventive services, including screenings, medical tests, immunizations and basic physical exams. We operated a total of 65 RediClinics at the end of fiscal 2019. We have owned 100% of RediClinic since 2014. 
         Health Dialog, based in Boston, is a provider of healthcare coaching and disease management services to health plans and employers. Health Dialog provides these services using a call in line staffed by nurse practitioners and through an on-line platform. We have owned 100% of Health Dialog since 2014. 
  Pharmacy Services SegmentEnvisionRxOptions provides a comprehensive suite of pharmacy benefits and services, including both transparent and traditional PBM options through its EnvisionRx and MedTrakRx PBMs; EnvisionPharmacies, a mail order and specialty pharmacy; EnvisionInsurance, a provider of commercial and Medicare-approved prescription insurance plans; EnvisionSavings, a prescription discount program for under and uninsured patients; and Laker Software, a claims adjudication platform. We have owned 100% of EnvisionRxOption since 2015.

    Restructuring and Executive Management ReorganizationIn March 2019, the Board of Directors implemented a reorganization of our executive management team to further streamline our business. This streamlining resulted in the departures of John Standley as chief executive officer upon the appointment of a successor, Kermit Crawford as president and chief operating officer, and Darren Karst as chief financial officer and chief accounting officer. 
         In addition, the Company announced a restructuring plan that will reduce managerial layers and consolidate roles across the organization, resulting in the elimination of approximately 400 full-time positions, or more than 20% of the corporate positions located at the Company's headquarters and across the field organization. Approximately two-thirds of the reductions took place at the time of the announcement and the balance will occur by the end of fiscal 2020. As a result of the restructuring, Rite Aid expects to achieve annual cost savings of approximately $55 million, of which approximately $42 million will be realized within fiscal year 2020. These cost savings will serve to offset an expected reduction in income associated with its diminishing obligations under the TSA with WBA, which related to the prior sale of stores. The Company expects to incur a one-time restructuring charge of approximately $38 million during fiscal 2020 to achieve the targeted cost savings. 
  Recasting of per-share amountsAs previously announced, we implemented a reverse stock split of our common stock at a reverse stock split ratio of 1-for-20. Our common stock began trading on a split-adjusted basis on the NYSE at the market open on April 22, 2019. Accordingly, all share and per-share amounts for the current period and prior periods have been recasted to reflect the reverse stock split. 
 


Industry Trends 

         Despite an increase in prescription drug usage, the rate of pharmacy sales growth in the United States continues to be negatively impacted by a decline in new blockbuster drugs, a longer FDA approval process, drug safety concerns, higher copays and an increase in the use of generic (non-brand name) drugs, which are less expensive but generate higher gross margins. New drug development in the next few years is expected to be concentrated in specialty prescriptions, which are high cost drugs targeted toward complex or rare chronic conditions. We expect prescription usage to continue to grow in the coming years due to the aging U.S. population, increased life expectancy, "baby boomers" continuing to become eligible for the federally funded Medicare prescription program and new drug therapies. Additionally, rising U.S. healthcare costs and the shortage of primary care physicians are creating opportunities for pharmacists and drugstores to play a more active role in driving positive health outcomes for patients. Services such as immunizations, medication therapy management, chronic condition management, clinics and medication compliance counseling extend our efforts well beyond filling prescriptions. We believe that offerings such as these could gain additional momentum in a rapidly changing healthcare environment. 
         In terms of our traditional drug dispensing business, generic prescription drugs continue to help lower overall costs for customers and third party payors. We believe the utilization of existing generic pharmaceuticals will continue to increase, although the pace of introduction of new generic drugs is expected to slow. The gross profit from a generic drug prescription in the retail drugstore industry is generally greater than the gross profit from a brand drug prescription. However, the sale amount can be substantially less and has impacted our overall revenues and same store sales. 
         The retail drugstore industry is highly competitive and consolidation has accelerated. We believe that the competitive advantages from the increasing trend toward vertical integration resulting from the combination of retail pharmacy companies with PBMs, such as CVS Health, and aggressive generic pricing programs at competitors such as Wal-Mart and various supermarket chains will further increase competitive pressures in the industry. Front-end product pricing has continued to be highly promotional in the retail drugstore business, which contributes to additional competitive pressures. 
 7

           The retail drugstore industry continues to rely significantly on third party payors. Over the past several years, third party payors, including the Medicare Part D plans and the state-sponsored Medicaid and related managed care Medicaid agencies, have changed the eligibility requirements of participants and have successfully reduced certain reimbursement rates. This trend is expected to continue, which puts added pressure on our and our competitors' results. Medicare Part D plans have also introduced plans that have restricted network options, under which a patient can elect a plan with a lower copay in exchange for the choice to use a limited number of pharmacies to fill their prescriptions. In order to participate in these restricted networks, retail pharmacies generally have to accept lower reimbursement rates. We expect the usage of these restricted network plans to continue to increase. When third party payors, including the Medicare Part D program and state-sponsored Medicaid agencies, reduce the number of participants and/or reduce their reimbursement rates, sales and margins in the industry could be reduced, and profitability of the industry adversely affected. These possible adverse effects can be partially offset by lowering our product cost, controlling expenses, dispensing more higher margin generics, finding new revenue streams through pharmacy services and dispensing more prescriptions overall. 
   Strategy 
         In fiscal 2019, we made significant progress in ensuring that we have low drug acquisition costs for filling prescriptions. We engaged with our payor partners to gain better reimbursement rate predictability and access. In fiscal 2020, we will also focus on further expanding the clinical role of our pharmacists; further integrating our healthcare services offered by our reportable segments and network of Rite Aid stores; optimizing our asset base; and growing front-end sales and prescription count while controlling costs. 
         Following are descriptions of some of our key initiatives: 
  Expanded Healthcare ServicesIn fiscal 2019, we continued to expand the role of our Rite Aid pharmacists in delivering health and wellness services that go beyond filling prescriptions. We have accelerated these efforts over the past year by focusing on a clinical pharmacy services strategy known as AIM, which stands for Adherence, Immunizations and Medication Therapy Management ("MTM"). A key part of our AIM strategy is operating as efficiently as possible so that our pharmacists have additional time to perform these increasingly valuable clinical services. In fiscal 2019, we introduced Rite Care, a state-of-the-art tool that provides our pharmacists with real-time alerts without having to visit a separate application. 
         Promoting medication adherenceor taking medications on time and as prescribedis one of the best ways our pharmacists can help drive positive health outcomes for patients while also lowering healthcare costs by avoiding illnesses and hospital visits. In addition to patient counseling, we have a number of tools in place that make it easier for patients to comply with their medication therapy while also providing a better customer experience, including text, phone and email alerts when a prescription is ready for pick-up and our One Trip Refills program, which allows patients to refill all of their monthly maintenance medications in a single trip to the pharmacy. 
         A key area of focus has been our immunizations program, which has grown significantly in recent years and continues to be an important area of focus. In fiscal 2019, our pharmacists administered an all-time company record, based on historical performance of go-forward Rite Aid stores, of 3.2 million immunizations, including more than 2.3 million flu shots. Pharmacists also increased the number of non-flu or ancillary immunizations, which protect against conditions such as shingles, pneumonia and whooping cough, by nearly 80% for a total of more than 900,000. Both flu and ancillary immunizations will continue to be a key priority in fiscal 2020. 
         We also continue to make progress in expanding our MTM services, in which pharmacists engage with patients and focus on managing their entire medication regimen to drive positive health outcomes. 
 8

   These efforts generated approximately $6.0 million in reimbursement revenue in fiscal 2019. We can also improve productivity by further increasing 90-day prescriptions and leveraging our workload balancing program that enables pharmacists at lower-volume stores to remotely support prescription dispensing at higher-volume stores. 
  Unique Healthcare AssetsAn important part of our retail healthcare strategy continues to be finding ways to integrate our expanded suite of healthcare assets with our base of conveniently located retail pharmacies to deliver a higher level of care and service in our communities. This includes leveraging our store base and the capabilities of EnvisionRxOptions in our efforts to create cost-effective solutions to employers and health plans; and drive growth. 
         Our Pharmacy Services Segment strategy centers on providing innovative pharmaceutical solutions and quality client service in order to help improve clinical outcomes for our clients' plan members while assisting our clients and their plan members in better managing overall health care costs. Our clients are primarily employers, insurance companies, unions, government employee groups, health plans, Managed Medicaid plans, Medicare plans, other sponsors of health benefit plans, and individuals throughout the United States. Our goal is to produce superior results for our clients and their plan members by leveraging our expertise in core PBM services, including: plan design offerings and administration, formulary management, Medicare Part D services, mail order, specialty pharmacy services, retail pharmacy network management services, clinical services, disease management services, and other spend management. During fiscal 2019, EnvisionRxOptions made significant progress in continuing to grow its Medicare Part D business, with 21% year-over-year membership growth and a total enrollment of approximately 624,000 as of March 2, 2019. 
         RediClinic is a component of our efforts to expand Rite Aid's retail healthcare offering. As of March 2, 2019, we had 29 RediClinics operating in Rite Aid stores throughout the Philadelphia and New Jersey markets. Including our locations in Texas, we operated a total of 65 RediClinics at the end of fiscal 2019. 
  Front-end MerchandisingOur front-end offering remains a critical part of Rite Aid's business. We focus on providing outstanding customer experiences, leveraging our valuable wellness brand, developing individualized and unique customer relationships and continuing to evolve the products and services we offer. We will continue to remain focused on strengthening our core categories of health, beauty, vitamins and consumables. 
         In beauty, we are undergoing our largest transformation in more than a decade, including the introduction of more than 300 products and new brands such as e.l.f. In November 2018, we became the first drugstore retailer to offer Kokie cosmetics, which provides the latest beauty trends at an affordable price. We also extended our exclusive drug channel partnership with GNC through 2021 and expect to launch innovative GNC brands in our stores over the next year. 
         In addition, we will accelerate our focus on growing own brand sales, as these items offer tremendous value to customers while enhancing our profitability. We have more than 145 new items in development and will be re-launching our best-selling private brand, Rite Aid Pharmacy, in the coming year. In fiscal 2020, we will also focus on testing innovative new merchandising programs, tailoring our mix to local needs, rationalizing SKUs and further strengthening our wellness-focused product offering. 
  Omni-Channel CapabilitiesIn fiscal 2019, we further enhanced our omni-channel capabilities by continuing our print-to-digital marketing transformation and driving increased customer engagement on our mobile app. In fiscal 2020, backed by additional capital investments, we will continue these efforts while also aggressively testing new ways to engage with our customers in providing a seamlessly connected customer experience that attracts new customers while increasing trip frequency and basket size for existing customers.

    wellness+ RewardsSince the launch of wellness+ Rewards in April 2010, our loyalty program has provided customers with the opportunity to earn significant discounts and wellness rewards. Beyond exclusive sale pricing and weekly savings for all cardholders, members earn  wellness+ Rewards points based on the purchase of certain front-end and pharmacy purchases. As an example, gold members receive a 20% discount off most non-pharmacy purchases for an entire year. 
         We have over 13 million active wellness+ Rewards members, defined as those who have shopped two or more times over the past six months. In addition, over 60% of customer transactions at Rite Aid now include a wellness+ Rewards card. This year, we enhanced our digital coupon and personalization benefits, which provided our customers with additional savings opportunities, and the program will continue to play a key role in our promotional offerings. 
  Wellness Store RemodelsIn fiscal 2019, we continued to strengthen Rite Aid as a wellness destination by completing additional Wellness store remodels. As a result, our total number of Wellness stores reached 1,765 by the end of the fiscal year, which means that 71% of all Rite Aid stores are now Wellness stores. We also opened one new store and relocated one store, in this groundbreaking Wellness format, which offers improved interior design, expanded clinical pharmacy services, our latest innovative merchandising and new wellness product offerings. Our customers have responded favorably to this unique store format, with our Wellness stores continuing to outperform the rest of our chain in terms of both front-end same store sales and same store prescription count growth. 
         In fiscal 2020, we plan to complete 70 additional Wellness remodels along with six relocations, two new store openings and one expansion. We believe these investments represent a cost-effective way to strengthen our store base, grow sales and offer our customers an engaging wellness experience. 
  Prescription File PurchasesIn fiscal 2019, we spent $47.9 million on the purchase of prescription files. We plan to increase our level of prescription file purchases in fiscal 2020 to approximately $60.0 million as they drive additional traffic to our stores and deliver a strong return on investment. 
  Drug Purchasing and Distribution EfficienciesIn fiscal 2019, after a careful and comprehensive review of our drug purchasing options, we agreed to key terms of an amendment to our drug purchasing agreement with McKesson Corporation ("McKesson"). Under these terms, McKesson will continue to source all of Rite Aid's branded and generic pharmaceuticals and provide direct-to-store delivery to all of our pharmacies through March of 2029. Securing the ability to purchase prescription drugs at a competitive price has been an important strategic objective, and after our rigorous review, we believe that extending our contract with McKesson provides Rite Aid with the most favorable terms that we can achieve in the marketplace. 
  Cost ControlIn fiscal 2020, we will continue to pursue opportunities to control our costs in order to help mitigate the impact of declining reimbursement rates and align our business with a new operational structure as the TSA with WBA winds down. In addition to strong cost control, we rationalized our store footprint by closing more than 80 unprofitable stores. Furthermore, in March 2019 we announced a major organizational restructuring that will reduce managerial layers and consolidate roles across the organization. As a result of this restructuring, we expect to achieve annual cost savings of approximately $55.0 million, of which approximately $42.0 million will be realized within fiscal 2020. In fiscal 2020, we will target further cost savings through indirect procurement efficiencies and labor productivity improvements. 
   Products and Services 
         Sales of prescription drugs for our Retail Pharmacy segment represented approximately 66.6%, 65.9% and 66.0% of our total drugstore sales in fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. In fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017, prescription drug sales were $10.4 billion, $10.3 billion and $11.1 billion, 
 10

   respectively. See the section entitled "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Continuing Operations" and our consolidated financial statements. 
         We carry a full assortment of non-prescription, or front-end, products. The types and number of front-end products in each store vary, and selections are based on customer needs and preferences and available space. No single front-end product category contributed significantly to our sales during fiscal 2019. Our Retail Pharmacy segment's principal classes of products in fiscal 2019 were the following: 

   
Product Class | Percentage of Sales | 
Prescription drugs | | 66.6 | %
Over-the-counter medications and personal care | | 10.8 | %
Health and beauty aids | | 5.0 | %
General merchandise and other | | 17.6 | %


        We offer a wide variety of products under our private brands to meet the needs of our customers in virtually every non-pharmacy department. We intend to increase our private brand sales and penetration in fiscal 2020 by expanding our product lines, refreshing our package design, along with leveraging our marketing vehicles. We believe that our assortment is differentiated and a compelling value to our customers based on our emphasis on high quality standards and everyday/promotional pricing. 
         We have a strategic alliance with GNC under which we have opened over 1,532 GNC stores within Rite Aid stores as of March 2, 2019 and have a contractual commitment to open at least 150 additional GNC stores within Rite Aid stores by December 2021. We believe the GNC stores enhance our wellness offerings and help differentiate us from our competitors. GNC is a leading nationwide retailer of vitamin and mineral supplements, personal care, fitness and other health-related products. 
         Through our 100% owned subsidiary, EnvisionRx, we offer a broad range of pharmacy-related services. In addition to its transparent and traditional PBM offerings through the EnvisionRx and MedTrak PBMs, EnvisionRx also offers fully integrated mail-order and specialty pharmacy services through EnvisionPharmacies. Through its Envision Insurance Company ("EIC"), EnvisionRx also serves one of the fastest-growing demographics in healthcare: seniors enrolled in Medicare Part D. In addition, EnvisionRx, through its state of the art Laker Software, performs prescription adjudication services for its own claims as well as claims for other PBM's. 
         The Company, through its Health Dialog subsidiary, provides health care coaching and disease management services to health plans and employers. Health Dialog provides these services using a call center staffed by nurse practitioners and through an on-line platform. 
   Technology 
         All of our stores are integrated into a common pharmacy system, which enables our customers to fill or refill prescriptions in any of our stores throughout the country, identifies adverse drug interactions, and enables our pharmacists to fill prescriptions more accurately and efficiently. Our customers may also order prescription refills over the Internet through our website, www.riteaid.com, our mobile app, or over the phone through our telephonic automated refill systems for pick up at a Rite Aid store or home delivery from a majority of our stores. We have automated pharmacy dispensing units in high volume stores, which are linked to our pharmacists' computers that fill and label prescription drug orders. We utilize central fill technology to facilitate the automated picking, packaging, and labeling of prescriptions in a central filling location, which are sent to certain retail stores for delivery to the customer. We also utilize workload sharing technology within our stores, whereby stores within a close proximity can shift the fulfillment of prescriptions to stores with excess capacity. The efficiency of these processes allows our pharmacists to spend more time consulting with 
 11

   and answering our customers' questions and concerns about their prescription medications and health conditions. Additionally, each of our stores employs point-of-sale technology that supports sales analysis and recognition of customer trends. This same point-of-sale technology facilitates the maintenance of perpetual inventory records which, together with our sales analysis, drives our automated inventory replenishment process. 
         We continue to embrace technology as a way to enhance the customer experience. Our mobile app, which is available for download for both the Android and iPhone platforms, allows our customers to use their smartphones to manage their wellness + account, refill prescriptions, access the weekly circular to view sale items, and locate a nearby Rite Aid store. We have continued to strengthen our presence on social media sites through unique promotions and contests. 
   Sources and Availability of Raw Materials 
         Since fiscal 2015, under our pharmaceutical purchasing and delivery agreement ("Purchasing and Delivery Agreement") with limited exceptions, we purchased all of our branded pharmaceutical products and almost all of our generic (non-brand name) pharmaceutical products from McKesson. If our relationship with McKesson were disrupted, we could temporarily experience difficulties filling prescriptions for branded and generic drugs until we execute a replacement wholesaler agreement or develop and implement self-distribution processes. 
         We purchase our non-pharmaceutical merchandise from numerous manufacturers and wholesalers. We believe that competitive sources are readily available for substantially all of the non-pharmaceutical merchandise we carry and that the loss of any one supplier would not have a material effect on our business. 
         We sell private brand and co-branded products that generally are supplied by numerous sources. The GNC branded vitamin and mineral supplement products that we sell in our stores are developed by GNC, and along with our Rite Aid brand vitamin and mineral supplements, are manufactured by GNC. 
   Customers and Third Party Payors 
         During fiscal 2019, our stores filled approximately 171.1 million prescriptions and served an average of 1.2 million customers per day. The loss of any one customer would not have a material impact on our results of operations. 
         In fiscal 2019, substantially all of our pharmacy sales were to customers covered by third party payors (such as insurance companies, prescription benefit management companies, government agencies, private employers or other managed care providers) that agree to pay for all or a portion of a customer's eligible prescription purchases based on negotiated and contracted reimbursement rates. During fiscal 2019, the top five third party payors accounted for approximately 80.4% of our pharmacy sales. The largest third party payor, Caremark, represented 28.3% of our pharmacy sales. The loss of, or a significant change to the prescription drug reimbursement rates by, a major third party payor could decrease our revenue and harm our business. 
         During fiscal 2019, Medicaid and related managed care Medicaid payors sales were approximately 19.1% of our pharmacy sales, of which the largest single Medicaid payor was approximately 1.8% of our pharmacy sales. During fiscal 2019, approximately 35.8% of our pharmacy sales were to customers covered by Medicare Part D. 
         Through our Pharmacy Services segment we provide innovative pharmaceutical solutions for our clients which are primarily employers, insurance companies, unions, government employee groups, health plans, Managed Medicaid plans, Medicare plans, and other sponsors of health benefit plans, and individuals throughout the United States. 
 12

     Competition 
         The retail drugstore and pharmacy benefit management industries are highly competitive. Our retail drugstore operations compete with, among others, retail drugstore chains, independently owned drugstores, supermarkets, mass merchandisers, discount stores, wellness offerings, dollar stores and mail order and internet pharmacies. We compete on the basis of store location, convenience, customer service, product selection, price, and payor access. Our pharmacy benefit management operations compete with other pharmacy benefit managers, such as Caremark and Express Scripts. We compete on the basis of our PBM service offerings, pricing and through our transparent and traditional PBM models. We believe continued consolidation in the healthcare industry, and the aggressive discounting of generic drugs by supermarkets and mass merchandisers and other PBM service providers will further increase competitive pressures in our industries. 
 Marketing and Advertising 
         In fiscal 2019, marketing and advertising expense was approximately $147.5 million, which was spent on our weekly circular (print and digital), our Wellness+ Rewards program/customer relationship marketing (CRM), digital/social marketing and focused pharmacy marketing initiatives including television, radio and direct mail. Our marketing and advertising activities are primarily focused on the following:


 Promotional marketing (circular/digital marketing) to drive share of wallet and new customer acquisition; 
 Our wellness + Rewards loyalty program, which benefits our members in several
ways: 


 Members earn wellness+ points by purchasing certain front-end products and prescriptions purchases that enables them to qualify
for savings of up to 20% off of front-end purchases every day for a year 
 Bonus Cash rewards provide additional savings to our customers/wellness+ members every week 
 Personalized offers/digital coupons that are often presented in vehicles such as digital marketing, email and direct mail 
 Emphasis on the broad selection, great quality and value of our private brand products; 

 Support of specific market-wide initiatives and individual store programs such as competitor market intrusion, prescription file buys and grand
openings for new and remodeled stores; and 
 Focused efforts on our omni-channel marketing initiatives including our Rite Aid mobile app, social media, our riteaid.com website and
e-commerce. 
 Additional programs focused on health and wellness such as One Trip Refills, Vaccine Central and Quit For You smoking cessation programs. 

 Associates 
         As of March 2, 2019, we had approximately 51,000 Retail Pharmacy segment associates: 11% were pharmacists, 41% were part-time and 35% were represented by unions. Additionally, we have approximately 2,100 Pharmacy Services segment associates. Associate satisfaction is critical to our success. We annually survey our associates to obtain feedback on various employment-related topics, including job satisfaction and their understanding of our core values and mission. We believe that our relationships with our associates are good. 
 13

           The number of graduates from U.S. Schools of Pharmacy is largely meeting our workforce demand. However, pharmacist employment opportunities still exist in certain areas. 
   Research and Development 
         We do not make significant expenditures for research and development. 
   Licenses, Trademarks and Patents 
         The Rite Aid name is our most significant trademark and the most important factor in marketing our stores and private brand products. We hold licenses to sell beer, wine and liquor, cigarettes and lottery tickets. As part of our strategic alliance with GNC, we have a license to operate GNC "stores-within-Rite Aid-stores." We also hold licenses to operate our pharmacies and our distribution facilities. Through our 100% owned subsidiary EnvisionRx, we hold a license to conduct Medicare Part D business with CMS. 
         Collectively, these licenses are material to our operations. 
   Seasonality 
         We experience moderate seasonal fluctuations in our results of operations concentrated in the first and fourth fiscal quarters as the result of the concentration of the cough, cold and flu season and the holidays. We tailor certain front-end merchandise to capitalize on holidays and seasons. We increase our inventory levels during our third fiscal quarter in anticipation of the seasonal fluctuations described above. Our results of operations in the fourth and first fiscal quarters may fluctuate based upon the timing and severity of the cough, cold and flu season, both of which are unpredictable. 
 Regulation 
         Our business is subject to federal, state and local laws, regulations, and administrative practices concerning the provision of and payment for health care services, including, without limitation: federal, state and local licensure and registration requirements concerning the operation of pharmacies and the practice of pharmacy; Medicare, Medicaid and other publicly financed health benefit plan regulations prohibiting kickbacks, beneficiary inducement and the submission of false claims; the ACA; regulations of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the U.S Consumer Product Safety Commission, the U.S Federal Trade Commission, and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, including regulations governing the purchase, sale, storing and dispensing of controlled substances and other products, as well as regulations promulgated by state and other federal agencies concerning automated outbound contacts such as phone calls, text messages and emails and the sale, advertisement and promotion of the products we sell, including nicotine products and alcoholic beverages. 
         Our business is also subject to patient privacy and other obligations, including corporate, pharmacy and associate responsibility imposed by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ("HIPAA"). As a covered entity, we are required to implement privacy standards, train our associates on the permitted uses and disclosures of protected health information, provide a notice of privacy practice to our pharmacy customers and permit pharmacy customers to access and amend their records and receive an accounting of disclosures of protected health information.

         In addition, in connection with the ownership and operations of our stores, distribution centers and other sites, we are subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters, including those governing the management and disposal of hazardous substances and the cleanup of contaminated sites. 
         Regarding PBM and affiliate operations, we are subject to federal, state, and local regulations, including all rules, guidance, memoranda, and updates published by CMS. This includes the governance set forth by the Medicare Part D program, which makes prescription drug coverage available to eligible Medicare beneficiaries through private insurers. This program regulates all aspects of the provision of Medicare drug coverage, including enrollment, formularies, pharmacy networks, marketing, and claims processing. In addition, various quasi-regulatory organizations and credentialing organizations have issued (or may propose) model standards or other requirements concerning PBMs, specialty pharmacies, or health plans. Examples include the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC"), the National Committee for Quality Assurance ("NCQA"), and the Utilization Review Accreditation Commission ("URAC"), among others.
