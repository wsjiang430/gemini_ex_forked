ITEM 1. BUSINESS
OVERVIEW

SmartFinancial, Inc. (“SmartFinancial” or the “Company”) was incorporated on September 19, 1983, under the laws of the State of Tennessee. SmartFinancial is a bank holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. 
The primary activity of SmartFinancial currently is, and is expected to remain for the foreseeable future, the ownership and operation of SmartBank (the "Bank"). As a bank holding company, SmartFinancial intends to facilitate SmartBank’s ability to serve its customers’ requirements for financial services. The holding company structure also provides flexibility for expansion through the possible acquisition of other financial institutions and the provision of additional banking-related services, as well as certain non-banking services, which a traditional commercial bank may not provide under present laws.
SmartBank

SmartBank is a Tennessee-chartered commercial bank established in 2007 which has its principal office in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee. The principal business of the Bank consists of attracting deposits from the general public and investing those funds, together with funds generated from operations and from principal and interest payments on loans, primarily in commercial loans, commercial and residential real estate loans, consumer loans and residential and commercial construction loans. Funds not invested in the loan portfolio are invested by the Bank primarily in obligations of the U.S. Government, U.S. Government agencies, and various states and their political subdivisions. In addition to deposits, sources of funds for the Bank’s loans and other investments include amortization and prepayment of loans, sales of loans or participations in loans, sales of its investment securities and borrowings from other financial institutions. The principal sources of income for the Bank are interest and fees collected on loans, fees collected on deposit accounts and interest and dividends collected on other investments. The principal expenses of the Bank are interest paid on deposits, employee compensation and benefits, office expenses and other overhead expenses.  At December 31, 2018, SmartBank had 29 full-service branches located in Tennessee, Alabama, and Florida, two loan production offices, two mortgage loan production offices, and two service centers.
Foothills Merger
On June 28, 2018, the Company along with the Bank entered into an agreement and plan of merger with Foothills Bancorp, Inc., a Tennessee corporation and Foothills Bank, a Tennessee-chartered commercial bank and wholly owned subsidiary of Foothills Bancorp. The merger was consummated on November 1, 2018, with Foothills Bancorp stockholders receiving stock of the Company. After the merger, original stockholders of SmartFinancial owned approximately 91 percent of the outstanding common stock of the combined entity on a fully diluted basis while the previous Foothills Bancorp stockholders owned approximately 9 percent. The assets and liabilities of Foothills Bancorp, as of the effective date of the merger, were recorded at their respective estimated fair values and combined with those of the Company. The excess of the purchase price over the net estimated fair values of the acquired assets and liabilities was allocated to identifiable intangible assets with the remaining excess allocated to goodwill, which was approximately $7.5 million. As a result of the merger the Company assets increased approximately $218 million and liabilities increased approximately $196 million. 
Tennessee Bancshares Merger
On December 12, 2017, the Company along with the Bank entered into an agreement and plan of merger with Tennessee Bancshares, Inc., a Tennessee corporation and Southern Community Bank, a Tennessee-chartered commercial bank and wholly owned subsidiary of Tennessee Bancshares. The merger was consummated on May 1, 2018, with Tennessee Bancshares stockholders receiving stock of the Company. After the merger, original stockholders of SmartFinancial owned approximately 89 percent of the outstanding common stock of the combined entity on a fully diluted basis while the previous Tennessee Bancshares stockholders owned approximately 11 percent. The assets and liabilities of Tennessee Bancshares, as of the effective date of the merger, were recorded at their respective estimated fair values and combined with those of the Company. The excess of the purchase price over the net estimated fair values of the acquired assets and liabilities was allocated to identifiable intangible assets with the remaining excess allocated to goodwill, which was approximately $16 million. As a result of the merger the Company assets increased approximately $226 million and liabilities increased approximately $207 million.

Capstone Merger
On May 22, 2017, the stockholders of the Company approved a merger with Capstone Bancshares, Inc. ("Capstone"), the one bank holding company of Capstone Bank, which was consummated on November 1, 2017. Capstone stockholders received either stock, cash, or a combination of stock and cash. After the merger, stockholders of SmartFinancial owned approximately 74 percent of the outstanding common stock of the combined entity on a fully diluted basis. The assets and liabilities of Capstone, as of the effective date of the merger, were recorded at their respective estimated fair values and combined with those of SmartFinancial. The excess of the purchase price over the net estimated fair values of the acquired assets and liabilities was allocated to identifiable intangible assets with the remaining excess allocated to goodwill, which was approximately $38 million. As a result of the merger Company assets increased approximately $536 million and liabilities increased approximately $466 million. The merger had a significant impact on all aspects of the Company's financial statements, and as a result, financial results after the merger may not be comparable to financial results prior to the merger.
Purchase of Cleveland, Tennessee branch
On December 8, 2016, the Bank entered into a purchase and assumption agreement with Atlantic Capital Bank, N.A. on a branch in Cleveland, Tennessee. The purchase was completed on May 19, 2017 for a total of $1.2 million in cash. The assets and liabilities as of the effective date of the transaction were recorded at their respective estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the net estimated fair values of the acquired assets and liabilities was allocated to identifiable intangible assets with the remaining excess allocated to goodwill, which was $660 thousand. In the periods following the acquisition, the financial statements include the results attributable to the Cleveland branch purchase beginning on the date of purchase. As a result of the transaction the Company acquired approximately $27 million in assets and assumed $27 million in liabilities.

SBLF Preferred Stock
On March 6, 2017, the Company redeemed its $12 million of Senior Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A (“SmartFinancial SBLF Stock”), to the United States Secretary of the Treasury and paid $195 thousand in accrued dividends. More details about the SBLF Preferred Stock can be found in Note 16 in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.” 
Employees

As of December 31, 2018, SmartFinancial and SmartBank had 387 full-time equivalent employees. The employees are not represented by a collective bargaining unit. SmartFinancial believes that its relationship with its employees is good.
Merger and Acquisition Strategy

Our strategic plan involves growing a high performing community bank through organic loan and deposit growth as well as disciplined merger and acquisition activity.  We are continually evaluating business combination opportunities and may conduct due diligence activities in connection with these opportunities. As a result, business combination discussions and, in some cases, negotiations, may take place, and transactions involving cash, debt or equity securities could be expected. Any future business combinations or series of business combinations that we might undertake may be material in terms of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, or equity issued.
Competition
We compete in the highly competitive banking and financial services industry. Our profitability depends principally on our ability to effectively compete in the markets in which we conduct business. We expect competition in the industry to continue to increase mainly as a result of the improvement in financial technology used by both existing and new banking and financial services firms. Competition may further intensify as additional companies enter the markets where we conduct business and we enter mature markets in accordance with our expansion strategy. 
We experience strong competition from both bank and non-bank competitors. Broadly speaking, we compete with national banks, super-regional banks, smaller community banks and non-traditional internet-based banks. In addition, we compete with other financial intermediaries and investment alternatives such as mortgage companies, credit card issuers, leasing companies, finance companies, money market mutual funds, brokerage firms, governmental and corporation bond issuers, and other securities firms. Many of these non-bank competitors are not subject to the same regulatory oversight, affording them a competitive advantage in some instances. In many cases, our competitors have substantially greater resources and offer certain services that we are unable to provide to our customers. 
6

We encounter strong pricing competition in providing our services. Additionally, other banks offer different products or services from those that we provide. The larger national and super-regional banks may have significantly greater lending limits and may offer additional products than we are capable of providing. We attempt to compete successfully with our competitors, regardless of their size, by emphasizing customer service while continuing to provide a wide variety of services. 
Supervision and Regulation
General
The U.S. banking industry is highly regulated under federal and state law. The following is a general summary of the material aspects of certain statutes and regulations applicable to SmartFinancial and SmartBank. This supervisory framework could materially impact the conduct and profitability of SmartFinancial’s and SmartBank’s activities. A change in applicable laws or regulations, or in the manner such laws or regulations are interpreted by regulatory agencies or courts, may have a material effect on SmartFinancial’s and SmartBank’s business, operations, and earnings. 
SmartFinancial is a bank holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (which we refer to as the “BHC Act”). As a result, SmartFinancial is subject to supervision, regulation, and examination by the Federal Reserve and is required to file with the Federal Reserve annual reports and such additional information as the Federal Reserve may require pursuant to the BHC Act and applicable regulations. SmartFinancial is also under the jurisdiction of the SEC for matters relating to the offering and sale of SmartFinancial’s securities and is subject to the SEC’s rules and regulations relating to periodic reporting, reporting to stockholders, proxy solicitations, and insider-trading.
SmartBank is a Tennessee-chartered commercial bank and is a member of the Federal Reserve System. As a Tennessee-chartered bank, SmartBank is subject to supervision, regulation, and examination by the Tennessee Department of Financial Institutions ("TDFI"). As a member of the Federal Reserve System, SmartBank is also subject to supervision, regulation, and examination by the Federal Reserve. In addition, SmartBank’s deposit accounts are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC"), and SmartBank is subject to regulation by the FDIC as the insurer of its deposits.
The bank and bank holding company regulatory scheme has two primary goals: to maintain a safe and sound banking system and to facilitate the conduct of sound monetary policy. This comprehensive system of supervision and regulation is intended primarily for the protection of the FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund, bank depositors, and the public, rather than SmartFinancial’s stockholders or creditors. To this end, federal and state banking laws and regulations control, among other things, the types of activities in which SmartFinancial and SmartBank may engage, permissible investments that SmartFinancial and SmartBank may make, the level of reserves that SmartBank must maintain against deposits, minimum equity capital levels, the nature and amount of collateral required for loans, maximum interest rates that can be charged, the ability of SmartFinancial and SmartBank to pay dividends and the amount of dividends paid, and corporate activities regarding mergers, acquisitions, and the establishment and closing of branch offices. In addition, federal and state laws impose substantial requirements on SmartBank in the areas of consumer protection and detection and reporting of potential or suspected money laundering and terrorist financing activities.

The sections below summarize certain elements of the bank holding company and bank regulatory framework applicable to SmartFinancial and SmartBank. This summary is not, however, intended to describe all laws, regulations, and policies applicable to SmartFinancial and SmartBank, and you should refer to the full text of the referenced statutes, regulations, and corresponding guidance for more information. These statutes and regulations are subject to change, and additional statutes, regulations, and corresponding guidance may be adopted. Proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the banking industry are frequently raised at both the state and federal level. We are unable to predict any such future changes or the effects, if any, that any such changes could have on SmartFinancial’s business, revenues, and financial results.
Regulation of SmartFinancial 
As a regulated bank holding company, SmartFinancial is subject to various laws and regulations that affect SmartFinancial’s business. These laws and regulations, among other things, prescribe minimum capital requirements, limit transactions with affiliates, impose limitations on the business activities in which SmartFinancial can engage, restrict SmartFinancial’s ability to pay dividends to its stockholders, restrict the ability of institutions to guarantee its debt, and impose certain specific accounting requirements on SmartFinancial that may be more restrictive and may result in greater or earlier charges to earnings or reductions in its capital than generally accepted accounting principles.

Permitted Activities
Under the BHC Act, a bank holding company that is not a financial holding company (as discussed below) is generally permitted to engage in, or acquire direct or indirect control of more than 5 percent of any class of the voting shares of any company that is not a bank or bank holding company and that is engaged in, the following activities (in each case subject to certain conditions and restrictions and prior approval of the Federal Reserve):

• | banking or managing or controlling banks;


• | furnishing services to or performing services for its subsidiaries; and


• | any activity that the Federal Reserve determines by regulation or order to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident to the business of banking, including, for example, factoring accounts receivable, making, acquiring, brokering, or servicing loans and usual related activities, leasing personal or real property, operating a nonbank depository institution, such as a savings association, performing trust company functions, conducting financial and investment advisory activities, underwriting and dealing in government obligations and money market instruments, performing selected insurance underwriting activities, issuing and selling money orders and similar consumer-type payment instruments, and engaging in certain community development activities.

While the Federal Reserve has in the past found these activities acceptable for other bank holding companies, the Federal Reserve may not allow SmartFinancial to conduct any or all of these activities, which are reviewed by the Federal Reserve on a case by case basis upon application by a bank holding company.
Acquisitions Subject to Prior Regulatory Approval
The BHC Act generally requires the prior approval of the Federal Reserve for a bank holding company to acquire substantially all the assets of a bank or to acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5 percent of any class of the voting shares of any bank, bank holding company, savings and loan holding company, or savings association, or to increase any such non-majority ownership or control of any bank, bank holding company, savings and loan holding company, or savings association, or to merge or consolidate with any bank holding company.
Under the BHC Act, a bank holding company that is located in Tennessee and is “well capitalized” and “well managed”, as such terms are defined under the BHC Act and implementing regulations, may purchase a bank located outside of Tennessee. Conversely, a well-capitalized and well-managed bank holding company located outside of Tennessee may purchase a bank located inside Tennessee. In each case, however, restrictions may be placed on the acquisition of a bank that has only been in existence for a limited amount of time or will result in concentrations of deposits exceeding limits specified by statute. 
Federal and state laws, including the BHC Act and the Change in Bank Control Act, impose additional prior notice or approval requirements and ongoing regulatory requirements on any investor that seeks to acquire direct or indirect “control” of an FDIC-insured depository institution or bank holding company. “Control” of a depository institution or bank holding company is a facts and circumstances analysis, but generally an investor is deemed to control a depository institution or bank holding company if the investor owns or controls 25 percent or more of any class of voting securities. Ownership or control of 10 percent or more of any class of voting securities, where either the depository institution or bank holding company is a public company, like SmartFinancial, or no other person will own or control a greater percentage of that class of voting securities after the acquisition, is also presumed to result in the investor controlling the depository institution or bank holding company, although this is subject to rebuttal.
The BHC Act was substantially amended through the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999, commonly referred to as the Gramm-Leach Bliley Act, or the GLBA. The GLBA eliminated long-standing barriers to affiliations among banks, securities firms, insurance companies, and other financial services providers. A bank holding company whose subsidiary deposit institutions are “well capitalized” and “well managed” may elect to become a “financial holding company” and thereby engage without prior Federal Reserve approval in certain banking and non-banking activities that are deemed to be financial in nature or incidental to financial activity. These “financial in nature” activities include securities underwriting, dealing, and market making; organizing, sponsoring, and managing mutual funds; insurance underwriting and agency; merchant banking activities; and other activities that the Federal Reserve has determined to be closely related to banking. Generally, no regulatory approval is required for a financial holding company to acquire a company, other than a bank or savings association, engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature, as determined by the Federal Reserve. SmartFinancial has not elected to become a financial holding company. 
8

A dominant theme of the GLBA is functional regulation of financial services, with the primary regulator of a company or its subsidiaries being the agency which traditionally regulates the activity in which the company or its subsidiaries wish to engage. For example, the SEC regulates bank holding company securities transactions, and the various banking regulators oversee banking activities.
Bank Holding Company Obligations to Bank Subsidiaries
Under current law and Federal Reserve policy, a bank holding company is expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to its depository institution subsidiaries and to maintain resources adequate to support such subsidiaries, which could require SmartFinancial to commit resources to support SmartBank in situations where additional investments may not otherwise be warranted. As a result of these obligations, a bank holding company may be required to contribute additional capital to its subsidiaries.
Bank Holding Company Dividends
The Federal Reserve’s policy regarding dividends generally is that a bank holding company should not declare or pay a cash dividend which would impose undue pressure on the capital of any bank subsidiary or would be funded only through borrowing or other arrangements that might adversely affect a bank holding company’s financial position. As a general matter, the Federal Reserve has indicated that the board of directors of a bank holding company should consult with the Federal Reserve and eliminate, defer, or significantly reduce the bank holding company’s dividends if:

• | the company’s net income available to stockholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends;


• | the company’s prospective rate of earnings retention is not consistent with its capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition; or


• | the company will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios.

If an insured member bank controlled by a bank holding company becomes “significantly undercapitalized” under the applicable federal bank capital ratios, or if the bank is “undercapitalized” and has failed to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan or has materially failed to implement such a plan, the Federal Reserve may require prior approval for any capital distribution by the bank holding company. For more information, see “Capitalization Levels and Prompt Corrective Action” below.
In addition, because SmartFinancial is a legal entity separate and distinct from SmartBank and does not conduct stand-alone operations, the company’s ability to pay dividends largely depends on the ability of SmartBank to pay dividends to SmartFinancial, which is also subject to regulatory restrictions as described below in “Bank Dividends.”
Under Tennessee law, SmartFinancial is not permitted to pay cash dividends if, after giving effect to the payment of such dividends, the company would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of business or its total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus any amounts needed to satisfy any preferential rights if it were dissolving. 

Dodd-Frank Act
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (which we refer to as the “Dodd-Frank Act”) significantly changed the regulatory structure for financial institutions like SmartBank and their holding companies with respect to lending, deposit, investment, trading, and operating activities. Although the Dodd-Frank Act is primarily aimed at the activities of investment banks and large commercial banks, many of the provisions of the legislation impact the operations of community banks like SmartBank. The following aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act are, or may be, applicable to SmartFinancial’s or SmartBank’s operations: 


• | Tier 1 capital treatment for certain “hybrid” capital items such as trust preferred securities was eliminated, subject to various grandfathering and transition rules.


• | The deposit insurance assessment base calculation now equals a depository institution’s average consolidated total assets minus its average tangible equity during the assessment period. Previously, the deposit insurance assessment was calculated based on the insured deposits held by the institution.


• | The ceiling on the size of the Deposit Insurance Fund was removed and the minimum designated reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund increased 20 basis points to 1.35 percent of estimated annual insured deposits or assessment base. The FDIC also was directed to offset the effect of the increased reserve ratio for insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion.


• | Bank holding companies and banks must be “well capitalized” and “well managed” in order to acquire banks located outside of their home state, which codified longstanding Federal Reserve policy. Any bank holding

company electing to be treated as a financial holding company must be and remain “well capitalized” and “well managed.”

• | Capital requirements for insured depository institutions are now countercyclical, such that capital requirements increase in times of economic expansion and decrease in times of economic contraction.


• | The Federal Reserve established interchange transaction fees for electronic debit transactions under a restrictive “reasonable and proportional cost” per transaction standard.


• | The “opt in” provisions of the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1997 have been eliminated, which allows a state bank to establish de novo branches in a state other than the bank’s home state if the law of such other state would permit a bank chartered in that state to open a branch at that location.


• | The Durbin Amendment limits interchange fees payable on debit card transactions for financial institutions with more than $10 billion in assets. While the Durbin Amendment does not directly apply to SmartBank, competitive market forces related to the reduction mandated by the Durbin Amendment may result in a decrease in revenue from interchange fees for smaller financial institutions.


• | The prohibition on the payment of interest on demand deposit accounts was repealed effective one year after enactment, thereby permitting depository institutions to pay interest on business checking and other accounts.


• | A new federal agency was created, the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (also known as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB), which has broad rulemaking, supervisory, and enforcement authority over consumer financial products and services, including deposit products, residential mortgages, home-equity loans, and credit cards. The CFPB is also responsible for examining large financial institutions (i.e., those with more than $10 billion in assets) for, and enforcing, compliance with federal consumer financial protection laws and regulations.


• | The regulation of consumer protections relative to mortgage originations, addressing loan originator compensation, minimum repayment standards, including restrictions on variable-rate lending by requiring the ability to repay be determined based on the maximum rate that will apply during the first five years of a variable-rate loan term, prepayment considerations, and new disclosures, has been expanded.

Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act
On May 24, 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (which we refer to as the “Regulatory Relief Act”) was enacted to modify or remove certain financial reform rules and regulations, including some of those implemented under the Dodd-Frank Act. While it maintains the majority of the regulatory structure established by the Dodd-Frank Act, the Regulatory Relief Act amends certain aspects for smaller depository institutions with less than $10 billion in assets, such as SmartBank. Portions of the Regulatory Relief Act address access to mortgage credit; consumer access to credit; protections for veterans, consumers, and homeowners; rules for certain bank holding companies; capital access; and protections for student borrowers. SmartFinancial and SmartBank will focus on the implementing rules, regulations, and guidance for the various provisions of the Regulatory Relief Act that impact their operations and activities.
Among other things, the Regulatory Relief Act simplifies the regulatory capital rules for financial institutions and their holding companies with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion. The Regulatory Relief Act requires federal banking agencies to develop a community bank leverage ratio (defined as the ratio of tangible equity capital to average total consolidated assets) for banks and holding companies with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion and an appropriate risk profile. The required regulations must specify a minimum community bank leverage ratio of not less than 8 percent and not more than 10 percent, as well as procedures for treatment of a qualifying banking organization that has a community bank leverage ratio that falls below the required minimum. Qualifying banking organizations that exceed the minimum community bank leverage ratio will be deemed to be in compliance with all other capital and leverage requirements. On November 21, 2018, pursuant to the Regulatory Relief Act, the federal banking agencies issued a notice of proposed rulemaking proposing a community bank leverage ratio of 9 percent. The comment period for the proposed rule has since closed, but the regulation is not yet finalized. The final minimum community bank leverage ratio is not known at this time. 
The Regulatory Relief Act also expands the universe of holding companies that are permitted to rely on the “Small Bank Holding Company and Savings and Loan Holding Company Policy Statement” (which we refer to as the “Small BHC Policy Statement”). The asset size of a qualifying holding company was increased from $1 billion to $3 billion on August 30, 2018, thus excluding holding companies with less than $3 billion in total consolidated assets from consolidated capital requirements. 
10

Further, the Regulatory Relief Act decreased the burden for community banks in regards to call reports, the Volcker Rule (which generally restricts banks from engaging in certain investment activities and limits involvement with hedge funds and private equity firms), mortgage disclosures, and risk weights for some high-risk commercial real estate loans. On December 28, 2018, the federal banking agencies issued a final rule under the Regulatory Relief Act increasing the asset threshold to qualify for an 18-month on-site examination cycle from $1 billion to $3 billion for qualifying institutions that are well capitalized, well managed, and meet certain other requirements. 
As of December 31, 2018, SmartFinancial had total consolidated assets of approximately $2.3 billion, meaning that it could qualify to rely on the Small BHC Policy Statement and qualify for an 18-month on-site examination cycle. However, in the event the Entegra merger is completed, SmartFinancial would have total consolidated assets of more than $3 billion and would not qualify for these regulatory relief measures. 
The Dodd-Frank Act, even despite the regulatory relief afforded by the Regulatory Relief Act, or any number of the provisions of the Regulatory Relief Act itself, may have the effect of increasing SmartFinancial’s and SmartBank’s expenses, decreasing their revenues, and changing the activities in which they choose to engage. The environment in which banking organizations operate is ever-evolving and any number of changes, whether legal, regulatory, social, economic, or otherwise, may have long-term effects on the profitability of banking organizations that cannot now be foreseen. It is particularly difficult at this time to determine or predict the impact of the Regulatory Relief Act on SmartFinancial and SmartBank, in part because various implementing rules and regulations are required and many of these have not yet been written or finalized. 
U.S. Basel III Capital Rules 
The U.S. Basel III capital rules, which were effective January 1, 2015, currently apply to all national and state banks and savings associations and certain, generally larger, bank holding companies (which we refer to collectively as “covered banking organizations”). The requirements in the U.S. Basel III capital rules started to phase in on January 1, 2015, for many covered banking organizations, including SmartFinancial and SmartBank, and were fully phased in on January 1, 2019.
In recent years, bank holding companies with less than $1 billion in total consolidated assets and that are not engaged in significant nonbanking activities, do not conduct significant off-balance sheet activities, and do not have a material amount of debt or equity securities registered with the SEC have been exempt from the Federal Reserve’s consolidated capital requirements under the Small BHC Policy Statement. As discussed above, the Regulatory Relief Act increased the asset threshold for bank holding companies to qualify for the Small BHC Policy Statement from $1 billion to $3 billion. Accordingly, SmartFinancial currently is not subject to the Federal Reserve’s consolidated capital requirements (as of December 31, 2018, SmartFinancial had total consolidated assets of approximately $2.3 billion), but will become subject to these requirements if and when it reaches $3 billion in total consolidated assets. Despite SmartFinancial currently being exempt from these requirements, SmartBank remains subject to minimum capital requirements. In the event the Entegra merger is completed, however, SmartFinancial would have total consolidated assets of more than $3 billion and would become subject to the Federal Reserve’s consolidated capital requirements.
The U.S. Basel III capital rules impose the following minimum capital requirements:


• | a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.5 percent;


• | a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6 percent;


• | a total risk-based capital ratio of 8 percent;


• | a leverage ratio of 4 percent; and


• | for a very small number of the largest financial institutions in the United States, an enhanced supplementary leverage ratio of 3 percent.

Under the U.S. Basel III capital rules, Tier 1 capital is defined to include two components: common equity Tier 1 capital and additional Tier 1 capital. The highest form of capital, common equity Tier 1 capital, or CET1 capital, consists solely of common stock (plus related surplus), retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive income, and limited amounts of minority interests that are in the form of common stock. Additional Tier 1 capital includes other perpetual instruments historically included in Tier 1 capital, such as non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock.
11

The rules permit bank holding companies with less than $15.0 billion in total consolidated assets, such as SmartFinancial, to continue to include trust-preferred securities and cumulative perpetual preferred stock issued before May 19, 2010, in Tier 1 capital, but not in CET1 capital, subject to certain restrictions. Tier 2 capital consists of an institution’s allowance for loan and lease losses, up to 1.25 percent of risk-weighted assets; qualifying perpetual preferred stock (and related surplus); certain qualifying hybrid capital instruments, perpetual debt, and mandatory convertible debt; certain qualifying subordinated debt instruments and intermediate-term preferred stock (and related surplus), subject to limitations; and a percentage of pretax net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair values.
In addition, in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions or discretionary bonus payments to executives, a covered banking organization must maintain a capital conservation buffer on top of its minimum risk-based capital requirements. This buffer must consist solely of Tier 1 common equity, but the buffer applies to all three risk-based capital measurements (common equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital, and total capital). The capital conservation buffer, which was phased in incrementally over time and became fully phased in on January 1, 2019, consists of an additional amount of common equity Tier 1 capital equal to 2.5 percent of risk-weighted assets.
The U.S. Basel III capital standards require certain deductions from or adjustments to capital. Deductions from CET1 capital are required for goodwill (net of associated deferred tax liabilities); intangible assets such as non-mortgage servicing assets and purchased credit card relationships (net of associated deferred tax liabilities); deferred tax assets that arise from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards (net of any related valuation allowances and net of deferred tax liabilities); any gain on sale in connection with a securitization exposure; any defined benefit pension fund net asset (net of any associated deferred tax liabilities) held by a bank holding company (this provision does not apply to a bank or savings association); the aggregate amount of outstanding equity investments (including retained earnings) in financial subsidiaries; and identified losses. Other deductions are necessary from different levels of capital. The U.S. Basel III capital rules generally also increased the risk weight for certain assets, meaning that more capital must be held against those assets. For example, under Basel III, commercial real estate loans that do not meet certain underwriting requirements must be risk-weighted at 150 percent, rather than at 100 percent which was the case prior to the U.S. Basel III capital rules becoming effective; however, the Regulatory Relief Act has reversed this for community banks with respect to some commercial real estate loans.
Additionally, the U.S. Basel III capital standards provide for the deduction of three categories of assets: (i) deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences that cannot be realized through net operating loss carrybacks (net of related valuation allowances and of deferred tax liabilities), (ii) mortgage servicing assets (net of associated deferred tax liabilities), and (iii) investments in more than 10 percent of the issued and outstanding common stock of unconsolidated financial institutions (net of associated deferred tax liabilities). The amount in each category that exceeds 10 percent of CET1 capital must be deducted from CET1 capital. The remaining, non-deducted amounts are then aggregated, and the amount by which this total amount exceeds 15 percent of CET1 capital must be deducted from CET1 capital. Amounts of minority investments in consolidated subsidiaries that exceed certain limits and investments in unconsolidated financial institutions may also have to be deducted from the category of capital to which such instruments belong.
Accumulated other comprehensive income, or AOCI, is presumptively included in CET1 capital and often would operate to reduce this category of capital. The U.S. Basel III capital rules provided a one-time opportunity at the end of the first quarter of 2015 for covered banking organizations to opt out of much of this treatment of AOCI, and SmartFinancial elected to opt out. The rules also have had the effect of increasing capital requirements by increasing the risk weights on certain assets, including high volatility commercial real estate (as discussed above), mortgage servicing rights not includable in CET1 capital, equity exposures, and claims on securities firms, which are used in the denominator of the three risk-based capital ratios.
As discussed above under “Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act,” pursuant to the Regulatory Relief Act, federal banking agencies have proposed a new minimum community bank leverage ratio (defined as the ratio of tangible equity capital to average total consolidated assets) of 9 percent for banks and holding companies with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion and an appropriate risk profile. Qualifying banking organizations that exceed the minimum community bank leverage ratio would be deemed to be in compliance with all other risk-based and leverage capital requirements. At the same time, the agencies proposed corresponding capital adequacy levels. As proposed, a qualifying banking organization with a community bank leverage ratio of greater than 9 percent would be considered “well capitalized”; a qualifying banking organization with a community bank leverage ratio of 7.5 percent or greater would be considered “adequately capitalized”; a qualifying banking organization with a community bank leverage ratio of less than 7.5 percent would be considered “undercapitalized”; and a qualifying banking organization with a community bank leverage ratio of less than 6 percent would be considered “significantly capitalized” and would be required to provide its primary regulator with additional information in order to determine whether such organization would be classified as “critically undercapitalized.” The comment period for these proposed rules has closed, but the regulation is not yet finalized.

SmartFinancial management believes that SmartFinancial and SmartBank would meet all capital adequacy requirements under the community bank leverage ratio capital rules if such rules were currently effective.
The Regulatory Relief Act also makes important changes to the “prompt corrective action” framework discussed below in “Regulation of SmartBank-Capitalization Levels and Prompt Corrective Action.”
Anti-Tying Restrictions 
Bank holding companies and their affiliates are prohibited from tying the provision of certain services, such as extensions of credit, to other nonbanking services offered by a bank holding company or its affiliates.
Executive Compensation and Corporate Governance
The Dodd-Frank Act generally requires public companies to include, at least once every three years, a separate non-binding “say on pay” vote in their proxy statement to allow stockholders the opportunity to vote on the compensation of the company’s named executive officers. In addition, if such public companies are involved in a merger, acquisition, or consolidation, or if they propose to sell or dispose of all or substantially all of their assets, stockholders generally have a right to an advisory vote on any golden parachute arrangements in connection with such transaction (frequently referred to as “say-on-golden parachute” vote). Other provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act may also impact SmartFinancial’s corporate governance. For instance, the Dodd-Frank Act required the SEC to adopt rules directing the national securities exchanges to prohibit the listing of any equity security of a company that does not have an independent compensation committee and requiring all exchange-traded companies to adopt clawback policies for incentive compensation paid to executive officers in the event of accounting restatements based on material non-compliance with financial reporting requirements.
Regulation of SmartBank
As a Tennessee-chartered commercial bank, SmartBank is subject to supervision, regulation, and examination by the TDFI, and, as a member of the Federal Reserve System, SmartBank is also subject to supervision, regulation, and examination by the Federal Reserve. Federal and state laws and regulations affect virtually all aspects of SmartBank’s operations, including its capital requirements, its ability to pay dividends, mergers and acquisitions, limitations on the amount that it can loan to a single borrower and related interests, permissible investments, and geographic and new product expansion, among other things. SmartBank generally must submit an application to, and receive the approval of, the TDFI and Federal Reserve before opening a new branch office or merging with another financial institution. The Commissioner of the TDFI and the Federal Reserve have the authority to enforce laws and regulations by ordering SmartBank, or a director, officer, or employee of SmartBank, to cease and desist from violating a law or regulation or from engaging in unsafe or unsound banking practices and by imposing other sanctions, including civil money penalties.

Tennessee law contains limitations on the interest rates that may be charged on various types of loans and restrictions on the nature and amount of loans that may be granted. and on the type of investments which may be made, by Tennessee-chartered banks. Tennessee-chartered banks are also subject to regulation by the TDFI with regard to capital requirements and the payment of dividends. 
Tennessee has adopted the provisions of the Federal Reserve’s Regulation O with respect to restrictions on loans and other extensions of credit to bank “insiders.” Further, under Tennessee law, state banks are prohibited from lending to any one person, firm, or corporation amounts more than 15 percent of the bank’s equity capital accounts, except, (i) in the case of certain loans secured by negotiable title documents covering readily marketable nonperishable staples or (ii) with the prior approval of the bank’s board of directors or finance committee (however titled), the bank may make a loan to any person, firm, or corporation of up to 25 percent of its equity capital accounts. 
Various state and federal consumer laws and regulations also affect the operations of SmartBank, including state usury laws, consumer credit and equal credit opportunity laws, and fair credit reporting laws. In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991, generally prohibits insured state-chartered banks from conducting activities as principal that are not permitted for national banks.
SmartBank’s deposits are insured by the FDIC under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act.
13

Current Expected Credit Loss
A new accounting standard changing the current method for providing allowances for loan losses has been adopted by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. This new standard is referred to as Current Expected Credit Loss (or “CECL”) and becomes effective for SmartBank in 2020. The use of this standard will increase the types of data required to determine the appropriate level of SmartBank’s allowance for loan losses. 
The use of this standard may increase SmartBank’s allowance for loan losses. Any increase in SmartBank’s allowance for loan losses or expenses incurred in order to make the determination for such allowance for loan losses could have a material adverse effect on SmartBank’s financial condition and results of operations. The direct effects of CECL on SmartBank are further discussed in Note 1-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our audited consolidated financial statements.
Capitalization Levels and Prompt Corrective Action
Federal law and regulations establish a capital-based regulatory framework designed to promote early intervention for troubled banks and require the FDIC to choose the least expensive method of resolution in the event of bank failures. The capital-based regulatory framework contains five categories of regulatory capital requirements, including “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized,” and “critically undercapitalized.” Generally, to qualify as a “well capitalized” institution, a bank (i) must have a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of no less than 5 percent, a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of no less than 6.5 percent, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of no less than 8 percent, and a total risk-based capital ratio of no less than 10 percent and (ii) must not be subject to any order or written directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. Generally, a bank is considered “adequately capitalized” if it maintains a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of at least 4 percent, a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 4.5 percent, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6 percent, and a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 8 percent. 
Immediately upon becoming “undercapitalized” (i.e., a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of less than 4 percent, a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.5 percent, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6 percent, or a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8 percent), a depository institution becomes subject to the provisions of Section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, which: (i) restrict payment of capital distributions and management fees; (ii) require that the appropriate federal banking agency monitor the condition of the institution and its efforts to restore its capital; (iii) require submission of a capital restoration plan; (iv) restrict the growth of the institution’s assets; and (v) require prior approval of certain expansion proposals. Additionally, bank holding companies controlling financial institutions can be called upon to boost the institutions’ capital and to partially guarantee the institutions’ performance under their capital restoration plans. The appropriate federal banking agency for an undercapitalized institution also may take any number of discretionary supervisory actions if the agency determines that any of these actions is necessary to resolve the problems of the institution at the least possible long-term cost to the Deposit Insurance Fund, subject in certain cases to specified procedures. These discretionary supervisory actions include: (i) requiring the institution to raise additional capital; (ii) restricting transactions with affiliates; (iii) requiring divestiture of the institution or the sale of the institution to a willing purchaser; (iv) requiring the institution to change and improve its management; (iv) prohibiting the acceptance of deposits from correspondent banks; (v) requiring prior Federal Reserve approval for any capital distribution by a bank holding company controlling the institution; and (vi) any other supervisory action that the agency deems appropriate. These and additional mandatory and permissive supervisory actions may be taken with respect to significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized institutions.
It should be noted that the minimum capital ratios referred to above in this section are merely guidelines, and federal and state bank regulators possess the discretionary authority to require higher capital ratios.
As previously discussed above, the Regulatory Relief Act simplifies the regulatory capital rules for financial institutions and their holding companies with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion. The Regulatory Relief Act requires federal banking agencies to develop a community bank leverage ratio (defined as the ratio of tangible equity capital to average total consolidated assets) for banks and holding companies with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion and an appropriate risk profile. The required regulations must specify a minimum community bank leverage ratio of not less than 8 percent and not more than 10 percent, as well as procedures for treatment of a qualifying community bank that has a community bank leverage ratio that falls below the required minimum. Qualifying banks that exceed the minimum community bank leverage ratio will be deemed to be in compliance with all other capital and leverage requirements. On November 21, 2018, pursuant to the Regulatory Relief Act, the federal banking agencies issued a notice of proposed rulemaking proposing a community bank leverage ratio of 9 percent. The comment period for the proposed rule has since closed, but the regulation is not yet finalized and, therefore, the final minimum community bank leverage ratio is not known at this time. 
Bank Reserves
14

The Federal Reserve requires all depository institutions, even if not members of the Federal Reserve System, to maintain reserves against some transaction accounts (primarily demand deposit and negotiable order of withdrawal (NOW) accounts). The balances maintained to meet the reserve requirements imposed by the Federal Reserve may be used to satisfy liquidity requirements. An institution may borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank “discount window” as a secondary source of funds, provided that the institution meets the Federal Reserve Bank’s credit standards.
Bank Dividends
Under federal law, an insured depository institution may not pay a dividend if it is undercapitalized or if paying the dividend would cause the institution to become undercapitalized. Tennessee law also places restrictions on the declaration and payment of dividends by state-chartered banks. For example, under Tennessee law, the board of directors of a Tennessee-chartered bank may only declare dividends from the surplus profits arising from the business of the bank and may not declare dividends in any calendar year that exceed the total of the bank’s retained net income of that year combined with its retained net income of the preceding two years without the prior approval of the Commissioner of the TDFI. Tennessee law also requires certain charges against and transfers from an institution’s undivided profits account before undivided profits can be made available for the payment of dividends. Furthermore, the TDFI also has the authority to prohibit the payment of dividends by a Tennessee-chartered bank when it determines payment of those dividends to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice.
Insurance of Accounts and Other Assessments
SmartBank pays deposit insurance assessments to the Deposit Insurance Fund, which are determined through a risk-based assessment system. SmartBank’s deposit accounts are currently insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund, generally up to a maximum of $250,000 per separately insured depositor. SmartBank pays assessments to the FDIC for such deposit insurance. Under the current assessment system, the FDIC assigns an institution to a risk category based on the institution’s most recent supervisory and capital evaluations, which are designed to measure risk. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, the FDIC may terminate a bank’s deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order, agreement, or condition imposed by the FDIC.
In addition, all FDIC-insured institutions are required to pay assessments to the FDIC to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation, or FICO, a federal government corporation established to recapitalize the predecessor to the Savings Association Insurance Fund. These assessments will continue until the last of the FICO bonds mature in 2019.
Restrictions on Transactions with Affiliates
SmartBank is also subject to federal laws that restrict certain transactions between it and its nonbank affiliates. An affiliate of a bank generally is any company or entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the bank, including, in the case of SmartBank, SmartFinancial. Under Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act (which we refer to as the “FRA”) and the Federal Reserve’s Regulation W, covered transactions by SmartBank with a single nonbank affiliate are generally limited to 10 percent of SmartBank’s capital and surplus and 20 percent of capital and surplus for all covered transactions with all nonbank affiliates. The definition of “covered transactions” includes transactions such as a loan by a bank to an affiliate, an investment by a bank in an affiliate, or a purchase by a bank of assets from an affiliate. A loan by a bank to a nonbank affiliate must be secured by collateral valued at 100 percent to 130 percent of the loan amount, depending on the type of collateral, and certain low quality assets and securities of an affiliate may not serve as collateral. 
All such transactions must generally be consistent with safe and sound banking practices and must be on terms that are no less favorable to the bank than those that would be available from nonaffiliated third parties. Moreover, state banking laws impose restrictions on affiliate transactions similar to those imposed by federal law. Federal Reserve policies also prohibit the payment by bank subsidiaries of management fees which are unreasonable in amount or exceed the fair market value of the services rendered or, if no market exists, actual costs plus a reasonable profit.
15

Loans to Insiders
Loans to executive officers or directors of a bank, or to any person who directly or indirectly, or acting through or in concert with one or more persons, owns, controls, or has the power to vote more than 10 percent of any class of voting securities of a bank, or to any related interest of those persons, including any company controlled by such persons, are subject to Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the FRA and their corresponding regulations, which are commonly referred to as “Regulation O.” Among other things, these loans must be made on terms substantially the same as those prevailing in transactions made to unaffiliated individuals and certain extensions of credit to these persons must first be approved in advance by a disinterested majority of the bank’s entire board of directors. Regulation O generally prohibits loans to any of these persons where the aggregate amount exceeds an amount equal to 15 percent of an institution’s unimpaired capital and surplus plus an additional 10 percent of unimpaired capital and surplus in the case of loans that are fully secured by certain readily marketable collateral, or when the aggregate amount on all of the extensions of credit outstanding to all of these persons would exceed the bank’s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus. Section 22(g) identifies limited circumstances in which a bank is permitted to extend credit to its executive officers.
Community Reinvestment Act
The Community Reinvestment Act (which we refer to as the “CRA”) and its corresponding regulations are intended to encourage banks to help meet the credit needs of their service areas, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with safe and sound operations. The CRA and its regulations provide for regulatory assessment of a bank’s record in meeting the credit needs of its service area. Federal banking agencies are required to make public the rating of a bank’s performance under the CRA. The federal banking agencies consider a bank’s CRA rating when a bank submits an application to establish banking centers, merge, or acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of another bank. In the case of an application by a bank holding company for approval of a merger or acquisition, the CRA performance record of all banks involved in the merger or acquisition are reviewed in connection with the application filing. An unsatisfactory record of CRA compliance can substantially delay, block, or result in the imposition of conditions in connection with expansionary activities. SmartBank’s last CRA performance evaluation was in August 2016, and SmartBank was assigned a rating of “Satisfactory.”
Branching
The Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 (which we refer to as the “Riegle-Neal Act”) provides that adequately capitalized and managed bank holding companies are permitted to acquire banks in any state. Previously, under the Riegle-Neal Act, a bank’s ability to branch into a particular state was largely dependent upon whether that state “opted in” to de novo interstate branching. Many states did not “opt-in,” which resulted in branching restrictions in those states. The Dodd-Frank Act amended the Riegle-Neal Act legal framework for interstate branching to permit national banks and state banks to establish de novo branches in any state if that state would permit the establishment of the branch by a state bank chartered in that state. Under current Tennessee law, SmartBank may open branch offices throughout Tennessee with the prior approval of the TDFI and adherence to applicable legal requirements.
Bank Secrecy Act
The Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act of 1970, better known as the “Bank Secrecy Act,” requires all United States financial institutions to assist United States government agencies to detect and prevent money laundering. Specifically, the Bank Secrecy Act requires financial institutions to keep records of cash purchases of negotiable instruments, file reports of cash transactions exceeding a daily aggregate amount of $10,000, and to report suspicious activity that might signify money laundering, tax evasion, or other criminal activities, and to obtain and retain information regarding the identify and verification of the beneficial owners of business customers.
Anti-Money Laundering and Economic Sanctions
The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (better known as the “USA PATRIOT Act”) provides the federal government with additional powers to address terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures, expanded surveillance powers, increased information sharing, and broadened anti-money laundering requirements. By way of amendments to the Bank Secrecy Act, the USA PATRIOT Act imposed new requirements that obligate financial institutions, such as banks, to take certain steps to control the risks associated with money laundering and terrorist financing.
16

Among other requirements, the USA PATRIOT Act and its implementing regulations require banks, such as SmartBank, to establish anti-money laundering programs that include, at a minimum:

• | internal policies, procedures, and controls designed to implement and maintain the bank’s compliance with all of the requirements of the USA PATRIOT Act, the Bank Secrecy Act, and related laws and regulations;


• | systems and procedures for monitoring and reporting suspicious transactions and activities;


• | a designated compliance officer;


• | employee training;


• | an independent audit function to test the anti-money laundering program;


• | procedures to verify the identity of each customer upon the opening of accounts;


• | heightened due diligence policies, procedures, and controls applicable to certain foreign accounts and relationships; and


• | ongoing due diligence and monitoring of customer relationships, including the beneficial owners of business customers.

Additionally, the USA PATRIOT Act requires each financial institution to develop a customer identification program, or CIP, as part of the bank’s anti-money laundering program. The key components of the CIP are identification, verification, government list comparison, notice, and record retention. The purpose of the CIP is to enable the financial institution to determine the true identity and anticipated account activity of each customer. To make this determination, among other things, the financial institution must collect certain information from customers at the time they enter into the customer relationship with the financial institution. This information must be verified within a reasonable time through documentary and non-documentary methods. Furthermore, all customers must be screened against any CIP-related government lists of known or suspected terrorists. Information regarding the identity and verification of the beneficial owners of business customers must also be obtained and retained. Furthermore, financial institutions are also required to comply with various reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Federal banking regulators consider an applicant’s effectiveness in combating money laundering, among other factors, in connection with an application to approve a bank merger or the acquisition of control of a bank or bank holding company.
The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (which we refer to as “OFAC”) is responsible for helping to ensure that United States entities do not engage in transactions with the subjects of U.S. sanctions, as defined by various executive orders and acts of Congress. Currently, OFAC administers and enforces comprehensive U.S. economic sanctions programs against certain specified countries/regions. In addition to the country/region-wide sanctions programs, OFAC also administers complete embargoes against individuals and entities identified on OFAC’s list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons, or “SDN List.” The SDN List includes thousands of parties that are located in many jurisdictions throughout the world, including in the United States and Europe. SmartBank is responsible for determining whether any potential and/or existing customers appear on the SDN List or are owned or controlled by a person on the SDN List. If any customer appears on the SDN List or is owned or controlled by a person or entity on the SDN List, such customer’s account must be placed on hold and a blocking or rejection report, as appropriate and if required, must be filed within 10 business days with OFAC. In addition, if a customer is a citizen of, has provided an address in, or is organized under the laws of any country or region for which OFAC maintains a comprehensive sanctions program, SmartBank must take certain actions with respect to such customer as dictated under the relevant OFAC sanctions program. SmartBank must maintain compliance with OFAC by implementing appropriate policies and procedures and by establishing a recordkeeping system that is reasonably appropriate to administer SmartBank’s compliance program. SmartBank has adopted policies, procedures, and controls to comply with the Bank Secrecy Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, and OFAC regulations.
Privacy and Data Security
Under the GLBA, federal banking regulators adopted rules limiting the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties. The rules require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to nonaffiliated third parties. The GLBA also directed federal regulators to prescribe standards for the security of consumer information. SmartBank is subject to these standards, as well as standards for notifying customers in the event of a security breach. Laws, regulations, and guidance related to data protection, consumer privacy, third party vendor management, disaster recovery, and information security continue to develop and change as a result of the rapid increase in and evolution of electronic bank products and services. The federal banking agencies are likely to spend time developing additional rules, regulations, and guidance on the subject of cyber security in response to recent cyber-attacks against financial institutions and continued development of electronic and online banking products and services. 
17

Consumer Laws and Regulations
SmartBank is also subject to other federal and state consumer-related laws and regulations that are designed to protect consumers in transactions with banks. These laws and regulations include, among others, the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Fair and Accurate Transactions Act, the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, the Military Lending Act, the Mortgage Disclosure Improvement Act, and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act. These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with consumers when offering consumer financial products and services.
Rulemaking authority for these and other consumer financial protection laws transferred from the prudential regulators to the CFPB on July 21, 2011. In some cases, regulators such as the Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the U.S. Department of Justice also retain certain rulemaking or enforcement authority. The CFPB also has broad authority to prohibit unfair, deceptive, and abusive acts and practices and to investigate and penalize financial institutions that violate this prohibition. While the statutory language of the Dodd-Frank Act sets forth the standards for acts and practices that violate the prohibition on unfair, deceptive, and abusive acts and practices, certain aspects of these standards are untested and it is currently not possible to predict how the CFPB will exercise this authority. In addition, consumer compliance examination authority remains with the prudential regulators for smaller depository institutions (i.e., those with $10 billion or less in total assets). 
Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFPB established certain minimum standards for the origination of residential mortgages, including a requirement to determine the borrower’s ability to repay. The Dodd-Frank Act generally prohibits a financial institution from making a residential mortgage loan unless the institution makes a “reasonable and good faith determination” that the consumer has a “reasonable ability” to repay the loan. The Dodd-Frank Act allows borrowers to raise certain defenses to a foreclosure action if a financial institution has not complied with the ability to repay requirements, but also provides a full or partial safe harbor from such defenses for loans that are “qualified mortgages.” The CFPB’s implementing rules define a “qualified mortgage” to have certain specified characteristics, and generally prohibit loans with negative amortization, interest-only payments, balloon payments, or terms exceeding 30 years from being qualified mortgages. The rules also establishes general underwriting criteria for qualified mortgages, including that monthly payments be calculated based on the highest payment that will apply in the first five years of the loan and that the borrower have a total debt-to-income ratio that is less than or equal to 43 percent. The Regulatory Relief Act has expanded the qualified mortgage safe harbor for financial institutions with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion to generally include loans that the institution retains in portfolio and that comply with existing limits on prepayment penalties, that comply with existing limits on total points and fees of 3 percent of the loan amount, that do not have negative amortization or interest-only features, and for which the institution has considered and documented the consumer’s debt, income, and financial resources. 
FIRREA and FDICIA
Far-reaching legislation, including the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (which we refer to as “FIRREA”) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (which we refer to as “FDICIA”), has impacted the business of banking for years. FIRREA primarily affected the regulation of savings institutions, rather than the regulation of commercial banks and bank holding companies like SmartBank and SmartFinancial, but did include provisions affecting deposit insurance premiums, acquisitions of thrifts by banks and bank holding companies, liability of commonly controlled depository institutions, and receivership and conservatorship rights and procedures, and substantially increased penalties for violations of banking laws, regulations, and orders.
FDICIA resulted in extensive changes to the federal banking laws. The primary purpose of FDICIA was to authorize additional borrowings by the FDIC in order to assist in the resolution of failed and failing financial institutions. However, the law also instituted certain changes to the supervisory process and contained various provisions affecting the operations of banks and bank holding companies.
The additional supervisory powers and regulations mandated by FDICIA include a “prompt corrective action” program based upon five regulatory zones for banks, in which banks are placed largely based on their capital positions. Regulators are permitted to take increasingly harsh action as a bank’s financial condition declines. Regulators are also empowered to place a bank in receivership or require the sale of a bank to another depository institution when the bank’s ratio of tangible equity to total assets reaches 2 percent. Better capitalized institutions are generally subject to less onerous regulation and supervision than banks with lesser amounts of capital. The Federal Reserve has adopted regulations implementing the prompt corrective action provisions of 
18

FDICIA, which place financial institutions into one of the following five categories based upon capitalization ratios (as these ratios have been revised following the implementation of Basel III): 

• | a “well capitalized” institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10 percent, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8 percent, a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6.5 percent, and a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of at least 5 percent;


• | an “adequately capitalized” institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 8 percent, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6 percent, a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 4.5 percent, and a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of at least 4 percent;


• | an “undercapitalized” institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8 percent, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6 percent, a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.5 percent, or a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of less than 4 percent;


• | a “significantly undercapitalized” institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6 percent, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4 percent, a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 3 percent, or a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of less than 3 percent; and


• | a “critically undercapitalized” institution has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets of 2 percent or less.

Institutions in any of the three undercapitalized categories would generally be prohibited from declaring dividends or making capital distributions. The regulations also establish procedures for “downgrading” an institution to a lower capital category based on supervisory factors other than capital. 
These levels will differ for community banks such as SmartBank who qualify for and elect to use the new community bank leverage ratio pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Relief Act. As previously discussed, the Regulatory Relief Act requires federal banking agencies to develop a community bank leverage ratio (defined as the ratio of tangible equity capital to average total consolidated assets) for banks and holding companies with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion and an appropriate risk profile. The required regulations must specify a minimum community bank leverage ratio of not less than 8 percent and not more than 10 percent, as well as procedures for treatment of a qualifying banking organization that has a community bank leverage ratio that falls below the required minimum. Qualifying banking organizations that exceed the minimum community bank leverage ratio will be deemed to be in compliance with all other risk-based and leverage capital requirements. On November 21, 2018, the federal banking agencies issued a notice of proposed rulemaking proposing a community bank leverage ratio of 9 percent and corresponding capital adequacy levels. As proposed, a qualifying banking organization with a community bank leverage ratio of greater than 9 percent would be considered “well capitalized”; a qualifying banking organization with a community bank leverage ratio of 7.5 percent or greater would be considered “adequately capitalized”; a qualifying banking organization with a community bank leverage ratio of less than 7.5 percent would be considered “undercapitalized”; and a qualifying banking organization with a community bank leverage ratio of less than 6 percent would be considered “significantly capitalized” and would be required to provide its primary regulator with additional information in order to determine whether such organization would be classified as “critically undercapitalized.” The comment period for the proposed rule has closed, but the regulation is not yet finalized.
SmartFinancial's management believes that SmartBank and SmartFinancial would meet all capital adequacy requirements under the community bank leverage ratio capital rules if such rules were currently effective. 
Various other sections of FDICIA impose substantial audit and reporting requirements and increase the role of independent accountants and outside directors. Set forth below is a list of certain other significant requirements under or provisions of FDICIA:

• | annual on-site examinations by regulators (except for smaller, well-capitalized banks with high management ratings, which must be examined every 18 months);


• | mandated annual independent audits by independent public accountants and an independent audit committee of outside directors for institutions with more than $500 million in assets;


• | uniform disclosure requirements for interest rates and terms of deposit accounts;


• | a requirement that the FDIC establish a risk-based deposit insurance assessment system;


• | authorization for the FDIC to impose one or more special assessments on insured banks to recapitalize the bank insurance fund (now called the Deposit Insurance Fund);


• | a requirement that each institution submit to its primary regulators an annual report on its financial condition and management, which report is available to the public;


• | a ban on the acceptance of brokered deposits except by well capitalized institutions and by adequately capitalized institutions with the permission of the FDIC, and the regulation of the brokered deposit market by the FDIC;


• | restrictions on the activities engaged in by state banks and their subsidiaries as principal, including insurance underwriting, to the same activities permissible for national banks and their subsidiaries unless the state bank is

19

well capitalized and a determination is made by the FDIC that the activities do not pose a significant risk to the insurance fund;

• | a review by each regulatory agency of accounting principles applicable to reports or statements required to be filed with federal banking agencies and a mandate to devise uniform requirements for all such filings;


• | the institution by each regulatory agency of noncapital safety and soundness standards for each institution it regulates which cover (i) internal controls, (ii) loan documentation, (iii) credit underwriting, (iv) interest rate exposure, (v) asset growth, (vi) compensation, fees, and benefits paid to employees, officers, and directors, (vii) operational and managerial standards, and (viii) asset quality, earnings, and stock valuation standards for preserving a minimum ratio of market value to book value for publicly traded shares (if feasible);


• | uniform regulations regarding real estate lending; and


• | a review by each regulatory agency of the risk-based capital rules to ensure they take into account adequate interest rate risk, concentration of credit risk, and the risks of non-traditional activities.

Future Legislative Developments
Legislation that could impact SmartFinancial and/or SmartBank is routinely introduced in Congress and the Tennessee legislature. Any such legislation could change current banking laws and the environment in which SmartFinancial and SmartBank operate in significant and unpredictable ways. SmartFinancial cannot now determine the effects (if any) that any such legislation, if enacted, or the regulations implementing the legislation or interpretations of such legislation or regulations, would have on SmartFinancial’s or SmartBank’s business, financial condition, or results of operations.
