ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
We are an independent technology company seeking to maximize customer value by delivering digital advertising’s supply chain of the future. Our sell-side platform empowers the world’s leading digital content creators across the open internet to control access to their inventory and increase monetization by enabling marketers to drive return on investment (“ROI”) and reach addressable audiences across ad formats and devices. Since 2006, our infrastructure-driven approach has allowed for the efficient processing and utilization of data in real time. By delivering scalable and flexible programmatic innovation, we improve outcomes for our customers while championing a vibrant and transparent digital advertising supply chain. 
Our specialized cloud infrastructure platform provides superior monetization for publishers by increasing the value of an impression and providing incremental demand through our deep and growing relationships with buyers. We are aligned with our publisher and app developer partners by being independent. We do not own media and therefore do not have a vested interest in driving ad revenue to specific media properties. Our global platform is omnichannel, supporting a wide array of ad formats and digital device types, including mobile app, mobile web, desktop, display, video, over-the-top (“OTT”), connected television (“CTV”), and rich media. 
We generate revenue from publishers primarily through revenue share agreements, generally one-year contracts that renew automatically for successive one-year periods, unless terminated prior to renewal. We primarily work with publishers and app developers who allow us direct access to their ad inventory, as well as select channel partners that meet our quality and scale thresholds. We refer to our publishers, app developers, and channel partners collectively as our publishers.
We enter into written service agreements with our demand side platform (“DSP”) buyers that allow them to use our platform to buy ad inventory, but we earn revenue from our publishers. Our platform service agreements with DSPs generally have one-year terms that renew automatically for successive one-year periods, unless terminated prior to renewal. We also negotiate Supply Path Optimization (“SPO”) agreements with agencies and advertisers that encourage these buyers to spend a higher share of their advertising budgets on our platform. SPO agreements typically have a one-year term and renewal terms are generally discussed one quarter prior to a new term. The effect of these SPO agreements is to increase the volume of ad spend on our platform without corresponding increases in technology costs. 
Our Industry
As the digital advertising ecosystem continues to evolve, some of the key industry trends are:
Rapid Proliferation of Digital Media Across Multiple Platforms: Consumers have dramatically increased the amount of time that they spend online and on mobile devices and numerous activities that historically occurred offline continue to shift online. In order to better reach consumers, every major media format has transitioned or is in the process of transitioning content from traditional or analog means of delivery to digital. 
The Rise of Programmatic Header Bidding: The challenges of scale and the complexity of the digital advertising ecosystem require an automated and efficient approach to purchasing ads online, known as programmatic advertising. Programmatic advertising, on an automated basis, enables buyers, advertisers, and/or their ad agencies, to purchase ad impressions on publisher supplied inventory, including websites, apps, TVs, and various other formats to transact within milliseconds in a sophisticated, technology-driven marketplace. 
Header bidding, which came to prominence starting in 2016, further increased the complexity of programmatic advertising. Header bidding involves putting software code on a publisher’s website or app allowing it to host a single parallel auction with multiple interested parties simultaneously, rather than the earlier process of sequential auctions for that impression. This innovation has fundamentally transformed programmatic advertising by providing buyers with increased transparency and equal access to ad impressions, which results in greater demand for each ad impression and increased publisher revenue.
Table of Contents

Massive Volumes of Data and Increased Costs: Header bidding has led to a significant increase in the number of ad impressions that need to be processed and analyzed in real-time by each participant in the digital advertising ecosystem. As consumers increasingly engage with digital media, and as advertisers bid on a growing array of ad formats and impressions, an immense amount of data is generated. The data includes anonymized consumer information about interests and intent, log files of winning and losing advertiser bids, and transaction records for billing and payment reconciliation. Technology infrastructure platforms must rapidly process this data while offering a seamless digital ad experience for consumers. 
Growing transaction volumes and increasingly complex data processing requirements can lead to rising overall costs for technology vendors. While header bidding increases the number of SSPs processing each ad impression, the underlying number of opportunities to place a personalized ad in front of a consumer does not grow, which creates processing complexity. Similarly, as SSPs process more ad impressions due to header bidding, so must DSPs. Each of these trends created by header bidding can significantly increase costs for technology providers if not properly addressed with superior technology.
Ad Spending Consolidating on Fewer Sell Side Platforms: As advertisers increase the percentage of their overall advertising budgets spent on digital formats, they are increasingly demanding improved transparency and control of their entire digital advertising supply chain. Transparency includes understanding what fees are being paid for every ad transaction, to whom the fees are being paid, and what value is being delivered by every fee recipient. In addition, transparency allows the advertiser to know the type of ad inventory being purchased and the content appearing adjacent to the advertiser’s ads to avoid purchasing fraudulent or fake inventory or appearing next to content that reflects poorly on the advertiser’s brand. This desire for transparency and control has led to a growing trend for advertisers to establish direct relationships with vendors in the digital advertising ecosystem that have transparent business practices and technical capabilities to meet their objectives. This has resulted in a larger portion of media spend consolidating onto fewer, more transparent technology platforms.
Protecting Consumer Privacy and Regulatory Challenges: There is an increasing awareness of how Internet user data is being leveraged to target ads, resulting in a growing number of privacy laws and regulations being established globally, including the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) in the European Union, the California Consumer Privacy Act (the “CCPA”) and California Privacy Rights Act (the “CPRA”) in California, and the Video Privacy Protection Act in the United States. We believe these trends will continue locally and globally. There have also been a growing number of consumer-focused non-profit organizations and commercial entities advocating for privacy rights. These institutions are enabling Internet consumers to assert their rights over the use of their online data in advertising transactions, a trend which we support.
The digital advertising landscape must continue to adapt to these trends and incorporate awareness of consumer privacy and compliance with regulatory authorities. For example, publishers, and their downstream supply and demand partners, are required to obtain unambiguous opt-in consent from European Union data subjects to process their personal data. In addition to legal and policy requirements, participants in the digital advertising supply chain were encouraged to agree upon technical specifications to collect and transmit detailed records of consent (or an alternative basis for the processing of personal data) and the purposes of that data processing. This demand resulted in widespread adoption of the Interactive Advertising Bureau (the “IAB”) Transparency & Consent Framework 2.0 (the “TCF”) in August 2020. Prior to the TCF, dueling technical standards resulted in industry-wide confusion following adoption of the GDPR. 
Over the years, Apple has greatly limited the use of third-party cookies within its web browser (Safari’s Intelligent Tracking Prevention) and recently announced the decision to make the app-based Identifier for Advertisers (the “IDFA”) opt-in by consumers rather than opt-out. Google is also, along with Apple, leading an active industry dialog to deliver the next wave of privacy compliant advertising solutions. Google announced its intention to limit the use of third-party cookies starting in 2024 in its Chrome web browser, as well as limit the use of alternate user-level tracking technologies and browsing history in its own ad platforms. We believe the “Open Internet” outside the “walled gardens” (a colloquial term that refers to closed advertising platforms including Google and Facebook) will shift from targeting by anonymized and invisible third-party cookies or identifiers to known identities based on consumer choice and opt-in. This shift towards significantly more reliable and accurate consumer identity has the potential to significantly increase advertiser ROI and therefore publisher revenue.

Our Role in the Digital Advertising Ecosystem
Our platform is a key component of powering the digital advertising ecosystem because of the role we play in meeting the needs of ad sellers and ad buyers.
Publishers and App Developers. Publishers and app developers create websites and apps that contain content for consumers along with adjacent viewable space for advertisements. As consumers navigate through these websites and apps, individual ad impressions are shown to them. These impressions are typically sold to buyers programmatically in real-time via a third-party technology infrastructure platform or SSP. Publishers and app developers rely on advertising revenue as the key driver for their businesses and rely on the capabilities of these third parties in order to achieve optimal yield for their advertising inventory. 
We primarily work with publishers and app developers who allow us direct access to their ad inventory, as well as select channel partners that meet our quality and scale thresholds. We have direct relationships with publishers such as Yahoo, formerly Verizon Media Group, and News Corp. and app developers such as Zynga and Electronic Arts. Our channel partners aggregate and provide further access to thousands of sites and apps from smaller publishers. We refer to our publishers, app developers, and channel partners collectively as our publishers.
We help monetize valuable impressions for our publisher clients across a wide array of ad formats and digital device types, including mobile app, mobile web, desktop, display, video, OTT/CTV, and rich media. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, we had a net increase of approximately 200 publishing partners. As of December 31, 2022, we served approximately 1,650 publishers and app developers, representing over 92,000 individual domains and apps worldwide on our platform across a diverse group of content verticals including news, e-commerce, gaming, media, weather, fashion, technology, and more. 
Sell Side Platforms. Traditionally referred to as sell side platforms or SSPs, platforms such as ours are designed to monetize inventory for publishers and app developers. Buyers and sellers come together through our marketplace to present, target, and purchase available advertising inventory. Our platform rapidly and efficiently processes significant volumes of ad bid data, providing a seamless digital experience for consumers. Traditionally, SSPs have focused exclusively on the needs of sellers in this process, and have limited their interactions with buyers to the buyer’s agent, the demand side platform or DSP. As buyers have sought greater control of their advertising supply chains, we have extended the capabilities of our specialized cloud infrastructure platform over the last several years to serve the needs of advertisers and agencies as well.
Demand Side Platforms. Advertisers and agencies often engage demand side platforms, which act as advertising demand aggregators, to execute their digital marketing campaigns across various ad formats. We are integrated with the leading DSPs around the world, such as The Trade Desk and Google DV360, enabling them to execute real-time transactions with our publisher clients. We maintain active integrations with DSPs around the world, some of which are global and omnichannel in nature or more narrowly targeted on specific ad formats or geographic markets.
Advertisers and Agencies. Spending begins with advertisers, who often engage advertising agencies to help plan and execute their advertising campaigns. To better control and optimize their advertising operations, advertisers and agencies are consolidating their spend with fewer, larger technology platforms who can deliver transparency and ensure the highest levels of inventory quality and control. 
Table of Contents

We have entered into agreements with all of the major agency holding companies and some of the largest advertisers in the world and believe this will continue to drive more ad spend to our platform. These advertisers and agencies access our platform through DSPs. We believe our purpose-built technology platform and direct relationships with advertisers and agencies will lead to significant consolidation of spend onto our platform. 
Buyers on our platform include DSPs, agencies and individual advertisers. We have broad exposure to the ecosystem of buyers, reaching on average approximately 75,000 advertisers per month in 2022. As spending on programmatic advertising increasingly becomes a larger share of overall ad spending, advertisers and agencies are seeking greater control of their digital advertising supply chains. To take advantage of this industry shift, we have entered into SPO agreements directly with buyers. As a result of these direct relationships, our existing advertisers and agencies are incentivized to allocate an increasing percentage of their advertising budgets to our platform. 
Two of our largest DSP relationships are with Google and The Trade Desk. We are party to an agreement with Google LLC, under which Google is a buyer on our platform. The initial one-year term of the current agreement ended in May 2019, and it automatically renews for successive one-year terms unless either party provides written notice at least 60 days’ prior to the end of the initial term or such successive terms. Either party may terminate for convenience upon providing at least 30 days’ prior written notice. We signed a prior similar agreement with a Google subsidiary in 2012. We are also party to an agreement with The Trade Desk, Inc., under which The Trade Desk is a buyer on our platform. The initial term of the agreement ended in November 2013, and it automatically renews for successive one-year terms. Either party may terminate for convenience upon providing at least 30 days’ prior written notice.
Our Specialized Cloud Infrastructure Platform
Our specialized cloud infrastructure enables real-time programmatic advertising transactions in a market characterized by significant data and impression volumes, regulatory complexity, and increased focus on transparency and privacy. We have built, enhanced and deployed our technology infrastructure to address these market conditions and provide superior outcomes for both publishers and buyers. We have deployed our purpose-built infrastructure globally in order to serve our customers with the high-speed transaction capabilities required to provide a seamless digital ad experience for consumers. Our offering is omnichannel and targets a diverse set of publishers touching many ad formats, and digital device types, including mobile app, mobile web, desktop, display, video, OTT/CTV, and rich media.
We believe that our specialized cloud infrastructure provides a number of advantages:
Real-time Ad Transaction Processing: Our specialized cloud infrastructure is designed for the rapid and efficient processing of real-time, programmatic ad transactions and the aggregation and analysis of the significant data accompanying each transaction. We power our cloud platform by proprietary software deployed on PubMatic-owned and operated hardware close to our customers around the world. Our technology platform processes each potential ad in a fraction of a second to optimize the consumer ad experience. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, our platform efficiently processed approximately 159.1 trillion ad impressions, up 72% from approximately 92.2 trillion ad impressions in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021.
Sophisticated, Purpose-built Technology that Delivers Superior Outcomes: Since our founding, we have believed that data-driven decisions would be the future of advertising and have accordingly invested in developing our machine learning capabilities. By harnessing our massive data assets and advanced machine learning capabilities, we are able to deliver superior outcomes by increasing advertiser ROI and publisher revenue, while increasing the cost efficiency of our platform and our customers’ and partners’ businesses. 
Transparency and Quality: We operate on a fundamental principle of transparency, being one of the first digital advertising infrastructure platforms to provide log-level data to buyers and provide transparency on every ad impression. In addition, advertisers utilizing our cloud infrastructure have full control over which publishers, ad formats, and specific ad impressions on which they would like to bid. We are among the first to offer a fraud-free program in 2017 where buyers are credited for any fraudulent inventory they may have purchased on our platform. 
Enabling Identity on the Open Internet: As advertising in the Open Internet shifts from targeting by anonymized and invisible third-party cookies that consumers must opt out of, and instead towards known first-party identity based on consumer choice and opt-in or other privacy compliant solutions, publishers and advertisers must transition to a new identity paradigm. While there are various constituents across the digital advertising industry creating new identity solutions, we have built a comprehensive platform that greatly simplifies the implementation and ongoing management of identity solution providers. Our solution allows for the use of many of the leading identifiers in a scaled and privacy-compliant fashion resulting in increased publisher revenue and buyer ROI.
Table of Contents

Scalable, Self-service Platform: Our cloud infrastructure solutions are available via self-serve, including an easy-to-use customer user interface and a set of application programming interfaces that allow our publisher customers to configure new inventory, extend into new geographies or ad formats, review reporting insights, and manage and track payments and billing cycles. Our platform also assists with managing the increasingly complex compliance burdens brought on by new industry guidelines and government regulations. We provide the tools and the mechanisms to help enable publisher inventory to be in compliance with these norms and requirements, maintaining strong data minimization practices, and allocating responsibility for data flows and legal compliance in agreements with vendors, publishers, and buyers.
Our Strengths
Publishers are actively seeking to maximize the value of their ad inventory, and buyers are seeking to increase advertising ROI. We believe that our specialized cloud infrastructure, rapid innovation, and transparent business model provide incentives to ad buyers to consolidate an increasing share of their total digital spend on our platform. At the same time, our direct publisher relationships, omnichannel header bidding capabilities, global scale, and access to incremental advertiser demand through direct relationships with buyers drive superior yield for publishers.
We believe the following strengths provide us with long-term competitive advantages:
Investment in Innovation: Our business model driven by our technology platform, owned infrastructure, and offshore research and development has enabled us to continuously invest in driving innovation, while delivering both top line revenue growth and profitability. 
Flexible Platform and Culture of Rapid Innovation: We built our company and our technology platform to be highly dynamic and to support rapid innovation. Our product and development teams are focused on continuous innovation and enhancement of our products and solutions. We believe that the flexibility of our platform and responsiveness to evolving customer needs and technical requirements enables us to achieve superior outcomes for our customers. Since our founding, we have invested significantly in a software ideation, development, build, test, and deployment process that allows us to routinely convert a requirement into working software within two weeks or less. Our platform is highly modular, which allows us to innovate and improve individual software components without affecting the rest of the platform. We utilize a microservices architecture to interconnect each module via application programming interfaces with defined interfaces for internal and external consumption. We focus on reliability and scalability of each individual module and across our platform to maximize uptime and scale up based on customer demand. In 2022, we released new software across our global infrastructure approximately 90 times. The result of our flexible platform and culture of rapid innovation is that we are highly responsive to evolving customer needs, which we believe is important in a rapidly evolving digital advertising industry.
Highly Efficient Infrastructure: As a result of our long-term, internal development efforts on our technology stack and strategic approach of owning our own hardware, we believe that we have among the lowest cost infrastructures of any specialized cloud infrastructure platform in the advertising market. We own and operate our proprietary software and hardware infrastructure around the world. This approach saves significant costs compared to companies that rely on public cloud alternatives due to the data-intensive nature of digital advertising and the immense volume of ad impressions created by header bidding. As a result, our cost of revenue per impression processed decreased by 19% in 2022 compared to 2021, and decreased by 28% in 2021 compared to 2020. Even as we grow the applicability of our cloud infrastructure to include more ad formats and devices, such as mobile, video, and now OTT/CTV, we have maintained strong capital efficiency as measured by revenue per dollar of capital expenditures. The efficiency of our infrastructure has enabled us to grow our access to first-party data, which generally refers to customer owned audience data, ad impression and bid request data, and advertiser bid response data, further driving superior results across our platform for buyers and sellers.
Machine Learning and Data Processing: We leverage our artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities to record, aggregate, analyze, and act on vast amounts of data to help our customers optimize their digital advertising businesses in real-time. In December 2022, our technology platform processed approximately 524 billion ad impressions and 7.4 petabytes of data every day. This data includes first party customer owned audience data, ad impression and bid request data, and advertiser bid response data. We flow all of this data through our machine learning platform in order to run thousands of algorithmic iterations on trillions of data points per month. These capabilities improves long term marketplace liquidity resulting in increased publisher revenue and higher advertiser ROI.
Table of Contents

Customer Trust and Alignment: We are aligned with both publishers and buyers, by being an independent and transparent infrastructure provider. We do not own media and therefore do not have a vested interest in driving ad revenue to specific media properties. We do not take a position in media or arbitrage media. We operate with a fundamental principle of transparency and provide detailed insights into fees to our customers. Our customers can therefore be confident that our algorithmic software decisions and our guidance are independent and in their best interests. Our trusted status has enabled us to build direct relationships with publishers, advertisers, agencies, and DSPs. Our ability to meet the demands of both buyers and inventory sellers enables us to produce superior outcomes for all industry participants.
Global, Omnichannel Reach: We are a global business with distributed critical infrastructure and a go-to-market presence in every major advertising market in the world outside of China. Many of our publisher customers have diversified businesses with media properties and audiences across the globe and with a wide variety of ad products including display and video ads across desktop, tablet, mobile, and connected TV devices. Similarly, many of our advertiser and agency customers have brand portfolios that span the globe with a variety of ad campaign requirements – from branding to performance, to combinations thereof. All of these parties actively seek global, omnichannel platform providers that can solve for their needs around the world and across ad formats and devices. By providing global, omnichannel reach of our infrastructure, we are well positioned to help publishers and ad buyers make their advertising businesses more efficient and effective. 
Growth Strategy
We believe we are positioned to benefit from tailwinds in the advertising industry, including the rapid proliferation of digital media, the need for purpose-built infrastructure to address the increasing complexity in the digital advertising landscape, and increasing consumer time spent online. Our growth strategy includes:
Attract New Publishers and Expand our Relationship with Existing Publishers: We constantly seek to acquire new high-quality publishers around the world. New publishers may include major media companies, app developers, e-commerce providers, and OTT platforms– any company that monetizes its audience through digital advertising. Once acquired, we seek to expand our relationship with existing publishers by leveraging our omnichannel capabilities to maximize our access to publishers’ ad formats and devices. We have demonstrated that we can retain our publisher customers, as evidenced by our net dollar-based retention rates of 108% for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 and 149% for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021.
Attract New Buyers and Expand our Relationship with Existing Buyers: We seek to acquire new buyers (including advertisers, agencies and DSPs) through our strong value proposition. We work with DSPs to help them reduce their costs and improve advertiser ROI. As advertisers and agencies increasingly consolidate their spending with fewer larger technology platforms, we seek to increase the proportion of their digital ad spending on our platform through direct relationships. We have entered into SPO agreements directly with both advertisers and agencies through various arrangements ranging from custom data and workflow integrations, product features, and volume-based business terms. The effect of these SPO agreements is to increase the volume of ad spend on our platform without corresponding increases in technology costs. 
Efficiently Expand Our Infrastructure Platform to Process More Ad Impressions: We have a track record of cost-effectively expanding the capacity of our infrastructure platform as exemplified by average daily ad impressions having increased approximately 440% over the three year period ended December 31, 2022, while the corresponding costs related to processing these impressions have increased approximately 130%. We expect to continue to invest in both software and hardware infrastructure to continue growing the number of valuable ad impressions we process on our platform. 
Improve Liquidity in Our Marketplace: We strive to continuously improve publisher revenue and advertiser ROI by investing in our technology and improving our machine learning capabilities. We leverage our artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities, alongside our growing publisher and buyer relationships, to improve liquidity in our marketplace. Increasing numbers of ad impressions, increasing advertiser bids, and data proliferation provide us with many opportunities to better match sellers and buyers of ad inventory. We believe that improved matching will lead to growth of our platform and greater publisher and buyer retention.
Develop New Products: As we grow our customer base and process increasing volumes of ad impressions and data, we gain insights into new challenges we can solve on behalf of our customers. We are constantly focused on creating new products that we believe solve our customers’ needs.
Table of Contents

Expand Into New Ad Formats: We have demonstrated an ability to extend header bidding into a variety of ad formats – initially desktop display, then mobile web, mobile app, digital video, and most recently with OTT/CTV. As technology and media evolve, additional ad formats may become attractive to us – whether existing in the ecosystem today or entirely new. These may include audio/podcast ads, native ads and digital out of home ads. Each ad format represents an opportunity to further extend our cloud infrastructure, increase our platform utilization, and acquire new customers or expand our relationship with existing customers. 
Expand into New Geographies: We decide to enter new advertising markets around the world based on size, growth rate, and other characteristics. We are constantly evaluating new markets with a strategy to use our existing global infrastructure and adjacent sales office, or by expanding our infrastructure footprint and placing personnel directly in those markets.
Our Technology 
Overview
We have designed our technology to efficiently process real-time advertising transactions while leveraging data to optimize outcomes for publishers and buyers. We own and operate our software and hardware infrastructure globally, which saves significant infrastructure expenditures as compared to public cloud alternatives. We designed our platform using a flexible, service-oriented architecture in order to facilitate rapid development of new solutions, to meet evolving industry demands, and to support new use cases and new ad formats. Our agile development process and flexible, service-oriented architecture empower our development teams to routinely convert a requirement into working software within a typical time frame of two weeks or less. Our omnichannel platform supports a wide array of publishers, ad formats and devices, including mobile app, mobile web, desktop, display, video, OTT/CTV, and rich media. 
We offer our solution as a complete, unified offering for publishers who want a simple, efficient and comprehensive solution. We also offer modular access to our platform via rich application programming interfaces and a mobile SDK, for publishers who wish to integrate with or extend the platform, or develop new business models and custom advertising solutions.
Data 
Among the central benefits of our software platform is the processing, management and analysis of valuable data assets. The hundreds of billions of ad impressions and trillion advertiser bids that we process every day generate enormous volumes of data that we harness to drive higher revenue for our publishers and increased ROI for our buyers. This data includes:
•Ad impression and bid data, which contain parameters such as page URL or app bundle ID, location of the user, operating system of the user’s device, device type, ad size and ad location on the page;
•First party customer owned audience data, such as segment data that specifies whether a consumer is a recent shopper for electronics or automobiles; and
•Advertiser bid response data, which is bidding data received from DSPs, agencies, and advertisers.
We have developed proprietary data and analytics offerings that allow publishers to monitor their ad business in near real-time, as well as advanced tools publishers can use to find new business opportunities, optimize their monetization strategy, and help maximize the value of their digital ad business. This data is also used by our machine learning algorithms to enhance our bidding and auctioning process by analyzing large datasets and applying algorithms to drive optimal results. 
Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
We analyze the data on our platform through extensive application of artificial intelligence technologies, including machine learning and natural language processing. Examples of how we leverage our artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities to improve outcomes for our customers are:
•Identify valuable ad impressions and predict auction behavior: When our machine learning models predict that an impression will attract high bids, our algorithms adjust pricing guidance to bidders in real time, which can lead to significant inventory yield improvements for publishers and higher win rates for ad buyers. 
•Optimize impression selection: Our ability to accurately predict and monetize high value impressions allows us to operate more efficiently, due to the fact that the cost of processing low-value impressions and high-value impressions are approximately the same. Our algorithms, such as impression throttling, deploy a variety of levers to optimize traffic sent to DSPs, agencies, and advertisers. 
•Improve our self-service capabilities: Publishers can enter natural language queries, such as “Show me average CPM for yesterday” and the analytics system will generate charts and tables with relevant data for rapid and informative analysis.

Programmatic Header Bidding
We are a leading provider of technology solutions that enable and improve header bidding for our customers. We developed an enterprise wrapper, OpenWrap, that was among the first header bidding solutions launched for general availability. OpenWrap was released in April 2016 and enables publishers to holistically manage and configure all header bidding partners through a powerful, synchronized and intuitive user interface. OpenWrap provides a transparent, real-time view into bid activity and volume, monetization and latency metrics which allow publishers to make smarter decisions and drive sustainable monetization. Our cloud infrastructure is interoperable with the other major header bidding software frameworks including open source Prebid, Google’s Open Bidding, Amazon’s Transparent Ad Marketplace, and others. We believe we are thought leaders in the header bidding space and are represented on the boards of Prebid and the IAB Tech Lab.
Regulatory Compliance
A growing set of privacy regulations have introduced complexity regarding the collection, use, and transmission of consumer data to the digital advertising ecosystem. Most notably, the GDPR that took effect in May 2018, the CCPA that took effect in January 2020 and CRPA that took effect in January 2023, among other global privacy laws and regulations, have created a compliance burden for advertisers, publishers, and their partners to navigate. The advertising industry has developed a number of the technical and policy solutions to create standards for compliance, such as IAB TCF.
We have implemented a number of technology innovations, process enhancements, and industry solutions in response to our publishers’ increased obligations. Through the TCF and other frameworks, we can identify and pass user consent parameters, and opt-in or opt-out as applicable, in a bid request. We are also able to evaluate whether such consents apply to our various demand partners, such as DSPs and agencies. Some of the specific measures we have taken include:
•User Consent. Working with publishers and channel partners to ensure appropriate consent is being obtained, recorded, and transmitted as applicable. 
•Data Mapping. Undertaking data mapping exercises for the purpose of understanding data flows in how we collect, use, and transmit personal information from our publishers, buyers, and data providers.
•Data Minimization. Establishing mechanisms to collect only the data that is needed and pseudonymizing data wherever possible (including masking IP address or geolocation data as applicable).
•Data Retention. Implementing a short data retention period across our technology platform so that we promptly delete, aggregate, or anonymize consumer data.
•Publisher and Demand Side Agreements. Monitoring and updating our agreements with publishers, DSPs, agencies, and advertisers, as applicable, to address privacy and regulatory compliance.
Inventory Quality
The quality of the inventory made available to advertisers has a significant impact on their ROI. Bad actors promoting botnets, fake ads, ad stuffing and other malignant methodologies reduce the ROI for advertisers and siphon dollars away from quality publishers. We have developed a multi-pronged strategy to create a high-quality marketplace beginning with high quality publisher selection, supported by proprietary and third-party fraud detection software, manual review, timely fraud investigations, and a fraud-free program in which buyers are credited for any fraudulent inventory they may have purchased on our platform. 
Ad Quality 
Ad quality refers to the quality of the advertisements that run on publishers’ sites. We have developed proprietary solutions targeting the reduction of security issues, including malware, redirects, unsafe code, and other similar practices; quality issues, including unsafe creative categories (such as alcohol or drugs) and creative attributes (Inbanner video, Expandables, Text Ads); and performance issues, including network load, number of trackers and memory size. On an average day, we scan over one million new advertisement creatives in near real-time using our Real-Time Ad Scanning (“RTAS”) system. RTAS connects to proprietary technology and partners’ services to extract the nature of creatives. Publishers can configure their preferences for quality attributes using our blocklist manager, creative attribute selection, and keyword blocking. A comprehensive reporting suite is available for publishers to monitor the top performing creatives and review the lost opportunity due to excessive blocking.

Log-level Transparency and Insights
We enable buyers to gain additional transparency and insights to help them inform future ad buying and optimize their supply paths by providing them access to log-level data, which is comprised of various attributes that are relevant to a single ad impression within an auction. Log-level data provides buyers transaction verification data, or how the auction operates and what fees are being charged. 
Reporting
Our technology platform provides extensive reporting capabilities to both buyers and publishers via application programming interfaces for direct integration into a customer’s reporting systems. Publishers are able to review performance, monitor key performance indicators (“KPIs”), and make adjustments to their set up and optimization. Buyers have access to campaign insight data to facilitate testing and adaptation toward maximizing ROI. Detailed performance by ad format, channels, and ad sizes allows for optimization to achieve maximum performance.
Self-Service
We design and implement self-service workflow solutions to allow publishers to efficiently manage their ad inventory. For example, publishers can update their own price floors, add or remove advertisers from blocklists, add new web sites and mobile apps, manage optimize their header bidding set ups, and leverage identity graphs from multiple ID providers. Ad buyers can configure the attributes for the inventory they desire, setup new or adjust existing private marketplace deals, and access extensive reporting on their media buying activities with us.
Our Team and Culture
Our culture and our team are our most important asset in building and expanding our business. Our team identifies new problems to solve, builds solutions, optimizes and extends our infrastructure, and acquires and serves customers. We believe that strong and diverse customer teams deepen customer relationships, promote innovation, and increase productivity.

Our practice of open and transparent communication coupled with a performance-based approach to compensation has created a culture in which employees feel empowered in their ability to influence and impact our business and be rewarded for their efforts. The value proposition we offer to our employees is rounded out with strong benefits programs that include paid family leave, health and wellness benefits and company sponsored opportunities to give back to the communities in which they work and live.
We are also committed to being inclusive in our hiring practices, promotion practices, and management practices as a means of ensuring equal opportunity for all employees as we continue to diversify our workforce. The diversity of our workforce has been publicly documented since 2017 with our annual Diversity & Inclusion Report. Our Inclusion Action Plan consists of five areas that focus on listening, learning, hiring, socio-economic support, and activism. This plan will be executed in part by our newly established Diversity & Inclusion Committee. The plan has a global focus that takes into consideration regional cultural differences to provide interactive employee experiences that drive continuous support for inclusion throughout our organization.
It has always been our goal to attract and retain the best talent in the industry and our inclusive interview process includes finding those candidates that best add to our company mission, values, and cultural principles. These three guiding elements form a social contract between employees as well as set expectations for the common behaviors we can expect from each other and inform how we treat our customers. They are infused in every aspect of our business, from employee experience and workplace culture to marketing strategies and customers success.

Technology and Development
We expect to continue investing in our technology in order to support efficient and effective ad monetization, which includes maximizing the yield from existing ad impressions and productively adding new ad impressions processed on our platform. We also intend to continue developing innovative capabilities for our customers.
As of December 31, 2022, we had 407 employees engaged in technology and development.
Our Competition
The digital advertising ecosystem is competitive and complex due to a variety of factors. While programmatic header bidding has enabled the purchasing and selling of vast amounts of digital advertising inventory, there now exist significant challenges related to the proliferation of media across platforms, transaction speed, increased costs, transparency, and regulatory requirements. To address these issues at scale for both publishers and buyers, we provide specialized software and hardware infrastructure to optimally power technology-driven transactions. We compete with SSPs like Magnite, smaller private SSPs in markets around the world, as well as divisions of larger companies like Google.
While there is direct competition, our cloud infrastructure is interoperable with the major header bidding software frameworks including open source Prebid, Google’s Open Bidding, Amazon’s Transparent Ad Marketplace, and others. As a result, we are able to gain access to competitors’ ad impressions. 
We have also demonstrated an ability to extend our header bidding infrastructure into a variety of higher-growth ad formats such as mobile web, mobile app, digital video, and most recently OTT/CTV.
We believe that our specialized cloud infrastructure enables us to compete favorably on the factors described above. In addition, we believe that new market entrants would find it difficult to gain direct access to publishers and ad buyers given their limited scale and would face significant costs to integrate with publishers and ad buyers and comply with growing regulatory requirements around the world.
Sales and Marketing
We primarily deploy a self-service model and focus our sales and marketing efforts on supporting, advising, and training our publishers to optimize their usage of our platform. We employ a nimble in-market sales team with expertise in programmatic advertising to attract premium publishers to our platform. We have dedicated teams focused on new publisher acquisition and existing publisher relationship management. New publishers on our platform work closely with our Customer Success team, which handles on-boarding and providing support throughout the publisher relationship life cycle. Our Customer Success team is organized and specialized by type of ad format and device and is trained to both maximize the number of integrations with each publisher, and deploy our value added solutions that we provide. Similarly, we have teams focused on new business acquisition and existing partner retention and expansion for advertisers, agencies, and DSPs. These teams focus on onboarding new partners and increasing spend across a variety of ad formats, devices, and geographies.

Our marketing team is focused on achieving thought leadership, educating customers on how to harness programmatic advertising to improve their business, guiding buyers on how to maximize ROI via the PubMatic cloud infrastructure, supporting our sales team, generating new leads and increasing awareness for our brand.
Intellectual Property
The protection of our technology and intellectual property is an important component of our success. We protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal and state statutory and common law rights, foreign laws where applicable, and contractual restrictions. We seek to control access to our proprietary technology by entering into non-disclosure agreements with third parties and disclosure and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors.
We consider our trademarks, patents, copyrights, trade secrets, and other intellectual property rights to be, in the aggregate, material to our business. We currently own two issued U.S. patents, expiring in 2034, relating to online advertising and auction techniques. We also own one issued Japanese patent. We also own trademark registrations and applications for the “PubMatic” name and variants thereof and other product-related marks in the United States and certain foreign countries. We have also registered numerous Internet domain names related to our business. We believe our platform would be difficult, time consuming, and costly to replicate. 
We intend to pursue additional intellectual property protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost effective. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, they may not be respected in the future or may be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged. In addition, the laws of various foreign countries where our products are distributed may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws in the United States.
Privacy and Data
We are subject to laws and regulations governing privacy and the transmission, collection, and use of personal data. Interest-based advertising, or the use of data to draw inferences about a consumer’s interests and deliver relevant advertising to that consumer, has come under increasing scrutiny by legislative, regulatory, and self-regulatory bodies, privacy advocates, academics, and commercial interests in the United States and abroad that focus on data protection and consumer privacy. In particular, much of this scrutiny has focused on the use of cookies and other tracking technologies that collect or aggregate information about consumers’ online browsing and mobile app usage activity. Because both our company and our publishers rely upon large volumes of such data collected primarily through cookies and other tracking technologies, it is essential that we monitor legal requirements and other developments in this area, domestically and globally, maintain a robust privacy and security compliance program, and engage in responsible privacy practices, including providing consumers with notice of the types of data we collect, how we collect it, with whom we share it, how we use that data to provide our solutions, and the applicable choices we offer consumers.
We provide notice through our privacy policies and notices, which can be found on our website at www.pubmatic.com. As stated in our privacy policy, we do not collect information, such as names, addresses or telephone phone numbers, for providing our advertising services that can be used directly to reveal the identity of the underlying individual. We take steps not to collect and store such information (although on occasion, our publishers voluntarily share information of their consumers with us and in such circumstances, we require the publishers to have obtained all necessary consents for such sharing). Our advertising and reporting rely on information that does not, on its own, directly reveal the identity of the underlying individuals (and we do not attempt to associate this information with other information that can identify such individuals). We typically do collect and store IP addresses, geo-location information, and device identifiers that are considered personal data or personal information under the privacy laws of some jurisdictions or otherwise may be the subject of current or future data privacy legislation or regulation. The definition of personally identifiable information, personal information, or personal data, varies by jurisdiction and continues to evolve in ways that may require us to adapt our practices to avoid violating laws or regulations related to the collection, storage, and use of consumer data. As a result, our technology platform and business practices must be assessed regularly against a continuously evolving legal and regulatory landscape, and we have adopted strong data minimization practices that mitigate our compliance risks.
There are also a number of specific laws and regulations governing the collection and use of certain types of consumer data relevant to our business. For example, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) imposes restrictions on the collection and use of data provided by children under the age of 13 by child-directed websites or online services, such as apps, directed to children or any website if the collection of such data is known to the website or app operator. We have taken various steps to implement a system in which our publishers are contractually obligated to either flag or notify us in writing of child-directed websites. When websites are flagged, or we receive notice of such websites, we do not collect personal information, as defined by COPPA, including cookie identifiers that can recognize the same consumer across multiple sites over time, or location information more specific than street and city, on such websites or online services.

Additionally, our compliance with our privacy policy and our general consumer data privacy and security practices are subject to review by the Federal Trade Commission, which may bring enforcement actions to challenge allegedly unfair and deceptive trade practices, including the violation of privacy policies and representations or material omissions therein. 
Certain State Attorneys General in the United States may also bring enforcement actions based on comparable state laws or federal laws that permit state-level enforcement. In California, for example, the Attorney General may bring enforcement actions for violations of the CCPA, as modified by the Attorney General’s recently approved enforcement guidelines. We have registered as a data broker in California with the California Attorney General. When we receive bid requests that include an opt-out signal, we do not sell personal information, as defined by the CCPA. We have also adopted the IAB CCPA Compliance Framework, which includes a technical specification to identify consumer signals to opt-out of sale of their data, and have signed the IAB Limited Service Provider Agreement that imposes service provider obligations for certain opted-out bid requests. These IAB frameworks are designed to facilitate compliance with the CCPA although the California Attorney General’s office has not yet approved such frameworks. The CCPA and CPRA set forth high potential liabilities for data privacy violations on a per-record basis, and the industry faces an uncertain compliance burden as our partners and publishers work to become compliant with the law. Adding further complexity in California, the CPRA imposed additional data protection obligations on companies doing business in California, including additional consumer rights processes and opt-outs for certain uses of sensitive data and sharing of personal data. Likewise, Virginia enacted the Consumer Data Protection Act (“CDPA”), Connecticut enacted the Connecticut Data Privacy Act (“CTDPA”), Colorado enacted the Colorado Privacy Act (“CPA”), and Utah enacted the Utah Consumer Privacy Act (“UCPA”), which impose consumer rights processes and requires user consent for certain types of sensitive data. These laws also sets forth high potential liabilities for data privacy violations on a per-record basis, and the industry faces an uncertain compliance burden as our partners and publishers work to become compliant with these laws in the future.
Outside of the United States, our privacy and data practices are subject to regulation by data protection authorities and other regulators in the countries in which we do business. The use and transfer of personal data in member states of the European Union is currently governed under the GDPR, which grants additional rights to consumers about their data, such as deletion and portability, and generally prohibits the transfer of personal data of EU subjects outside of the EU, unless the party exporting the data from the EU implements a compliance mechanism designed to ensure that the receiving party will adequately protect such data. We had relied on the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework (Privacy Shield framework), to transfer personal data of EU subjects to the United States, but the Privacy Shield framework was recently declared invalid by Court of Justice of the European Union. (“CJEU”) on July 16, 2020. In October 2022, the Biden administration negotiated new privacy shield terms with EU regulators, and signed an Executive Order in October 2022 directing the steps the United States will take to implement its commitments to the EU/US data privacy framework. The new proposed Privacy Shield terms are subject to further review by the European Commission or EC and member states. Max Schrems, who brought the lawsuit which resulted in the invalidation of Privacy Shield in 2020, has indicated that he will legally challenge these newly proposed Privacy Shield terms.
In its July 16, 2020 decision, while the CJEU upheld the adequacy of the standard contractual clauses (a standard form of contract approved by the European Commission as an adequate personal data transfer mechanism, and potential alternative to the Privacy Shield framework), it made clear that reliance on them alone may not necessarily be sufficient in all circumstances and cast doubt on their future use. Use of the standard contractual clauses must now be assessed on a case-by-case basis taking into account the legal regime applicable in the destination country, in particular applicable surveillance laws and rights of individuals. The use of standard contractual clauses for the transfer of personal data specifically to the United States remains under review by a number of European data protection supervisory authorities. 
The GDPR sets out higher potential liabilities for certain data protection violations, which may result in fines up to the greater of €20 million or 4% of an enterprise’s global annual revenue. Additionally, the UK GDPR will also have the ability to fine up to the greater of £17.5 million or 4% of global turnover. Further, the EU is currently in discussions to replace the ePrivacy Directive (commonly called the “Cookie Directive”) with the ePrivacy Regulation that governs the use of technologies that collect, access, and store consumer information and may create additional compliance burdens for us in Europe.
Other jurisdictions have enacted legislation that closely tracks the concepts, obligations, and consumer rights described in the GDPR, including Brazil’s General Data Protection law and Thailand’s Personal Data Protection Act. Some jurisdictions, including Russia and China, have in recent years enacted data localization laws, which require any personal information of citizens of those jurisdictions to be stored and processed on servers located in those jurisdictions. Such laws are gaining momentum and are being enforced by local authorities.

Beyond laws and regulations, we are also members of self-regulatory bodies that impose additional requirements related to the collection, use, and disclosure of consumer data, including the IAB, the Digital Advertising Alliance, and the NAI. Under the requirements of these self-regulatory bodies, in addition to other compliance obligations, we provide consumers with notice via our privacy policies about our use of cookies and other technologies to collect consumer data, our collection and use of consumer data to deliver interest-based advertisements, and consumers’ opt-out choices. We also allow consumers to opt-out from the use of data we collect for purposes of interest-based advertising through mechanisms described in our privacy policies available on our website. Some of these self-regulatory bodies have the ability to discipline members or participants, which could result in penalties and cause reputational harm. Additionally, some of these bodies might refer violations of their requirements to the Federal Trade Commission or other regulators.
