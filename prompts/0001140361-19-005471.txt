ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Overview
 
On July 26, 2018, International Money Express, Inc. (formerly FinTech Acquisition Corp. II) consummated a transaction (the “Merger”) by and among FinTech Acquisition Corp. II, a Delaware corporation (“FinTech”), FinTech II Merger Sub Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of FinTech (“Merger Sub 1”), FinTech II Merger Sub 2 LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of FinTech (“Merger Sub 2”), Intermex Holdings II, Inc. (“Intermex Holdings” or “Holdings”) and SPC Intermex Representative LLC (“SPC Intermex”). As a result of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Intermex Holdings ceased and Merger Sub 2 (which changed its name to International Money Express Sub 2, LLC in connection with the closing of the Merger) continued as the surviving entity. In connection with the closing of the Merger, FinTech, the surviving entity, changed its name to International Money Express, Inc. Unless the context below otherwise provides, the terms “we”, “us”, “Intermex”, and the “Company” refer to International Money Express, Inc. following the Merger, together with its respective subsidiaries. Reference to the Company and its business operations and financial information as it existed pre-Merger refers to Intermex Holdings.
 
We conduct our business primarily through our operating subsidiary, Intermex Wire Transfer, LLC. Intermex was incorporated as a Delaware corporation on May 28, 2015. Our principal executive office is located at 9480 South Dixie Highway, Miami, Florida 33156, and our telephone number at that address is (305) 671-8000. Our website is https://www.intermexonline.com. The information found on our website is not incorporated by reference into this filing or any other report we file with or furnish to the SEC.
 
Intermex is a rapidly growing and leading money remittance services company focused primarily on the United States to Latin America and the Caribbean (“LAC”) corridor, which includes Mexico, Central and South America and the Caribbean. We utilize our proprietary technology to deliver convenient, reliable and value-added services to our customers through a broad network of sending and paying agents. Our remittance services, which include a comprehensive suite of ancillary financial processing solutions and payment services, are available in 50 states, Washington D.C., and Puerto Rico, where customers can send money to beneficiaries primarily in 17 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. Our services are accessible in person through over 100,000 sending and paying agents and company-operated stores, as well as online and via Internet-enabled mobile devices.
 
Money remittance services to Latin America, primarily Mexico and Guatemala, are the primary source of our revenue. These services involve the movement of funds on behalf of an originating customer for receipt by a designated beneficiary at a designated receiving location. Our remittances to Latin America are generated in the United States by customers with roots in Latin American and Caribbean countries, many of whom do not have an existing relationship with a traditional full-service financial institution capable of providing the services we offer. We provide these customers with flexibility and convenience to help them meet their financial needs. Other customers who use our services may have access to traditional banking services, but prefer to use our services based on reliability, convenience and value. We generate money remittance revenue from fees paid by our customers (i.e. the senders of funds), which we share with our sending agents in the United States and our paying agents in the destination country. Remittances paid in local currencies that are not pegged to the U.S. dollar also earn revenue through our daily management of currency exchange spreads.
 
Our money remittance services enable our customers to send and receive funds through our extensive network of locations in the United States that are primarily operated by third-party businesses, which we refer to as agents, and a small number of company- operated stores in the LAC corridor. In addition, our services are offered digitally through Intermexonline.com and via Internet-enabled mobile devices. We currently operate in the United States, Mexico, Guatemala and 20 additional countries. Since January 2015 through December 31, 2018, we have grown our agent network by more than 109%, and increased our remittance transactions volume by approximately 117%. In 2018, we processed approximately 24 million remittances, representing over 27% growth as compared to 2017.
 
Our Competitive Strengths
 
    
· | Primary focus on the Latin American Corridor. Unlike many of our competitors, who we believe prioritize global reach over growth and profitability, we are focused almost exclusively on one or two geographical regions. We believe the LAC corridor provides an attractive operating environment with significant opportunity for future growth. According to latest available data published by the World Bank, the LAC corridor represented approximately 13.4% of total worldwide remittance volume for 2017, or $82 billion of annual transaction volume, and was the most rapidly growing remittance corridor in the world. The information contained in this paragraph is based on the World Bank’s “Bilateral Remittance Matrix 2017” published in April 2018 (the “World Bank Remittance Matrix”). 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Highly scalable, proprietary software platform. We provide our money remittance services utilizing our internally developed proprietary software systems, which we believe enhance the productivity of our network of agents, enabling them to quickly, reliably and cost-effectively process remittance transactions. Our proprietary software systems were designed to incorporate real-time compliance functionality, which improves our regulatory compliance and helps to minimize fraud. We have developed a platform that has the capacity to handle traffic well in excess of ten times the number of transactions we currently process. Our money remittance platform has experienced limited downtime with our 2018 downtime being less than 0.05%, despite multiple natural disasters in our markets during that period.

· | Highly selective agent recruitment process designed to identify productive long-term partners. We strategically target agents for our network only after a metric-based analysis of potential productivity and a thorough vetting process. In our agent selection process, we focus on geographic locations that we believe are likely to have high customer volume and demand for our services. By closely monitoring individual agent performance and money remittance trends, we can offer our agents real-time technical support and marketing assistance to help increase their productivity and remittance volume. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Strong relationships with major banks and financial institutions. Our relationships with clearing, check processing, trading and exchange rate and cash management banks are critical to an efficient and reliable remittance network. We benefit from our strong and long-term relationships with a number of large banks and financial institutions. We maintain strong relationships with a number of other national and regional banking and financial institutions in the United States and Latin America. For example, we have maintained a long-term relationship with Wells Fargo, Bank of America and US Bank, among others. Due to increasing regulatory scrutiny of banks and financial institutions, we believe that new banking relationships may be difficult to develop, hence creating a barrier to entry to new competition and making our existing relationships a competitive advantage. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Powerful brand with strong consumer awareness and loyalty in the LAC corridor. We believe we are a leading money remittance provider from the United States to the LAC corridor, processing 17.4% of the aggregate volume of remittances to Mexico according to the latest available data published by the Central Bank of Mexico in 2018 and 24.0% of the aggregate volume of remittances to Guatemala according to the latest available data published by the Central Bank of Guatemala in 2018. We believe that our customers associate the Intermex brand with reliability, strong customer service and the ability to safely and efficiently remit their funds. The information contained in this paragraph is based on “Revenues by Workers' Remittances” published in the Central Bank of Mexico’s website, and “Income from family remittance” published in the in the Central Bank of Guatemala’s website. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Strong compliance processes and procedures. We operate in a highly-regulated environment and are reviewed by regulators and external auditors periodically. We maintain a comprehensive and rigorous compliance process with policies, procedures and internal controls designed to exceed current regulatory requirements. Our software also includes embedded compliance systems that provide real-time transaction alerts and Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) screening. Our risk and compliance management tools include programs by Equifax, Experian, LexisNexis and TransUnion, among others. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Experienced and proven management team. Our management team consists of industry veterans with a track record of achieving profitable growth, even during periods involving transformative transactions, such as during the time around our acquisition by Stella Point Capital to the closing of the Merger with FinTech. Led by our Chief Executive Officer, Robert Lisy, with a successful 27-year track record in the retail financial services and electronic payment processing industry. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Growth Strategy
 
We believe we are well positioned to drive continued growth by executing on the following core strategies:
 
  
· | Expand our market share in our largest corridors. The two largest remittance corridors we serve are the United States to Mexico and United States to Guatemala. According to the latest available data in the World Bank Remittance Matrix, the United States to Mexico remittance corridor was the largest in the world in 2017, with an aggregate of over $30.0 billion sent. The United States to Guatemala corridor represented the tenth largest in the world in 2017 as reported by the World Bank in their latest available data published, with an aggregate of over $7.7 billion sent. We aim to continue to expand our market share by: 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Growing our market share in our current stronghold states. We are currently well-established in 15 states (Alabama, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, Mississippi, North Carolina, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia) and poised for continued profitable growth within those markets via targeted regional penetration. We believe that we can leverage our current customer data to increase repeat customer usage, track and effectively recapture one-time users of our service and improve sending agent productivity to drive growth in these states. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Increasing our market share in growth states. We have identified 10 states (California, Colorado, Illinois, Kansas, Nevada, New York, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah and Wisconsin) where we expect to realize significantly increased market share growth. In particular, we are staging a targeted marketing effort in these large states where we are underrepresented. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Expand our services into new corridors. We believe that there is significant room to grow our business in underserved geographic regions in the LAC corridor where there is demand from customers and agents for our value-added approach to money remittances. Specifically, we are targeting future growth opportunities via new corridors from the United States to other non-Spanish speaking regions, including the Caribbean and other continents. In 2018, we achieved strong 27% and 45% growth in remittance volume to our newer markets of El Salvador and Honduras, respectively, compared to 2017. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

· | Leverage our technology in the business-to-business market. We believe that our money remittance platform has significant excess capacity. We believe we can leverage this capacity to sell business-to-business solutions to third parties, such as banks and major retailers. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Continue to grow online and mobile remittance channels. Our money remittance platform currently enables our customers to send funds from the United States to Latin America through the Internet via Intermexonline.com and on their Internet-enabled mobile devices. We believe these channels not only expand our potential customer base as digital transaction capabilities become more relevant to Latin American consumers but also benefit from secular and demographic trends as consumers continue to migrate to conducting financial transactions online.

Segments
    Our business is organized around one reportable segment that provides money transmittal services primarily between the USA and Latin America. This is based on the objectives of the business and how our chief operating decision maker, the CEO and President, monitors operating performance and allocates resources.
Operations and Services
 
Money remittance services to Latin America, primarily Mexico and Guatemala, are the primary source of our revenue. These services involve the movement of funds on behalf of an originating customer for receipt by a designated beneficiary at a designated receiving location. Our remittances to Latin America are generated in the United States by customers with roots in Latin American and Caribbean countries, many of whom do not have an existing relationship with a traditional full-service financial institution capable of providing the services we offer. We provide these customers with flexibility and convenience to help them meet their financial needs. Other customers who use our services may have access to traditional banking services, but prefer to use our services based on reliability, convenience and value add. We generate money remittance revenue from fees paid by our customers (i.e. the senders of funds), which we share with our sending agents in the United States and our paying agents in the destination country. Remittances paid in local currencies that are not pegged to the U.S. dollar also earn revenue through our daily management of currency exchange spreads.
 
The majority of our money remittance transactions are generated through our agent network of retail locations and company- operated stores where the transaction is processed and payment is collected by our agent. Those funds become available for pickup by the beneficiary at the designated receiving destination, usually within minutes, at any Intermex payer location. In select countries, the designated recipient may also receive the remitted funds via a deposit directly to the recipient’s bank account, mobile phone account or prepaid card. Our locations in the United States, also referred to as our sending agents, tend to be individual establishments, such as multi-service stores, grocery stores, convenience stores, bodegas and other retail locations. Our payers in Latin America are referred to as paying agents, and generally consist of large banks and financial institutions or large retail chains. Grupo Elektra, S.A.B. de C.V. is our largest paying agent and processes a significant portion of remittances in the LAC corridor. Each of our sending agents and our paying agents are primarily operated by third-party businesses where our money remittance services are offered. Additionally, we operate a small number of retail locations in the United States, which we refer to as company-operated stores and where our money remittance services are available. We also operate subsidiary payer networks in Mexico under the Pago Express brand and in Guatemala under the Intermex brand. These networks contribute payer locations that reach some of the most remote areas in those countries, providing increased convenience to our customers in the United States, Mexico and Guatemala.
 
At our agent sending locations, our customers may initiate a transaction directly with an agent, or through a direct-dialed telephone conversation from our agent location to our call centers. Many of our sending agents operate in locations that are open outside of traditional banking hours, including nights and weekends. Our sending agents understand the markets that they serve and coordinate with our sales and marketing teams to develop business plans for those markets. We hold promotional events for our sending agents to help familiarize them with the Intermex brand and to incent the agents to promote our services to customers.
 
Our money remittance services are also available on the Internet via Intermexonline.com, enabling customers to send money twenty-four hours a day conveniently from their computer or Internet-enabled mobile device. Those funds can be sent to any of our paying agent locations or to a recipient’s bank account, funding the transaction using debit card, credit card, or through electronic funds transfer processed through the automated clearing house (“ACH”) payment system. Internet-based money transmission services do not comprise a material percentage of the Company’s overall business.
 
We maintain call centers in Mexico and Guatemala, providing call center services 365 days per year and customer service in both English and Spanish, as well as the possibility of service in many of the regional dialects that our customers speak. Our call centers are able to provide customer service for inbound customer calls, and have technology available for direct calls from customers at our agent locations in processing remittance transactions.

Cash Management Bank Relationships
 
We buy and sell a number of global currencies and maintain a network of settlement accounts to facilitate the timely funding of money remittances and foreign exchange trades. Our relationships with clearing, check processing, trading and exchange rate and cash management banks are critical to an efficient and reliable remittance network. We benefit from our strong and long-term relationships with a number of large banks and financial institutions. We maintain strong relationships with a number of other national and regional banking and financial institutions in the United States and Latin America. In addition, we have benefitted from our 15-year relationship with US Bank, which manages our main operating account, and from strong relationships with Bancomer, Wells Fargo and KeyBank as our primary banks for exchange rate management with respect to the foreign currencies. Finally, we rely on our relationships with Wells Fargo, Bank of America and US Bank, as well as KeyBank and North American Banking Company, for check processing services.
Information Technology
 
 Currently, all of our money processing software is proprietary and has been developed internally by our software development team. Our money processing software acts as a point of sale for our money remittance transactions and incorporates real-time compliance functionality, which improves our regulatory compliance and helps to minimize fraud. Our money processing software is critical to our operations while our back-office software is critical for settling our transactions.


In addition to our money remittance software, we continue to develop programs and defenses against cyber-attacks. We are fully aligned with the cybersecurity framework, which is a voluntary framework that most companies in the financial services industry follow. We utilize a number of third-party vendors that monitor our systems and inform us of any attempted attacks. We also utilize a third-party consultant to act as our Chief Information Security Officer (“CISO”) and audit our cybersecurity policies and practices. Our CISO delivered an annual report to our board of directors at least once during the fiscal year.
 
In addition to our proprietary and internally developed software systems, we have analytical data which enables us to analyze market trends, performance of market territories, agents’ performance and consumers’ habits in real time.
 
We continually invest in our technology platform that has the capacity to handle traffic well in excess of ten times the number of transactions we currently process. A load balancing configuration between tier-1 datacenters, in addition to failover redundancy, provide uptime performance. Our technology platform has experienced limited downtime, with our 2018 downtime being less than 0.05%, despite multiple natural disasters in our markets during that period.
 
Our Transaction Processing Engine, developed through a combination of databases, web services and applications, allows us to process money remittances reliably and quickly by leveraging a proprietary rules engine to apply granular-level product feature customization. The Transaction Processing Engine also leverages real-time risk management algorithms to improve our regulatory compliance and helps to minimize fraud.
 
Our internally developed and proprietary payer Application Programming Interface (“API”) platform securely and efficiently integrates our transaction processing engine directly with the platforms of our paying agents, so that we can deliver money remittances quickly to our paying agents while optimizing the efficiency/speed of adding new payers to our network and integrating payers’ software and systems with our software and systems.
 
Intellectual Property
 
The Intermex brand is critical to our business. In the markets in which we compete, we derive benefit from our brand, as we believe the Intermex brand is recognized for its speed, cost effectiveness and reliability for money remittances throughout the United States and Latin America. We use various trademarks and service marks in our business, including, but not limited, to Intermex, International Money Express, CheckDirect and Pago Express, some of which are registered in the United States and other countries. In addition, we rely on trade secret protection to protect certain proprietary rights in our information technology. See the section entitled “Information Technology” for more information.
 
We rely on a combination of patent, trademark and copyright laws and trade secret protection and confidentiality or license agreements to protect our proprietary rights in products, services, expertise, and information. We believe the intellectual property rights in processing equipment, computer systems, software and business processes held by us and our subsidiaries provide us with a competitive advantage. We take appropriate measures to protect our intellectual property to the extent such intellectual property can be protected.

Sales and Marketing
 
The majority of our money remittance transactions are generated through our agent network of retail locations and company-operated stores where the transaction is processed and payment is collected by our agent (“sending agent(s)”). Those funds become available for pickup by the beneficiary at the designated destination, usually within minutes, at any Intermex payer location (“paying agent(s)”). Our agent locations include multi-service stores, grocery stores, convenience stores, bodegas and other retail locations. The vast majority of our agents are provided access to our proprietary money remittance software systems, while others have access to our combination telephone and fax/tablet set up, which we call telewire, enabling direct access to our call centers for money remittance services. In all of our independent sending agent locations the agent provides the physical infrastructure and staff required to complete the remittances, while we provide the central operating functions, such as transaction processing, settlement, marketing support, compliance training and support and customer relationship management. We also maintain 32 company-operated stores in the United States. When a money remittance transaction is initiated at a company-operated store, only the paying agent earns a commission. We retain customer data, which enables us to increase repeat customer usage, track and effectively recapture one-time users of our service and improve sending agent productivity. As a part of our money remittance transactions, we rely upon in excess of 100,000 sending agents and paying gents, none of which, individually, handle a material portion of our business.
 
We market our services to customers in a number of ways, directly and indirectly through our sending agents and paying agents, promotional activities, traditional media and digital advertising, and our loyalty program, which we call “Interpuntos.” This loyalty program offers customers faster service at our sending agent locations and the ability to earn points with each transaction that are redeemable for rewards, such as reduced transaction fees or more favorable foreign exchange rates.
 
Our Industry
 
We are a rapidly growing and leading money remittance services company primarily focused on the United States to the LAC corridor. We utilize our proprietary technology to deliver convenient, reliable and value-added services to our customers through a broad network of sending and paying agents. The two largest remittance corridors we serve are United States to Mexico and United States to Guatemala. According to the World Bank Remittance Matrix, the United States to Mexico remittance corridor was the largest in the world in 2017, with an aggregate of over $30.0 billion sent. This amount represented approximately 40% of remittances to all of Latin America, and Mexico was the fourth largest global recipient of remittances, after India, China and the Philippines. The United States to Guatemala corridor represented the tenth largest in the world in 2017 as reported by the World Bank in their latest available data published, with an aggregate of over $7.2 billion sent. Growth in money remittances in the United States-Latin America corridor continues to outpace money remittance growth in the rest of the world. For example, while global remittances increased by 5.7% from 2015 to 2017, remittances to Latin America grew at a rate of 17.6% in the same period, with the vast majority of that volume coming from the United States.
 
Trends in the cross-border money remittance business tend to correlate to immigration trends, global economic opportunity and related employment levels in certain industries such as construction, information, manufacturing, agriculture and certain service industries.
 
Throughout 2018, Latin American political and economic conditions remained unstable, as evidenced by high unemployment rates in key markets, currency reserves, currency controls, restricted lending activity, weak currencies and low consumer confidence, among other factors. Specifically, continued political and economic unrest in parts of Mexico and Guatemala contributed to volatility. Our business has generally been resilient during times of economic instability as money remittances are essential to many recipients, with the funds used by the receiving party for their daily needs. However, long-term sustained devaluation of the Mexican Peso or Guatemalan Quetzal as compared to the U.S. dollar could negatively affect our revenues and profitability.
 
Another significant trend impacting the money remittance industry is increasing regulation on banks, making it difficult for money remittance companies to have strong banking relationships. Regulations in the United States and elsewhere focus, in part, on cybersecurity and consumer protection. Regulations require money remittance providers, banks and other financial institutions to develop systems to prevent, detect, monitor and report certain transactions.
 
Government Regulation
 
As a non-bank financial institution, we are regulated by the Department of Treasury, the Internal Revenue Service, FinCEN, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”), the Department of Banking and Finance of the State of Florida and additionally by the various regulatory institutions of those states where we hold an operating license. We are duly registered as a Money Service Business (“MSB”) with FinCEN, the financial intelligence unit of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. We are also subject to a wide range of regulations in the United States and other countries, including anti-money laundering laws and regulations; financial services regulations; currency control regulations; anti-bribery laws; money transfer and payment instrument licensing laws; escheatment laws; privacy, data protection and information security laws; and consumer disclosure and consumer protection laws.

Regulators worldwide are exercising heightened supervision of money remittance providers and requiring increased efforts to ensure compliance. Failure to comply with any applicable laws and regulations could result in restrictions on our ability to provide our products and services, as well as the potential imposition of civil fines and possibly criminal penalties. We continually monitor and enhance our compliance programs in light of the most recent legal and regulatory changes.
 
Anti-Money Laundering Compliance. Our money remittance services are subject to anti-money laundering laws and regulations of the United States, including the Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, as well as state laws and regulations and the anti-money laundering laws and regulations in many of the countries in which we operate. The countries in which we operate may require one or more of the following:
 
    
· | reporting of large cash transactions and suspicious activity;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


· | transaction screening against government watch-lists, including the watch-list maintained by OFAC;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | prohibition of transactions in, to or from certain countries, governments, individuals and entities;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | limitations on amounts that may be transferred by a customer or from a jurisdiction at any one time or over specified periods of time, which require aggregation over multiple transactions; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | customer information gathering and reporting requirements;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


· | customer disclosure requirements, including language requirements and foreign currency restrictions;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | notification requirements as to the identity of contracting agents, governmental approval of contracting agents or requirements and limitations on contract terms with our agents; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | registration or licensing of us or our agents with a state or federal agency in the United States or with the central bank or other proper authority in a foreign country; and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | minimum capital or capital adequacy requirements.
--+--------------------------------------------------



Anti-money laundering regulations are constantly evolving and vary from country to country. We continuously monitor our compliance with anti-money laundering regulations and implement policies and procedures in light of the most current legal requirements. Our money remittance services are primarily offered through third-party agents under contract with us, but we do not directly control these agents. As a MSB, we and our agents are required to establish anti-money laundering compliance programs that include internal policies and controls; a designated compliance officer; employee training and an independent review function. We have developed an anti-money laundering training manual and a program to assist with the education of our agents and employees on the applicable rules and regulations. We also offer in-person and online training as part of our agent compliance training program, engage in various activities to enable agent oversight and have adopted compliance policies that outline key principles of our compliance program to our agents. We have developed a regulatory compliance department, under the direction of our experienced Chief Administrative and Compliance Officer, whose foremost responsibility is to monitor transactions, detect suspicious activity, maintain financial records and train our employees and agents. An independent third-party consulting firm periodically reviews our policies and procedures to ensure the efficacy of our anti-money laundering and regulatory compliance program. Our key milestones in the compliance process include (1) the entry of the transaction by the sending agent requires completion of mandatory fields and identification requirements, (2) the sender and receiver are screened against government required lists (for OFAC and other purposes), (3) the transaction, before sent to the paying agent, is screened and any flagged exceptions are sent to the compliance unit for investigation and release or rejection and (4) the transaction is screened for limit restrictions, velocity levels, structuring and identification requirements.
 
In connection with and when required by regulatory requirements we make information available to certain U.S. federal and state, as well as certain foreign, government agencies to assist in the prevention of money laundering, terrorist financing and other illegal activities and pursuant to legal obligations and authorizations. In certain circumstances, we may be required by government agencies to deny transactions that may be related to persons suspected of money laundering, terrorist financing or other illegal activities, and it is possible that we may inadvertently deny transactions from customers who are making legal money transfers.
 
Licensing. In most countries, either we or our agents are required to obtain licenses or to register with a government authority in order to offer money transfer services. Almost all states in the United States, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico require us to be licensed to conduct business within their jurisdictions. Licensing requirements may include requirements related to net worth, providing surety bonds and letters of credit, operational procedures, agent oversight and maintenance of reserves to cover outstanding payment obligations. Acceptable forms of such reserves will vary based on jurisdiction and the applicable regulator, but generally include cash and cash equivalents, U.S. government securities and other highly rated debt instruments. Many regulators require us to file reports on a quarterly or more frequent basis to verify our compliance with their requirements. We are also subject to periodic examinations by the governmental agencies with regulatory authority over our business.
 
Escheatment. Unclaimed property laws of each state in the United States in which we operate, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico require us to track certain information for all of our money remittances and payment instruments and, if the funds underlying such remittances and instruments are unclaimed at the end of an applicable statutory abandonment period, require us to remit the proceeds of the unclaimed property to the appropriate jurisdiction. Applicable statutory abandonment periods range from three to seven years. Certain foreign jurisdictions also have unclaimed property laws. These laws are evolving and are often unclear and inconsistent among jurisdictions, making compliance challenging. We have an ongoing program designed to comply with escheatment laws as they apply to our business.

Data Privacy and Cybersecurity. We are subject to federal, state and international laws and regulations relating to the collection, use, retention, security, transfer, storage and disposal of personally identifiable information of our customers, agents and employees. In the United States, we are subject to various federal privacy laws, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which requires that financial institutions provide consumers with privacy notices and have in place policies and procedures regarding the safeguarding of personal information. We are also subject to privacy and data breach laws of various states. Outside the United States, we are subject to privacy laws of numerous countries and jurisdictions, which may be more restrictive than the U.S. laws and impose more stringent duties on companies or penalties for non-compliance. Government surveillance laws and data localization laws are evolving to address increased and changing threats and risks and as these laws evolve they may be, or become, inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.
 
Consumer Protection. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) was signed into law in 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act imposes additional regulatory requirements and creates additional regulatory oversight over us. The Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB which issues and enforces consumer protection initiatives governing financial products and services, including money remittance services, in the United States. The CFPB’s Remittance Transfer Rule became effective on October 28, 2013. Its requirements include: a disclosure requirement to provide consumers sending funds internationally from the United States enhanced pre-transaction written disclosures, an obligation to resolve certain errors, including errors that may be outside our control, and an obligation to cancel transactions that have not been completed at a customer’s request. As a “larger participant” in the market for international money transfers, we are subject to direct examination and supervision by the CFPB. We have modified our systems and consumer disclosures in light of the requirements of the Remittance Transfer Rule. In addition, under the Dodd-Frank Act, it is unlawful for any provider of consumer financial products or services to engage in unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices. The CFPB has substantial rule making and enforcement authority to prevent unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices in connection with any transaction with a consumer for a financial product or service.
 
Anti-Bribery Regulation. We are subject to regulations imposed by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) in the United States and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions. These laws may impose recordkeeping and other requirements on us. We maintain a compliance program designed to comply with anti-bribery laws and regulations applicable to our business.
 
Risk Management
 
At times, we are exposed to credit risk related to receivable balances from sending agents in the money remittance process if agents do not promptly process transactions and make payments to us. Historically, the amount of these receivables has not been material to our business.
 
Through our online and electronic platforms, we also are exposed to credit risk directly from transactions that are originated through means other than cash, such as credit, debit and “ACH” cards, and therefore are subject to “chargebacks” for insufficient funds or other collection impediments, such as fraud.
 
We continually monitor fraud risk, perform credit reviews before adding agents to our network and conduct periodic credit risk analyses of agents and certain other parties that we transact with directly. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, our bad debt expense was equal to 0.5% of our total revenues.
 
Seasonality
 
We do not experience meaningful seasonality in our business. We may experience, however, increased transaction volume around certain holidays, such as Mother’s Day and the December holidays.
Competition
 
The market for money remittance services is very competitive, consisting of a small number of large competitors and a large number of small, niche competitors, and we will continue to encounter competition from new technologies that enable customers to send and receive money in a variety of ways. We generally compete based on convenience, price, security, reliability, customer service, distribution network, speed, options and brand recognition. We believe that our ongoing investments in new products and services will help us to remain competitive in our evolving business environment.
 
Our competitors include a small number of large money remittance providers, financial institutions, banks and a large number of small niche money remittance service providers that serve select regions. We compete with larger companies such as The Western Union Company (“Western Union”), MoneyGram International, Inc. (“MoneyGram”) and Euronet Worldwide Inc. (“EuroNet”) and a number of other smaller competitors. We generally compete for money remittance agents on the basis of value, service, quality, technical and operational differences, commission, and marketing efforts. As a philosophy we sell credible solutions to agents, not discounts or higher commissions as is typical for the industry. We compete for money remittance customers on the basis of trust, convenience, service, efficiency of outlets, value, technology and brand recognition.

Index

We expect to encounter increasing competition as new technologies emerge that enable customers to send and receive money through a variety of channels, but we do not expect adoption rates to be as significant in the near term for the customer segment we serve. Regardless, we continue to innovate in the industry by differentiating our money remittance business through programs to foster loyalty among agents as well as customers and have expanded our channels through which our services are accessed to include online and mobile offerings in preparation for customer adoption.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had 252 employees in the United States, as well as 438 employees outside of the United States. As of December 31, 2018, we had 335 employees in Mexico represented by a labor union.
Insurance
 
We maintain insurance policies to cover directors’ and officers’ liability, fiduciary, crime, property, workers’ compensation, automobile, key man, general liability and umbrella insurance.
 
All of our insurance policies are with third-party carriers and syndicates with financial ratings of A or better. We and our global insurance broker regularly review our insurance policies and believe the premiums, deductibles, coverage limits and scope of coverage under such policies are reasonable and appropriate for our business.
