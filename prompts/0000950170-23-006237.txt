Item 1. Business
Overview
 We are a commercial-stage medical technology company dedicated to improving the vision of patients following cataract surgery. Our proprietary RxSight® Light Adjustable Lens system (“RxSight system”) is the first and only commercially available premium cataract technology that enables doctors to customize and optimize visual acuity for patients after surgery. The RxSight system is comprised of our RxSight Light Adjustable Lens® (“LAL®”), RxSight Light Delivery Device (“LDD”) and accessories. Our LAL is a premium intraocular lens (“IOL”) made of proprietary photosensitive material that changes shape in response to specific patterns of ultraviolet (“UV”) light generated by our LDD.
We designed our RxSight system to address the shortcomings of competitive premium IOL technologies and provide a solution that doctors can trust to improve visual outcomes and achieve high levels of patient satisfaction. Competitive premium IOLs require patients to specify their visual priorities before surgery and be willing to accept various optical trade-offs associated with those choices. Once a patient has selected a competitive premium IOL, the surgeon must rely on a series of preoperative diagnostic tests and predictive formulae to choose the appropriate lens power. If the doctor’s prediction is suboptimal, then the patient may experience suboptimal results that could necessitate a subsequent corneal refractive procedure or certain other compromises in order to reach vision targets.
 In contrast, with the RxSight system, the surgeon implants the LAL as they would in any other cataract procedure, determines refractive error with patient input several weeks following surgery and then uses the LDD to modify the LAL with the precise visual correction needed to achieve the patient’s desired vision outcomes. We believe our RxSight system provides doctors and patients increased confidence and peace of mind by eliminating the high-stakes preoperative guesswork common to competitive premium IOLs and allowing patients to iterate their final vision characteristics with customized post-surgical adjustments.
A cataract is the loss of transparency in the eye’s natural lens, which causes blurry or hazy vision and can eventually lead to blindness. Approximately 50% of all individuals develop some form of cataracts by age 60, usually in both eyes, and prevalence increases with age. Among the world’s most commonly performed procedures, cataract surgery involves removing the cloudy natural lens and replacing it with a clear IOL. Prior to surgery, patients can opt for either a spherical monofocal IOL, which usually results in improved vision but requires glasses for best vision, or a premium IOL, which also corrects for astigmatism and/or presbyopia, thereby reducing spectacle dependence. In the United States, Medicare and private insurers typically cover the full cost of spherical IOL procedures, while premium IOL procedures require patients to pay an incremental out-of-pocket fee, typically ranging from $1,000 to $4,000 per eye depending on the specific premium IOL used. In the United States, the world’s largest premium IOL market, 2022 premium procedures represented about 25% of all cataract procedures and generated approximately $760 million in revenue, a figure that is projected to grow at a 12% compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) by 2027, according to the Market Scope 2022 Premium Cataract Surgery Market Report.
 We believe that the premium cataract surgery market remains underpenetrated due to both doctors’ reluctance to recommend competitive premium IOLs to the full universe of eligible patients and patients’ confusion in assessing the associated trade-offs and side effects with competitive premium IOLs. We believe competitive premium IOLs often fail to deliver on patients’ expectations for quality vision across a range of distances without glasses. In our most recent Phase IV commercial data over 90% of patients were able to achieve 20/20 or better at distance without glasses, which is approximately twice the rate of any of the alternative IOLs. In addition, over 90% of patients were also able to read 5-point font at near vision, which is typically the size of footnotes on a page.
We believe our RxSight system offers doctors and patients a significantly more reliable approach that can consistently deliver optimal, fully customized visual outcomes with few compromises, ultimately driving broad adoption and establishing it as the standard of care for premium cataract procedures. The key benefits of our solution include:
•Allowing full customization and optimization of patient vision after surgery. Our LAL uses a proprietary silicone formulation that enables changing the mechanical and optical properties of the lens following implantation. Our LDD uses proprietary software and algorithms to deliver a short UV light exposure treatment that polymerizes specific portions of the lens and allows doctors to adjust spherical and cylindrical refraction in 0.25 diopter increments, similar to the adjustment increments used to refract patients for glasses or contact 


lenses, as well as in other refractive procedures like LASIK. All other premium IOLs are fixed-power lenses that cannot be adjusted following surgery;
 •Delivering superior visual outcomes with low risk of side effects.  In our Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) clinical trial, 70% of LAL patients achieved 20/20 or better uncorrected visual acuity without glasses, while in similar trials of other premium IOLs, only about 40% of patients achieved this performance level. Additionally, LAL patients do not experience increased incidence of glare or halos that are common with other premium IOLs; 
 •Providing accuracy and precision to optimize vision with both eyes. Most LAL patients choose minor differences in the refractive correction of each eye, resulting in glasses-free vision across a full range of distances. In our most recent Phase IV commercial study data over 90% of patients were able to achieve 20/20 or better at distance without glasses, which is approximately twice the rate of any of the alternative IOLs. In addition, over 90% of patients were also able to read 5-point font at near vision, which is typically the size of footnotes on a page;
 •Enabling patients to preview and compare possible vision outcomes. LAL patients are the only premium IOL patients able to test-drive their vision after surgery but before selecting a final refractive outcome. With up to three possible UV light treatments to adjust the LAL, patients direct their optimal visual acuity through an interactive and iterative process; and 
 •Empowering doctors to grow their practices with a premium IOL they can trust and confidently recommend. Our RxSight system has been shown to deliver excellent visual outcomes across a broad range of patient types and preferences. In our 2022 RxSight customer survey, 89% of respondents said they thought our RxSight system delivered the highest quality vision, 98% said they would recommend the LAL to others and 75% said they would select it for their own eyes. 
 Our commercial efforts began in 2019 and have been primarily focused in the United States, where we are building a “razor and razor blade” business model to drive new customer adoption and ongoing LAL volume growth. Our U.S. commercial organization includes a direct sales team of LDD sales personnel and LAL account managers, as well as clinical specialists, field service engineers and marketing personnel. Our sales efforts are concentrated on the roughly 3,000 U.S. cataract surgeons that perform 70%-80% of all premium IOL procedures. As of December 31, 2022, we had established an installed base of 400 LDDs in ophthalmology practices and, since our inception though December 31, 2022, surgeons have implanted over 42,000 LALs.
We plan to grow our business primarily by expanding the size of our LDD installed base and driving increased utilization of our LAL through heightened awareness of the superior clinical outcomes our RxSight system provides patients. To continue to strengthen our competitive position in the premium IOL market, our research and development activities are focused primarily on programs that improve clinical outcomes, improve customer experience, expand our indications for use, reduce manufacturing costs and lifecycle management.
Our market and industry
Cataracts and other common vision conditions
Common vision conditions can be roughly divided by two defining factors: 1) the typical age of onset and 2) whether the condition is more closely linked to the cornea, the front surface of the eye that controls about two-thirds of its focusing ability, or the natural lens, which sits behind the iris and is responsible for the eye’s remaining focusing power. From childhood through the fourth decade of life, refractive conditions related primarily to the cornea – myopia, hyperopia and astigmatism – typically have the greatest impact on visual acuity and are usually addressed with glasses and contact lenses. In adults with these conditions, corneal procedures like LASIK can reduce dependence on glasses and contact lenses.
By age 50, most people also experience presbyopia, which manifests itself as increased difficulty seeing at near and intermediate distances without glasses or contact lenses. Presbyopia occurs because the natural lens is losing its elasticity and, therefore, its ability to focus light rays on near objects. By age 60, approximately half of all individuals also develop some form of cataracts, in which the normally clear lens loses its transparency and increasingly obstructs or otherwise interferes with the passage of light to the retina. The result is blurry or hazy vision and increased sensitivity to light, particularly at night, that cannot be treated with glasses or contact lenses. Cataracts are irreversible, progressive and usually affect both eyes. Cataracts can significantly interfere with daily activities, affect quality of life and eventually cause

blindness. According to the National Eye Institute, despite the availability of effective surgical treatment, cataracts are the leading cause of blindness worldwide.


Cataract surgery
Cataract surgery is among the most common surgical procedures performed in the world and involves replacement of the patient’s natural cloudy lens with a clear artificial IOL. In the United States, the procedure is commonly performed in an outpatient setting, such as an Ambulatory Surgery Center (“ASC”), by an ophthalmologist specializing in cataract surgery and often requires only 5 to 15 minutes to complete. In most cases, surgery begins with removal of the cataractous lens through a process known as phacoemulsification. During phacoemulsification, the ophthalmic surgeon makes a small surgical incision in the cornea and inserts an ultrasonic probe that breaks up, or emulsifies, the lens while a hollow needle removes the pieces of the lens (see image 1 below). After the cataract is removed, the surgeon inserts the replacement IOL through the same surgical incision (see image 2 below). Following implantation, the IOL sits firmly in place just behind the iris (see image 3 below).


Conventional vs. premium cataract surgery
 Cataract surgery is often bifurcated into two categories based on IOL type, as follows:
•Conventional: The patient receives a monofocal IOL, which is designed to provide vision at one pre-defined distance without correction for other visual problems that often affect cataract surgery patients such as corneal astigmatism and presbyopia. Nearly all patients undergoing conventional cataract surgery will need to rely on glasses following cataract surgery to achieve the best distance, intermediate and near vision. 
 •Premium: The patient receives a premium IOL, which is designed to address the shortcomings of conventional monofocal lenses by also correcting for the additional visual problems of astigmatism and/or presbyopia. Premium IOLs reduce the need for glasses relative to conventional IOLs but may impose trade-offs related to their ability to provide glasses-free near, intermediate and distance vision, as well as the potential for increased incidence of halos, glare and other side effects related to monofocal IOLs.
 Healthcare payors typically cover the full cost of conventional cataract procedures. In the United States, a healthcare payor (primarily Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”)) typically provides reimbursement for a conventional cataract procedure of approximately $500 for a surgeon fee and approximately $1,000 for a facility fee, which includes the cost of a conventional monofocal IOL. Accounting for reductions in CMS reimbursement and for inflation, reimbursement

rates have decreased by two thirds since 1991. The surgeon fee covers all pre-operative cataract testing, the cataract operation and follow-up care for three months.
For U.S. premium cataract procedures, the healthcare payor (primarily CMS) reimburses the same surgeon and facility fees, but the patient pays the surgeon an additional fee between $1,000-$2,000 for implantation of a toric IOL and an average between $2,000-$4,000 for implantation of other premium lenses, which includes the cost of the premium IOL. Consequently, premium cataract procedures are between 10 and 15 times more profitable for the doctors and ophthalmology practices than conventional cataract procedures and are less impacted by changes in reimbursement rates. At the same time, because premium cataract patients pay an additional out-of-pocket fee, they tend to have high expectations that the surgeon will satisfy their desire for quality, glasses-free vision. 
Our market opportunity
According to the Market Scope 2022 Premium Cataract Surgery Market Report and 2022 Market Scope IOL Report:
•Approximately 28 million cataract surgeries were performed globally in 2022, including 4.6 million in the United States. The number of procedures worldwide is projected to grow at a CAGR of 6.3% to over 38 million by 2027. In the United States, procedures are expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.3% to 5.3 million by 2027; 
 •The United States is the world’s largest premium IOL market. In 2022, premium IOL procedures represented approximately 25% and 12% of cataract surgeries in the United States and worldwide, respectively; 
 •In 2022, premium IOL revenue was approximately $2.1 billion globally and $760 million in the United States, and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 13% and 12%, respectively, through 2027. Key growth drivers include the increasing number of patients who prefer to be glasses-free, technological innovations, increased access to healthcare and rising disposable income; and 
 •In the United States, there are approximately 10,000 ophthalmic surgeons that perform cataract surgery, including approximately 3,000 that perform roughly 70%-80% of premium IOL cataract procedures. 
 We believe there is an opportunity to gain market share in the premium IOL market segment and also increase the penetration of premium IOLs in the broader market by converting doctors and patients currently electing for conventional cataract surgery. We believe that the premium cataract surgery market remains underpenetrated due to both doctors’ reluctance to recommend premium IOL offerings to the full universe of eligible patients and patients’ confusion in assessing the trade-offs associated with the wide range of commercially available premium IOL offerings. Furthermore, we believe current non-adjustable premium IOL offerings often cannot deliver on patient expectations regarding their desire to see at near, intermediate and far distances without reliance on glasses and to avoid troubling side effects such as glare, halos and loss of contrast sensitivity.
 We are currently focused on driving awareness and penetration of our RxSight system in the premium cataract market, and primarily concentrating our near-term commercial efforts on the United States. We believe the United States is the most compelling market given the large population of individuals over the age of 60 that are covered by health insurance, the concentrated base of cataract surgeons experienced with premium IOL offerings, the high gross domestic product per capita and the favorable U.S. healthcare reimbursement system, which has a well-established history of covering a portion of the cost for cataract surgery.
 Non-adjustable premium IOLs and their limitations
 Prior to the commercial availability of our RxSight system, doctors and patients chose from two primary types of premium IOLs, as follows:
•Multifocal Lenses. Multifocal lenses have two or more corrective zones, which allow the patient to receive focused light from different distances. Although multifocal lenses provide patients with a wider range of vision compared to the standard monofocal IOLs, multifocal lenses split light across the multiple corrective zones on the lens, sometimes impacting visual quality. For example, approximately two to three times as many patients who choose a multifocal lens over a monofocal lens experience side effects such as glare and halos, as well as reduced contrast vision, which are especially problematic in low light situations such as driving at night. For some patients these become more pronounced and can lead to explantation (removal of the IOL and replacement with another type of IOL). Extended-depth-of-focus (“EDOF”) lenses are similar to multifocals, except they have 


only one corrective zone. They create an elongated focal point that allows for a broader range of vision, although patients will still often require glasses for distance and near vision. EDOF lenses will still typically result in glare and halos, as well as reduced contrast vision, although generally less severe than those experienced with multifocal lenses; and
•Astigmatism-Correcting or Toric Lenses. Toric lenses correct for astigmatism, a condition in which the cornea is not uniformly curved leading to distortion of near and distance vision. According to the 2022 Market Scope IOL Report, approximately 70% of the population has clinically significant astigmatism of 0.5 diopters or more. Corrective toric lenses can provide additional distance, intermediate or near vision correction depending on the power of the lens selected and if their optical design incorporates either multifocal or EDOF features. 
 When preparing patients for premium cataract surgery, surgeons must have a comprehensive understanding of available premium IOL options and how to best match a patient to the technology that fits their priorities. Patient decisions are based on several factors and tend to be heavily influenced by surgeon recommendations, as well as the patient’s motivation for independence from glasses and willingness to tolerate side effects. During an initial consultation, surgeons often ask patients to fill out a survey regarding their vision experiences and expectations to determine if the patient is a good premium IOL candidate. If so, the surgeon helps select the appropriate premium IOL based on the patient’s lifestyle and the type of vision they most value (i.e., near, intermediate or distance). Significant time is often required to educate patients on the various trade-offs with respect to the visual outcomes associated with each type of premium IOL. Following this consultation, surgery is usually scheduled within several weeks or months.
 Prior to surgery, the patient’s eyes are measured using one or more diagnostic devices to help the surgeon predict the lens focusing power best suited to achieve the optimal postoperative outcome. Focusing power, expressed in diopters (D), refers to how a lens focuses light to a point (spherical power) or a line (cylindrical or astigmatic power). Accurately predicting lens power is critical to reducing postoperative residual refractive error and delivering the best possible visual outcomes. Because the lens power of competitive premium IOLs cannot be changed after implantation, doctors rely on a series of preoperative diagnostic tests and predictive formulae to determine the lens power. Typically, the patient returns a day after surgery to have their eye evaluated and ensure healing is underway. After approximately one month, premium cataract patients that are dissatisfied with their results may be fitted for glasses or elect to undergo a secondary, remedial procedure to meet desired vision targets. A separate LASIK procedure is the most common surgical procedure to correct any residual visual errors following the cataract procedure.
 A key limitation of these competitive premium IOLs is that they cannot be adjusted after the surgery and, as such, require the patient to commit to a desired visual outcome prior to the procedure. However, in discussing vision optimization options with patients ahead of the procedure, it can be difficult to effectively demonstrate different visual outcomes. Once a premium IOL is selected, another key limitation is the ability of the surgeon to precisely predict the correct lens power and then implant the IOL with the level of accuracy required to deliver the patient’s expected outcome. Additionally, the incision made to remove the cloudy lens and insert the IOL along with the resultant healing process often creates additional levels of astigmatism, which cannot be predicted with precision before cataract surgery.
We believe that the need to commit to a visual outcome before surgery combined with the limited ability to make adjustments following the procedure are key factors contributing to the low levels of premium IOL penetration. When expectations regarding postoperative visual acuity and independence from glasses are not met, patients are often disappointed. As a result, even though 60% of cataract patients rate “being glasses free after cataract surgery” as extremely important, surgeons are often hesitant to recommend existing premium IOLs to their patients.
 Our solution
We designed our RxSight system to address the shortcomings of existing premium IOL technologies and provide a solution that doctors can trust to improve visual outcomes and achieve high levels of patient satisfaction. We began commercializing our solution in the United States in 2019 and are focused on establishing the RxSight system as the standard of care for premium IOL procedures. As of December 31, 2022, we had an installed base of 400 LDDs in ophthalmology practices, and since our inception over 42,000 surgeries have been performed with our RxSight system.
 Overview of the RxSight system
Our RxSight system is the first and only FDA-approved IOL technology that enables doctors to customize and optimize visual acuity for patients after cataract surgery. With the RxSight system, the doctor performs a standard cataract procedure to implant the LAL, determines refractive error with patient input after healing is complete, then uses the LDD to reshape the

LAL to achieve the patients’ desired vision outcomes. Our RxSight system is comprised of two key components, along with other intraoperative and postoperative accessories:
 •RxSight Light Adjustable Lens: The LAL is our proprietary IOL that can be adjusted postoperatively to improve uncorrected visual acuity. Our IOL is made of special photosensitive material that changes shape and power when a specific pattern of UV light is delivered from the LDD. 
 •RxSight Light Delivery Device: The LDD is our proprietary office-based light treatment device that delivers UV light in a precisely programmed pattern to induce a predictable change in the shape and refractive properties of the LAL, enabling surgeons to precisely modify the LAL based on the visual correction needed to achieve the patient’s desired vision after cataract surgery. 
 


Our foundational technology
We have developed our RxSight system over the last 20 years, incorporating expertise and proprietary technologies across multiple disciplines, including optics, material science, chemistry, software and hardware engineering. The proprietary RxSight technology that enables post-operative adjustability is based on the principles of photochemistry. The LAL is made of a photosensitive material that changes shape and power when a specific pattern of UV light is delivered to the LAL.
Our LAL, which we manufacture using our proprietary silicone formulation, leverages the unique material properties of silicone. A silicone molecule consists of an inorganic silicon-oxygen backbone, which is a chain of alternating silicon and oxygen atoms with an attached side group, which is a pair of organic molecules bonded to each silicon atom in the chain. Through a process called polymerization, silicone monomers (short chain molecules) are reacted together to form silicone polymers (long chain molecules), which may be cross-linked at multiple points resulting in three-dimensional, rather than linear, structures. By varying chain length, attached side group and cross-linking design, silicone polymers can be tailored to have unique properties, leading to their broad use across a wide array of applications. We have developed a novel application of silicone to optimize the mechanical and optical properties of IOLs in order to improve vision in patients following cataract surgery.
To create the LAL, we use a composition of silicone polymers and monomers, the latter which we call “macromers” mixed with photo-active molecules and other compounds. The initial composition of our lens material is a viscous liquid that is thermally cured in a lens mold. Thermal curing and photopolymerization use temperature and ultraviolet light, respectively, to initiate and propagate a polymerization reaction. To avoid polymerizing the macromers in the composition, the thermal curing is performed at a low temperature. The partial polymerization of the LAL results in a solid but soft silicone lens, leaving the photosensitive macromers unpolymerized and distributed throughout the lens. While the resulting lens is optically clear, the macromers and photo-active molecules remain free to continuously move within the lens.
After packaging and sterilization, the LAL is ready to be implanted as part of a standard cataract surgical procedure to replace the patient’s natural lens. Once wound healing is complete, a short exposure of UV light is applied to the LAL to adjust the refractive properties of the lens. When the UV light is directed to a specific portion of the lens, the exposed macromers in that portion of the lens are polymerized and become stationary. This creates an excess concentration of free macromers in the unexposed portion of the lens and sets up a diffusion gradient over which the unpolymerized macromers move from the concentrated area to the less concentrated area. Over the next one to two days, the unpolymerized macromers

redistribute across the lens to achieve a uniform distribution. The redistribution of the macromers causes the exposed portion of the lens to swell relative to the unexposed portion of the lens, enabling refractive power change.
The movement of the macromers causes a highly predictable change in the curvature of the lens. If the central portion of the lens is exposed to UV light, unpolymerized macromers in the periphery of the lens move into the central portion. As a result, the central portion of the lens swells, creating a lens shape for correction of hyperopia. Conversely, if the periphery of the lens is exposed to UV light, unpolymerized macromers in the central portion of the lens migrate into the periphery. As a result, the periphery of the lens swells, creating a lens shape for correction of myopia. In addition to spherical correction for myopia or hyperopia, customized cylinder adjustments along any axis of the lens can be targeted to correct for astigmatism.
To achieve the desired refractive change in the LAL, our LDD uses proprietary software and algorithms to deliver a short UV exposure treatment that polymerizes specific portions of the lens according to a predefined pattern of light, called a nomogram. Nomograms allow for adjustment of spherical and cylindrical refraction in 0.25 diopter increments, like the adjustment increments used to refract patients for glasses or contact lenses, as well as in other refractive procedures like LASIK, which has similar refractive accuracy. Designed for placement in the doctor’s office, the LDD is a combination of a standard slit lamp and a digital light projector. The slit lamp portion allows the doctor to see inside the patient’s eye and align the light beam with the LAL. The digital light projector portion projects an image onto the LAL using DLP technology that has approximately 250,000 micro mirrors that are electronically activated to represent an image stored in memory.
Each UV light treatment consumes only a portion of the macromers in the lens, allowing the LAL to be adjusted multiple times. This process can be repeated up to three times over a period of several weeks, until the patient and doctor are satisfied. The entire lens is then polymerized to provide a stable correction. After adjustment light treatments are completed, one or two lock-in light treatments are applied to consume all remaining macromers and photo-active compounds. After the final lock-in treatment, the lens power can no longer be adjusted.
Our approach
 With the RxSight system, the surgeon performs a standard IOL implant procedure, replacing the patients’ natural lens with the LAL. Two to three weeks following surgery, the patient visits the doctor’s office for a standard postoperative refraction, which is similar to the eye test used to create a prescription for eye glasses. Using a traditional phoropter and vision chart, a clinician determines the refractive error and prescription required and inputs the information into the LDD’s graphical user interface. The patient’s eye is dilated and a contact lens is applied to the eye as the patient is seated in front of the LDD for a light treatment. Based on the prescription input, the LDD generates a programmed, predetermined exposure of UV light. For approximately 100 seconds, the light painlessly and non-invasively reshapes the implanted LAL to correct the measured refractive error. The entire treatment takes less than five minutes. The patient returns approximately three to five days later for additional light treatments to further adjust their vision, if desired, or to lock-in the lens. While patients can receive up to three adjustments, the average number of adjustments in our FDA clinical trial was 1.6.
The RxSight system enables a fully interactive and iterative process to optimize visual acuity with patients able to test drive their vision, comparing possible outcomes before selecting a final prescription for their LAL. In clinical practice since our FDA approval, roughly 60% of patients undergoing multiple adjustments have requested a change from their original spherical target, underscoring the value of adjustability and customization. From the time of surgery until 24 hours after the LAL is locked in, the patient wears UV light protective glasses as unprotected exposure to light can cause uncontrolled changes in the LAL. Since late 2021, we have included ActivShield technology on all LALs, which provides an extra layer of UV protection on the lens surface and reduces dependence on patient compliance with protective glasses.
 Key benefits of RxSight system for patients
•Superior vision outcomes. In the pivotal study that formed the basis for our FDA approval, the observed rate of eyes with 20/20 or better uncorrected distance visual acuity for our LAL was 70.1%. This compares favorably to the results of pivotal studies with similar study designs and patient populations that supported FDA approval of Alcon’s Acrysof Toric (38.4%) and J&J’s Tecnis Toric (43.6%). Most LAL patients choose minor differences in the refractive correction of each eye, resulting in glasses-free vision across a full range of distances. In our most recent Phase IV commercial study data over 90% of LAL patients who chose to optimize vision with both eyes, achieved 20/20 distance vision and were also able to read 5-point font without glasses; 
 •Postoperative customization. Our RxSight system enables patients to preview and compare possible vision outcomes after surgery based on their unique preferences and lifestyle requirements before they select a final 


prescription for their LAL. With up to three possible adjusting light treatments, patients can dial-in their optimal visual acuity through an interactive and iterative process;
•No increase in glare and halo. Our LALs do not induce higher rates of glare and halos compared to monofocal IOLs. In contrast, multifocal IOLs, generally relied upon to improve near vision, are associated with a higher incidence of unwanted side effects including reduced contrast sensitivity and increased glare and halos around bright lights. These problems can lead to explants, in which patients undergo another procedure to remove the multifocal IOL and replace it with another type of IOL. In FDA studies for the Alcon Panoptix, J&J Symfony and Alcon Vivity lenses, 48.8%, 59.2% and 17.0% of subjects, respectively, reported being bothered by halos postoperatively; and 
 •Corrects residual refractive error. The RxSight system can reduce the potential for secondary surgical procedures by correcting residual refractive error after surgery using our office based LDD to shape the LAL. With other premium IOLs, a separate LASIK procedure is generally the only way to correct for residual visual errors following the primary cataract procedure. 
 Key benefits of RxSight system for doctors
•Clear value proposition for patients, helping doctors to build their premium cataract practices. Rather than explaining the complicated trade-offs with respect to visual outcomes and predicting refraction before surgery, the surgeon may simply tell patients that their vision will be corrected postoperatively via a painless, in-office process similar to being prescribed glasses. The doctor can also share the LAL’s clinical results with the patient to provide reassurance that the procedure will deliver desired results; 
 •Increased confidence. The clinical benefit of “dialing-in” to achieve superior visual outcomes postoperatively increases doctors’ confidence that the LAL can meet patients’ expectations. The doctor does not need to decide prior to surgery whether the patient will be particularly sensitive to suboptimal visual outcomes or side effects (such as glare, halo and loss of contrast). The patient is also unlikely to need a postoperative adjustment such as LASIK to improve their outcome; 
 •Fewer intraoperative measurements. With other premium IOLs, the lens power is fixed and cannot be changed after surgery, requiring doctors to spend considerable time on preoperative and intraoperative measurements to estimate the most suitable lens power to implant and lens position. With our RxSight system, surgeons are not as dependent on preoperative and intraoperative equipment for measurements. Instead, they can focus on the surgical procedure, knowing refractive error will be corrected postoperatively with the LDD, and with the patient’s active involvement;
 •Broad application across different patients’ needs. We offer a single IOL that can address a broad range of patient types and needs, while providing a solution that doctors can trust to improve visual outcomes, eliminating the need for extensive preoperative discussions with patients about which IOL may best fit their lifestyle and visual preferences. Moreover, the superior outcomes and patient-centered approach of the RxSight system helps drive patient referrals and grow premium cataract volumes, which generally produce higher practice revenue and profit margin than conventional procedures; and
 •Economic benefits that drive practice growth. A recent economic impact survey by Haffey & Company of almost 50 practices using the RxSight system revealed that LAL procedures were sourced from all other categories of other IOLs. For example, respondents indicated that approximately 40% of their LAL patients would have otherwise selected a conventional monofocal IOL, which is far less profitable for a practice than a LAL procedure. In addition, based on an average of 9 LALs implanted per month at these practices, doctors observed a payback period of approximately nine months for the LDD, based on the current list purchase price. Following this payback period, practices continue to reap the financial benefit of converting patients to the RxSight system.
 Our growth strategies
We are leveraging the tangible and compelling benefits of our RxSight solution to achieve broad adoption of our technology and establish it as the standard of care for premium cataract surgery. Our growth strategies include:
 •Establishing new customers and growing our installed base of LDDs. We believe our technology offers a differentiated value proposition to doctors and patients, providing us an opportunity to grow our share in the 


premium IOL market and increase the penetration of premium IOLs in the broader cataract surgery market. To grow our installed base, we are focused primarily on converting high-volume premium cataract surgeons to the RxSight system by highlighting its clinical, economic and workflow benefits vs. competing premium IOL technologies. Secondarily, we are focused on the broader pool of cataract surgeons who may implant premium IOLs sparingly or not at all due to suboptimal visual outcomes, persistent side effects and uneven patient satisfaction sometimes associated with non-adjustable premium IOL offerings. Because our RxSight system is designed to overcome these shortcomings, we believe many of these doctors have the potential to be successful RxSight customers. We are also investing in professional education, additional clinical studies and registries that expand our evidence base, facilitating peer-to-peer dialogue and forums and communicating the benefits of our technology through marketing initiatives, tradeshows and podium presentations;
•Increasing the utilization of our LALs by empowering doctors to grow their practices. We work closely with every new customer to conduct a thorough training and onboarding process, providing a high level of service to help the practice succeed with the RxSight system. This support helps the practice confidently recommend the LAL to an increasing number of patients and, in turn, grow their practice. In a recent RxSight customer survey, 89% of doctors said they thought our RxSight system delivered the highest quality vision, 98% said they would recommend the LAL to others and 75% said they would select it for their own eyes. In addition to personnel support, we also provide practices with marketing materials, such as patient brochures, literature and digital content for website and social media promotions. We also provide ongoing training related to new technology features and developments, as well as education on the patient benefits of our solution;
 •Strategically expanding our commercial organization and marketing activities. Since launching the RxSight system commercially in 2019, we have substantially increased the size and scope of our U.S. commercial organization. While we believe our current commercial organization is well built to reach our focused target of high-volume premium cataract surgeons, we will add highly qualified personnel for time to time, with a strategic mix of sales personnel and clinical specialists, to drive higher levels of awareness and penetration in certain regions. We also expect to accelerate marketing initiatives and professional education, including training on best practices and techniques;
 •Investing in RxSight system enhancements and expanding indications. We continue to enhance our RxSight system to improve the patient and doctor experience, meet evolving customer needs and address the widest possible patient population. Since our initial FDA approval in November 2017 through December 31, 2022, we have received 20 supplemental approvals. Recent enhancements include increasing the range of available LAL powers, modifying the LAL to improve image quality, reducing the margin of residual refractive error, allowing an optional third refractive adjustment, developing new UV glasses with improved aesthetics and usability, and adding a photosensitive anterior layer (ActivShield) to the LAL to help protect the lens from unwanted UV exposure. We believe these technological advancements help to drive increased adoption of our RxSight system; 
 •Scaling our business to achieve cost and production efficiencies. We expect to realize operating leverage through increased scale efficiencies as our commercial operations grow. We have executed a number of design and manufacturing process improvements to streamline both LAL and LDD production, and have developed a lower cost to manufacture LDD, which was approved by the FDA on January 31, 2023. We are also concurrently executing on our strategy to optimize our diverse supply chain and to develop second sources from less expensive suppliers. We anticipate that the combination of these strategies will drive margin improvement in the future when introduced into production and offered for sale; and
 •Growing our commercial operations in international markets.  While our current commercial focus is on the large opportunity within the United States, we believe the RxSight system offers compelling benefits for cataract doctors and patients in select international markets. According to the Market Scope 2022 Premium Report, over 70% of the premium IOL procedures in 2022 were outside the United States. Our RxSight system has approval in Mexico and Canada for improving uncorrected visual acuity by adjusting the LAL power to correct residual postoperative refractive error. We may selectively pursue commercial expansion outside the United States that accept these approvals in the future, with a priority on markets where we see significant potential growth opportunities. New approvals may also be sought in large cataract markets with more complex regulatory environments such as Asia. 

FDA clinical studies
 In July 2016, we completed our FDA Phase 3 pivotal randomized clinical study of 600 subjects, designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of performing light treatments to correct postoperative spherical and cylindrical refractive error. In this study, 391 subjects had the LAL implanted in one eye and the results were compared at the six-month postoperative visit against 193 subjects with a monofocal control IOL implanted in one eye. The LAL met all primary effectiveness endpoints and was approved by the FDA on November 22, 2017 as the first commercially available adjustable IOL. In the study, 70.1% of LAL subjects achieved monocular uncorrected distance visual acuity of 20/20 or better compared to 36.3% of the eyes implanted with the monofocal control IOL. In addition to being statistically significantly better than the control IOL, the observed rate of eyes with 20/20 or better uncorrected distance visual acuity was the highest reported for any approved intraocular lens and approximately twice what was observed by the two most popular astigmatism-correcting IOLs (38.4% by Alcon’s Acrysof Toric, and 43.6% by J&J’s Tecnis Toric) in similar patient populations in the pivotal studies that led to their approvals by the FDA. Additionally, LAL patients reported a low rate of glare or halo, visual side effects that are frequently reported with premium IOLs.
We are conducting a 500-eye prospective, randomized, controlled multicenter Post Approval Study, which was a requirement of our Premarket Approval (“PMA”) approval. Subjects are randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either the LAL or a monofocal IOL. Study subjects will be followed for six months. The results will compare effectiveness and safety of the LAL and monofocal IOL. We anticipate completing enrollment in 2024.
 Sales and marketing
We commenced commercial launch of our RxSight system in the United States in 2019 and are initially focused on the estimated 3,000 surgeons that perform 70%-80% of premium cataract surgery procedures. These surgeons are usually part of larger ophthalmology practices with multiple cataract surgeons. They typically have refractive surgery practices offering LASIK and are skilled at selling premium procedures based on delivery of better visual outcomes. Our U.S. commercial organization includes a direct sales team comprised of LDD sales personnel and LAL account managers, as well as clinical specialists and field service engineers and marketing personnel. While we believe we can effectively cover our concentrated target market with our focused commercial organization, we will add highly qualified personnel from time to time, with a strategic mix of sales personnel and clinical specialists, to drive further awareness and penetration among cataract surgeons.
 Our commercial efforts are designed to create a “razor and razor blade” business model by building a sizable LDD installed base to drive ongoing growth in LAL procedure volumes. LDD sales personnel are responsible for establishing relationships with doctors and securing new customers. New customer contracts typically include sale of the LDD between approximately $115,000 - $120,000, sale of LALs for approximately $1,000 each and an LAL consignment agreement. Once the LDD is installed, our clinical specialists work closely with the practice’s doctors, technicians and staff members to ensure that they are fully trained, proficient LAL providers. Our LAL account managers oversee this process and engage with practices on an ongoing basis to assist with patient awareness and education programs, development of efficient patient flow processes and other initiatives. To achieve broad awareness of the RxSight system among cataract surgeons, we also conduct various marketing programs, including promotions at industry and society conferences, podium presentations, social media, and educational webinars focused on the differentiated benefits of our RxSight system.
Our RxSight system has received regulatory approval in Mexico and Canada. We recently commenced limited sales activities in Canada through a distribution partner.
Research and development
 Our research and development activities are focused on programs that improve clinical outcomes, improve customer experience, expand our indications for use, reduce manufacturing costs and lifecycle management. Since our initial FDA approval in November 2017 through December 31, 2022, we have received approximately 20 supplemental approvals that advance these objectives.
On January 31, 2023, the FDA approved our PMA supplement to our LDD for various modifications that are intended to reduce the cost to manufacture the device. We anticipate that this lower-cost-to-manufacture LDD will also require a submission for approval in countries outside the United States.
Research and development expenses were $26.0 million and $24.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.


Manufacturing and supply
We currently manufacture, assemble, test, and ship our LAL and LDD, and various accessory products including a custom injector system for use with our LAL at our campus of four facilities and approximately 121,000 total square feet in Aliso Viejo, California. We have intentionally pursued a vertically integrated manufacturing strategy offering critical advantages, including control over our product quality and rapid product iteration using strong R&D and quality groups. We believe our current manufacturing capacity is sufficient to meet our current expected demand for at least the next 12 months.
We are registered with the FDA as a medical device manufacturer and are licensed by the State of California to manufacture and distribute our medical devices. We are required to manufacture our products in compliance with the FDA’s Quality System Regulation (“QSR”) (21 CFR 820). The FDA enforces the QSR through periodic inspections and may also inspect the facilities of our suppliers. We moved to our current Aliso Viejo, California facilities starting in April 2016, all of which have been registered with the FDA, the State of California, and the European Notified Body (British Standards Institution) for the manufacture and distribution of medical devices.
We have received International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”) 13485:2016 certification for our quality management system. ISO certification generally includes recertification audits every third year, scheduled annual surveillance audits and periodic unannounced audits. We have also received quality system certification to the Medical Device Single Audit Program (“MDSAP”) to cover the jurisdictions of United States, Canada, Brazil, Japan, and Australia from the British Standards Institution. The MDSAP certification follows the ISO 13485:2016 certification schedule. The most recent recertification and surveillance audit was conducted in July 2022.
The LAL is a silicone intraocular lens made from a proprietary blend of custom chemical components. Chemical component vendors produce the raw materials, which we inspect, blend, further purify, and process, and formulate into uncured silicone blend. Using this uncured silicone, we mold the lens in one of our two Class 7 clean rooms. After curing, the molded lens is inspected and packaged and then sent to a third-party ethylene oxide sterilization vendor. After sterilization, the lens is returned to us for final inspection, packaging, and shipment to customers.
Our LDD is a UV projector medical device, which consists of an anterior segment biomicroscope, computer controllers for performing light treatments, and a biometrically designed patient interface and table. The optics are bonded into their mounts using epoxies, which are then oven cured, assembled into the main optical housing and optimized on a proprietary precision alignment station. The completed optical head is integrated into the table, along with a computer, power supplies and other electro-mechanical parts. We outsource the cables and circuit boards used in the LDD to certified specialty contract manufacturers. The fully assembled LDD is put through an electrical safety and final acceptance test process, and then reviewed by quality control, packaged and shipped directly to our customers for installation.
 In addition, to aid the doctor in implanting the LAL, we provide several accessories including a custom insertion system and a contact lens. The insertion system consists of a disposable cartridge and a reusable injector handpiece. The disposable cartridge is processed, inspected, and packaged by us while having ethylene oxide sterilization performed by a third-party vendor. The reusable injector handpiece is manufactured by a third-party vendor and is inspected and packaged by us. We also manufacture, inspect, and package a reusable contact lens for administering UV light treatments. The end user is responsible for performing cleaning and sterilization of the injector handpiece and the contact lens following directions for use and hands on training provided by us. We also provide custom UV glasses that are manufactured by third party vendors, and then inspected and shipped by us from our facilities to our customers.
We use a combination of internally manufactured and externally sourced components to produce the LAL, LDD, custom insertion system, and other accessory products. Externally sourced components include off-the-shelf chemical, materials, microchips integrated into printed circuit boards and cables, sub-assemblies, and custom parts that are provided by qualified and approved suppliers. We also employ a third-party sterilization vendor. Some components are provided by single-source or sole source suppliers. While there are other suppliers that could make or provide any one of our single sourced components, we seek to manage single-source supplier risk by regularly assessing the quality and capacity of our suppliers, implementing supply and quality agreements where appropriate and actively managing lead times and inventory levels of sourced components. In addition, we are currently in the process of identifying and approving alternative suppliers to dual or multi-source certain of our LAL raw materials and LDD components. We generally seek to maintain sufficient supply levels to help mitigate any supply interruptions and enable us to find and qualify another source of supply. Order quantities and lead times for externally sourced components are based on our forecasts, which are derived from historical demand and anticipated future demand. Lead times for components may vary depending on the size of the order, time required to fabricate and test the components, specific supplier requirements and current market demand for the materials, sub-assemblies, and

parts. In addition, COVID-19 has resulted in manufacturing interruptions at single and sole source suppliers in the United States, European Union, the U.K. and China, which we have been able to mitigate, to date, with selected pre-payment for product, expedite fees, sourcing from alternative suppliers, placing orders for specific chip sets separate from third party suppliers to ensure supply and longer-term orders.
Our suppliers are evaluated, qualified, and approved as part of our supplier quality program, which includes verification and monitoring procedures to ensure that our suppliers comply with FDA and ISO standards, as well as our own specifications and requirements. We inspect and verify externally sourced components under strict processes supported by internal policies and procedures. We maintain a rigorous change control policy to assure that no product or process changes are implemented without our prior review and approval.
Third-party reimbursement and patient billing
Dual aspect payment model
In the United States, the CMS has determined that the additional refractive correction provided by astigmatism correcting and presbyopia correcting (premium) IOLs is not a covered benefit. As described in two CMS rulings (CMS 05-01 and CMS 1536-R), premium IOLs have both a covered and non-covered aspect, providing the framework for the “dual-aspect payment model.” In effect since 2005, this model means that CMS does not reimburse the physician or the facility for the additional costs associated with a premium IOL, while still covering the cost of the conventional IOL procedure. Instead, the patient selecting a premium IOL is responsible for the additional charges from the physician and from the facility that exceed the regular charges for insertion of a conventional IOL that are submitted to CMS by each of these providers. As of 2017, CMS has recognized the LAL as an astigmatism correcting (premium) IOL, making it eligible for the dual aspect payment model. Most commercial payers mirror the Medicare rulings, but this can vary by payor.
Procedure coding and payment
In the United States, we primarily sell our LAL products to ambulatory surgical centers (“ASCs”) and occasionally to hospitals. These customers in turn bill various third-party payors, such as commercial payors and state and government payors, as well as patients and doctors directly for the services provided to each patient.
Third-party payors require physicians and hospitals to identify the service for which they are seeking reimbursement by using Current Procedural Terminology, or CPT, codes, which are created and maintained by the American Medical Association, or AMA. For cataract surgery, the most common specific CPT codes are 66984 (Cataract surgery with IOL, on stage) and 66982 (Cataract surgery, complex). The facility fees associated with these codes include payment for a conventional IOL of up to $150. A specific HCPCS code is listed on the CMS claim by the facility to indicate use of premium IOL for tracking purposes only (V2787 or V2788 for astigmatism-correcting or presbyopia-correction function of IOL, respectively). Similarly, the physician includes HCPCS code A9270 (non-covered item or service) on their claim to Medicare (or another third party) to indicate charges for extended care related to the correction of refractive error.
While an Advanced Beneficiary Notice (“ABN”) or Notice of Exclusion from Medicare Benefits (“NEMB”) is not required, most providers issue an ABN or NEMB to alert patients that CMS (or non-Medicare payers) do not cover the additional charges associated with a premium IOL and to get the patient’s agreement to pay these charges. Patients are then billed directly by the physician and the ASC for these charges. In some cases, the physician bills the patient exclusively and then reimburses the ASC for the additional cost of the premium IOL.
Commercial payor and government program coverage
While the dual aspect payment model has been in use for over 15 years, the extent to which this model will be used by non-government third-party payors, such as commercial insurance, and managed healthcare organizations may vary. One third-party payor’s decision does not ensure that other payors will also follow this model. As a result, the coverage determination process can require manufacturers to provide additional support for the use of a product to each payor separately. This can be a time-consuming process, with no assurance that the dual aspect model will be applied consistently.
Reimbursement outside of the United States
In international markets, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems also vary significantly by country, and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies. In many countries, analogous determinations to the dual aspect CMS ruling have been made, allowing for partial coverage of the cataract procedure by national health systems, with patients paying out of pocket for refractive services associated with the premium IOL. In other countries, such dual

billing is not allowed, forcing patients to pay for the entire cost of the cataract surgery and IOL when a premium IOL is used. In such markets, it may be possible for doctors to charge separately for the cost of light treatments, which are not part of the cataract procedure. This method would require a different billing methodology by us than is currently used in the United States, where light treatments are included with the purchase of the LAL. There is no assurance that these methodologies will be allowed or that an adequate level of payment will be established, or that the third-party payors’ reimbursement policies will not adversely affect the ability for manufacturers to sell products profitably.
Intellectual Property, License Agreements, and Other Material Agreements
Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain, maintain, protect, and enforce our intellectual property rights, including our patent rights, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets, operate without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the intellectual property rights of others and prevent others from infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating our intellectual property rights. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright and other intellectual property rights and measures to protect the products and technology that we consider important to our business. We also rely on know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position.
Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, pursuing and obtaining patent protection in the United States and in jurisdictions outside of the United States related to our technology, inventions, improvements and products that are important to the development and implementation of our business. Our patent portfolio covers various aspects of our LDD, LAL and related devices and methods.
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, in the United States, issued patents are granted a term of 20 years from the earliest claimed non-provisional or Patent Cooperation Treaty (“PCT”) filing date. In certain instances, a patent term can be adjusted to recapture a portion of delay by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”), in examining the patent application (patent term adjustment, or PTA) or extended to account for term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period (patent term extension, or PTE), or both. Additionally, a patent term may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier filed patent. However, the life of the patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. In addition, we cannot provide any assurance that any patents will be issued from our pending or future applications or that any issued patents will adequately protect our current and future products. We also cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our owned or in-licensed patents or whether such claims, if issued, will cover our products, provide sufficient protection from competitors or otherwise provide any competitive advantage. Any issued patents that we may own or in-license in the future may be challenged, invalidated, narrowed, held unenforceable, infringed or circumvented.
As of December 31, 2022, our patent estate is directed to various aspects of our programs and technology, including our LAL and our LDD as well as lens adjustment procedure and other technology. Any U.S. or foreign patents issued or pending would be scheduled to expire on various dates from 2023 and 2041, without taking into account any possible patent term adjustments or extensions and assuming payment of all appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity, and other governmental fees. Further details on certain segments of our patent portfolio, including our owned and exclusively in-licensed issued patents and patent applications, are included below.
 •Our current LAL: Some of the patents directed to our current LAL include, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 9,119,710, which is expected to expire in 2026, U.S. Pat. No. 10,470,874, which is expected to expire in 2026, and U.S. Pat. No. 10,874,505, which is expected to expire in 2033. 
 •Our LDD: Some of the patents directed to our LDD include, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 10,864,075, which is expected to expire in 2038, and U.S. Pat. No. 10,932,864, which is expected to expire in 2039. 
 •Our lens adjustment procedure: Some of the patents directed to our lens adjustment procedure include, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 10,010,406, which is expected to expire in 2032, and U.S. Pat. No. 10,166,731, which is expected to expire in 2036. 
 •Our RxSight system accessories: A patent directed to our RxSight system accessories includes, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 10,456,240, which is expected to expire in 2038. 
 Pursuant to the agreement with QAD, Inc. (“QAD”) dated October 29, 2015 (the “QAD Agreement”), we received a nonexclusive, non-transferable, perpetual license to use certain QAD software at the physical location where we install the software. Under the agreement, we purchase such QAD software through individual orders (“Purchase Orders”), and each

Purchase Order has a respective payment fee and maintenance fee. We use the software licensed under the QAD agreement for inventory, shipping, receiving, sales order, work order, planning and financial transactions for the business. Maintenance for the software is offered by QAD and available for purchase by us on an annual basis, and such purchase was compulsory for the first year of the agreement. After the first year, maintenance purchased under the agreement automatically renews for successive one-year periods unless terminated by us or QAD 60 days prior to the effective date of any renewal term. Further, we grant QAD audit rights to verify our usage of QAD software, and if following such audit our use of the QAD software is in excess of our license, we are obligated to pay to QAD the amounts necessary to become compliant. QAD provides limited warranties to the software and retains all intellectual property ownership rights in the QAD software including any modifications made by us, however we receive a license to use any modifications made by us. Unless earlier terminated, the term of the QAD agreement is perpetual. Both parties have the right to terminate the agreement for convenience by giving the other party 90 days prior written notice and such termination does not affect the license granted. Either party to the agreement may terminate the agreement with notice, if the other materially breaches the agreement, and the breach is not cured within specified time periods. In addition, either party may terminate if the other party is adjudicated bankrupt or an official is appointed to manage its financial affairs. Upon termination for cause, we must immediately discontinue all use of the software.
We believe that we have certain know-how and trade secrets relating to our technology and current and future products. We rely on trade secrets to protect certain aspects of our technology related to our current and future products. However, trade secrets and know-how can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our trade secrets and know-how, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, service providers, and contractors but these agreements may not provide meaningful protection, and we cannot guarantee that we have executed such agreements with all applicable counterparties. These agreements may also be breached, and we may not have an adequate remedy for any such breach. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. Although we take steps to protect our trade secrets and know-how, third parties may independently develop or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets and know-how.
For more information regarding risks related to our intellectual property, please see “Risk Factors-Risks related to Intellectual Property” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report.
Competition
Competition in the surgical ophthalmology market is intense and is primarily driven by technological innovation and the regulatory approval required to commercialize products in the key markets around the world. The development of new or improved products may make existing products less attractive, reduce them to commodity status or even make them obsolete. We believe the principal competitive factors in our markets include:
•the quality of patient outcomes, oftentimes measured by visual acuity, and adverse event rates; 
 •patient experience, including patient recovery time and level of discomfort; 
 •acceptance by treating doctors and referral sources; 
 •doctor learning curves and willingness to adopt new technologies; 
 •ease-of-use and reliability; 
 •economic benefits and cost savings; 
 •strength of clinical evidence; 
 •effective distribution and marketing to surgeons and potential patients; and 
 •product price and qualification for coverage and reimbursement. 
 From a commercial perspective, we believe our primary competitors in the cataract IOL market are alternative premium IOL providers, including Alcon, Johnson & Johnson and Bausch + Lomb. According to Market Scope, the global cataract IOL market is highly concentrated, with these top three players accounting for approximately 78% of the total U.S. premium cataract surgery market and approximately 61% of the global manufacturer market revenue. Our competitors are significantly larger than us with greater financial, marketing, sales and personnel resources, greater brand recognition and

longer operating histories. We believe our ability to compete effectively will be dependent on our ability to build the commercial infrastructure necessary to effectively and cost-efficiently drive awareness of the unique value of our RxSight system.
 In addition, patients who receive an LAL will be required to wear UV protective glasses until final lock-in which is approximately 4-5 weeks after surgery. They will also be required to return for an additional two to three clinic visits compared to traditional cataract surgery. The additional clinic visits are non-surgical but do require the patient’s eyes to be dilated. Due to these additional requirements, market acceptance of the LAL may be impacted.
The three most popular premium IOLs approved for cataract treatment are PanOptix by Alcon, Vivity by Alcon and Tecnis by Johnson & Johnson. According to the Market Scope 2022 Premium Report Alcon, Johnson & Johnson, Bausch + Lomb are three of the top IOL manufacturers, with an estimated 2022 revenue share of the world-wide premium IOL market of approximately 51%, 25%, and 2% respectively. The PanOptix and Tecnis families of IOLs are available in a monofocal Toric, multifocal Toric and EDOF Toric versions. The PC and Toric versions of these lenses represented over half of all premium multifocal IOLs sold in 2022. The rest of the market is shared between several smaller companies each with under 5% market share. From a technology perspective, we believe the LAL competes with nearly all of the existing IOLs, including conventional, premium astigmatism correcting and premium presbyopia correcting lenses.
 Government regulation
Our products and operations are subject to extensive and ongoing regulation by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, (the “FDCA”) and its implementing regulations, as well as other federal, state and local regulatory authorities in the United States, as well as foreign regulatory authorities. The FDA regulates, among other things, product design and development, pre-clinical and clinical testing, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, storage, record keeping and reporting, clearance or approval, marketing, distribution, promotion, import and export, and post-marketing surveillance in the United States to assure the safety and effectiveness of medical products for their intended use.
FDA regulation of medical devices
Unless an exemption applies, each new or significantly modified medical device we seek to commercially distribute in the United States will require either a premarket notification to the FDA requesting permission for commercial distribution under Section 510(k) of the FDCA, also referred to as a 510(k) clearance, or approval from the FDA of a PMA application. Both the 510(k) clearance and PMA processes can be resource intensive, expensive, and lengthy, and require payment of significant user fees, unless an exemption is available.
FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes – Class I, Class II or Class III – depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to provide reasonable assurances with respect to safety and effectiveness.
Class I devices are those for which safety and effectiveness can be reasonably assured by adherence to the FDA’s general controls for medical devices, which include compliance with the applicable portions of FDA’s current good manufacturing practices for devices, as reflected in of the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, establishment registration and device listing, reporting of adverse events and malfunctions, and appropriate, truthful and non-misleading labeling and promotional materials. Some Class I devices, also called Class I reserved devices, also require premarket clearance by the FDA through the 510(k) premarket notification process described below. Most Class I products are exempt from the premarket notification requirements.
Class II devices are those that are subject to the FDA’s general controls and any other special controls deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. These special controls can include performance standards, patient registries, product-specific FDA guidance documents, special labeling requirements and post-market surveillance. Most Class II devices are subject to premarket review and clearance by the FDA through the 510(k) premarket notification process.
Class III devices include devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk such as life-supporting or life-sustaining devices, or implantable devices, in addition to those deemed novel and not substantially equivalent following the 510(k) process. Due to the level of risk associated with Class III devices, the FDA’s general controls and special controls alone are insufficient to assure their safety and effectiveness. Devices placed in Class III generally require the submission of a PMA application, demonstrating the safety and effectiveness of the device which must be approved by the FDA prior to marketing, or the receipt of a 510(k) de novo classification, which provides for the reclassification of the device into Class I or II. The

PMA approval process is generally more costly and time consuming than the 510(k) process. Through the PMA application process, the applicant must submit data and information demonstrating reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use to the FDA’s satisfaction. Accordingly, a PMA application typically includes, but is not limited to, extensive technical information regarding device design and development, pre-clinical and clinical trial data, manufacturing information, labeling and financial disclosure information for the clinical investigators in device studies. The PMA application must provide valid scientific evidence that demonstrates to the FDA’s satisfaction a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use.
If a new medical device does not qualify for the 510(k) premarket notification process because no predicate device to which it is substantially equivalent can be identified, the device is automatically classified into Class III. The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 established a new route to market for low to moderate risk medical devices that are automatically placed into Class III due to the absence of a predicate device, called the “Request for Evaluation of Automatic Class III Designation,” or the de novo classification process. This process allows a manufacturer whose novel device is automatically classified into Class III to request down-classification of its medical device into Class I or Class II on the basis that the device presents low or moderate risk, rather than requiring the submission and approval of a PMA. If the manufacturer seeks reclassification into Class II, the manufacturer must include a draft proposal for special controls that are necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the medical device. The FDA may reject the reclassification petition if it identifies a legally marketed predicate device that would be appropriate for a 510(k) or determines that the device is not low to moderate risk and requires PMA or that general controls would be inadequate to control the risks and special controls cannot be developed.
Obtaining FDA marketing authorization, de novo down-classification, or approval for medical devices is expensive and uncertain, and may take several years, and generally requires significant scientific and clinical data.
Investigational device process
In the United States, absent certain limited exceptions, human clinical trials intended to support medical device clearance or approval require an IDE application. Some types of studies deemed to present “non-significant risk” are deemed to have an approved IDE once certain requirements are addressed, and IRB approval is obtained. If the device presents a “significant risk” to human health, as defined by the FDA, the sponsor must submit an IDE application to the FDA and obtain IDE approval prior to commencing the human clinical trials. The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE application must be approved in advance by the FDA for a specified number of subjects. Generally, clinical trials for a significant risk device may begin once the IDE application is approved by the FDA and the study protocol and informed consent are approved by appropriate institutional review boards at the clinical trial sites. There can be no assurance that submission of an IDE will result in the ability to commence clinical trials, and although the FDA’s approval of an IDE allows clinical testing to go forward for a specified number of subjects, it does not bind the FDA to accept the results of the trial as sufficient to prove the product’s safety and effectiveness, even if the trial meets its intended success criteria.
 All clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s IDE regulations that govern investigational device labeling, prohibit promotion and specify an array of recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators. Clinical trials must further comply with the FDA’s good clinical practice regulations for institutional review board approval and for informed consent and other human subject protections. Required records and reports are subject to inspection by the FDA.
 The results of clinical testing may be unfavorable, or, even if the intended safety and effectiveness success criteria are achieved, may not be considered sufficient for the FDA to grant marketing approval or clearance of a product. The commencement or completion of any clinical trial may be delayed or halted, or be inadequate to support approval of a PMA application, for numerous reasons, including, but not limited to, the following:
 •The FDA or other regulatory authorities do not approve a clinical trial protocol or a clinical trial, or place a clinical trial on hold;
 •Patients do not enroll in clinical trials at the rate expected;
 •Patients do not comply with trial protocols;
 •Patient follow-up is not at the rate expected; 


•Patients experience adverse events; 
 •Patients die during a clinical trial, even though their death may not be related to the products that are part of the trial; 
 •Device malfunctions occur with unexpected frequency or potential adverse consequences;
 •Side effects or device malfunctions of similar products already in the market that change the FDA’s view toward approval of new or similar PMAs or result in the imposition of new requirements or testing; 
 •Institutional review boards and third-party clinical investigators may delay or reject the trial protocol;
 •Third-party clinical investigators decline to participate in a trial or do not perform a trial on the anticipated schedule or consistent with the clinical trial protocol, investigator agreement, investigational plan, good clinical practices, the IDE regulations, or other FDA or IRB requirements;
 •Third-party investigators are disqualified by the FDA;
 •We or third-party organizations do not perform data collection, monitoring and analysis in a timely or accurate manner or consistent with the clinical trial protocol or investigational or statistical plans, or otherwise fail to comply with the IDE regulations governing responsibilities, records, and reports of sponsors of clinical investigations;
 •Third-party clinical investigators have significant financial interests related to us or our study such that the FDA deems the study results unreliable, or we or investigators fail to disclose such interests;
 •Regulatory inspections of our clinical trials or manufacturing facilities, which may, among other things, require us to undertake corrective action or suspend or terminate our clinical trials; 
 •Changes in government regulations or administrative actions;
 •The interim or final results of the clinical trial are inconclusive or unfavorable as to safety or effectiveness; or
 •The FDA concludes that our trial design is unreliable or inadequate to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
 The 510(k) clearance process
Under the 510(k) process, the manufacturer must submit to the FDA a premarket notification, demonstrating that the device is “substantially equivalent,” as defined in the statute, to a legally marketed predicate device.
A predicate device is a legally marketed device that is not subject to premarket approval, i.e., a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976 (pre-amendments device) and for which a PMA is not required, a device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or Class I, or a device that was previously found substantially equivalent through the 510(k) process. A device is considered to be substantially equivalent if, with respect to the predicate device, it has the same intended use, and has either (i) the same technological characteristics; or (ii) different technological characteristics, but the information provided in the 510(k) submission demonstrates that the device does not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness than the predicate device. Clinical data is sometimes, but not always, required to support substantial equivalence.
Before the FDA will accept a 510(k) premarket notification for substantive review, the FDA will first assess whether the submission satisfies a minimum threshold of acceptability. If the FDA determines that the 510(k) submission lacks necessary information for substantive review, the FDA will issue a “Refuse to Accept” letter which generally outlines the information the FDA believes is necessary to permit a substantive review and to reach a determination regarding substantial equivalence. An applicant must submit the requested information before the FDA will proceed with additional review of the submission. If a 510(k) submission is accepted for substantive review, the Medical Device User Fee Amendments sets a performance goal of 90 days for FDA review of a 510(k) submission, but the review time can be delayed if FDA raises questions or requests additional information during the review process. As a practical matter, clearance often takes longer, and clearance is never assured. Thus, as a practical matter, clearance often takes longer than 90 days. Although many 510(k) premarket notifications are cleared without clinical data, the FDA may require further information, including clinical data, to make a determination

regarding substantial equivalence, which may significantly prolong the review process. If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent, it will grant clearance to commercially market the device.
If the FDA determines that the device is not “substantially equivalent” to a predicate device, or if the device is automatically classified into Class III, the device sponsor must then fulfill the much more rigorous premarketing requirements of the PMA approval process, or seek reclassification of the device through the de novo process. A manufacturer can also submit a petition for direct de novo review if the manufacturer is unable to identify an appropriate predicate device and the new device or new use of the device presents a moderate or low risk.
Medical devices can only be marketed for the indications for which they are cleared or approved. After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a new or major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or, depending on the modification, could require a PMA application or de novo classification. The determination as to whether or not a modification constitutes such a change is initially left to the manufacturer using available FDA guidance; however, the FDA may review this determination to evaluate the regulatory status of the modified product at any time and may require the manufacturer to cease marketing and recall the modified device until new 510(k) clearance or PMA approval is obtained. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination regarding whether a new premarket submission is required for the modification of an existing device, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or approval of a PMA application is obtained. The manufacturer may also be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.
The PMA approval process
Following receipt of a PMA application, the FDA conducts an administrative review to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. If it is not, the agency will refuse to file the PMA. If it is, the FDA will accept the application for filing and begin the substantive review. The FDA, by statute and by regulation, has 180 days to review a filed PMA application, although the review of an application more often occurs over a significantly longer period of time. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided, and the FDA may issue a major deficiency letter to the applicant, requesting the applicant’s response to deficiencies communicated by the FDA. The FDA considers a PMA or PMA supplement to have been voluntarily withdrawn if an applicant fails to respond to an FDA request for information (e.g., major deficiency letter) within a total of 360 days. Before approving or denying a PMA, an FDA advisory committee may review the PMA at a public meeting and provide the FDA with the committee’s recommendation on whether the FDA should approve the submission, approve it with specific conditions, or not approve it. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Prior to approval of a PMA, the FDA may conduct inspections of the clinical trial data and clinical trial sites, as well as inspections of the manufacturing facility and processes. Overall, the FDA review of a PMA application generally takes between one and three years but may take significantly longer. The FDA can delay, limit or deny approval of a PMA application for many reasons, including:
•The device may not be shown safe or effective to the FDA’s satisfaction;
 •The data from pre-clinical studies and/or clinical trials may be found unreliable or insufficient to support approval; 
 •The manufacturing process or facilities may not meet applicable requirements; and 
 •Changes in FDA approval policies or adoption of new regulations may require additional data. 
 If the FDA evaluation of a PMA is favorable, the FDA will issue either an approval letter, or an approvable letter, the latter of which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the PMA. When and if those conditions have been fulfilled to the satisfaction of the FDA, the agency will issue a PMA approval letter authorizing commercial marketing of the device, subject to the conditions of approval and the limitations established in the approval letter. If the FDA’s evaluation of a PMA application or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. The FDA also may determine that additional tests or clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and data is submitted in an amendment to the PMA, or the PMA is withdrawn and resubmitted when the data are available. The PMA process can be expensive, uncertain and lengthy and a number of devices for which the FDA approval has been sought by other companies have never been approved by the FDA for marketing.

New PMA applications or PMA supplements are required for modification to the manufacturing process, equipment or facility, quality control procedures, sterilization, packaging, expiration date, labeling, device specifications, ingredients, materials or design of a device that has been approved through the PMA process. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as an initial PMA application, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the approved PMA application and may or may not require as extensive technical or clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel, depending on the nature of the proposed change.
In approving a PMA application, as a condition of approval, the FDA may also require some form of post-approval study or post-market surveillance, whereby the applicant conducts a follow-up study or follows certain patient groups for a number of years and makes periodic reports to the FDA on the clinical status of those patients when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional or longer term safety and effectiveness data for the device. The FDA may also require post-market surveillance for certain devices cleared under a 510(k) notification, such as implants or life-supporting or life-sustaining devices used outside a device user facility. The FDA may also approve a PMA application with other post-approval conditions intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, such as, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale, distribution and use. Significant modifications to the manufacturing process, labeling and design for a device which has received approval through the PMA process may require submission of a new PMA application or PMA supplement prior to marketing.
Ongoing regulation by the FDA
Even after the FDA permits a device to be marketed, numerous regulatory requirements apply, including but not limited to:
•establishment registration and device listing; 
 •the QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, production, control, supplier/contractor selection, complaint handling, documentation, and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process; 
 •labeling regulations, advertising and promotion requirements, restrictions on sale distribution or use of a device, each including the FDA general prohibition against the promotion of products for any uses other than those authorized by the FDA, which are commonly known as “off label” uses;
 •the Medical Device Reporting (“MDR”) regulation, which requires that manufactures report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or if their device malfunctioned and the device or a similar device marketed by the manufacturer would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur; 
 •medical device corrections and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufactures report to the FDA field corrections or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by a device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA Act that may present a risk to health; 
 •recall requirements, including a mandatory recall if there is a reasonable probability that the device would cause serious adverse health consequences or death; 
 •an order of repair, replacement or refund; 
 •device tracking requirements; and 
 •post market study and surveillance requirements. 
 After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) or possibly a PMA. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially, but the FDA can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If the FDA disagrees with our determination not to seek a new 510(k) clearance, the FDA may retroactively require us to seek 510(k) clearance or possibly a PMA. The FDA could also require us to cease marketing and distribution and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or a PMA is obtained. Also, in these circumstances, we may be subject to significant regulatory fines and penalties.

Some changes to an approved PMA device, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new PMA application or PMA supplement, as appropriate, before the change can be implemented. Supplements to a PMA often require the submission of the same type of information required for an original PMA application, except that the supplement is generally limited to that information needed to support the proposed change from the device covered by the original PMA. The FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing PMA supplements as it does in reviewing original PMA applications.
FDA regulations require us to register as a medical device manufacturer with the FDA. Additionally, some states also require medical device manufacturers and/or distributors doing business within the state to register with the state or apply for a state license, which could subject our facility to state inspection as well as FDA inspection on a routine basis for compliance with the QSR and any applicable state requirements. These regulations require that we manufacture our products and maintain related documentation in a prescribed manner with respect to manufacturing, testing and control activities. Further, the FDA requires us to comply with various FDA regulations regarding labeling. Failure by us or by our suppliers to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA or state authorities, which may include any of the following sanctions:
•warning or untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties; 
 •customer notifications, voluntary or mandatory recall or seizure of our products; 
 •operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production; 
 •delay in processing, clearing or approving submissions or applications for new products or modifications to existing products; 
 •FDA refusal to issue certificates to foreign governments needed to export products for sale in other countries; 
 •suspension or withdrawal of FDA approvals or clearances that have already been granted; and 
 •criminal prosecution. 
 Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory clearance or approval of our products under development.
Our facilities, records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic unscheduled inspections by the FDA. Failure to comply with the applicable United States medical device regulatory requirements could result in, among other things, warning letters, untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees, civil penalties, unanticipated expenditures, repairs, replacements, refunds, recalls or seizures of products, operating restrictions, total or partial suspension of production, the FDA’s refusal to issue certificates to foreign governments needed to export products for sale in other countries, the FDA’s refusal to grant future premarket clearances or approvals, withdrawals or suspensions of current product clearances or approvals and criminal prosecution.
When the FDA conducts an inspection, the inspectors will identify any deficiencies they believe exist in the form of a notice of inspectional observations, or Form FDA 483. If we receive a notice of inspectional observations or deficiencies from the FDA following an inspection, we would be required to respond in writing, and would be required to undertake corrective and/or preventive or other actions in order to address the FDA’s or other regulators’ concerns. Failure to address the FDA’s concerns may result in the issuance of a warning letter or other enforcement or administrative actions.
International medical device premarket authorization process
The European Union has adopted numerous directives and standards regulating the design, manufacture, clinical trials, labeling and adverse event reporting for medical devices. Our products are regulated in the European Union as medical devices per European Union Directive 93/42/EEC, also known as the Medical Device Directive (“MDD”). The MDD sets out the basic regulatory framework for medical devices in the European Union. The system of regulating medical devices operates by way of a certification for each medical device. Each certified device is marked with the CE mark which shows that the device has a Certificat de Conformité. There are national bodies known as Competent Authorities in each member state which oversee the implementation of the MDD within their jurisdiction. The means for achieving the requirements for

the CE mark vary according to the nature of the device. Devices are classified in accordance with their perceived risks, similarly to the U.S. system. The class of a product determines the conformity assessment required before the CE mark can be placed on a product. Conformity assessments for our products are carried out as required by the MDD. Each member state can appoint Notified Bodies within its jurisdiction. If a Notified Body of a one-member state has issued a Certificat de Conformité, the device can be sold throughout the European Union without further conformance tests being required in other member states. The CE mark is contingent upon continued compliance with the applicable regulations and the quality system requirements of the ISO 13485 standard.
The new European Union Medical Devices Regulation 2017/745, or EU MDR, which was published in May 2017 with a transition period of three years, replaces the MDD and will expand and modify the pre-market and post-market obligations of the MDD. The date of application of the EU MDR has been postponed to May 26, 2024 with implementation dates based off of risk classification of the medical device. Recently, the European Commission proposed legislative amendments, including amendments to extend the transition period to the new rules from May 26, 2024 to December 31, 2027 for higher risk devices and until December 31, 2028 for medium and lower risk devices. The EU MDR will impose additional requirements on clinical evaluation process, safety, classification and performance of medical device products. The EU MDR will have no impact on our current and future products as registrations to the EU MDR are in process and are scheduled for completion prior to the implementation dates. The company has passed the MDR upgrade assessment with no observations and a recommendation for certification by the European Notified Body in December 2021. In addition to inspections by the FDA and other regulatory entities, we are also subject to periodic inspections by applicable European Notified Body with respect to regulatory requirements that apply to medical devices designed and manufactured by us and clinical trials sponsored by us. We are also certified to the Medical Device Single Audit Program (“MDSAP”) for the jurisdictions of the United States, Canada, Japan, Brazil, and Australia which allows for one single audit performed by Notified Body to cover those jurisdictions with respect to quality systems. All registrations and certifications due to Great Britain leaving the European Union (Brexit) and Switzerland ending a joint agreement with the European Union (Swexit) have been done to the timelines as required for these countries and will continue to be performed to the updated timelines as published during these processes.
 Other U.S. regulatory matters
Medical device companies are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business. Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities following product clearance or approval are subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in the United States in addition to the FDA, including the CMS, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Justice, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, and state and local governments. For example, in the United States, sales, marketing and scientific and educational programs also must comply with state and federal fraud and abuse, anti-kickback false claims, transparency, government price reporting, anti-corruption, and health information privacy and security laws and regulations. Internationally, other governments also impose regulations in connection with their healthcare reimbursement programs and the delivery of healthcare items and services. These laws include the following:
•U.S. federal healthcare fraud and abuse laws generally apply to our activities because our products are covered under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. The Anti-Kickback Statute is particularly relevant because of its broad applicability. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription medical device manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf), to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce or reward referrals, including the purchase, recommendation, order or prescription of a particular medical device, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Almost any financial arrangement with a healthcare provider, patient or customer could implicate the Anti-Kickback Statute. Statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protect certain arrangements if specific requirements are met. The government can exercise enforcement discretion in taking action against arrangements that do not fit within a safe harbor. Further, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. Moreover, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act. Penalties for violations of the Anti- Kickback Statute include, but are not limited to, criminal, civil and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid 


and other federal healthcare programs. Our exclusion would mean that procedures using our products would no longer be eligible for reimbursement under federal healthcare programs;
•Another development affecting the healthcare industry is the increased use of the federal Civil False Claims Act and, in particular, actions brought pursuant to the False Claims Act’s “whistleblower” or “qui tam” provisions. In recent years, the number of suits brought against healthcare companies by private individuals has increased dramatically. The federal civil and criminal false claims acts, including the civil FCA, prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. No specific intent to defraud is required under the civil FCA. The criminal FCA provides for criminal penalties for submitting false claims, including imprisonment and criminal fines; 
 •The Civil Monetary Penalty Act of 1981 and implementing regulations impose penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal healthcare program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent, or offering or transferring remuneration to a federal healthcare beneficiary that a person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s decision to order or receive items or services reimbursable by the government from a particular provider or supplier; 
 •Federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), prohibits, among other things, executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and their implementing regulations, also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; 
 •Federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers; 
 •The FDCA, which prohibits, among other things, the adulteration or misbranding of medical devices; 
 •Additionally, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to doctors. The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires applicable manufacturers of covered drugs, medical devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to annually report to CMS information regarding payments and other transfers of value to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain non-physician healthcare professionals (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners, among others) and teaching hospitals, as well as information regarding ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members;
 •The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring us to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, if any, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations; 
 •Analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback, anti-referral, and false claims laws, which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers; state laws that require certain biotechnology, pharmaceutical, and medical device companies to comply with the industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government and may require applicable manufacturers to disclose or report certain information related to payments and other transfers of value to doctors and entities or sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials, marketing expenditures and activities, and state and foreign laws that govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus 


complicating compliance efforts; and state laws related to insurance fraud in the case of claims involving private insurers.
Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory and regulatory exemptions or safe harbors, it is possible that some of our activities, such as stock-option compensation paid to doctors that have entered into consulting agreements with us, could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. The growth of our business and sales organization and our expansion outside of the United States may increase the potential of violating these laws or our internal policies and procedures. The risk of our being found in violation of these or other laws and regulations is further increased by the fact that many have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to various interpretations. Any action brought against us for violations of these laws or regulations, even successfully defended, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business. Also, we may be subject to private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers on behalf of the federal or state governments. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal, state and foreign laws described above or any other current or future fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, including damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, injunctions, requests for recall, seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals or refusal to allow a firm to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts, and we could be required to curtail or cease our operations. Any of the foregoing consequences could seriously harm our business and our financial results.
United States health care reform
Changes in healthcare policy could increase our costs and subject us to additional regulatory requirements that may interrupt commercialization of our current and future solutions. Current and future legislative proposals to further reform healthcare or reduce healthcare costs may limit coverage for the procedures associated with the use of our products or result in lower reimbursement for those procedures. The cost containment measures that payers and providers are instituting and the effect of any healthcare reform initiative implemented in the future could significantly reduce our revenues from the sale of our products. Changes in healthcare policy, including changes in the implementation or the repeal of the ACA in the United States, could increase our costs, decrease our revenue and impact sales of and reimbursement and coverage for our current and future products. Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. In particular, on December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Act. Additionally, on December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld the District Court ruling that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. On March 2, 2020, the United States Supreme Court granted the petitions for writs of certiorari to review this case and held oral arguments in November 2020. In June 2021, the United States Supreme Court held that Texas and other challengers had no legal standing to challenge the ACA, dismissing the case on procedural grounds without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Thus, the ACA will remain in effect in its current form. It is unclear how this Supreme Court decision, future litigation, and healthcare measures of the Biden administration will impact the ACA and our business. Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted, including aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year and reduced payments to several types of Medicare providers, which will remain in effect through 2031 absent additional congressional action, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, unless additional action is taken by Congress. Under current legislation, the actual reduction in Medicare payments can vary from 1% in 2022 to up to 4% in the final fiscal year of this sequester. Moreover, there recently has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted legislation designed, among other things, to bring more transparency to product pricing. Complying with any new legislation or reversing changes implemented under the ACA could be time-intensive and expensive, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business.
The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality or expanding access. Current and future legislative proposals to further reform healthcare or reduce healthcare costs may limit coverage of or lower reimbursement for the

procedures associated with the use of our products. The cost containment measures that payors and providers are instituting and the effect of any healthcare reform initiative implemented in the future could impact our revenue from the sale of our products.
We believe that there will continue to be proposals by legislators at both the federal and state levels, regulators and third-party payors to reduce costs while expanding individual healthcare benefits. Certain of these changes could impose additional limitations on the rates we will be able to charge for our current and future products or the amounts of reimbursement available for our current and future products from governmental agencies or third-party payors. Current and future healthcare reform legislation and policies could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
Data privacy and security
Medical device companies may be subject to U.S. federal and state health information privacy, security and data breach notification laws, which may govern the collection, use, disclosure and protection of health-related and other personal information.
HIPAA imposes privacy, security and breach reporting obligations with respect to individually identifiable health information upon “covered entities” (health plans, health care clearinghouses and certain health care providers), and their respective business associates, individuals or entities that create, received, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HIPAA mandates the reporting of certain breaches of health information to the United States Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) affected individuals and if the breach is large enough, the media. Entities that are found to be in violation of HIPAA as the result of a breach of unsecured protected health information, or PHI, a complaint about privacy practices or an audit by HHS, may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative fines and penalties and/or additional reporting and oversight obligations if required to enter into a resolution agreement and corrective action plan with HHS to settle allegations of HIPAA non-compliance.
Even when HIPAA does not apply, failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers’ personal information secure may constitute unfair acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C § 45(a). The FTC expects a company’s data security measures to be reasonable and appropriate in light of the sensitivity and volume of consumer information it holds, the size and complexity of its business, and the cost of available tools to improve security and reduce vulnerabilities. Personally identifiable health information is considered sensitive data that merits stronger safeguards. The FTC’s guidance for appropriately securing consumers’ personal information is similar to what is required by the HIPAA Security Rule.
In addition, certain state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Actual or perceived failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in private claims, demands and litigation, regulatory investigations and other proceedings, and the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties and other relief. For example, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act, (“CCPA”), which went into effect January 1, 2020. The CCPA, among other things, created new data privacy obligations for covered companies and provided new privacy rights to California residents, including the right to opt out of certain disclosures of their information. The CCPA also created a private right of action with statutory damages for certain data breaches, thereby potentially increasing risks associated with a data breach.
 Additionally, in November 2020, California voters passed the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (“CPRA”). The CPRA, which became effective January 1, 2023 created additional obligations with respect to certain data relating to consumers, significantly expands the CCPA, including by introducing additional obligations such as data minimization and storage limitations, granting additional rights to consumers, such as correction of personal information and additional opt-out rights, and creates a new entity, the California Privacy Protection Agency, to implement and enforce the law. The CCPA and CPRA may increase our compliance costs and potential liability. In addition to the CCPA, numerous other states’ legislatures have passed or are considering similar laws that will require ongoing compliance efforts and investment.
The EU also has laws and regulations dealing with the collection, use and processing of personal data obtained from individuals in the EU, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR. These laws and regulations are often more restrictive than those in the United States and restrict transfers of personal data to the United States unless certain requirements are met. The GDPR provides that EU member states may make their own further laws and regulations limiting the processing of genetic, biometric or health data, which could limit our ability to use and share personal data or could cause our costs to increase, and harm our business and financial condition. Further, the United Kingdom’s exit from the EU has

created uncertainty with regard to data protection regulation in the United Kingdom. We are subject to the UK General Data Protection Regulation and UK Data Protection Act of 2018, which retains the GDPR in the United Kingdom’s national law and provides for a penalty structure similar to the GDPR. Because the interpretation and application of laws, regulations, standards and other obligations relating to data privacy and security are still uncertain, it is possible that these laws, regulations, standards and other obligations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data processing practices and policies. If our practices are not consistent, or are viewed as not consistent, with changes in laws, regulations and standards or new interpretations or applications of existing laws, regulations and standards, we may also become subject to fines, audits, inquiries, whistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage, investigations, lawsuits, loss of export privileges, severe criminal or civil sanction or other penalties.
 Employees and human capital
As of December 31, 2022, we had 292 full-time employees. All of our employees are full-time and none of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered under a collective bargaining agreement.
Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees, advisors and consultants. The principal purposes of our equity and cash incentive plans are to attract, retain and reward personnel through the granting of stock-based and cash-based compensation awards, in order to increase stockholder value and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives.
Facilities
Our corporate headquarters is in Aliso Viejo, California where we lease four facilities housing our headquarters, manufacturing, research and development and administrative offices. The facility leases are for approximately 121,000 square feet in the aggregate. The leases terminate on (a) September 30, 2024, with one option to extend for five years; (b) January 31, 2026, with three options to extend for five years each; (c) March 31, 2023, with two options to extend for five years each; and (d) August 31, 2024, with one option to extend for five years. We believe that our existing facilities are adequate for our near-term needs but expect to need additional space as we grow. We believe that suitable additional or alternative space would be available in the future as required on commercially reasonable terms.
Legal proceedings
From time to time, we may become involved in litigation or other legal proceedings. We are not currently a party to any litigation or legal proceedings that, in the opinion of our management, are likely to have a material adverse effect on our business. Regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors.
