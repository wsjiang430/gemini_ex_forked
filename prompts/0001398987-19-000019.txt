Item 1.    Business. 
Our Company 
We are the leading and most integrated provider of residential real estate services in the U.S. We are the world's largest franchisor of residential real estate brokerages with some of the most recognized brands in the real estate industry, the leading U.S. residential real estate brokerage (based upon transaction volume), the leading provider of global relocation services and a significant provider of title and settlement services.
The core of our integrated business strategy is to grow the base of productive independent sales agents at our company owned and franchisee brokerages and provide them with compelling data and technology products and services to make them more productive and their businesses more profitable.
Our revenue is derived on a fee-for-service basis, and given our breadth of complementary service offerings, we are able to generate fees from multiple aspects of a residential real estate transaction. Our operating platform is supported by our portfolio of industry leading franchise brokerage brands, including Century 21®, Coldwell Banker®, Coldwell Banker Commercial®, ERA®, Sotheby's International Realty® and Better Homes and Gardens® Real Estate. In addition, in January 2019, we launched franchise sales of the Corcoran® brand.
We also own and operate company owned brokerages under the Coldwell Banker®, Coldwell Banker Commercial®, Corcoran®, Citi HabitatsSM, Climb Real Estate®, Sotheby's International Realty® and ZipRealty® brands.
Our multiple brands and operations allow us to derive revenue from many different segments of the residential real estate market, in many different geographies and at varying price points.
Segment Overview 
We report our operations in four segments, each of which receives fees based upon services performed for our customers: Real Estate Franchise Services ("RFG"), Company Owned Real Estate Brokerage Services ("NRT"), Relocation Services ("Cartus®") and Title and Settlement Services ("TRG").
Real Estate Franchise Services. We are the largest franchisor of residential real estate brokerages in the world through our portfolio of well-known brokerage brands, including Century 21®, Coldwell Banker®, Coldwell Banker Commercial®, ERA®, Sotheby's International Realty® and Better Homes and Gardens® Real Estate. In January 2019, to expand and enhance our existing portfolio of brands, we launched Corcoran® as a new franchise brand, which has historically been operated solely as part of our company owned brokerage segment.

As of December 31, 2018, our real estate franchise systems and proprietary brands had approximately 299,400 independent sales agents worldwide, including approximately 191,700 independent sales agents operating in the U.S. (which included approximately 50,200 company owned brokerage independent sales agents). As of December 31, 2018, our real estate franchise systems and proprietary brands had approximately 16,600 offices worldwide in 113 countries and territories, including approximately 6,000 brokerage offices in the U.S. (which included approximately 760 company owned brokerage offices).
The average tenure among U.S. franchisees is approximately 22 years as of December 31, 2018. Our franchisees pay us fees for the right to operate under one of our trademarks and to enjoy the benefits of the systems and business enhancing tools provided by our real estate franchise operations. In addition to highly competitive brands that provide unique offerings to our franchisees, we support our franchisees with dedicated national marketing and servicing programs, technology including the Zap® technology platform, training, education, learning and development to facilitate our franchisees in growing their business and increasing their revenue and profitability. We believe that one of our strengths is the strong relationships that we have with our franchisees, as evidenced by our 98% retention rate as of December 31, 2018. Our retention rate represents the annual franchisee gross commission income for the year ended December 31, 2017 generated by our franchisees that remain in our franchise systems as of December 31, 2018, measured against the annual gross commission income of all franchisees for the year ended December 31, 2017.
Company Owned Real Estate Brokerage Services. We own and operate the leading residential real estate brokerage business (based upon transaction volume) in the U.S. under the Coldwell Banker®, Corcoran®, Sotheby's International Realty®, ZipRealty®, Citi HabitatsSM and Climb Real Estate® brand names. We offer full-service residential brokerage services in many of the largest metropolitan areas of the U.S. NRT, as the broker for a home buyer or seller, derives revenues primarily from gross commission income received at the closing of real estate transactions. NRT also has relationships with developers, primarily in major cities, to provide marketing and brokerage services in new developments. To complement its residential brokerage services, NRT offers home ownership services that include comprehensive single-family residential property management in many of the nation's largest rental markets. This segment also included the Company's share of equity earnings or losses related to our former 49.9% ownership of PHH Home Loans LLC ("PHH Home Loans"), our former home mortgage joint venture with PHH Mortgage Corporation ("PHH"), which was sold to PHH in the first quarter of 2018. The Company's share of equity earnings or losses related to our 49.9% ownership of Guaranteed Rate Affinity, LLC ("Guaranteed Rate Affinity"), our current mortgage origination joint venture, which began doing business in August 2017 on a phased-in basis, is included in the financial results of the Title and Settlement Services segment.
Relocation Services. We are the leading provider of global relocation services and operate in key international relocation destinations. We offer a broad range of world-class employee relocation services designed to manage all aspects of an employee's move to facilitate a smooth transition in what otherwise may be a complex and difficult process for the 
5

employee and employer. Our relocation services business serves corporations, including 56% of the Fortune 50 companies. We also service affinity organizations such as insurance companies and credit unions that provide our services to their members. In 2018, we assisted in over 171,000 corporate and affinity relocations in 150 countries for approximately 660 active clients. As of December 31, 2018, our top 25 relocation clients had an average tenure of approximately 20 years with us. Member brokers of the Cartus Broker Network, including certain franchisees and NRT, receive referrals from the relocation services, affinity services and from each other in exchange for a referral fee.
Title and Settlement Services. We assist with the closing of real estate transactions by providing full-service title and settlement (i.e., closing and escrow) services to customers, real estate companies, affinity groups, corporations and financial institutions with many of these services provided in connection with the Company's real estate brokerage and relocation services businesses. In 2018, TRG was involved in the closing of approximately 176,000 transactions of which approximately 53,000 related to NRT. In addition to our own title and settlement services, we also coordinate a nationwide network of attorneys, title agents and notaries to service financial institution and relocation clients on a national basis. We also serve as an underwriter of title insurance policies in connection with residential and commercial real estate transactions. This segment also includes the Company's share of equity earnings and losses for our Guaranteed Rate Affinity mortgage origination joint venture.
Housing Market and Market Share
U.S. Gross Commission Income. Residential real estate brokerage companies typically realize revenues in the form of a sales commission earned from closed homesale sides (either the "buy" side and/or the "sell" side of a real estate transaction), which we refer to as gross commission income. We believe that the level of gross commission income generated in the U.S. represents a substantial addressable market. We estimate that more than $70 billion in gross commission income was generated by U.S. residential existing homesale transactions involving a broker in 2018. Our company owned brokerages and franchisees earned approximately $13 billion in gross commission income in the same period.
Market Share. As measured in a comparison to the volume of all existing homesale transactions in the U.S. as reported by NAR (regardless of whether an agent or broker was involved in the transaction), we estimate that our market share in 2018 increased modestly year-over-year to approximately 16.1% compared to 15.9% in 2017. Our estimated share of all U.S. existing homesale unit transactions in 2018 remained at approximately 13.5%.
Basis of Calculation
U.S. Gross Commission Income Calculation. We estimate U.S. gross commission income by multiplying NAR’s published existing homesale transaction units, reduced to approximately 89% (to reflect 87% of the total homes that were bought using an agent or broker and 91% of the total homes that were sold using an agent or broker in 2018 according to NAR), by (a) NAR's published average sales price and (b) the average annual broker commission rate in 2017 as published by Real Trends, a provider of residential brokerage industry analysis, of 5.08%.
Market Share Calculation. We measure our market share transaction volume by the ratio of (a) homesale transaction volume (sides times average price) in which we and our franchisees participate to (b) NAR's existing homesale transaction volume (regardless of whether an agent or broker was involved in the transaction)—calculated by doubling the number of existing homesale transactions reported by NAR to account for both the buy and sell sides of a transaction multiplied by NAR's average sales price. Homesale unit transaction market share is calculated similarly but without including average sales price in either the numerator or denominator.

Industry Trends 
Industry definition.  We primarily operate in the U.S. residential real estate industry, which is approximately a $1.8 trillion industry based on 2018 transaction volume (i.e. average homesale price times number of new and existing homesale transactions) and derive substantially all of our revenues from serving the needs of buyers and sellers of existing homes rather than new homes manufactured and sold by homebuilders. Residential real estate brokerage companies typically realize revenues in the form of a commission that is based on a percentage of the price of each home sold. As a result, the real estate industry generally benefits from rising home prices and increasing homesale transactions (and conversely is adversely impacted by falling prices and lower homesale transactions). We believe that existing homesale transactions and the services associated with these transactions, such as mortgage origination, title services and relocation services, represent one of the most attractive segments of the residential real estate industry for the following reasons:

• | the existing homesales segment represents a significantly larger addressable market than new homesales. Of the approximately 6.0 million homesales in the U.S. in 2018, NAR estimates that approximately 5.3 million were existing homesales, representing approximately 89% of the overall sales as measured in units; 


• | existing homesales afford us the opportunity to represent either the buyer or the seller and in some cases both the buyer and the seller; and


• | we are able to generate revenues from ancillary services provided to our customers.

While substantially all homebuyers start their search for a home using the Internet, according to NAR, 87% of home buyers and 91% of home sellers used an agent or broker in 2018. We believe that agents or brokers will continue to be directly involved in most home purchases and sales, primarily because real estate transactions have certain characteristics that benefit from the service and value offered by an agent or broker, including the following:

• | the average homesale transaction size is very high and generally is the largest transaction one does in a lifetime;


• | homesale transactions occur infrequently;


• | there is a compelling need for personal service as home preferences are unique to each buyer;


• | a high level of support is required given the complexity associated with the process, including specific marketing and technology services; and


• | there is a high variance in price, depending on neighborhood, floor plan, architecture, fixtures, and outdoor space.

Cyclical nature of industry.  The U.S. residential real estate industry is cyclical but has historically shown strong growth over time. Based on information published by NAR, existing homesale units increased at a compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, of 1.9% from 1972 through 2018, with 29 annual increases, versus 17 annual decreases.
7

During that same period, median existing homesale prices increased at a CAGR of 5.1% (not adjusted for inflation) from 1972 through 2018, a period that included four economic recessions.
According to NAR, the existing homesale transaction volume (median homesale price times existing homesale transactions) grew at a CAGR of 7.1% from 1972 through 2018. 
The U.S. residential real estate industry was in a significant and lengthy downturn from the second half of 2005 through 2011. Based upon data published by NAR from 2005 to 2011, the number of annual U.S. existing homesale transactions declined by 40% and the median existing homesale price declined by 24%. Beginning in 2012, the U.S. residential real estate industry began a recovery. Based upon data published by NAR from 2011 to 2018, the number of annual U.S. existing homesale units and the median existing homesale price improved by 25% and 56%, respectively. However, in 2018 homesale transaction volume did not grow from 2017, driven by a 3% year-over-year decline in homesale transactions to 5.3 million homes offset by a 3% increase in the average homesale price.
Long-term demographics.  We believe that long-term demand for housing and the growth of our industry is primarily driven by the affordability of housing, the economic health of the U.S. economy, demographic trends such as generational transitions, increases in U.S. household formation, mortgage rate levels and mortgage availability, certain tax benefits, job growth, increases in renters that qualify as homebuyers, the inherent attributes of homeownership versus renting and the influence of local housing dynamics of supply versus demand. We believe that the residential real estate market will benefit over the long-term from expected positive fundamentals, including expected growth in the number of U.S. households over the next decade, in particular among the millennial generation.

Participation in Multiple Aspects of the Residential Real Estate Market
We participate in services associated with many aspects of the residential real estate market. Our four complementary businesses and mortgage joint venture work together, allowing us to generate revenue at various points in a residential real estate transaction, including the purchase or sale of homes, corporate relocation and affinity services, settlement and title services, and franchising of our brands. The businesses each benefit from our deep understanding of the industry, strong relationships with real estate brokers, sales agents and other real estate professionals and expertise across the transactional process. Unlike other industry participants who offer only one or two services, we can offer homeowners, our franchisees and our corporate and affinity clients ready access to numerous associated services that facilitate and simplify the home purchase and sale process. These services provide further revenue opportunities for our owned businesses and those of our franchisees. Specifically, our brokerage offices and those of our franchisees participate in purchases and sales of homes involving relocations of corporate transferees and affinity members using Cartus® relocation services and we offer customers (purchasers and sellers) of both our owned and franchised brokerage businesses convenient title and settlement services. These services produce incremental revenues for our businesses and franchisees. In addition, we participate in the mortgage process through our 49.9% ownership of Guaranteed Rate Affinity, which began doing business in August 2017 on a phased-in basis. All four of our businesses and our mortgage joint venture can derive revenue from the same real estate transaction.

Real Estate Franchise Services 
Our primary objectives as the largest franchisor of residential real estate brokerages in the world are to retain and expand existing franchises, sell new franchises, and most importantly, provide branding and support to our franchisees. At December 31, 2018, our real estate franchise systems and proprietary brands had approximately 16,600 offices worldwide in 113 countries and territories in North and South America, Europe, Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Australia, including approximately 6,000 brokerage offices in the U.S. (which included approximately 760 company owned brokerage offices).
We derive substantially all of our real estate franchising revenues from royalties and marketing fees received under long-term franchise agreements with our domestic franchisees (typically ten years in duration) and NRT. These royalties are based on a percentage of the franchisees' sales commission earned from closed homesale sides (either the "buy" side and/or the "sell" side of a real estate transaction), which we refer to as gross commission income. Our franchisees pay us royalties, net of volume incentives achieved (other than NRT), for the right to operate under one of our trademarks and to utilize the benefits of the franchise systems. We provide our franchisees with systems and tools that are designed to help our franchisees serve their customers, attract new or retain existing independent sales agents, and support our franchisees with servicing programs, technology and education, as well as branding-related marketing which is funded through contributions by our franchisees and us (including NRT). We operate and maintain an Internet-based reporting system for our domestic franchisees which generally allows them to electronically transmit listing information and other relevant reporting data to us. We also own and operate websites for each of our brands for the benefit of our franchisees and their independent sales agents.
10

RFG's domestic annual net royalty revenues from franchisees other than our company owned brokerages can be represented by multiplying (1) that year's total number of closed homesale sides in which those franchisees participated by (2) the average sale price of those homesales by (3) the average brokerage commission rate charged by these franchisees by (4) RFG's net contractual royalty rate. The net contractual royalty rate represents the average percentage of our franchisees' commission revenues paid to us as a royalty, net of volume incentives achieved (or for some larger franchisees, flat fee royalties) and net of non-standard incentives granted to franchisees. Non-standard incentives may be used as consideration to attract new franchisees, grow franchisees (including through independent sales agent recruitment) or extend existing franchisee agreements, although such incentives are generally not available to most franchisees, in contrast to volume incentives. The domestic royalty revenue from NRT is calculated by multiplying homesale sides by average sale price by average brokerage commission rate by 6% royalty rate. NRT does not receive volume incentives or non-standard incentives. In addition to domestic royalty revenue, RFG earns revenue from marketing fees, listing fees, the preferred alliance program, international affiliates and upfront international fees. The following chart illustrates the key drivers for revenue earned by RFG:
We believe one of our strengths is the strong relationships that we have with our franchisees as evidenced by the retention rate of 98% as of December 31, 2018. Our retention rate represents the annual franchisee gross commission income for the year ended December 31, 2017 generated by our franchisees that remain in our franchise systems as of December 31, 2018, measured against the annual gross commission income of all franchisees for the year ended December 31, 2017. On average, our domestic franchisees' tenure with our brands was approximately 22 years as of December 31, 2018. During 2018, none of our franchisees (other than NRT) generated more than 1% of the total revenue of our real estate franchise business.
The franchise agreements set forth guidelines on the business and operations of the franchisees and require them to comply with the mandatory identity standards set forth in each brand's policy and procedures manuals. A franchisee's failure to comply with these restrictions and standards could result in a termination of the franchise agreement. The franchisees generally are not permitted to terminate the franchise agreements prior to their expiration, and in those cases where termination rights do exist, they are very limited (e.g., if the franchisee retires, becomes disabled or dies). Generally, new domestic franchise agreements have a term of ten years and require the franchisees to pay us an initial franchise fee for the franchisee's principal office plus, upon the receipt of any commission income, a royalty fee in most cases equal to 6% of their commission income. One exception to this flat 6% royalty fee structure is our Better Homes and Gardens® Real Estate franchise business, which launched a "capped fee model" on January 9, 2019 that applies to any new franchisee as well as preexisting franchisees who elect to switch from their current royalty fee structure to the capped fee model. Under this capped fee model, franchisees pay a royalty fee (generally equal to 5% of their commission income) capped at a set amount per independent sales agent per year, subject to our right to annually modify or increase the independent sales associate cap. Our franchise systems offer a volume incentive program, whereby each franchisee is eligible to receive a refund of a portion of the royalties paid upon the satisfaction of certain conditions (or in the case of Corcoran, a reduced royalty based upon volume). The volume incentive is calculated for each eligible franchisee as a progressive percentage of each franchisee's annual gross revenue (paid timely) for each calendar year. Under the current form of the franchise agreements, the volume incentive varies for each franchise system, and will generally result in a net or effective royalty rate of 6% to 3% for each individual franchisee. The volume incentive program is not offered to Better Homes and Gardens® Real Estate capped model franchisees or Coldwell Banker Commercial® franchisees.
We provide a detailed table to each eligible franchisee that describes the gross revenue thresholds required to achieve a volume incentive and the corresponding incentive amounts. We reserve the right to increase or decrease the percentage and/or dollar amounts in the table on an annual basis, subject to certain limitations. Our company owned brokerage offices do not participate in the volume incentive program.
11

Each of our current franchise systems require franchisees and company owned offices to make monthly contributions to marketing funds maintained by each brand, although required contributions for Corcoran® franchisees and franchisees under the capped fee model in effect for certain Better Homes and Gardens® Real Estate franchisees decrease if certain financial thresholds are achieved by the franchisee. These contributions are used primarily for the development, implementation, production, placement and payment of national and regional advertising, marketing, promotions, public relations and/or other marketing-related activities, such as lead generation, all to promote and further the recognition of each brand and its independent franchisees and their affiliated independent sales agents. In addition to the contributions from franchisees and company owned offices, the Real Estate Franchise Services group may be, in certain instances, required to make contributions to certain marketing funds and may make discretionary contributions (at its option) to any of the marketing funds.
The Company also offers support services to its independent franchisees and their affiliated independent sales agents, including technology-enabled solutions such as customer relationship management (CRM), lead generation and productivity tools.
Under certain circumstances, we extend conversion notes to eligible franchisees for the purpose of providing an incentive to join the brand, to renew their franchise agreements, or to facilitate their growth opportunities. Growth opportunities include the expansion of franchisees' existing businesses by opening additional offices, through the consolidation of operations of other franchisees, as well as through the acquisition of independent sales agents and offices operated by independent brokerages. Many franchisees use the proceeds from the conversion notes to update marketing materials, upgrade technology and websites, or to assist in acquiring companies or recruiting agents. The notes are not funded until appropriate credit checks and other due diligence matters are completed, and the business is opened and operating under one of our brands. Upon satisfaction of certain revenue performance based thresholds, the notes are forgiven ratably over the term of the franchise agreement. If the revenue performance thresholds are not met, franchisees may be required to repay all or a portion of the outstanding notes.
In addition to offices owned and operated by our franchisees, as of December 31, 2018, we, through NRT, own and operate approximately 710 offices under the Coldwell Banker®, Coldwell Banker Commercial® and Sotheby's International Realty® brand names. NRT pays intercompany royalty fees and marketing fees to our Real Estate Franchise Services Segment in connection with its operation of these offices. These fees are recognized as income or expense by the applicable segment level and eliminated in the consolidation of our businesses.
In the U.S., we employ a direct franchising model whereby we contract with and provide services directly to independent owner-operators.  We also utilize a direct franchising model outside of the U.S. for Sotheby's International Realty® and Corcoran® and, in some cases, Better Homes and Gardens Real Estate®. For all other brands, we generally employ a master franchise model outside of the U.S., whereby we contract with a qualified third party to build a franchise network in the country or region in which franchising rights have been granted. Under both the direct and the master franchise model outside of the U.S., we typically enter into long-term franchise agreements (often 25 years in duration) and receive an initial area development fee and ongoing royalties.  Under the master franchise model, the ongoing royalties we receive are generally a percentage of the royalties received by the master franchisor from its franchisees with which it contracts. Under the direct franchise model, a royalty fee is paid to us on transactions conducted by our franchisees in the applicable country or region.
We also offer third-party service providers an opportunity to market their products to our franchisees and their independent sales agents and customers through our preferred alliance program. To participate in this program, service providers generally agree to provide preferred pricing to our franchisees and/or their customers or independent sales agents and to pay us a combination of an initial licensing or access fee, subsequent marketing fees and/or commissions based upon our franchisees' or independent sales agents' usage of the preferred alliance vendors. We also transmit listings to various platforms and services.
We own the trademarks Century 21®, Coldwell Banker®, Coldwell Banker Commercial®, Corcoran®, ERA® and related trademarks and logos, and such trademarks and logos are material to the businesses that are part of our real estate franchise segment. Our franchisees and our subsidiaries actively use these trademarks, and all of the material trademarks are registered (or have applications pending) with the United States Patent and Trademark Office as well as with corresponding trademark offices in major countries worldwide where these businesses have significant franchised operations.
We have an exclusive license to own, operate and franchise the Sotheby's International Realty® brand to qualified residential real estate brokerage offices and individuals operating in eligible markets pursuant to a license agreement with SPTC Delaware LLC, a subsidiary of Sotheby's ("Sotheby's"). Such license agreement has a 100-year term, which consists 
12

of an initial 50-year term ending February 16, 2054 and a 50-year renewal option. We pay a licensing fee to Sotheby's for the use of the Sotheby's International Realty® name equal to 9.5% of the net royalties earned by our Real Estate Franchise Services Segment attributable to franchisees affiliated with the Sotheby's International Realty® brand, including our company owned offices.
In October 2007, we entered into a long-term license agreement to own, operate and franchise the Better Homes and Gardens® Real Estate brand from Meredith. The license agreement between Realogy and Meredith is for a 50-year term, with a renewal option for another 50 years at our option. We pay a licensing fee to Meredith for the use of the Better Homes and Gardens® Real Estate brand name equal to 9.0% of the net royalties earned by our Real Estate Franchise Services Segment attributable to franchisees affiliated with the Better Homes and Gardens® Real Estate brand, subject to a minimum annual licensing fee.
Each of our brands has a consumer website that offers real estate listings, contacts and services. Century21.com, coldwellbanker.com, coldwellbankercommercial.com, sothebysrealty.com, era.com, bhgrealestate.com and corcoran.com are the official websites for the Century 21®, Coldwell Banker®, Coldwell Banker Commercial®, Sotheby's International Realty®, ERA®, Better Homes and Gardens® Real Estate and Corcoran® franchise systems, respectively. The contents of these websites are not incorporated by reference herein or otherwise a part of this Annual Report.
Company Owned Real Estate Brokerage Services 
Through our subsidiary, NRT, we own and operate a full-service real estate brokerage business in many of the largest metropolitan areas in the U.S. Our company owned real estate brokerage business operates under the Coldwell Banker® and Sotheby's International Realty® franchised brands as well as proprietary brands that we own, but do not currently franchise, such as Corcoran®, Climb Real Estate®, ZipRealty® and Citi HabitatsSM (although we launched franchise sales of Corcoran® in January 2019).
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 760 company owned brokerage offices, approximately 4,900 employees and approximately 50,200 independent sales agents working with these company owned offices.
Our company owned real estate brokerage business derives revenue primarily from gross commission income received serving as the broker at the closing of real estate transactions. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our average homesale broker commission rate was 2.43% which represents the average commission rate earned on either the "buy" side or the "sell" side of a homesale transaction. Gross commission income is also earned on non-sale transactions such as home rentals. NRT, as a franchisee of RFG, pays a royalty fee of 6% per transaction to RFG from the commission earned on a real estate transaction. The remainder of gross commission income is split between the broker (NRT) and the independent sales agent. The following chart illustrates the key drivers for revenue earned by NRT:
In addition, as a full-service real estate brokerage company, we promote the complementary services of our relocation and title and settlement services businesses. We believe we provide integrated services that enhance the customer experience.
When we assist the seller in a real estate transaction, independent sales agents generally provide the seller with a full-service marketing program, which may include developing a direct marketing plan for the property, assisting the seller in pricing the property and preparing it for sale, listing it on multiple listing services, advertising the property (including on websites), showing the property to prospective buyers, assisting the seller in sale negotiations, and assisting the seller in preparing for closing the transaction. When we assist the buyer in a real estate transaction, independent sales agents generally help the buyer in locating specific properties that meet the buyer's personal and financial specifications, show properties to the buyer, assist the buyer in negotiating (where permissible) and preparing for closing the transaction. In addition, NRT has relationships with developers, primarily in major cities, to provide marketing and brokerage services in new developments.
13

At December 31, 2018, we operated approximately 89% of our offices under the Coldwell Banker® brand name, approximately 5% of our offices under the Sotheby's International Realty® brand name and 6% of our offices under the Corcoran®, Citi HabitatsSM, ZipRealty® and Climb Real Estate® brand names combined. Our offices are geographically diverse with a strong presence in the east and west coast areas, primarily around large metropolitan areas in the U.S., where home prices are generally higher. We operate our Coldwell Banker® offices and Sotheby's International Realty® offices in numerous regions throughout the U.S., Corcoran® offices in New York City, the Hamptons (New York), and Palm Beach, Florida and Climb Real Estate® offices in Northern California.
We intend to grow our business organically. To grow organically, we focus on working with office managers to attract and retain independent sales agents who can successfully engage and promote transactions from new and existing clients. To complement our residential brokerage services, NRT offers home ownership services that include comprehensive single-family residential property management in many of the nation's largest rental markets.
To a lesser extent, we may grow our business through strategic acquisitions focused primarily on expanding our existing markets. Following the completion of an acquisition, we tend to consolidate the newly acquired operations with our existing operations to reduce or eliminate duplicative costs and to leverage our existing infrastructure to support newly affiliated independent sales agents.
NRT has a contract with Cartus under which the brokerage business provides brokerage services to relocating employees of the clients of Cartus. When receiving a referral from Cartus, NRT seeks to assist the relocating employee in completing a homesale or home purchase. Upon completion of a homesale or home purchase, NRT receives a commission on the purchase or sale of the property and is obligated to pay Cartus a portion of such commission as a referral fee. We believe that these fees are comparable to the fees charged by other relocation companies.
Relocation Services 
Through our subsidiary, Cartus, we are the leading provider of global relocation services. 
In 2018, we assisted in over 171,000 corporate and affinity relocations in 150 countries for approximately 660 active clients, including 56% of the Fortune 50 companies as well as affinity organizations. Cartus has operations in the U.S. and internationally in the United Kingdom, Canada, Hong Kong, Singapore, China, India, Brazil, Germany, France, Switzerland and the Netherlands.
Employee Relocation Services
We primarily offer corporate clients employee relocation services, such as:

• | homesale assistance, including:


◦ | the valuation, inspection, purchasing and selling of a transferee's home;


◦ | the issuance of home equity advances to transferees permitting them to purchase a new home before selling their current home (these advances are generally guaranteed by the individual's employer);


◦ | certain home management services;


◦ | assistance in locating a new home; and


◦ | closing on the sale of the old home, generally at the instruction of the client;


• | expense processing, relocation policy counseling, relocation-related accounting, including international assignment compensation services, and other consulting services;


• | arranging household goods moving services, over 56,000 domestic and international shipments in 2018, and providing support for all aspects of moving a transferee's household goods, including the handling of insurance and claim assistance, invoice auditing and quality control;


• | coordinating visa and immigration support, intercultural and language training, and expatriation/repatriation counseling and destination services; and


• | group move management services providing coordination for moves involving a large number of transferees to or from a specific regional area over a short period of time.

The wide range of our services allows our Cartus clients to outsource their entire relocation programs to us.
Substantially all homesale service transactions for clients are classified as "no risk." Under "no risk" business, the client is responsible for reimbursement of all direct expenses associated with the homesale. Such expenses include, but are 
14

not limited to, appraisal, inspection and real estate brokerage commissions. The client also bears the risk of loss on the resale of the transferee's home. Clients are responsible for reimbursement of all other direct costs associated with the relocation including, but not limited to, costs to move household goods, mortgage origination points, temporary living and travel expenses. Generally, we fund the direct expenses associated with the homesale as well as those associated with the relocation on behalf of the client and the client then reimburses us for these costs plus interest charges on the advanced funds. This limits our exposure on "no risk" homesale services to the credit risk of our clients rather than to the potential fluctuations in the real estate market or to the creditworthiness of the individual transferring employee. Historically, due to the credit quality of our clients, we have had minimal losses with respect to these "no risk" homesale services.
The "at risk" business that we conduct is minimal. In "at risk" homesale service transactions, we acquire the home being sold by the transferring employee, incur the cost for all direct expenses (acquisition, carrying and selling costs) associated with the homesale and bear any loss on the sale of the home.
Substantially all of our contracts with our relocation clients are terminable at any time at the option of the client and are non-exclusive. If a client ceases or reduces volume under its contract, we will be compensated for all services performed up to the time that volume ceases and reimbursed for all expenses incurred.
There are a number of different revenue streams associated with relocation services. We earn referral commissions primarily from real estate brokers and household goods moving companies that provide services to the transferee. Clients may also pay transactional fees for the services performed. We also earn net interest income which represents interest earned from clients on the funds we advance on behalf of the transferring employee net of costs associated with the securitization obligations used to finance these payments. Cartus measures operating performance based on initiations, which represent the total number of transferees and affinity members we serve, and referrals, which represent the number of referrals from which we earn revenue from real estate brokers.
Affinity Services
About 18% of our relocation revenue in 2018 was derived from our affinity services, which provides real estate services, including home buying and selling assistance to members of organizations such as insurance companies and credit unions that have established members who are buying or selling a home. Our affinity revenues are highly concentrated and our affinity relationships are terminable at any time at the option of the client and are non-exclusive. Often these organizations offer our affinity services to their members at no cost and, where permitted, provide their members with a financial incentive for using these services. These member benefits and services help the organizations attract new members and retain current members. Where permitted by law, these members can receive cash or a gift card based on the home purchase/sale price pursuant to the applicable program.
Cartus Broker Network
To service the needs of our relocation and affinity clients as well as broker-to-broker referrals, we manage the Cartus Broker Network, which is a network of real estate brokers consisting of our company owned brokerage operations, select franchisees and independent real estate brokers who have been approved to become members. Cartus requires experienced brokers and independent sales agents and obtains background checks on all members of the network. Member brokers of the Cartus Broker Network receive referrals from our relocation services, affinity business and each other in exchange for a referral fee. The Cartus Broker Network is a key contributor to our lead generation strategy, with approximately 99% of the converted leads generated through the network being directed to independent sales agents affiliated with our franchisees and company-owned brokerages in 2018. The Cartus Broker Network closed approximately 81,000 real estate transactions in 2018 related to relocation, affinity, and broker-to-broker activity.
The following chart illustrates the key drivers for revenue generated by Cartus:

Title and Settlement Services 
Our title and settlement services business, TRG, provides full-service title and settlement (i.e., closing and escrow) services to real estate companies and financial institutions. We act in the capacity of a title agent and sell title insurance to property buyers and mortgage lenders. We are licensed as a title agent in 42 states and Washington, D.C., and have physical locations in 20 states and Washington, D.C. We issue title insurance policies on behalf of large national underwriters as well as through our Dallas-based subsidiary, Title Resources Guaranty Company ("Title Resources"). Title Resources is a title insurance underwriter licensed in 35 states and Washington, D.C. We operate mostly in major metropolitan areas. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 400 offices, approximately 200 of which are co-located within one of our company owned brokerage offices.
Virtually all lenders require their borrowers to obtain title insurance policies at the time mortgage loans are made on real property. The terms and conditions upon which the real property will be insured are determined in accordance with the standard policies and procedures of the title underwriter. When our title agencies sell title insurance, the title search and examination function is performed by the agent. The title agent and underwriter split the premium. The amount of such premium "split" is determined by agreement between the agency and underwriter, or is promulgated by state law. We derive revenue through fees charged in real estate transactions for rendering the services described above, fees charged for escrow and closing services, and a percentage of the title premium on each title insurance policy sold. We have entered into underwriting agreements with various underwriters, which state the conditions under which we may issue a title insurance policy on their behalf. For policies issued through our agency operations, assuming no negligence on our part, we are not typically liable for losses under those policies; rather the title insurer is typically liable for such losses. 
Our company owned brokerage operations are the principal source of our title and settlement services business for homesale transactions. Other sources of our title and settlement services homesale business include our real estate franchise business, Cartus and unaffiliated brokerage operations. For refinance transactions, we generate title and escrow revenues from financial institutions throughout the mortgage lending industry. Many of our offices have subleased space from, and are co-located within, our company owned brokerage offices. The capture rate of our title and settlement services business from company owned brokerage operations was approximately 37% in 2018.
We coordinate a national network of escrow and closing agents (some of whom are our employees, while others are attorneys in private practice and independent title companies) to provide full-service title and settlement services to a broad-based group that includes lenders, home buyers and sellers, developers and independent real estate sales agents. Our role is generally that of an intermediary managing the completion of all the necessary documentation and services required to complete a real estate transaction.
Our title and settlement services business measures operating performance based on purchase and refinance closing units and the related title premiums and escrow fees earned on such closings. In addition, we measure net title premiums earned for title policies issued by our underwriting operation. 
The following chart illustrates the key drivers for revenue generated by our title and settlement services business:
We intend to grow our title and settlement services business by attracting title and escrow sales agents in existing markets. We will also continue to seek to increase our capture rate of title business from our NRT homesale sides. In addition, we expect to continue to grow our underwriting business by increasing our agent base.
The equity earnings or losses related to Guaranteed Rate Affinity, our mortgage origination joint venture with Guaranteed Rate that began doing business on a phased-in basis in August 2017, are included in the financial results of TRG. We own 49.9% of the home mortgage joint venture and Guaranteed Rate owns the remaining 50.1%.

Marketing and Technology 
Our ability to provide independent sales agents at company owned and franchised brokerages with compelling data and technology products and services to make them more productive and their businesses more profitable is core to our integrated business strategy.
The marketing and technology services and support provided by independent sales agents to their customers are an important element of the value offered by an agent in the home purchase and sale process. Our commitment to continuously develop and improve our marketing and technology products and service is part of our value proposition to company owned and franchised real estate brokerages, affiliated independent sales agents and their customers as well as to our relocation and title and settlement services segments. Increasingly, these products and services are desired as an integrated tool, rather than stand-alone products and services. 
We have expended, and expect to continue to expend, substantial time, capital, and other resources to identify the needs of company owned brokerages, franchisees, independent sales agents and their customers and to develop marketing, technology and service offerings to meet the needs of affiliated independent sales agents. We are now building our agent- and franchisee-focused technology products with an open architecture in order to enable third-party vendors and products to access and interface with our products.
Real Estate Franchise Operations. Each of our franchise brands operates a marketing fund that is funded principally by our franchisees, although we may make discretionary contributions to any of the marketing funds and, in certain instances, are required to make contributions to certain marketing funds. The focus of each marketing fund is to build and maintain brand awareness and preference for the brand and drive leads to our franchisees and their affiliated independent sales agents, which is accomplished through a variety of media, including but not limited to social media, advertising, direct marketing and internet advertising.
Each brand manages a comprehensive system of marketing tools, systems and sales information and data that can be accessed through freestanding brand intranet sites to assist independent sales agents in becoming the best marketer of their listings. Advertising is primarily used by the brands to drive leads to our agents, increase brand awareness and perception, promote our network and offerings to the real estate industry and engage our customer base.
We provide our franchisees with technology-enabled solutions designed to help our franchisees serve their customers, attract new or retain existing independent sales agents, and support our franchisees with servicing programs, including tools using our proprietary Zap platform. Our technology offerings are designed to leverage the collective strength of each brand online and are updated frequently in order to keep up with changing needs of brokers, agents and consumers to continually strengthen our value proposition.
Our proprietary platform is designed to increase the value proposition to our franchisees, their independent sales agents and their customers by:

• | aiding in lead generation and obtaining additional homesale transactions for our franchisees and their independent sales agents;


• | connecting those agents and brokers to a predictive customer relationship management (CRM) tool that allows for the cultivation of productive relationships with consumers at all stages of the transaction;


• | enhancing access to listing distributions through mobile applications and websites;


• | informing them with valuable client insight and behavioral data to help those agents increase their productivity; and


• | providing consumers with a streamlined yet comprehensive user experience to facilitate the necessary steps for researching homes, communities and independent sales agents.

Our brand websites contain listing information on a regional and national market basis, independent sales agent information, community profiles, home buying and selling advice, relocation tips and mortgage financing information and unique property and neighborhood insights from local agents. Each independent sales agent also has a personally-branded mobile application that they can customize with their own content and use to market themselves. Additionally, each brand website allows independent sales agents to market themselves to consumers. 
 Significant focus is placed on developing websites for each brand to create value to the real estate consumer. Each brand website focuses on streamlined, easy search processes for listing inventory and rich descriptive details, multiple photos, full motion videos and in some cases virtual reality tours to market the real estate listing. We also place significant emphasis on distributing our real estate listings with third-party websites to expand a homebuyer's access to such listings, at 
17

times enhancing the presentation of the listings on third-party websites to make the listings more attractive to consumers. Consumers seeking more detailed information about a particular listing on a third-party website are generally able to click through to a brand website or a company owned brokerage website or telephone the franchisee or company owned brokerage directly.
We also provide our franchisees with proprietary technology to support many of the key back office processes necessary for their business operations including listing and transaction management, reporting, marketing, and agent profiles. The primary system provides direct interaction with business operations, allows for integration with third-party systems and offers business planning tools that enable our franchisees to track their progress against key business objectives in real time.
Company Owned Brokerage Operations. Our company owned brokerages sponsor a wide array of marketing programs, materials and opportunities to complement the sales work of our affiliated independent sales agents and increase brand awareness. The effectiveness and quality of marketing programs play a significant role in attracting and retaining independent sales agents.
NRT's sponsored marketing programs and initiatives primarily focus on attracting potential new home buyers and sellers to NRT's affiliated independent sales agents. These programs and initiatives also complement the awareness of our brands by increasing the local recognition of our agents and local brokerages.
Much of our marketing efforts are geared toward showcasing the inventory of our real estate listings and the affiliated independent sales agents who are the selling agents of these listings. In addition to prominently placing the listing property and related selling agent information on numerous real estate websites, we promote the selling agents and their properties on social media sites and offer tools and systems intended to enhance the home buying and home selling experiences of our customers. We also offer the independent sales agents broad-based advertising, mailings and other campaigns to generate leads, interest and recognition.
The Internet has become the primary advertising channel in our industry and we have sought to become a leader among full-service residential real estate brokerage firms in the use and application of marketing technology. We place our property listings on hundreds of real estate websites and we operate a variety of our own websites.
NRT also utilizes both proprietary and third-party technology to offer independent sales agents tools that may enhance their productivity and increase their understanding of their local markets and the impact of their marketing efforts. For example, we recently launched Listing Concierge, a full service solution for the design, creation and distribution of automated customized property listings.
 Additional tools include the HomeBase Transaction Management and InTouch CRM systems, as well as e-Marketing reporting tools.
Education
Each real estate brand provides learning and development materials and access to continuing education to its franchisees to assist them in building their real estate sales businesses. Each brand's engagement program contains different materials and delivery methods. The marketing materials include a detailed description of the services offered by our franchise systems (which will be available to the independent sales agent). Live instructors at conventions and orientation seminars deliver some engagement modules while other modules can be viewed by brokers anywhere in the world through virtual classrooms over the Internet. Most of the programs and materials are then made available in electronic form to franchisees over the respective system's private intranet site. Many of the materials are customizable to allow franchisees to achieve a personalized look and feel and make modifications to certain content as appropriate for their business and marketplace.
Employees 
At December 31, 2018, we had approximately 11,400 employees, including approximately 855 employees outside of the U.S. None of our employees are represented by a union.
Seasonality
The residential housing market is seasonal, with a higher level of homesale transactions typically occurring in the second and third quarter of each year. As a result, historically, operating results and revenues for all of our businesses have been strongest in the second and third quarters of the calendar year. 
18

Competition 
Real Estate Brokerage Industry. The ability of our real estate brokerage franchisees and our company owned brokerage businesses to successfully compete is important to our prospects for growth. Their ability to compete may be affected by the recruitment, retention and performance of independent sales agents, the location of offices and target markets, the services provided to independent sales agents, the economic relationship between the broker and the agent (including the share of commission income retained by the agent and fees charged to or paid by the agent for services provided by the broker), the number and nature of competing offices in the vicinity, affiliation with a recognized brand name, community reputation, technology and other factors, including macro-economic factors such as national, regional and local economic conditions.
We and our franchisees compete for consumer business as well as for independent sales agents with national and regional independent real estate brokerages and franchisors, discount and limited service brokerages, and with franchisees of our brands. Our largest national competitors in this industry include, but are not limited to, HomeServices of America (a Berkshire Hathaway affiliate), Howard Hanna Holdings, Compass and Weichert, Realtors and several large franchisors: RE/MAX International, Inc., Keller Williams Realty, Inc. and HSF Affiliates LLC (a joint venture controlled by HomeServices of America that operates Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices and Real Living Real Estate).
Competition for Independent Sales Agents.  The successful recruitment and retention of independent sales agents and independent sales agent teams are critical to the business and financial results of a brokerage—whether or not it is affiliated with a franchisor. Most of a brokerage's real estate listings are sourced through the sphere of influence of its independent sales agents, notwithstanding the growing influence of internet-generated leads. Competition for independent sales agents in our industry is high and has intensified particularly with respect to more productive independent sales agents and in the densely populated metropolitan areas in which we operate.  The successful recruitment and retention of independent sales agents is influenced by many factors, including remuneration (such as sales commission percentage and other financial incentives paid to independent sales agents), other expenses borne by independent sales agents, leads or business opportunities generated for independent sales agents from the brokerage, independent sales agents' perception of the value of the broker's brand affiliation, marketing and advertising efforts by the brokerage or franchisor, the quality of the office manager, staff and fellow independent sales agents with whom they collaborate daily, as well as technology, continuing professional education, and other services provided by the brokerage or franchisor. 
We believe that a variety of factors in recent years have negatively impacted the recruitment and retention of independent sales agents in the industry generally and have put upward pressure on the average share of commissions earned by affiliated independent sales agents, including increasing competition, such as from brokerages that offer a greater share of commission income to independent sales agents, changes in the spending patterns of independent sales agents (as more agents purchase services from third parties outside of their affiliated broker), and growth in independent sales agent teams. Certain of our privately-held competitors have investors that appear to be supportive of a model that pursues increases in market share over profitability, which exacerbates competition for independent sales agents and pressure on the share of commission income received by the agent, creating challenges to our and our franchisee’s margins and profitability.
Commission Plan Competition Among Real Estate Brokerages.  Some of the firms competing for sales agents use different commission plans, which may be appealing to certain sales agents. There are several different commission plan variations that have been historically utilized by real estate brokerages to compensate their independent sales agents. One of the most common variations has been the traditional graduated commission model where the independent sales agent receives a percentage of the brokerage commission that increases as the independent sales agent increases his or her volume of homesale transactions, and the brokerage frequently provides independent sales agents with a broad set of support offerings and promotion of properties. Other common plans include a desk rental or 100% commission plan, a fixed transaction fee commission plan, and a capped commission plan. A capped commission plan generally blends aspects of the traditional graduated commission model with the 100% commission plan.
Although less common, some real estate brokerages employ their sales agents and, in such instances, employee agents may earn smaller brokerage commissions in exchange for other employee benefits or bonuses. Most brokerages focus primarily on one type of commission plan though some may offer one or more of commission plan variations to their sales agents.
Our company owned brokerage service has historically compensated affiliated independent sales agents using a traditional graduated commission model that emphasizes the value proposition offered to independent sales agents and independent sales agent teams, although we have utilized elements of other commission plans in certain geographic markets 
19

and have recently begun to expand our use of alternative commission plans at our company owned brokerages in certain territories.
Low Barriers to Entry and Influx of Traditional and Non-Traditional Competition as well as Industry Disrupters. The real estate brokerage industry has minimal barriers to entry for new participants, including participants utilizing historic real estate brokerage models and those pursuing alternative variations of those models as well as non-traditional methods of marketing real estate. The significant size of the U.S. real estate market, in particular the addressable market of commission revenues, has continued to attract outside capital investment in traditional and disruptive competitors that seek to access a portion of this market.
There are also market participants who differentiate themselves by offering consumers flat fees, rebates or lower commission rates on transactions (often coupled with fewer services). Although such competitors have yet to have a material impact on overall brokerage commission rates, this could change in the future if they use greater discounts as a means to increase their market share or improve their value proposition.
While real estate brokers using historic real estate brokerage models typically compete for business primarily on the basis of services offered, reputation, utilization of technology, personal contacts and brokerage commission, participants pursuing non-traditional methods of marketing real estate may compete in other ways, including companies that employ technologies intended to disrupt historic real estate brokerage models or minimize or eliminate the role brokers and sales agents perform in the homesale transaction process. A growing number of companies are competing in non-traditional ways for a portion of the gross commission income generated by homesale transactions. For example, listing aggregators and other web-based real estate service providers not only compete for our company owned brokerage business by establishing relationships with independent sales agents and/or buyers and sellers of homes, they also increasingly charge brokerages and independent sales agents additional fees for new and existing services. Other business models that have emerged in recent years consist of companies (including certain listing aggregators) that leverage capital to purchase homes directly from sellers, commonly referred to as iBuying.
Franchise Competition. According to NAR, approximately 42% of individual brokers and independent sales agents are affiliated with a franchisor. Competition among the national real estate brokerage brand franchisors to grow their franchise systems is intense. We believe that competition for the sale of franchises in the real estate brokerage industry is based principally upon the perceived value that the franchisor provides to enhance the franchisee's ability to grow its business and improve the recruitment, retention and productivity of its independent sales agents. The value provided by a franchisor encompasses many different aspects including the quality of the brand, tools, technology, marketing and other services, the availability of financing provided to the franchisees, and the fees the franchisees must pay. Franchisee fees can be structured in numerous ways and can include flat royalty and marketing fees, capped royalty fees, and discounted royalty and marketing fees. We recently launched a capped fee model at one of our brands as substantially all of our franchises are structured using a flat fee model and we have faced increasing competition from franchisors utilizing alternative models.
Relocation Business. Competition in our corporate relocation business is based on capabilities, price and quality. We compete primarily with global outsourced and regional relocation services providers in the corporate relocation business. The larger outsourced relocation services providers that we compete with include BGRS, SIRVA, Inc. and Weichert Relocation Resources, Inc. Competition is expected to continue to intensify as an increasingly higher percentage of relocation clients reduce their global relocation benefits and related spend. 
Title and Settlement Business. The title and settlement business is highly competitive. The number and size of competing companies vary in the different areas in which we conduct business. In certain parts of the country we compete with small title agents and attorneys while in other parts of the country our competition is the larger title underwriters and national vendor management companies. In addition, we compete with the various brands of national competitors including Fidelity National Title Insurance Company, First American Title Insurance Company, Stewart Title Guaranty Company and Old Republic Title Company.
Government and Other Regulations 
RESPA.  RESPA, state real estate brokerage laws and similar laws in countries in which we do business restrict payments which real estate brokers, title agencies, mortgage bankers, mortgage brokers and other settlement service providers may receive or pay in connection with the sales of residences and referral of settlement services (e.g., mortgages, homeowners insurance and title insurance). Such laws may to some extent impose limitations on arrangements involving our real estate franchise, real estate brokerage, settlement services and relocation businesses or the business of our mortgage origination joint venture. In addition, with respect to our company owned real estate brokerage, relocation and title and 
20

settlement services businesses as well as our mortgage origination joint venture, RESPA and similar state laws generally require timely disclosure of certain relationships or financial interests with providers of real estate settlement services. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”) administers RESPA. Some state authorities have also asserted enforcement rights.
RESPA and related regulations do, however, contain a number of provisions that allow for payments or fee splits between providers, including fee splits between title underwriters and agents, real estate brokers and agents and market-based fees for the provision of goods or services and marketing arrangements.  In addition, RESPA allows for referrals to affiliated entities, including joint ventures, when specific requirements have been met.  We rely on these provisions in conducting our business activities and believe our arrangements comply with RESPA.  RESPA compliance, however, has become a greater challenge under certain administrations for most industry participants offering settlement services, including mortgage companies, title companies and brokerages, because of changes in the regulatory environment and expansive interpretations of RESPA or similar state statutes by certain courts. Permissible activities under state statutes similar to RESPA may be interpreted more narrowly and enforcement proceedings of those statutes by state regulatory authorities may also be aggressively pursued. RESPA also has been invoked by plaintiffs in private litigation for various purposes. 
Franchise Regulation. In the U.S., the sale of franchises is regulated by various state laws, as well as by federal law under the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC"). The FTC requires that franchisors make extensive disclosure to prospective franchisees but does not require registration. A number of states require registration and/or disclosure in connection with franchise offers and sales. In addition, several states have "franchise relationship laws" or "business opportunity laws" that limit the ability of the franchisor to terminate franchise agreements or to withhold consent to the renewal or transfer of these agreements. The states with relationship or other statutes governing the termination of franchises include Alaska, Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin. Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands also have statutes governing termination of franchises. Some franchise relationship statutes require a mandated notice period for termination and some require a notice and cure period. In addition, some require that the franchisor demonstrate good cause for termination. These statutes do not have a substantial effect on our operations because our franchise agreements generally comport with the statutory requirements for cause for termination, and they provide notice and cure periods for most defaults. When state law grants a period longer than permitted under the franchise agreement, we extend our notice and/or cure periods to match the statutory requirements. In some states, case law requires a franchisor to renew a franchise agreement unless a franchisee has given cause for non-renewal. Failure to comply with these laws could result in civil liability to the franchisors. While our franchising operations have not been materially adversely affected by such existing regulation, we cannot predict the effect of any future federal or state legislation or regulation. Internationally, many countries have similar laws affecting franchising.
State Brokerage Laws.  Our company owned real estate brokerage business is also subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations that contain general standards for and limitations on the conduct of real estate brokers and sales agents, including those relating to the licensing of brokers and sales agents, fiduciary and agency duties, consumer disclosure obligations, administration of trust funds, collection of commissions, restrictions on information sharing with affiliates, fair housing standards and advertising and consumer disclosures. Under state law, our company owned real estate brokers have certain duties to supervise and are responsible for the conduct of their brokerage businesses.
Worker Classification. Although the legal relationship between residential real estate brokers and licensed sales agents throughout the real estate industry historically has been that of independent contractor, newer rules and interpretations of state and federal employment laws and regulations, including those governing employee classification and wage and hour regulations, may impact industry practices, our company owned brokerage operations and our affiliated franchisees. 
Real estate laws generally permit brokers to engage sales agents as independent contractors. Federal and state agencies have their own rules and tests for classification of independent contractors as well as to determine whether employees meet exemptions from minimum wages and overtime laws.  These tests consider many factors that also vary from state to state.  The tests continue to evolve based on state case law decisions, regulations and legislative changes.  There is active worker classification litigation in numerous jurisdictions against a variety of industries—now including residential real estate brokerages—where the plaintiffs seek to reclassify independent contractors as employees or to challenge the use of federal and state minimum wage and overtime exemptions. 
For a summary of legal proceedings initiated against a wholly-owned subsidiary franchisor of the Company and an affiliated franchisee alleging worker misclassification, see "Part I - Item 3. Legal Proceedings" in this Annual Report.
21

Multiple Listing Services Rules.  We participate in many multiple listing services ("MLS") and are subject to each MLS' rules, policies, data licenses, and terms of service, which specify, among other things, how we may access and use MLS data and listings and how MLS data and listings must be displayed on our and our franchisees' websites and mobile applications. The rules of each MLS to which we belong can vary widely and are complex.
Regulation of Title Insurance and Settlement Services. Nearly all states license and regulate title agencies/settlement service providers or certain employees and underwriters through their Departments of Insurance or other regulatory body. In many states, title insurance rates are either promulgated by the state or are required to be filed with each state by the agent or underwriter, and some states promulgate the split of title insurance premiums between the agent and underwriter. States sometimes unilaterally lower the insurance rates relative to loss experience and other relevant factors. States also require title agencies and title underwriters to meet certain minimum financial requirements for net worth and working capital. In addition, the insurance laws and regulations of Texas, the jurisdiction in which our title insurance underwriter subsidiary, Title Resources, is domiciled, generally provide that no person may acquire control, directly or indirectly, of a Texas domiciled insurer, unless the person has provided required information to, and the acquisition is approved or not disapproved by, the Texas Department of Insurance. Generally, any person acquiring beneficial ownership of 10% or more of our voting securities would be presumed to have acquired indirect control of our title insurance underwriter subsidiary unless the Texas Department of Insurance, upon application, determines otherwise. Our insurance underwriter is also subject to a holding company act in its state of domicile, which regulates, among other matters, investment policies and the ability to pay dividends.
Certain states in which we operate have "controlled business" statutes which impose limitations on affiliations between providers of title and settlement services, on the one hand, and real estate brokers, mortgage lenders and other real estate service providers, on the other hand. We are aware of the states imposing such limits and monitor the others to ensure that if they implement such a limit that we will be prepared to comply with any such rule. "Controlled business" typically is defined as sources controlled by, or which control, directly or indirectly, the title insurer or agent. Pursuant to legislation enacted in the State of New York in late 2014 requiring the licensing of title agents, the New York Department of Insurance has issued regulations that provide that title agents with affiliated businesses must make a good faith effort to obtain, and be open for, title insurance business from all sources and not business only from affiliated persons, including actively competing in the marketplace. A company's failure to comply with such statutes could result in the payment of fines and penalties or the non-renewal of the Company's license to provide title and settlement services. We provide our services not only to our affiliates but also to third-party businesses in the geographic areas in which we operate. Accordingly, we manage our business in a manner to comply with any applicable "controlled business" statutes by ensuring that we generate sufficient business from sources we do not control. We have never been cited for failing to comply with a "controlled business" statute.
Regulation of the Mortgage Industry. We participate in the mortgage origination business through our 49.9% ownership of Guaranteed Rate Affinity. Private mortgage lenders operating in the U.S. are subject to comprehensive state and federal regulation and to significant oversight by government sponsored entities. Dodd-Frank endows the CFPB with rule making, examination and enforcement authority involving consumer financial products and services, including mortgage finance.  The CFPB has issued a myriad of proposed and final rules, including TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure rules, which could materially and adversely affect the mortgage and housing industries.  Dodd-Frank established new standards and practices for mortgage originators, including determining a prospective borrower's ability to repay its mortgage and restricting the fees that mortgage originators may collect and could establish new standards in the future which could be costly to comply with and present material operating risks.
Cybersecurity and Data Privacy Regulations.  To run our business, it is essential for us to store and transmit sensitive personal information about our customers, prospects, employees, independent agents, and relocation transferees (Cartus) in our systems and networks. At the same time, we are subject to numerous laws, regulations, and other requirements around the world that require businesses like ours to protect the security of personal information, notify customers and other individuals about our privacy practices, and limit the use, disclosure, or transfer of personal data across country borders. Regulators in the U.S. and abroad continue to enact comprehensive new laws or legislative reforms imposing significant privacy and cybersecurity restrictions. The result is that we are subject to increased regulatory scrutiny, additional contractual requirements from corporate customers, and heightened compliance costs. For example, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"), which became effective in May 2018, conferred new and significant privacy rights on individuals (including employees and independent agents), and materially increased penalties for violations. In the U.S., California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act—which is expected to go into full effect in 2020—imposing new and comprehensive requirements on organizations that collect and disclose personal information about California residents. In March 2017, the New York Department of Financial Services’ new cybersecurity regulation went into effect.

That regulation required regulated financial institutions, including Realogy’s Title Resource Group ("TRG"), to establish a detailed cybersecurity program. Program requirements included corporate governance, incident planning, data management, system testing, vendor oversight, and regulator notification rules. Now, other state regulatory agencies are expected to enact similar requirements following the adoption of the Insurance Data Security Model Law by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners that is consistent with the New York regulation. For example, the South Carolina Insurance Data Security Act, effective January 1, 2019, is based on the Insurance Data Security Model Law and imposes new breach notification and information security requirements on insurers, agents, and other licensed entities authorized to operate under the state’s insurance laws, including TRG. Finally, our security systems and IT infrastructure may not adequately protect against all potential security breaches, cyber-attacks, or other unauthorized access to personal information. Third parties, including vendors or suppliers that provide essential services for our global operations, could also be a source of security risk to us if they experience a failure of their own security systems and infrastructure. Any significant violations of privacy and cybersecurity could result in the loss of new or existing business, litigation, regulatory investigations, the payment of fines, damages, and penalties and damage to our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
