ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Basis of Presentation
On July 25, 2018, MI Acquisitions, Inc. ("MI Acquisitions"), which was formed under the laws of the State of Delaware on April 23, 2015, acquired all of the outstanding member equity interests of Priority Holdings, LLC in exchange for the issuance of MI Acquisitions' common stock. As a result, Priority Holdings, LLC, which was previously a privately-owned company, became a wholly-owned subsidiary of MI Acquisitions (the "Business Combination"). Simultaneously, MI Acquisitions changed its name to Priority Technology Holdings, Inc. For financial accounting and reporting purposes under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP"), the acquisition was accounted for as a "reverse merger." Under this method of accounting, MI Acquisitions is treated as the acquired entity whereby Priority Holdings, LLC was deemed to have issued common stock for the net assets and equity of MI Acquisitions accompanied by a simultaneous equity recapitalization of Priority Holdings, LLC. Net assets of the Company are stated at historical cost and accordingly the equity and net assets of the Company have not been adjusted to fair value. As of July 25, 2018, the consolidated financial statements of the Company include the combined operations, cash flows, and financial positions of both MI Acquisitions and Priority Holdings, LLC. Prior to July 25, 2018, the results of operations, cash flows, and financial position are those of Priority Holdings, LLC. The units and corresponding capital amounts and earnings per unit of Priority Holdings, LLC prior to July 25, 2018 have been retroactively restated as shares reflecting the exchange ratio established in the recapitalization.
 Overview of the Company

We are a leading provider of merchant acquiring and commercial payment solutions, offering unique product capabilities to small and medium businesses ("SMBs"), enterprises and distribution partners such as retail independent sales organizations ("ISOs"), financial institutions ("FIs"), wholesale ISOs, and independent software vendors ("ISVs") in the United States. The Company, then Priority Holdings, LLC, was founded in 2005 with a mission to build a merchant inspired payments platform that would advance the goals of our SMB and enterprise clients and distribution partners. Since 2013, we have grown from the 38th largest U.S. merchant acquirer to become the 13th largest and 6th largest non-bank merchant acquirer as of the end of 2017, measured by Visa and MasterCard purchase volume according to the December 2017 Nilson Report. In 2018 and 2017, we processed over 466 million and 439 million transactions, respectively, and over $38 billion and $35 billion, respectively, in bankcard payment volume across approximately 181,000 and 174,000, respectively, merchants. Headquartered in Alpharetta, Georgia, we had 562 employees as of December 31, 2018 and are led by an experienced group of payments executives.

Our growth has been underpinned by three key strengths: (1) a cost-efficient, agile payment and business processing infrastructure, known internally as Vortex.Cloud and Vortex.OS, (2) two proprietary product platforms: the MX product suite targeting the consumer payments market and the commercial payments exchange ("CPX") product suite targeting the commercial payments market and (3) focused distribution engines dedicated to selling into business-to-consumer ("B2C") and commercial payments business-to-business ("B2B") markets.

The MX Product line provides technology-enabled payment acceptance and business management capabilities to merchants, enterprises and our distribution partners. The MX product line includes: (1) our MX ISO/Agent and VIMAS reseller technology systems (collectively referred to as "MX Connect") and (2) our MX Merchant products, which together provide resellers and merchant clients, a flexible and customizable set of business applications that help better manage critical business work functions and revenue performance using core payment processing as our leverage point. MX Connect provides our consumer payments reselling partners with automated tools that support low friction merchant on-boarding, underwriting and risk management, client service, and commission processing through a single mobile-enabled, web-based interface. The result is a smooth merchant activation onto our flagship consumer payments offering, MX Merchant, which provides core processing and business solutions to SMB clients. In addition to payment processing, the MX Merchant product line encompasses a variety of proprietary and third-party product applications that merchants can adopt such as MX Insights, MX Storefront, MX Retail, MX Invoice, MX B2B and ACH.com, among others. This comprehensive suite of solutions enables merchants to identify key consumer trends in their business, quickly implement e-commerce or retail point-of-sale ("POS") solutions, and even handle automated clearing house ("ACH") payments. By empowering resellers to adopt a consultative selling approach and embedding our technology into the critical day-
 
to-day workflows and operations of both merchants and resellers, we believe that we have established and maintained "sticky" relationships. We believe that our strong retention, coupled with consistent merchant boarding, have resulted in strong processing volume and revenue growth.

The CPX platform, like the MX Product line, provides a complete solution suite designed to monetize all types of B2B payments by maximizing automation for buyers and suppliers. CPX supports virtual card, purchase card, electronic fund transfer, ACH and check payments, intelligently routing each transaction via the optimal payment method. Underlying our MX and CPX platforms is the Company's Vortex.Cloud and Vortex.OS enterprise infrastructure, a curated cloud and application programming interface ("API") driven operating system built for scale and agility.

We developed an entirely virtual computing infrastructure in 2012. This infrastructure, known as Vortex.Cloud, is a highly-available, redundant, and audited payment card industry ("PCI"), Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ("HIPAA"), NACHA, and Financial Stability Oversight Council (the "FSOC") computing platform with centralized security and technical operations. We strive to enable Vortex.Cloud to maintain 99.999% uptime. All computational and IP assets of our operating companies are hosted and managed on Vortex.Cloud infrastructure. With Vortex.Cloud, we have constructed a uniform set of APIs, called Vortex.OS (operating system), that provide critical functionality to our payment divisions. The Vortex OS APIs provide electronic payments, security/crypto, data persistence, time series data (events), and artificial intelligence (AI). The MX and CPX product platforms leverage Vortex.OS and Vortex.Cloud for maximum scalability, high-availability, security, and access to advanced feature sets. The combined result is a purpose build infrastructure and product offering that produces solid organic growth and profit margin results. Furthermore, in addition to supporting a modern product stack, Vortex.Cloud and Vortex.OS enable the rapid inclusion of data and systems of acquisition targets for smooth consolidation to our operating infrastructure and accelerate achievement of revenue and cost synergies.
We sell our B2C merchant acquiring solutions primarily to SMBs through a growing and diverse reseller network, including ISOs, FIs, ISVs, Value-Added Resellers ("VARs") and other referral partners. We maintain stable, long-term relationships with our resellers, bolstered by the integration of MX Connect, a powerful customer relationship management ("CRM") and business operating system. MX Connect is used by our resellers and internal teams to manage their merchant base and accelerate the growth of their businesses through various value-added tools and resources which include marketing resources, automated onboarding, merchant underwriting, merchant activity monitoring and reporting. In addition, we offer ISVs and VARs a technology "agnostic" and feature rich API, providing developers with the ability to integrate electronic payment acceptance into their software and improve boarding efficiency for their merchant base. For the end user, MX Merchant provides a customizable, virtual terminal with proprietary business management tools and add-on applications that create an integrated merchant experience. MX Merchant's add-on applications include invoicing, website builder, inventory management and customer engagement and data analytics focused on targeted marketing among others. These proprietary business management tools and add-on applications, coupled with our omni-channel payment solutions, enable us to achieve attrition rates that, we believe, are well below industry average. MX Merchant can be deployed on hardware from a variety of vendors and operated either as a standalone product or integrated with third-party software. Through MX Merchant, we are well-positioned to capitalize on the trend towards integrated payments solutions, new technology adoption, and value-added service utilization in the SMB market. Our broad go-to-market strategy has resulted in a merchant base that is both industry and geographically diversified in the United States, resulting in low industry and merchant concentration.

In addition to our B2C offering, we have diversified our source of revenues through our growing presence in the B2B market. We work with enterprise clients and leading financial institutions seeking to automate their accounts payable processes. We provide curated managed services and a robust suite of integrated accounts payable automation solutions to industry leading financial institutions and card networks such as Citibank, MasterCard, Visa and American Express, among others. Unlike the consumer payments business which advocates a variable cost indirect sales strategy, Priority Commercial Payments supports a direct sales model that provides turnkey merchant development, product sales, and supplier enablement programs. CPX offers clients a seamless bridge for buyer to supplier (payor to provider) payments by integrating directly to a buyer's payment instruction file and parsing it for payment to suppliers via virtual card, purchase card, ACH +, dynamic discounting, or check. Successful implementation of our Accounts Payable ("AP") automation solutions provides suppliers with the benefits of cash acceleration, buyers with valuable rebate/discount revenue, and the Company with stable sources of payment processing and other revenue. Considering that the commercial payments volume in the United States is over twice the size of consumer payments and substantially less penetrated for electronic payments, we believe that this market represents a high growth opportunity for us.
 
More recently, we began to build our Integrated Partners component which offers solutions for ISVs, third-party integrators, and merchants that allow for the leveraging of our core payments engine via application program interfaces ("APIs") resources. Integrated Partners connects businesses with other businesses and their customers in the real estate, hospitality, and health care marketplaces.
We generate revenue primarily from fees charged for processing payment transactions, and to a lesser extent, from monthly subscription services and other solutions provided to merchants. Processing fees are generated from the ongoing sales of our merchants under multi-year merchant contracts, and thus are highly recurring in nature. Due to the nature of our strong reseller-centric distribution model and differentiated technology offering, we can drive efficient scale and operating leverage, generating robust margins and profitability.

For the year ended December 31, 2018, we generated revenue of $424.4 million, a net loss of $15.0 million and Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure) of $52.9 million, compared to revenue of $425.6 million, net income of $4.6 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $56.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. For a discussion of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation to net income (loss), the most directly comparable measure under GAAP, please see the section entitled "Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations—Certain Non-GAAP Measures" elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Industry Overview

The B2C payment processing industry provides merchants with credit, debit, gift and loyalty card and other payment processing services, along with related value-added solutions and information services. The industry continues to grow, driven by wider merchant acceptance, increased consumer use of electronic payments and advances in payment technology. The proliferation of bankcards and use of other payment technologies has made the acceptance of electronic payments through multiple channels a virtual necessity for many businesses, regardless of size, to remain competitive. This increased use and acceptance of bankcards and the availability of more sophisticated products and services has resulted in a highly competitive and specialized industry.

Services to the SMB merchant market have been historically characterized by basic payment processing without ready access to more sophisticated technology, value-added solutions, or customer service that are typically offered to large merchants. To keep up with the changing demands of how consumers wish to pay for goods and services, we believe that SMB merchants increasingly recognize the need for value-added services wrapped around omni-channel payment solutions that are tailored to their specific business needs.

Key Industry Trends

The following are key trends we believe are impacting the merchant acquiring / payment processing industry:


• | Trend Toward Electronic Transactions. We believe the continued shift from cash/paper payments toward electronic / card payments will drive growth for merchant acquirers and processors as volume continues to grow correspondingly. According to the December 2017 Nilson Report, card and electronic-based payments will make-up 83% of U.S. consumer payments (dollar volume) by 2021, compared to 64% and 75% in 2011 and 2016, respectively. We believe the continued migration from cash to card and overall market growth will continue to provide tailwinds to the electronic payments industry.


• | Increasing Demand for Integrated Payments. Merchant acquirers are increasingly differentiating themselves from competitors via innovative technology, including integrated POS solutions ("integrated payments"). Integrated payments refer to the integration of payment processing with various software solutions and applications that are sold by VARs and ISVs. Integrated software tools help merchants manage their businesses, streamline processes, lower costs, increase accuracy, and drive growth for businesses. The broader solutions delivered as part of an integrated payments platform have become an increasingly important consideration point for many SMBs, whereas pricing was historically the key factor influencing the selection of a merchant acquirer. Merchant acquirers that partner with VARs and ISVs to integrate payments with software or own the software outright may benefit most from new revenue streams and higher merchant retention.


• | Mobile Payments. Historically, e-commerce was conducted on a computer via a web browser; however, as mobile technologies continue to proliferate, consumers are making more purchases through mobile browsers and native mobile applications. We believe this shift represents a significant opportunity given the high growth rates of mobile payments volume, higher fees for card-not-present and cross-border processing and potential for the in-app economy to stimulate and/or alter consumer spending behavior.


• | Migration to EMV. EMV, which stands for Europay, MasterCard and Visa, is the global payments standard that utilizes chip technology on cards designed to increase security. EMV technology employs dynamic authentication for each transaction, rendering any data copied from magnetic strip readers to produce counterfeit cards unusable. Demand for EMV ready terminals should remain resilient in the near term due to the following:


• | The United States was one of the last countries to adopt EMV technology, leaving a large group of merchants still transitioning to the EMV standards; and


• | U.S. merchants are penalized for failing to comply with EMV standards by bearing the chargeback risk when presented with an EMV enabled card when the terminal is non-compliant.

The large majority of our third-party products are EMV enabled, and we expect that most new hardware sales will be EMV enabled devices, although all hardware sales constitute only a small portion of our total revenue.

B2B payments is the largest payment market in the United States by volume and presents a significant opportunity for payment providers to capitalize on the conversion of check and paper-based payments to electronic payments, including card-based acceptance. As businesses have increasingly looked to improve efficiency and reduce costs, the electronification of B2B payments has gained momentum. Business Insider estimates that over 51% of B2B volume was paid via check in 2016, mainly due to the complex and cumbersome process associated with B2B payments, including invoicing, delayed payment terms and use of multiple banks. 

Electronics Payments Overview

The payment processing and services industry provides the infrastructure and services necessary to enable the acceptance, processing, clearing and settlement of electronic payments predominantly consisting of credit card, debit card, ACH payments, gift cards and loyalty rewards programs. Characterized by recurring revenues, high operating leverage, and robust cash flow generation, the industry continues to benefit from the mass migration from cash and checks to electronic payments. According to the December 2017 Nilson Report, purchase volume on credit, debit and prepaid cards in the United States was approximately $6.2 trillion in 2016 and is estimated to reach nearly $8.5 trillion by 2021, a compound annual growth rate of 6.6%.

There are five key participants in the payment processing value chain: (i) card issuing banks, (ii) merchant acquirers, (iii) payment networks, (iv) merchant processors and (v) sponsor banks. Each of these participants performs key functions in the electronic payments process, while other entities, such as terminal manufacturers, gateway providers and independent sales organizations also play important functions within the value chain.


• | Card Issuing Banks – Typically financial institutions that issue credit/debit cards to consumers (also underwrite the risk associated the cards), authorize (check for fraud and sufficient funds) transactions and transfer funds through the payment networks for settlement. Some card issuers do not have the ability to process transactions in-house, in which case the issuer may engage a card processor.


• | Merchant Acquirers – Firms that sign up merchants to their platform through a variety of sales channels, enabling them to accept, process and settle electronic payments. Additionally, merchant acquirers provide other value-added services to help merchants run their businesses more efficiently, such as helping to select POS hardware and providing customer support and services.


• | Payment Networks – Card brand companies, such as MasterCard or Visa, that set rules and provide the rails to route transactions and information between card issuers, merchant acquirers and payments processors in real-time over vast communication networks.


• | Merchant Processors – Firms that provide the technology needed to allow for payment authorization, data transmission, data security and settlement functions. Oftentimes the term merchant acquirer and processor are used synonymously; however, they perform two distinct functions (sometimes provided by the same entity).


• | Sponsor Banks – Financial Institutions that are acquiring members of Visa and MasterCard and provide sponsorship access to acquirers and processors to the card networks. Sponsor banks provide merchants the ultimate access to the card networks for their processing activity.


The industry also includes other third-party providers, including service, software and hardware companies that provide products and services designed to improve the experience for issuers, merchants and merchant acquirers. This category includes mobile payment enablers, terminal manufacturers, and ISV's.

Each electronic payment transaction consists of two key steps: the front-end authorization and back end settlement.

• | Front End Authorization – The original request for payment authorization that occurs when the card is swiped or inserted at the POS or the data is entered into an online gateway.


• | Back End Settlement – The settlement and clearing process consists of settling outstanding payables and receivables between the card issuing bank & merchant bank. This process is facilitated by a back-end processor that utilizes the network's platform to send outstanding payable information and funds between the two parties.

A credit or debit card transaction carried out offline or through signature debit is a two-message process, with the front end occurring at the POS and the back end occurring later as a part of a batch processing system that clears all of the day's payments from transaction occurring throughout the day. Credit and debit card transactions carried out with personal identification numbers consist of a single message, whereby the authorization and clearing occur immediately – the money is instantly debited from the cardholder's checking account, although the settlement of funds (the transfer to the merchant's account) may happen later as part of a batch process.

MX Connect enables resellers to efficiently market merchant acquiring solutions to a broad base of merchants through this one-to-many distribution model. Resellers leverage MX Connect's powerful CRM and business operating features to manage their internal sales teams and engage their merchant base through various value-added tools and resources, such as marketing resources, automated onboarding, merchant underwriting, merchant activity monitoring and reporting, to support the growth of their businesses. We believe that our ability to service our reseller partners through a comprehensive offering provides a competitive advantage that has allowed the company to build a large, diverse merchant base characterized by high retention. The strength of our technology offering is manifest in the fact that we maintain ownership of merchant contracts, with most reseller contracts including strong non-solicit and portability restrictions.
Comprehensive Suite of Payment Solutions

MX Merchant offers a comprehensive and differentiated suite of traditional and emerging payment products and services that enables SMBs to address their payment needs through one provider. We provide a payment processing platform that allows merchants to accept electronic payments (e.g. credit cards, debit cards, and ACH) at the point of sale ("POS"), online, and via mobile payment technologies. In addition, through MX Merchant, we deliver innovative business management products and add-on features that meet the needs of SMBs across different vertical markets. Through our MX Merchant platform, we believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on the trend towards integrated payments solutions, new technology adoption and value-add service utilization that is underway in the SMB market.

We invest to attract and retain executive leadership that align with the opportunities in the market and our strategic focus. 
Growth Strategies

We intend to continue to execute a multi-pronged growth strategy, with diverse organic initiatives supplemented by acquisitions. Growth strategies include:

Organic Growth in our Consumer Reseller and Merchant Base

We expect to grow through our existing reseller network and merchant base, capitalizing on the inherent growth of existing merchant volume and reseller merchant portfolios. By providing resellers with agile tools to manage their sales businesses and grow their merchant portfolio, we have established a solid base from which to generate new merchant adoption and retain existing merchants. By engaging in a consultative partnership approach, we maintain strong relationships with our reseller partners and continues to exhibit strong merchant adoption and volume growth trends. Through our resellers, we provide merchants with full-service acquiring solutions, as well as value-added services and tools to streamline their business processes and enables them to focus on driving same store sales growth.
Expand our Network of Distribution Partners

We have established and maintains a strong position within the reseller community, with approximately 1,000 partners. We intend to continue to expand our distribution network to reach new partners, particularly with ISVs and VARs to expand technology and integrated partnerships. We believe that our MX Connect technology offering enables us to attract, and retain, high quality resellers focused on growth.
Increase Margin per Merchant with Complementary Products and Services

We intend to drive the adoption of our value-added services and tools with our merchant base. MX Merchant allows merchants to add proprietary Priority applications as well as other third-party applications from the MX Merchant Marketplace to build customized payment solutions that are tailored to a merchant's business needs. As we continue to board new merchants and promote our MX Merchant solution, we can cross-sell these add-on applications. By increasing attachment rates, along with continued benefit from economies of scale, we expect to see improved margins per merchant. Merchants utilizing MX Merchant exhibit somewhat higher retention, contributing to our improving overall retention rates. We believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on the secular trend towards integrated payments solutions, new technology adoption and value-add service utilization in the SMB market.
Deploy Industry Specific Payment Technology

We intend to continue to enhance and deploy our technology-enabled payment solutions in attractive industries. Through MX Merchant, we have developed proprietary applications and added third-party tools that address the specific needs of merchants in certain verticals, including retail, healthcare and hospitality. We continue to identify and evaluate new and attractive industries where we can deliver differentiated technology-enabled payment solutions that meet merchants' industry-specific needs.
Expand Electronic Payments Share of B2B Transactions with CPX

We have a growing presence in the commercial payments market where we provide curated managed services and AP automation solutions to industry leading financial institutions and card networks such as Citibank, MasterCard, Visa and American Express. Commercial payments is the largest and one of the fastest growing payments market in the United States by volume. We are well positioned to capitalize on the secular shift from check to electronic payments, which currently lags the consumer payments 
 
markets, by eliminating the friction between buyers and suppliers through our industry leading offering, and driving strong growth and profitability.

Accretive Acquisitions

We intend to selectively pursue strategic and tactical acquisitions that meet certain criteria, with a consistent long-term goal of maximizing stockholder value. We actively seek potential acquisition candidates that exhibit certain attractive attributes including, predictable and recurring revenue, scalable operating model, low capital intensity complementary technology offerings and strong cultural fit.

Commercial Payments Offering: Managed Services and CPX

We provide curated managed services and AP automation solutions (CPX) on behalf of industry leading financial institutions and card networks such as Citibank, MasterCard, Visa and American Express ("AMEX"). Our turnkey merchant development, business process outsourcing and refined supplier enablement program, allow commercial partners to leverage our long-standing customer relationships. Established in 2008, our commercial payments offering has allowed us to profit from the large and growing commercial payments market. Priority CPX offers solutions to key pain points such as scalability of expanding supplier onboarding while decreasing costs through automation. Successful implementation of our AP automation strategies provides vendors with the benefits of cash acceleration, buyers with valuable rebate/discount revenue, and the Company with stable sources of merchant acquiring, credit card interchange and discount fee revenue.
Managed Services

We provide business process outsourcing services to AMEX that offer AMEX's merchants access to several programs, including AMEX Buyer Initiated Payments ("BIP") and AMEX Merchant Financing loans. Acting as an outsourced sales force, we utilize approximately 180 employees to originate BIP or Merchant Financing loans for AMEX, earning a fee for each origination. Additionally, AMEX compensates us for personnel fees incurred for the employees who sell these outsourced services. We do not take any credit risk associated with the aforementioned programs.
CPX


Priority CPX is a turnkey commercial payments platform that automates the AP payment process between buyers and suppliers to maximize financial rebates and ensure timely, automated payment of vendor payments.

Sales and Distribution

We reach our consumer payment merchants through three primary sales channels: 1) Retail ISOs/Agents and Financial Institutions (i.e. community banks), 2) Wholesale ISOs, and 3) Independent Software Vendors and Value-Added Resellers. MX Connect allows resellers to engage merchants for processing services and a host of value-added features designed to enhance their customer relationship. Merchants utilize our diverse product suite to manage their business, increasing our ability to retain the merchant if the ISO were to leave the Company.

• | Retail ISOs/Agents and Financial Institutions (i.e. community banks) – A non-risk bearing independent company of sales agents, individual sales agent, or financial institution that operates as a sales force on behalf of the Company. Retail

 
resellers are not employed by us but rather are independently contracted to acquire merchants to utilize our payment processing and product offerings. While the reseller serves as the merchant's key contact, the processing contract is between us and the merchant and agreements with resellers include non-solicitation rights. We manage the transaction risk on behalf of retail resellers. 

• | Wholesale ISO – A risk bearing independent company of sales agents that operates as a sales force on behalf of the Company. Wholesale ISOs are not employed by us but rather are independently contracted to acquire merchants to utilize our payment processing and product offerings. While the ISO serves as the merchant's key contact, the processing contract is between us and the merchant, and agreements with ISOs include non-solicitation rights. Wholesale ISOs are responsible and bear all transaction risk on their merchant portfolios. We underwrite all such merchants even though wholesale ISOs bear the risk.


• | ISVs and VARs - ISVs develop and sell business management software solutions while VARs sell third-party software solutions to merchants as part of a bundled package that includes the computer systems which operates the software. We partner with ISVs and VARs that can integrate our capabilities into a variety of software applications (e.g. medical billing software). These integrated payment solutions create an extremely "sticky" customer relationship.


Priority Commercial Payments obtains its "buyer" clients through direct sales initiative and referral and business partnerships with integrated software partners, the card networks (MasterCard, Visa, American Express) and large US banking institutions. We support a direct vendor sales model that provides turnkey merchant development, product sales, and supplier enablement programs. By establishing a seamless bridge for buyer-to-supplier (payor-to-provider) payments that is integrated directly to a buyer's payment instruction file to facilitate payments to vendors via all payment types (virtual card, purchase card, ACH +, dynamic discounting), we have established ourselves as an emerging force in commercial payments.

Our market strategy has resulted in a merchant base that we believe is diversified across both industries and geographies resulting in, what we believe, is more stable average profitability per merchant. No single reseller relationship contributes more than 10% of total bankcard processing volume. On a standalone basis the Priority CPX product would represent the 52nd largest merchant acquirer in the U.S. and among its fastest growing.
Security, Disaster Recovery and Back-up Systems

As a result of normal business operations, we store information relating to our merchants and their transactions. Because this information is considered sensitive in nature, we maintain a high level of security to attempt to protect it. Our computational systems are continually updated and audited to the latest security standards as defined by payment card industry and data security standards ("PCI DSS"), FSOC, and HIPAA audits. As such, we have a dedicated team responsible for security incident response. This team develops, maintains, tests and verifies our incident response plan. The primary function of this team is to react and respond to intrusions, denial of service, data leakage, malware, vandalism, and many other events that could potentially jeopardize data availability, integrity, and confidentiality. This team is responsible for investigating and reporting on all malicious activity in and around our information systems. In addition to handling security incidents, the incident response team continually educates themselves and us on information security matters.

High-availability and disaster recovery are provided through a combination of redundant hardware and software running at two geographically distinct data centers. Each data center deployment is an exact mirror of the other and each can handle all technical, payment, and business operations for all product lines independently of the other. If one site or service becomes impaired, the traffic is redirected to the other automatically. Business Continuity Planning drills are run each quarter to test fail-over and recovery as well as staff operations and readiness.

Third-Party Processors and Sponsor Banks

We partner with various vendors in the payments value chain to process payments for our merchant clients, most notably processors and sponsor banks, which sit between us (the merchant acquirer) and the card networks. Processing is a scale driven business in which many acquirers outsource the processing function to a small number of large processors. In these partnerships, we serve as a merchant acquirer and enters into processing agreements with payment processors, such as First Data or TSYS, to serve as our front-end and back-end transaction processor for which they are paid processing fees. These processors in turn have agreements 
 
with card networks such as Visa and MasterCard, through which the transaction information is routed in exchange for network fees.

To provide processing services, acquirers such as we must be registered with the card networks (e.g. Visa and MasterCard). To register with a card network in the United States, acquirers must maintain relationships with banks willing to sponsor the acquirer's adherence to the rules and standards of the card networks, or a sponsor bank. We maintain sponsor bank relationships with Citizens Bank, Wells Fargo, and Synovus Bank. For ACH payments, the Company's ACH network (ACH.com) is sponsored by Atlantic Capital Bank, MB Financial Bank, and Regions Bank. Sponsor bank relationships enable us to route transactions under the sponsor bank's control and identification number (referred to as a BIN for Visa and ICA for MasterCard) across the card networks (or ACH network) to authorize and clear transactions.

Risk Management

Our thoughtful merchant and reseller underwriting policies combined with our forward-looking transaction management capabilities have enabled us to maintain low credit loss performance. Our risk management strategies are informed by a team with decades of experience managing merchant acquiring risk operations that are augmented by our modern systems designed to manage risk at the transaction level.

Initial Underwriting- Central to our risk management process is our front-line underwriting policies that vet all resellers and merchants prior to their contracting with us. Our automated risk systems pull credit bureau reports, corporate ownership details, as well as anti-money laundering, Office of Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC") and Financial Crimes Enforcement Network ("FinCEN") information from a variety of integrated data bases. This information is put into the hands of a tenured team of underwriters who conduct any necessary industry checks, financial performance analysis or owner back ground checks, consistent with our policies. Based upon these results the underwriting department rejects or approves and sets appropriate merchant and reseller reserve requirements which are held by our bank sponsors on our behalf. Resellers are subject to quarterly and/or annual assessments for financial strength compliance with our policies and adjustments to reserve levels. The results of our initial merchant underwriting inform the transaction level risk limits for volume, average ticket, transaction types and authorization codes among other items that are captured by our CYRIS risk module—a proprietary risk system that monitors and reports transaction risk activity to our risk team. This transaction level risk module, housed within MX Connect, forms the foundational risk management framework that enables the company to optimize transaction activity and processing scale while preserving a modest aggregate risk profile that has resulted in historically low losses.

Real-Time Risk Monitoring- Merchant transactions are monitored on a transactional basis to proactively enforce risk controls. Our risk systems provide automated evaluation of merchant transaction activity against initial underwriting settings. Transactions that are outside underwriting parameters are queued for further investigation. Also, resellers whose merchant portfolio represents a concentration of investigated merchants are evaluated for risk action (i.e., increased reserves or contract termination).

Risk Audit- Transactions flagged by our risk monitoring systems or that demonstrate suspicious activity traits that have been flagged for review can result in funds being held and other risk mitigation actions. These can include non- authorization of the transaction, debit of reserves or even termination of processing agreement. Merchants are periodically reviewed to assess any risk adjustments based upon their overall financial health and compliance with Network standards. Merchant transaction activity is investigated for instances of business activity changes or credit impairment (and improvement).

Loss Mitigation- In instances where particular transactions and/or individual merchants are flagged for fraud, where transaction activity is resulting in excessive charge-backs, several loss mitigation actions may be taken. These include charge-back dispute resolution, merchant and reseller funds (reserves or processed batches) withheld, inclusion on Network Match List to notify the industry of a "bad actor", and even legal action.

We ensure that our risk and underwriting activities are coordinated with our bank sponsors (Wells Fargo, Citizens Bank and Synovus) and authorization and settlement partners (First Data and TSYS).

Acquisitions of Businesses

On June 19, 2015, we entered into a definitive agreement to purchase substantially all merchant acquiring related assets, except those identified as excluded, of American Credit Card Processing Corp., American Credit Card Processing Corp. II, American 
 
Credit Card Processing Corp. III and their affiliates. The total purchase price consideration was approximately $27.6 million, consisting of cash paid and a contingent earnout payment.
During 2018, we consummated the acquisitions of four businesses for total cash consideration of $7.5 million plus shares of our common stock with a fair value of $5.0 million. There is the potential for additional contingent consideration up to $1.5 million.

For more information regarding our acquisitions, see Note 2, Business Combinations, to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Competition

The U.S. acquiring industry is highly competitive, with several large processors accounting for the majority of processing volume; when excluding banks, we ranked 6th among U.S. merchant acquiring as of 2017, according to the December 2017 Nilson Report. When comparing top non-bank U.S. merchant acquirers by volume, Worldpay holds the leadership position followed by Global Payments, First Data and TSYS. While the scale of these companies is large, we believe there is still ample opportunity for companies like us to continue to grow given the vast amount of growth in MasterCard/Visa purchasing volume which increased in 2017 given the utility of card-based payments by U.S. consumers.

The concentration at the top of the industry partly reflects consolidation; however, we believe that consolidation has also resulted in many large processors having multiple, inflexible legacy IT systems that are not well equipped to adjust to changing market requirements. We believe that the large merchant acquirers whose innovation has been hindered by these redundant, legacy systems risk losing market share to acquirers with more agile and dynamic IT systems, such as Priority.
Pricing has historically been the key factor influencing the selection of a merchant acquirer. However, providers with more advanced tech-enabled services (primarily online and integrated offerings) have an advantage over providers operating legacy technology and offering undifferentiated services that have come under pricing pressure from higher levels of competition. High quality customer service further differentiates providers as this helps to reduce attrition. Other competitive factors that set acquirers apart include price, partnerships with financial institutions, servicing capability, data security and functionality. Leading acquirers are expected to continue to add additional services to expand cross-selling opportunities, primarily in omni-channel payment solutions, POS software, payments security, customer loyalty and other payments-related offerings.

The largest opportunity for acquirers to expand is within the small to medium-sized merchant market. According to First Annapolis, there are approximately 7.2 million small to mid-sized merchants generating over $800 billion in credit/debit dollar volume annually, which equates to approximately $6 billion in acquirer net revenue. JP Morgan estimates that small and mid-sized merchants make up 30% to 35% of U.S. bank card purchase volume. Volume per merchant is lower for acquirers with high penetration rates amongst small businesses; however, this is largely offset by the aggregate processing fee potential and market size.

According to the SMB group, a markets insight firm for small and medium-sized businesses, the majority of small (approximately 67%) and medium-sized businesses (approximately 81%) recognize the upside tech-enabled solutions provide to daily operations and long-term growth potential. As small businesses increasingly demand integrated solutions tailored to specific business functions or industries merchant processors are adopting payment enabled software offerings that combine payments with core business operating software. By subsisting within SMB's critical business software processors are able to improve economic results through better merchant retention and often higher processing margins. Through our MX Merchant platform, we are well-positioned to capitalize on the trend towards integrated solutions, new technology adoption and value added-service utilization in the SMB market.

Government Regulation and Payment Network Rules

We operate in an increasingly complex legal and regulatory environment. We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations and the rules and standards of the payment networks that are utilized to provide our electronic payment services, as more fully described below.
Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act")

 
The Dodd-Frank Act, which was signed into law in the United States in 2010, resulted in significant structural and other changes to the regulation of the financial services industry. The Dodd-Frank Act directed the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the "Federal Reserve Board") to regulate the debit interchange transaction fees that a card issuer or payment card network receives or charges for an electronic debit transaction. Pursuant to the so-called "Durbin Amendment" to the Dodd-Frank Act, these fees must be "reasonable and proportional" to the cost incurred by the card issuer in authorizing, clearing and settling the transaction. Pursuant to regulations promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board, debit interchange rates for card issuers with assets of $10 billion or more are capped at $0.21 per transaction and an ad valorem component of 5 basis points to reflect a portion of the issuer's fraud losses plus, for qualifying issuers, an additional $0.01 per transaction in debit interchange for fraud prevention costs. The cap on interchange fees has not had a material direct effect on our results of operations.

In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act limits the ability of payment card networks to impose certain restrictions because it allows merchants to: (i) set minimum dollar amounts (not to exceed $10) for the acceptance of a credit card (and allows federal governmental entities and institutions of higher education to set maximum amounts for the acceptance of credit cards) and (ii) provide discounts or incentives to encourage consumers to pay with cash, checks, debit cards or credit cards.

The rules also contain prohibitions on network exclusivity and merchant routing restrictions that require a card issuer to enable at least two unaffiliated networks on each debit card, prohibit card networks from entering into exclusivity arrangements and restrict the ability of issuers or networks to mandate transaction routing requirements. The prohibition on network exclusivity has not significantly affected our ability to pass on network fees and other costs to our customers, nor do we expect it to in the future.

The Dodd-Frank Act also created the FSOC, which was established to, among other things, identify risks to the stability of the United States financial system. The FSOC has the authority to require supervision and regulation of nonbank financial companies that the FSOC determines pose a systemic risk to the United States financial system. Accordingly, we may be subject to additional systemic risk-related oversight.
Payment Network Rules and Standards

As a merchant acquirer, we are subject to the rules of Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover and other payment networks. In order to provide services, several of our subsidiaries are either registered as service providers for member institutions with MasterCard, Visa and other networks or are direct members of MasterCard, Visa and other networks. Accordingly, we are subject to card association and network rules that could subject us to a variety of fines or penalties that may be levied by the card networks for certain acts or omissions.

Furthermore, payment networks establish their own rules and standards that allocate responsibilities among the payment networks and their participants. These rules and standards, including the PCI DSS, govern a variety of areas including how consumers and merchants may use their cards, data security and allocation of liability for certain acts or omissions including liability in the event of a data breach. The payment networks may change these rules and standards from time to time as they may determine in their sole discretion and with or without advance notice to their participants. These changes may be made for any number of reasons, including as a result of changes in the regulatory environment, to maintain or attract new participants, or to serve the strategic initiatives of the networks and may impose additional costs and expenses on or be disadvantageous to certain participants. Participants are subject to audit by the payment networks to ensure compliance with applicable rules and standards. The networks may fine, penalize or suspend the registration of participants for certain acts or omissions or the failure of the participants to comply with applicable rules and standards.

An example of a standard is EMV, which is mandated by Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover. This mandate sets new requirements and technical standards, including requiring integrated POS systems to be capable of accepting the more secure "chip" cards that utilize the EMV standard and set new rules for data handling and security. Processors and merchants that do not comply with the mandate or do not use systems that are EMV compliant risk fines and liability for fraud-related losses. We have invested significant resources to ensure our systems' compliance with the mandate, and to assist our merchants in becoming compliant by the applicable deadlines.

To provide our electronic payments services, we must be registered either indirectly or directly as service providers with the payment networks that we utilize. Because we are not a bank, we are not eligible for membership in certain payment networks, including Visa and MasterCard, we are therefore unable to directly access these networks. The operating regulations of certain payment networks, including Visa and MasterCard, require us to be sponsored by a member bank as a service provider. We are 
 
registered with certain payment networks, including Visa and MasterCard, through Wells Fargo, Citizens Bank and Synovus Bank. The agreements with our bank sponsors give them substantial discretion in approving certain aspects of our business practices including our solicitation, application and qualification procedures for merchants and the terms of our agreements with merchants. We are registered directly as service providers with Discover, American Express and certain other networks. We are also subject to network operating rules promulgated by NACHA—the Electronic Payments Associations relating to payment transaction processed by us using the Automated Clearing House Network. For ACH payments, our ACH network (ACH.com) is sponsored by Atlantic Capital Bank, MB Financial Bank, and Regions Bank.

Banking Laws and Regulations

The Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (the "FFIEC") is an interagency body comprised of federal bank and credit union regulators such as the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC"), the National Credit Union Administration, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection. The FFIEC examines large data processors in order to identify and mitigate risks associated with systemically significant service providers, including specifically the risks they may pose to the banking industry.
We are considered by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council to be a technology service provider ("TSP") based on the services we provide to financial institutions. As a TSP, we are subject to audits by an interagency group consisting of the Federal Reserve System, FDIC, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.
Privacy and Information Security Laws

We provide services that may be subject to various state, federal and foreign privacy laws and regulations. These laws and regulations include the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, which applies to a broad range of financial institutions and to companies that provide services to financial institutions in the United States, including gaming business. We are also subject to a variety of foreign data protection and privacy laws, including, without limitation, Directive 95/46/EC, as implemented in each member state of the European Union and its successor, the General Data Protection Regulation, which became effective in May 2018. Among other things, these foreign and domestic laws, and their implementing regulations, in certain cases restrict the collection, processing, storage, use and disclosure of personal information, require notice to individuals of privacy practices, and provide individuals with certain rights to prevent use and disclosure of protected information. These laws also impose requirements for safeguarding and removal or elimination of personal information.

Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Regulation

The United States federal anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970, as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (collectively, the "BSA"), and the "BSA" implementing regulations administered by FinCEN, a bureau of the United States Department of the Treasury, require, among other things, each financial institution to: (1) develop and implement a risk-based anti-money laundering program; (2) file reports on large currency transactions; (3) file suspicious activity reports if the financial institution believes a customer may be violating U.S. laws and regulations; and (4) maintain transaction records. Given that a number of our clients are financial institutions that are directly subject to U.S. federal anti-money laundering laws and regulations, we have developed an anti-money laundering compliance program to best assist our clients in meeting such legal and regulatory requirements.

We are subject to certain economic and trade sanctions programs that are administered by OFAC of the United States Department of Treasury, which place prohibitions and restrictions on all U.S. citizens and entities with respect to transactions by U.S. persons with specified countries and individuals and entities identified on OFAC's Specially Designated Nationals list (for example, individuals and companies owned or controlled by, or acting for or on behalf of, countries subject to certain economic and trade sanctions, as well as terrorists, terrorist organizations and narcotics traffickers identified by OFAC under programs that are not country specific). Similar anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing and proceeds of crime laws apply to movements of currency and payments through electronic transactions and to dealings with persons specified on lists maintained by organizations similar to OFAC in several other countries and which may impose specific data retention obligations or prohibitions on intermediaries in the payment process. We have developed and continue to enhance compliance programs and policies to monitor and address such legal and regulatory requirements and developments. We continue to enhance such programs and policies to ensure that our customers do not engage in prohibited transactions with designated countries, individuals or entities.

 
Debt Collection and Credit Reporting Laws

Portions of our business may be subject to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act and similar state laws. These debt collection laws are designed to eliminate abusive, deceptive and unfair debt collection practices and may require licensing at the state level. The Fair Credit Reporting Act regulates the use and reporting of consumer credit information and also imposes disclosure requirements on entities that take adverse action based on information obtained from credit reporting agencies. We have procedures in place to comply with the requirements of these laws.
Unfair or Deceptive Acts or Practices

We and many of our merchants are subject to Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act prohibiting unfair or deceptive acts or practices, or UDAP. In addition, the UDAP and other laws, rules and or regulations, including the Telemarketing Sales Act, may directly impact the activities of certain of our merchants, and in some cases may subject us, as the merchant's payment processor or provider of certain services, to investigations, fees, fines and disgorgement of funds if we were deemed to have aided and abetted or otherwise provided the means and instrumentalities to facilitate the illegal or improper activities of the merchant through our services. Various federal and state regulatory enforcement agencies including the Federal Trade Commission and the states attorneys general have authority to take action against non-banks that engage in UDAP or violate other laws, rules and regulations and to the extent we are processing payments or providing services for a merchant that may be in violation of laws, rules and regulations, we may be subject to enforcement actions and as a result may incur losses and liabilities that may impact our business.
Indirect Regulatory Requirements

A number of our clients are financial institutions that are directly subject to various regulations and compliance obligations issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the "CFPB"), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and other agencies responsible for regulating financial institutions. While these regulatory requirements and compliance obligations do not apply directly to us, many of these requirements materially affect the services we provide to our clients. The banking agencies, including the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, have imposed requirements on regulated financial institutions to manage their third-party service providers. Among other things, these requirements include performing appropriate due diligence when selecting third-party service providers; evaluating the risk management, information security, and information management systems of third-party service providers; imposing contractual protections in agreements with third-party service providers (such as performance measures, audit and remediation rights, indemnification, compliance requirements, confidentiality and information security obligations, insurance requirements, and limits on liability); and conducting ongoing monitoring of the performance of third-party service providers. Accommodating these requirements applicable to our clients imposes additional costs and risks in connection with our financial institution relationships. We expect to expend resources on an ongoing basis in an effort to assist our clients in responding to any regulatory inquiries on behalf of merchants and resellers.
Telephone Consumer Protection Act

We are subject to the Federal Telephone Consumer Protection Act and various state laws to the extent we place telephone calls and short message service ("SMS") messages to clients and consumers. The Telephone Consumer Protection Act regulates certain telephone calls and SMS messages placed using automatic telephone dialing systems or artificial or prerecorded voices.
Other Regulation

We are subject to U.S. federal and state unclaimed or abandoned property (escheat) laws which require us to turn over to certain government authorities the property of others we hold that has been unclaimed for a specified period of time such as account balances that are due to a distribution partner or merchant following discontinuation of our relationship with them. The Housing Assistance Tax Act of 2008 requires certain merchant acquiring entities and third-party settlement organizations to provide information returns for each calendar year with respect to payments made in settlement of electronic payment transactions and third-party payment network transactions occurring in that calendar year. Reportable transactions are also subject to backup withholding requirements.

The foregoing is not an exhaustive list of the laws, rules and regulations to which we are subject to and the regulatory framework governing our business is changing continuously.

 
Intellectual Property

We have developed a payments platform that includes many instances of proprietary software, code sets, work flows and algorithms. It is our practice to enter into confidentiality, non-disclosure, and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and into confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with other third parties, to limit access to, and disclosure and use of, our confidential information and proprietary technology. In addition to these contractual measures, we also rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, registered domain names, and patent rights to help protect the Priority brand and our other intellectual property.
As of December 31, 2018, we had in excess of 30 active trademarks that pertain to company, product names, and logos. We may file patent applications as we innovate through research and development efforts, and to pursue additional patent protection to the extent we deem it beneficial and cost-effective. We also own a number of domain names necessary for business operations and brand protection.
Employees

As of December 31, 2018, we employed 562 employees, of which 516 were employed full-time. None of our employees are represented by a labor union and we have experienced no work stoppages. We consider our employee relations to be good.
