Item 1. | BUSINESS.
--------+----------

General 
 PrimeEnergy Resources Corporation (the Company) was organized in March, 1973, under the laws of the State of Delaware. 
 We are an independent oil and natural gas company engaged in acquiring, developing and producing oil and natural gas. We presently own producing and non-producing properties located primarily in Texas, Oklahoma and West Virginia. All of our oil and gas properties and interests are located in the United States. Through our subsidiaries Prime Operating Company, Eastern Oil Well Service Company and EOWS Midland Company, we act as operator and provide well-servicing support operations for many of the onshore oil and gas wells in which we have an interest, as well as for third parties. We are also active in the acquisition of producing oil and gas properties through joint ventures with industry partners. Our subsidiary, PrimeEnergy Management Corporation (PEMC), acts as the managing general partner of three oil and gas limited partnerships (the Partnerships), and acts as the managing trustee of two asset and income business trusts (the Trusts). 
Exploration, Development and Recent Activities 
 The Companys activities include development and exploratory drilling. Our strategy is to develop the Companys extensive oil and gas reserves primarily through horizontal drilling. This strategy includes targeting reservoirs with high initial production rates and cash flow as well as other reservoirs with lower initial production rates but longer sustained rates and higher expected return on investment. We believe that with todays technology, horizontal development of our reserves provides superior economic results as compared to vertical development, by delivering higher production rates through greater contact and stimulation of a larger volume of reservoir rock while minimizing the surface footprint required to develop those same reserves. 
 Maintaining a strong balance sheet and ample liquidity are key components of our business strategy. For 2019, we will continue our focus on preserving financial flexibility and ample liquidity as we manage the risks facing our industry. Our 2019 capital budget is reflective of current commodity prices and has been established based on an expectation of available cash flows, with any cash flow deficiencies expected to be funded by borrowings under our revolving credit facility. As we have done historically to preserve or enhance liquidity, we may adjust our capital program throughout the year, divest non-strategic assets, or enter into strategic joint ventures. 
 In accordance with SEC rules governing the scheduling of development of proved undeveloped (PUD) reserves, our year-end reserve report includes only the eight PUD locations that at year-end were being drilled or completed. The Company has less than one percent interest in each of these eight wells. Also included in the reserve report are 20 wells that were drilled and completed in 2018, but were not on production at year-end and were therefore designated as shut-in. Of this group, the Company has a 49.5% working interest in eight wells drilled in Upton County, Texas, as part of our West Texas, horizontal development program, plus 10% to 12% working interest in six wells and minor royalty interest in an additional six wells, all of which were drilled in our Scoop-Stack development program in Oklahoma. 
 Since the start of our West Texas horizontal drilling program in 2015 and through the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company has participated in 67 horizontal wells in the Permian Basin: 56 of these were completed and 
 
4 


  producing by year-end 2018, and eight more are expected to be on-line by the end of the first quarter of 2019, and three will be put on production in the second quarter of 2019. Of the total 67 horizontal wells in this program, the Company has an average of 28.19% interest in 52 wells, and less than one percent interest in 15 wells. Of the 11 wells to be brought on production in 2019, the Company has 49% interest in 8 wells that are one-mile in length, as well as 46% interest in two wells and 5.3% interest in one well that are each two-miles in length. Through completion and first date of production we expect to have invested $32.2 million in these 11 wells, including production facilities. 
 In Upton County, West Texas, we are developing a contiguous 3,900 acre block with our joint venture partner, Apache Corporation. In this block the Company has 2,600 leasehold acres with interest between 14% and 56%, depending on the formation or depth being developed. In 2018, three horizontals were drilled, completed and brought on-line in this joint venture. An additional eight wells with one-mile long laterals in the Wolfcamp B were participated in for 49% interest and have been brought on production in February, 2019. Apache Corporation has indicated a desire to continue PAD drilling of this acreage in reservoirs above the Middle Wolfcamp that, as described below, are currently being tested in a nearby acreage block. If favorable results of these offset wells occur it is likely to spur the drilling of as many as 96 additional horizontal wells in the near future in this 3,900 acre block. The cost of such development would be approximately $748 million with the Companys share being approximately $284 million. The actual number of wells that will be drilled, the cost, and the timing of drilling will vary based upon many factors, including commodity market conditions. 
 Also in Upton County, Texas, the Company is developing a separate 1,310 acre block, with Apache Corporation as the operator. In the 4th quarter of 2018 three new horizontal wells, that were designated as probable, were drilled targeting pay intervals above the Middle Wolfcamp: one in the Wolfcamp A, one in the Jo Mill and one in the Lower Spraberry. These wells are expected to be placed into production in the second quarter of 2019 and will be important tests of the economic viability of these reservoirs for our acreage. Prime holds between 5% and 48% working interest in various depths of this acreage and our share of these three wells will be approximately $8.9 million. If favorable results are achieved from these three wells, an additional 21 locations are likely to be drilled in the near future at a gross cost of approximately $182 million with the Companys share being approximately $60 million. 
 In Martin County, Texas we are developing a 965 acre block with Concho Resources. In 2016, two horizontal wells were drilled and completed and two additional horizontals were drilled and brought on-line in 2017. The Company owns 35% to 38% interest in this joint venture acreage where Concho Resources is the operator. No near-term additional drilling plans have been received from Concho Resources, however, offset operators have been actively drilling and their results appear encouraging for the future development of multiple landing zones within this acreage block. 
 The fast pace of drilling in West Texas has subsided somewhat in the first quarter of 2019 due to lower NYMEX crude prices as well as a pipeline bottleneck that has constrained deliveries of West Texas crude to Cushing, Oklahoma. This bottle-neck has resulted in a greater price spread for West Texas Intermediate crude flowing to Cushing, Oklahoma. As additional pipeline capacity is completed in 2019 and early 2020, that spread is expected to narrow and drilling activity is expected to rebound. 
 In our Oklahoma Scoop-Stack horizontal development program, which began in 2012, the Company has participated in 45 horizontal wells for approximately $35 million through the fourth quarter of 2018 with an average interest of 13.8 %. Over this same time period, the Company chose to retain an overriding royalty interest in 51 other horizontal wells. In the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company participated for less than one percent interest in the drilling of four new wells at a net cost of $309,500. All of these are expected to be placed on-line in the first quarter of 2019. Our horizontal activity in Oklahoma is focused in Canadian, Grady, Kingfisher and Garvin counties where we have approximately 2,215 net acres. We believe this acreage has significant additional resource potential that could support the drilling of as many as 161 new horizontal wells based on an estimate of four to ten wells per section, depending on the reservoir target area, with our share of the capital expenditure being approximately $82 million at an average 10% ownership level.

 In 2018, in the Gulf Coast region of Texas, Unit Petroleum drilled and completed two successful wells and recompleted a third well in the Wilcox Formation of the Jazz field in Polk County. The Company has a 3.87% overriding royalty interest in both of the newly drilled wells and a 2.8125% working interest and 3.769% revenue interest in the recompleted well. The Companys share of the recompletion expense was approximately $100,000. In addition, the Company successfully recompleted a shallow well in the Segno field of Polk County, Texas with a 72.5% working interest and a net expense of approximately $43,000. 
 Significant 2018 Activity 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had net capitalized costs related to proved oil and gas properties of $224 million. Total expenditures for the acquisition, exploration and development of our properties during 2018 were $46 million as we continue development under the programs discussed above. Proved reserves as of December 31, 2018, were 12.665 MMBOE which consisted of 99.7% proved developed reserves. 
 During 2018, we participated in a total of 28 gross (6.1 net) wells that were drilled and completed, 14 of these were producing at year-end, while the remaining 14 wells were shut-in at year-end and are all expected to be on production in the first quarter of 2019. Of the 28 total wells completed, 15 are in our West Texas horizontal drilling program, and 13 are in our Oklahoma Scoop-Stack horizontal development program. 
 In 2018, the Company sold or farmed-out leasehold rights through several transactions, receiving gross proceeds of approximately $3.1 million in exchange for leasehold interest in Oklahoma, Kansas, Colorado, Texas and Wyoming. This includes the sale of 1,808 net acres and 20 wells in Garfield County, Oklahoma, and 5,005 net acres along with 54 wells, in Yuma County, Colorado and Cheyenne County, Kansas. 
 In 2018, the Company acquired approximately 464 net acres and 16.6% to 33.4% working interest in 51 oil and gas wells and one commercial salt water disposal well, for a total cost of $6,080,000. This acreage and group of wells are operated by the Company and located in Reagan County, Texas, where future horizontal drilling will likely occur. 
 We believe that our diversified portfolio approach to our drilling activities produces more consistent and predictable economic results than would otherwise be experienced with a less diversified or higher risk drilling program profile. 
 We attempt to assume the position of operator in all acquisitions of producing properties. We will continue to evaluate prospects for leasehold acquisitions and for exploration and development operations in areas in which we own interests and are actively pursuing the acquisition of producing properties. In order to diversify and broaden our asset base, we will consider acquiring the assets or stock in other entities and companies in the oil and gas business. Our main objective in making any such acquisitions will be to acquire income producing assets so as to increase our net worth and increase our oil and gas reserve base. 
 We presently own producing and non-producing properties located primarily in Texas, Oklahoma, and West Virginia, and we own a substantial amount of well servicing equipment. 
 We do not own any refinery or marketing facilities, and do not currently own or lease any bulk storage facilities or pipelines other than adjacent to and used in connection with producing wells and the interests in certain gas gathering systems. All of our oil and gas properties and interests are located in the United States. 
 In the past, the supply of gas has exceeded demand on a cyclical basis, and we are subject to a combination of shut-in and/or reduced takes of gas production during summer months. Prolonged shut-ins could result in reduced field operating income from properties in which we act as operator. 
 Exploration for oil and gas requires substantial expenditures particularly in exploratory drilling in undeveloped areas, or wildcat drilling. As is customary in the oil and gas industry, substantially all of our 
 
6 


  exploration and development activities are conducted through joint drilling and operating agreements with others engaged in the oil and gas business. 
 Summaries of our oil and gas drilling activities, oil and gas production, and undeveloped leasehold, mineral, and royalty interests are set forth under Item 2., Properties, below. Summaries of our oil and gas reserves, future net revenue and present value of future net revenue are also set forth under Item 2., PropertiesReserves, below. 
 Well Operations 
 Our operations are conducted through our principal offices in Houston, Texas, and district offices in Houston and Midland, Texas, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and Charleston, West Virginia. We currently operate 1,368 wells, including producing, saltwater disposal, injection, and supply wells: 220 through the Houston office, 361 through the Midland office, 310 through the Oklahoma City office and 477 through the Charleston, West Virginia office. Substantially all of the wells we operate are wells in which we have an interest. 
 We operate wells pursuant to operating agreements which govern the relationship between us, as operator, and the other owners of working interests in the properties, including the Partnerships, Trusts and joint venture participants. For each operated well, we receive monthly fees that are competitive in the areas of operations and we also are reimbursed for expenses incurred in connection with well operations. 
 The Partnerships, Trusts and Joint Ventures 
 Since 1975, PEMC has acted as managing general partner of various partnerships, trusts and joint ventures. 
 PEMC, as managing general partner of the Partnerships and managing trustee of the Trusts, is responsible for all Partnership and Trust activities, the drilling of development wells and the production and sale of oil and gas from productive wells. PEMC also provides administration, accounting and tax preparation for the Partnerships and Trusts from our offices in Houston, Texas. PEMC is liable for all debts and liabilities of the Partnerships and Trusts, to the extent that the assets of a given limited partnership or trust are not sufficient to satisfy its obligations. We stopped sponsoring partnerships and trusts in 1992. In 2018, we liquidated three of those partnerships, and today there are only 3 partnerships and 2 trusts remaining. The aggregate number of limited partners in the Partnerships and beneficial owners of the Trusts now administered by PEMC is approximately 225. 
Regulation 
 Regulation of the Oil and Natural Gas Industry 
 Our operations are substantially affected by federal, state and local laws and regulations. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations can result in substantial penalties. The regulatory burden on the industry increases the cost of doing business and affects profitability. Although we believe we are in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, such laws and regulations are frequently amended or reinterpreted. Therefore, we are unable to predict the future costs or impact of compliance. Additional proposals and proceedings that affect the oil and natural gas industry are regularly considered by the United States Congress (Congress), state governments, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (the FERC) and other federal and state regulatory agencies and federal, state and local courts. We cannot predict when or whether any such proposals may become effective. We do not believe that such action or proposal would have a material disproportionate effect on us as compared to similarly situated competitors. 
Regulation Affecting Production 
 As described above, natural gas production and related operations are, or have been, subject to price controls, taxes and numerous other laws and regulations. In addition, all of the jurisdictions in which we own or 
 
7 


  operate producing oil and natural gas properties have statutory provisions regulating the exploration for and production of oil and natural gas, including provisions related to permits for the drilling of wells, bonding requirements to drill or operate wells, the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled, sourcing and disposal of water used in the drilling and completion process and the abandonment of wells. Our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations. These include the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units, the number of wells that may be drilled in an area and the unitization or pooling of crude oil or natural gas wells, as well as regulations that generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose certain requirements regarding the ratability or fair apportionment of production from fields and individual wells. These laws and regulations may limit the number of oil and natural gas wells we can drill. Moreover, each state generally imposes a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil, natural gas and NGLs within its jurisdiction. States do not regulate wellhead prices or engage in other similar direct regulation, but there can be no assurance that they will not do so in the future. The effect of such future regulations may be to limit the amounts of oil and natural gas that may be produced from our wells, negatively affect the economics of production from these wells or limit the number of locations we can drill. 
 The failure to comply with the rules and regulations of oil and natural gas production and related operations can result in substantial penalties. Our competitors in the oil and natural gas industry are subject to the same regulatory requirements and restrictions that affect our operations. 
 Regulation of transportation and sale of gas. 
 The availability, terms and cost of transportation significantly affect sales of gas. Federal and state regulations govern the price and terms for access to gas pipeline transportation. Intrastate gas pipeline transportation activities are subject to various state laws and regulations, as well as orders of state regulatory bodies. The interstate transportation and sale of gas is subject to federal regulation, including regulation of the terms, conditions and rates for interstate transportation, storage and various other matters, primarily by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). FERC endeavors to make gas transportation more accessible to gas buyers and sellers on an open-access and non-discriminatory basis. 
 Pursuant to the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct 2005) it is unlawful for any entity, such as the Company, to use any deceptive or manipulative device or contrivance in connection with the purchase or sale of gas or transportation services subject to regulation by FERC, in contravention of rules prescribed by FERC. The EPAct 2005 also gives FERC authority to impose civil penalties of up to $1 million per day, subject to annual inflation adjustment, for each violation of the Natural Gas Act (NGA), the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 and related regulations. 
 Under FERC Order 704, which regulates annual gas transaction reporting requirements, any market participant, including a producer such as the Company, that engages in wholesale sales or purchases of gas that equal or exceed 2.2 million MMBtus of physical gas in the previous calendar year must annually report such sales and purchases to FERC on Form No. 552 by May 1 of the year following the calendar year when such sales and purchases occurred. Form No. 552 contains aggregate volumes of wholesale gas purchased or sold in the prior calendar year to the extent such transactions utilize, contribute to or may contribute to the formation of price indices. Order 704 is intended to increase the transparency of the wholesale gas markets and to assist FERC in monitoring those markets and in detecting market manipulation. 
 Intrastate gas pipeline transportation rates are subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions. The basis for intrastate gas pipeline regulation, and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate gas pipeline rates, vary from state to state. Additional proposals and proceedings that might affect the gas industry are considered from time to time by the U.S. Congress, FERC, state legislatures, state regulatory bodies and the courts. The Company cannot predict when or if any such proposals might become effective or their effect, if any, on its operations. The Company believes that the regulation of intrastate gas pipeline transportation 
 
8 


  rates will not affect its operations in any way that is materially different from the effects on its similarly situated competitors. 
 Regulation of transportation and sale of oil and NGL 
 Intrastate liquids pipeline transportation rates, terms and conditions are subject to regulation by numerous federal, state and local authorities and, in a number of instances, the ability to transport and sell such products on interstate pipelines is dependent on pipelines that are also subject to FERC jurisdiction under the Interstate Commerce Act (the ICA). The Company does not believe these regulations affect it any differently than other producers. 
 The ICA requires that pipelines maintain a tariff on file with the FERC. The tariff sets forth the established rates as well as the rules and regulations governing the service. The ICA requires, among other things, that rates and terms and conditions of service on interstate common carrier pipelines be just and reasonable. Such pipelines must also provide jurisdictional service in a manner that is not unduly discriminatory or unduly preferential. Shippers have the power to challenge new and existing rates and terms and conditions of service before the FERC. 
 Rates of interstate liquids pipelines are currently regulated by the FERC, primarily through an annual indexing methodology, under which pipelines increase or decrease their rates in accordance with an index adjustment specified by the FERC. For the five-year period beginning in July 2016, the FERC established an annual index adjustment equal to the change in the producer price index for finished goods plus 1.23 percent. This adjustment is subject to review every five years. Under the FERCs regulations, a liquids pipeline can request a rate increase that exceeds the rate obtained through application of the indexing methodology by using a cost-of-service approach, but only after the pipeline establishes that a substantial divergence exists between the actual costs experienced by the pipeline and the rates resulting from application of the indexing methodology. Increases in liquids transportation rates may result in lower revenue and cash flows for the Company. 
 In addition, due to common carrier regulatory obligations of liquids pipelines, capacity must be prorated among shippers in an equitable manner in the event there are nominations in excess of capacity by current shippers or capacity requests are received from a new shipper. Therefore, new shippers or increased volume by existing shippers may reduce the capacity available to the Company. Any prolonged interruption in the operation or curtailment of available capacity of the pipelines that the Company relies upon for liquids transportation could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. However, the Company believes that access to liquids pipeline transportation services generally will be available to it to the same extent, if not better given the Companys firm transportation contracts, as to its similarly situated competitors. 
 In November 2009, the Federal Trade Commission (the FTC) issued regulations pursuant to the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 intended to prohibit market manipulation in the petroleum industry. Violators of the regulations face civil penalties of up to $1 million per violation per day, subject to annual inflation adjustment. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the CFTC) has also issued anti-manipulation rules that subject violators to a civil penalty of up to the greater of $1 million per violation, subject to annual inflation adjustment, or triple the monetary gain to the person for each violation. 
 Regulation of Environmental and Occupational Safety and Health Matters 
 Our operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations governing environmental protection as well as the discharge of materials into the environment and occupational health and safety. These laws and regulations may, among other things: (i) require the acquisition of permits to conduct exploration, drilling and production operations; (ii) restrict the types, quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment or injected into formations in connection with oil and 
 
9 


  natural gas drilling and production activities; (iii) limit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas; (iv) require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former and ongoing operations, such as requirements to close pits and plug abandoned wells; and (v) impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from drilling and production operations. Any failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of corrective or remedial obligations and the issuance of orders enjoining performance of some or all of our operations. 
 These laws and regulations may also restrict the rate of oil and natural gas production below the rate that would otherwise be possible. The regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases the cost of doing business in the industry and consequently affects profitability. Additionally, Congress and federal and state agencies frequently revise environmental laws and regulations and any changes that result in more stringent and costly waste handling, disposal and cleanup requirements for the oil and natural gas industry could have a significant impact on our operating costs. 
 The clear trend in environmental regulation has been to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment and thus any changes in environmental laws and regulations or re-interpretation of enforcement policies that result in more stringent and costly waste handling, storage, transportation, disposal, or remediation requirements could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. We may be unable to pass on such increased compliance costs to our purchasers. Moreover, accidental releases or spills may occur in the course of our operations and we cannot assure you that we will not incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of such releases or spills, including any third-party claims for damage to property, natural resources or persons. While compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our operations to date, we can provide no assurance that this will continue in the future. 
 The following is a summary of the more significant existing and proposed environmental, occupational health and safety laws and regulations to which our business operations are or may be subject to and for which compliance may have a material adverse impact on our capital expenditures, results of operations or financial position. 
 The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act 
 The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), and comparable state statutes, regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. Pursuant to rules issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the EPA), individual state governments administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more stringent requirements. Drilling fluids, produced waters and most of the other wastes associated with the exploration, development and production of crude oil or natural gas are currently regulated under RCRAs non-hazardous waste provisions. However, it is possible that certain oil and natural gas drilling and production wastes now classified as non-hazardous could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future. For example, in December 2016, the EPA and environmental groups entered into a consent decree to address the EPAs alleged failure to timely assess its RCRA Subtitle D criteria regulations exempting certain exploration and production related oil and natural gas wastes from regulation as hazardous wastes under RCRA. The consent decree requires the EPA to propose a rulemaking no later than March 15, 2019 for revision of certain Subtitle D criteria regulations pertaining to oil and natural gas wastes or to sign a determination that revision of the regulations is not necessary. EPA action in response to the consent decree remains pending. Removal of RCRAs exemption for exploration and production wastes has the potential to significantly increase our waste disposal costs to manage, which in turn will result in increased operating costs and could adversely impact our results of operations and financial position. Also, in the course of our operations, we generate some amounts of ordinary industrial wastes, such as paint wastes, waste solvents and waste oils that may be regulated as hazardous wastes if such wastes have hazardous characteristics. 
 
10 


 Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act 
 The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), also known as the Superfund law, imposes joint and several liability, without regard to fault or legality of conduct, on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include the current and former owners and operators of the site where the release occurred and anyone who disposed or arranged for the disposal of a hazardous substance released at the site. Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third-parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. 
 We generate materials in the course of our operations that may be regulated as hazardous substances. Despite the petroleum exclusion of CERCLA, which currently encompasses natural gas, we may nonetheless handle hazardous substances within the meaning of CERCLA, or similar state statutes, in the course of our ordinary operations and, as a result, may be jointly and severally liable under CERCLA for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which these hazardous substances have been released into the environment. In addition, we currently own, lease, or operate numerous properties that have been used for oil and natural gas exploration, production and processing for many years. Although we believe that we have utilized operating and waste disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hazardous substances, wastes, or hydrocarbons may have been released on, under or from the properties owned or leased by us, or on, under or from other locations, including off-site locations, where such substances have been taken for disposal. In addition, some of our properties have been operated by third parties or by previous owners or operators whose treatment and disposal of hazardous substances, wastes, or hydrocarbons was not under our control. These properties and the substances disposed or released on, under or from them may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state and local laws. Under such laws, we could be required to undertake investigatory, response, or corrective measures, which could include soil and groundwater sampling, the removal of previously disposed substances and wastes, the cleanup of contaminated property, or remedial plugging or pit closure operations to prevent future contamination, the costs of which could be substantial. 
 Water Discharges 
 The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, or the Clean Water Act (the CWA), and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of oil and other substances, into waters of the United States. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters, including wetland areas, is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (the USACE) or an analogous state agency. In September 2015, the EPA and the USACE issued a final rule redefining the scope of the EPAs and the USACEs jurisdiction under the CWA with respect to certain types of waterbodies and classifying these waterbodies as regulated wetlands (the WOTUS rule). Several legal challenges to the rule followed, along with attempts to stay implementation of the WOTUS rule following the change in U.S. presidential administrations. Currently, the WOTUS rule is active in 22 states and enjoined in 28 states. However, in December 2018, the EPA and the USACE proposed changes to regulations under the CWA that would provide discrete categories of jurisdictional waters and tests for determining whether a particular waterbody meets any of those classifications. Several groups have already announced their intent to challenge the proposed WOTUS replacement rule. Therefore, the scope of jurisdiction under the CWA is uncertain at this time. To the extent the original WOTUS rule or any replacement rule expands the scope of the CWAs jurisdiction, we could face increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for dredge and fill activities in wetland areas. In addition, federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the CWA and analogous state laws and regulations. We do not expect the costs to comply with the requirements of the CWA to have a material adverse effect on our operations. 
 
11 


 The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 amends the CWA and establishes strict liability for owners and operators of facilities that cause a release of oil into waters of the United States. In addition, this law requires owners and operators of facilities that store oil above specified threshold amounts to develop and implement spill prevention, control and countermeasures plans. 
 Safe Drinking Water Act and Saltwater Disposal Wells 
 In the course of our operations, we produce water in addition to oil and natural gas. Water that is not recycled or otherwise disposed of on the lease may be sent to saltwater disposal wells for injection into subsurface formations. Underground injection operations are regulated under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act and permitting and enforcement authority may be delegated to state governments. In Texas, the Texas Railroad Commission (RRC) regulates the disposal of produced water by injection well. The RRC requires operators to obtain a permit from the agency for the operation of saltwater disposal wells and establishes minimum standards for injection well operations. In response to recent seismic events near underground injection wells used for the disposal of oil and natural gas-related waste waters, federal and some state agencies have begun investigating whether such wells have caused increased seismic activity, and some states have shut down or placed volumetric injection limits on existing wells or imposed moratoria on the use of such injection wells. In response to concerns related to induced seismicity, regulators in some states have already adopted or are considering additional requirements related to seismic safety. For example, the RRC has adopted rules for injection wells to address these seismic activity concerns in Texas. Among other things, the rules require companies seeking permits for disposal wells to provide seismic activity data in permit applications, provide for more frequent monitoring and reporting for certain wells and allow the RRC to modify, suspend, or terminate permits on grounds that a disposal well is likely to be, or determined to be, causing seismic activity. More stringent regulation of injection wells could lead to reduced construction or the capacity of such wells, which could in turn impact the availability of injection wells for disposal of wastewater from our operations. Increased costs associated with the transportation and disposal of produced water, including the cost of complying with regulations concerning produced water disposal, may reduce our profitability. The costs associated with the disposal of proposed water are commonly incurred by all oil and natural gas producers, however, and we do not believe that these costs will have a material adverse effect on our operations. 
Air Emissions 
 The federal Clean Air Act and comparable state laws restrict the emission of air pollutants from many sources, such as tank batteries and compressor stations, through air emissions standards, construction and operating permitting programs and the imposition of other compliance requirements. These laws and regulations may require us to obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with stringent air permit requirements or utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions of certain pollutants. Over the next several years, we may be required to incur certain capital expenditures for air pollution control equipment or other air emissions related issues. For example, in October 2015, the EPA lowered the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for ozone from 75 to 70 parts per billion. The EPA approved final attainment/nonattainment designations with the new ozone standards in July 2018 and currently all of the areas in which we operate are in attainment with such standards. However, state implementation of these revised air quality standards or a change in the attainment status of the areas in which we operate could result in stricter permitting requirements, delay or prohibit our ability to obtain such permits and result in increased expenditures for pollution control equipment, the costs of which could be significant. Separately, in June 2016, the EPA finalized a rule regarding criteria for aggregating multiple small surface sites into a single source for air-quality permitting purposes applicable to the oil and natural gas industry. This rule could cause small facilities, on an aggregate basis, to be deemed a major source, thereby triggering more stringent air permitting requirements, which in turn could result in operational delays or require us to install costly pollution control equipment. The EPA has also adopted new rules under the Clean Air Act that require the reduction of volatile organic compound emissions from certain fractured and refractured natural gas wells for which well completion operations are conducted and further require that most

  wells use reduced emission completions, also known as green completions. These regulations also establish specific new requirements regarding emissions from production-related wet seal and reciprocating compressors and from pneumatic controllers and storage vessels. The EPA expanded on its emission standards for volatile organic compounds in June 2016 with the issuance of first-time standards, known as Subpart OOOOa, to address emissions of methane from equipment and processes across the oil and natural gas source category, including hydraulically fractured oil and natural gas well completions. Following the change in presidential administration, there have been attempts to modify these regulations, and litigation concerning the regulations is ongoing. As a result of these developments, substantial uncertainty exists with respect to implementation of the EPAs 2016 methane rule. However, given the long-term trend toward increasing regulation, future federal methane regulation of the oil and gas industry remains a possibility, and several states have separately imposed their own regulations on methane emissions from oil and gas production activities. These and other air pollution control and permitting requirements have the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects and increase our costs of development and production, which costs could be significant. We do not believe that compliance with such requirements, however, will have a material adverse effect on our operations. 
 Regulation of Greenhouse Gas Emissions 
 In response to findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases (GHGs) endanger public health and the environment, the EPA has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the Clean Air Act that, among other things, establish Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD), construction and Title V operating permit reviews for certain large stationary sources. Facilities required to obtain PSD permits for their GHG emissions also will be required to meet best available control technology standards for these emissions. EPA rulemakings related to GHG emissions could adversely affect our operations and restrict or delay our ability to obtain air permits for new or modified sources. In addition, the EPA has adopted rules requiring the annual reporting of GHG emissions from certain petroleum and natural gas system sources in the U.S., including, among others, onshore and offshore production facilities, which include certain of our operations. Also, as noted above, the EPA has promulgated a New Source Performance Standard related to methane emissions from the oil and natural gas source category. 
 While Congress has considered legislation related to the reduction of GHG emissions in the past, no significant legislation to reduce GHG emissions has been adopted at the federal level. In the absence of Congressional action, a number of state and regional GHG restrictions have emerged. At the international level, the United States joined the international community at the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France. The Paris Agreement entered into force in November 2016. Although this agreement does not create any binding obligations for nations to limit their GHG emissions, it does include pledges from participating nations to voluntarily limit or reduce future emissions. In June 2017, President Trump stated that the United States would withdraw from the Paris Agreement, but may enter into a future international agreement related to GHGs. The Paris Agreement provides for a four-year exit process beginning when it took effect in November 2016, which would result in an effective exit date of November 2020. The United States adherence to the exit process is uncertain, and the terms on which the United States may reenter the Paris Agreement or a separately negotiated agreement are unclear at this time. Although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address GHG emissions would impact our business, any such future laws and regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting emissions of GHGs from, our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of GHGs associated with our operations. 
 Substantial limitations on GHG emissions could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas we produce and lower the value of our reserves. Notwithstanding potential risks related to climate change, the International Energy Agency estimates that global energy demand will continue to represent a major share of global energy use through 2040, and other private sector studies project continued growth in demand for the next two decades. However, recent activism directed at shifting funding away from companies with energy-related assets could result in limitations or restrictions on certain sources of funding for the energy sector. Finally, it

  should also be noted that many scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earths atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods, droughts and other climatic events; if any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 Hydraulic Fracturing Activities 
 Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand or alternative proppant and chemicals under pressure into target geological formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. We regularly use hydraulic fracturing as part of our operations. Recently, there has been increased public concern regarding an alleged potential for hydraulic fracturing to adversely affect drinking water supplies, resulting in new legislative and regulatory initiatives that seek to increase the regulatory burden imposed on hydraulic fracturing. 
 At the federal level, the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority pursuant to the Safe Drinking Water Act over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel fuels and published permitting guidance in February 2014 addressing the performance of such activities. Further, the EPA finalized regulations under the CWA in June 2016 that prohibit wastewater discharges from hydraulic fracturing and certain other natural gas operations to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants. Also, in December 2016, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources. The final report concluded that water cycle activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources under certain limited circumstances. 
 At the state level, several states have adopted or are considering legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, disclosure and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. For example in May 2013, the RRC adopted new rules governing well casing, cementing and other standards for ensuring that hydraulic fracturing operations do not contaminate nearby water resources. Local governments also may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of, or prohibiting, drilling or hydraulic fracturing activities. We believe that we follow applicable standard industry practices and legal requirements for groundwater protection in our hydraulic fracturing activities. Nonetheless, if new or more stringent federal, state, or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we operate, we may be required to incur significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development or production activities and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells. 
 If new federal, state or local laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted, such legal requirements could result in delays, eliminate certain drilling and injection activities and make it more difficult or costly to perform fracturing. Any such regulations limiting or prohibiting hydraulic fracturing could reduce oil and natural gas exploration and production activities and, therefore, adversely affect our business. Such laws or regulations could also materially increase our costs of compliance and doing business by more strictly regulating how hydraulic fracturing wastes are handled or disposed. 
 Endangered Species Act and Migratory Birds 
 The federal Endangered Species Act (ESA) and (in some cases) comparable state laws were established to protect endangered and threatened species. Pursuant to the ESA, if a species is listed as threatened or endangered, restrictions may be imposed on activities adversely affecting that species habitat. We may conduct operations on oil and natural gas leases in areas where certain species that are listed as threatened or endangered are known to exist and where other species, such as the sage grouse, that potentially could be listed as threatened or endangered under the ESA may exist. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (the FWS) may designate critical habitat and suitable habitat areas that it believes are necessary for the survival of a threatened or endangered 
 
14 


  species. A critical habitat or suitable habitat designation could result in further material restrictions to federal land use and may materially delay or prohibit land access for oil and natural gas development. Moreover, as a result of a 2011 settlement agreement, the FWS was required to make a determination on listing of more than 250 species as endangered or threatened under the FSA by no later than completion of the agencys 2017 fiscal year. The FWS missed the deadline but reportedly continues to review new species for protected status under the ESA pursuant to the settlement agreement. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Recently, there have been renewed calls to review protections currently in place for the dunes sagebrush lizard, whose habitat includes portions of the Permian Basin, and to reconsider listing the species under the ESA. The designation as threatened or endangered of previously unprotected species in areas where we operate could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations on our development and production activities that could have a material adverse impact on our ability to develop and produce our reserves. If we were to have a portion of our leases designated as critical or suitable habitat, it could adversely impact the value of our leases. 
 OSHA 
 We are subject to the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and comparable state statutes whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard, the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act and comparable state statutes and any implementing regulations require that we organize and/or disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local governmental authorities and citizens. 
Related Permits and Authorizations 
 Many environmental laws require us to obtain permits or other authorizations from state and/or federal agencies before initiating certain drilling, construction, production, operation, or other oil and natural gas activities and to maintain these permits and compliance with their requirements for on-going operations. These permits are generally subject to protest, appeal, or litigation, which, in certain cases, can delay or halt projects and cease production or operation of wells, pipelines and other operations. 
Related Insurance 
 We maintain insurance against some risks associated with above or underground contamination that may occur as a result of our exploration and production activities. However, this insurance is limited to activities at the well site, and there can be no assurance that this insurance will continue to be commercially available or that this insurance will be available at premium levels that justify its purchase by us. The occurrence of a significant event that is not fully insured or indemnified against could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations. 
 Although we have not experienced any material adverse effect from compliance with environmental requirements, there is no assurance that this will continue. We did not have any material capital or other non-recurring expenditures in connection with complying with environmental laws or environmental remediation matters in 2018, nor do we anticipate that such expenditures will be material in 2019. 
 Competition and Markets 
 The business of acquiring producing properties and non-producing leases suitable for exploration and development is highly competitive. Our competition, in our efforts to acquire both producing and non-producing properties, include oil and gas companies, independent concerns, income programs and individual producers and operators, many of which have financial resources, staffs and facilities substantially greater than those available to us. Furthermore, domestic producers of oil and gas must not only compete with each other in marketing their 
 
15 


  output, but must also compete with producers of imported oil and gas and alternative energy sources such as coal, nuclear power and hydroelectric power. Competition among petroleum companies for favorable oil and gas properties and leases can be expected to increase. 
 The availability of a ready market for any oil and gas produced by us at acceptable prices per unit of production will depend upon numerous factors beyond our control, including the extent of domestic production and importation of oil and gas, the proximity of our producing properties to gas pipelines and the availability and capacity of such pipelines, the marketing of other competitive fuels, fluctuation in demand, governmental regulation of production, refining, transportation and sales, general national and worldwide economic conditions, and use and allocation of oil and gas and their substitute fuels. There is no assurance that we will be able to market all of the oil or gas produced by us or that favorable prices can be obtained for the oil and gas production. 
 Major Customers 
 The Company sells its oil and gas production to a number of direct purchasers under direct contracts or through other operators under joint operating agreements. Listed below are the percent of the Companys total oil and gas sales made which represented more than 10% of the Companys oil and gas sales in the year 2018. 

Oil Purchasers: | | 
Apache Corporation | 50.9 | %
Plains All American Inc. | 17.8 | %
Gas Purchasers: | | 
Apache Corporation | 35.6 | %
Targa Pipeline Mid-Continent West Tex, LLC | 21.4 | %

 Although there are no long-term purchasing agreements with these purchasers, we believe that they will continue to purchase our oil and gas products and, if not, could be readily replaced by other purchasers. 
 Employees 
 At March 20, 2019, we had 156 full-time employees, 28 of whom were employed at our principal offices in Houston, Texas, at the offices of Prime Operating Company, Eastern Oil Well Service Company and EOWS Midland Company, and 128 employees who were primarily involved in our district operations in Midland, Texas, Elmore City and Oklahoma City, Oklahoma and Charleston, West Virginia.
