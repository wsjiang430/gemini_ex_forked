 Item 1. Business.
 Xometry, Inc. (Xometry, the “Company”, “our”, “we”) is a global online marketplace connecting buyers with suppliers of manufacturing services, transforming one of the largest industries in the world. We use our proprietary technology to create a marketplace that enables buyers to efficiently source manufactured parts and assemblies, and empower suppliers of manufacturing services to grow their businesses.
Our AI-enabled technology platform is powered by proprietary machine learning algorithms and a dataset, resulting in a sophisticated marketplace for manufacturing. As a result, buyers can procure the products they want on demand and suppliers can source new manufacturing opportunities that match their specific processes and capacity. Interactions on our platform provide rich data insights that allow us to continuously improve our AI models and innovate new products and services, fueling powerful network effects as we scale.
We define “buyers” as individuals who have placed an order to purchase parts or assemblies on our platform. Our buyers include engineers, product designers, procurement and supply chain personnel, inventors and business owners from businesses of a variety of sizes, ranging from self-funded start-ups to Fortune 100 companies. We define “accounts” as an individual entity, such as a sole proprietor with a single buyer or corporate entities with multiple buyers, having purchased at least one part on our marketplace. We define “suppliers” as individuals or businesses that have been approved by us to either manufacture a product on our platform for a buyer or have utilized our supplier services, including our digital marketing services, data services, financial services or supplies.
Manufacturing is one of the largest industries globally and is in the early stages of digitization. Buyers looking to source manufacturing processes are faced with a highly fragmented and regionalized base of suppliers that are prone to supply chain disruptions and are difficult to efficiently manage. Opaque pricing structures, long lead times and a lack of quality controls contribute to a procurement process that is inefficient, unpredictable and unreliable. Conversely, suppliers of specialized manufacturing services are faced with limited ability to source customers, inconsistent demand, volatile operating costs and resource constraints that put their businesses under significant financial pressure. For supply chains around the world to become more reliable and resilient, buyers and suppliers need a more efficient, agile way to transact.
 We enable buyers across industries to source a broad array of manufacturing processes to meet their needs. In 2022, we generated a majority of our revenue from the prices we charge buyers on our platform. Buyers begin by uploading an engineering schematic that contains 3D design specifications, typically a computer-aided design, or a CAD, file. Then, we price transactions through our proprietary, AI-enabled instant quoting engine based on factors such as volume, manufacturing process, material and location. The convenience and transparency of our model leads to increasing buyer stickiness and spend over time. In addition, we incorporate elements of environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) practices into our marketplace by offering buyers the ability to purchase carbon credits to offset the carbon used to make their parts.
We empower suppliers to grow their manufacturing businesses and expand machine uptime by providing access to an international base of buyers. We also offer supporting products and services designed to meet our suppliers’ unique needs. In 2019, we introduced Xometry Supplies in the United States (“U.S.”), which enables our suppliers to access other experienced suppliers who sell competitively priced tools, materials and supplies from leading brands. In 2020, we introduced financial services that enable suppliers to stabilize and enhance their cash flows, provide discounts on tools and materials that allow suppliers to lower their operating costs, and give access to resource management tools to optimize suppliers’ businesses. In 2021, we acquired Thomas Publishing Company (“Thomas”) and Fusiform, Inc. (d/b/a FactoryFour) (“FactoryFour”), expanding our basket of supplier services to include digital marketing and data solutions and SaaS based solutions to help suppliers optimize their productivity. Revenue from our supplier services was approximately 20% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022. We expect revenue from supplier services to continue to grow over time.
We act as the seller to our buyers and we agree to pricing in advance of sourcing the order from a manufacturer. We bear the risk that a buyer is not satisfied or that we are required to pay a supplier more than anticipated to manufacture the order.
During 2022, we launched the Industrial Buying Engine (“IBE”), which helps customers source and purchase from the more than 500,000 suppliers on Thomasnet.com. The IBE digitizes the old and time-consuming request-for-quote process and allows buyer and suppliers to transact on Thomasnet. In addition, through IBE buyers can receive instant quotes from Xometry. We also introduced Workcenter which gives suppliers a one-stop view into all of their Xometry and non-Xometry work. A cloud-based manufacturing execution system, Workcenter brings the job board and financial services into one, easy-to-use platform. With Workcenter, shop owners can build and manage workflows for all their projects, including those from non-Xometry customers, and also quote new projects from Xometry and Thomas.
 Industry Overview
•Manufacturing is a massive, highly fragmented, and regionalized industry in need of solutions to drive efficiency. The global manufacturing industry is one of the largest industries in the world. We believe the industry is poised for increased digitization via a number of global thematic shifts, including rising demand for production, new manufacturing technologies, and shifting value chains, but is in need of solutions to drive efficiency and create opportunities from these dynamics. Furthermore, the manufacturing industry is largely composed of small- to medium-sized manufacturers and we believe that there are significant barriers to entry for these businesses, who have to compete with scaled, better-resourced manufacturers. Xometry has an opportunity to help these highly fragmented, small- to medium-sized manufacturers with their materials, financing and advertising and marketing through our supplier services. 
 •Sourcing manufacturing opportunities is a complex, costly and time-consuming process. Even for the most sophisticated buyers and suppliers, the manufacturing sourcing and procurement process is complex, uncertain, costly and time-consuming. We believe that the labor-intensive sourcing process presents a significant opportunity as buyers and suppliers look for more efficient ways to source demand and consummate production. 
 •Resilient, localized and compliant supply chains are imperative. We believe there is a significant opportunity to help companies around the world improve their supply chain diversification, access just-in-time production, and build supply chain resilience. The COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical instability have highlighted the urgent need for resilient and localized supply chains. 
 •There is increasing focus on the manufacturing industry to address ESG issues. Companies and investors are increasingly focused on the importance of ESG issues. Supply chain management is a major source of carbon emissions. A lack of transparency in the supply chain makes it more difficult for companies to track and address their carbon emissions. Many companies, including some of the largest corporations in the U.S., are shifting their focus towards building more equitable supply chains and sourcing from more diverse suppliers. As ESG continues to garner management and stakeholder focus, we believe companies will increasingly look to productive business solutions that limit environmental harm and address social issues throughout the manufacturing ecosystem.
 •Multiple catalysts have led to an inflection point for industry digitization. We believe future expected labor shortages, in combination with the proliferation of new technologies, necessitates digital solutions that increase productivity, improve financial performance and allow them to compete sustainably. 
 Our Opportunity
We believe the unique challenges that companies and manufacturers face, supporting macro trends, and innovations in technology have brought the manufacturing industry to an inflection point for digital transformation. We provide the solution—a technology platform to unlock access, drive business efficiency, and improve the sustainability of manufacturing worldwide.
At the time of the IPO, we estimated our addressable market at $260 billion based on the estimated size of the market for the six key manufacturing processes offered on our platform at that time. This included CNC machining, injection molding, 3D printing (including fused deposition modeling, direct metal laser sintering, PolyJet, stereolithography, selective laser sintering, binder jetting, carbon digital light synthesis and multi jet fusion), sheet forming and cutting, die casting and urethane casting. Subsequently, we acquired Thomas which has data about suppliers which offer over 70,000 industrial processes, which we believe expands our addressable market to over $2 trillion globally.
 Our Platform
We are accelerating innovation by providing real-time, equitable access to global manufacturing demand and capacity. We provide sourcing and pricing across a network of buyers and suppliers, offer a suite of configurable manufacturing processes through our diverse supplier network, and enable business success through additional products and services that serve the unique needs of each side of our marketplace.

The data we generate enables us to become a preferred collaboration, workflow, and transaction platform for both buyers and suppliers.
 Our platform is also highly extensible, with an expansive and growing set of traditional and emerging manufacturing processes offered by our supplier network. Because of our platform’s extensibility, we are well positioned to scale and rapidly capture new processes brought to the platform by our suppliers, further enabling buyers to access customized, relevant manufacturing solutions that are suited to their industry needs and buyer preferences.
We offer these tailored processes through a user-centric platform that is reliable and flexible, leveraging additional products and services to increase buyer and seller engagement over time.
Reducing Manufacturing's Carbon Footprint
We are committed to helping reduce the manufacturing industry’s overall carbon footprint.
Marketplace customers can calculate the carbon footprint of their manufacturing projects to help them make informed decisions that will help them reduce their carbon emissions. Earlier this year, we integrated the Gravity Climate API into our Marketplace. The Gravity Climate API calculates carbon emissions estimates for Xometry order requests, using climate science and data related to product material, manufacturing processes, mass, and geography.
 We also offer a Carbon Offset Program, which gives buyers an integrated option to offset up to 100% of the carbon footprint of the entire manufacturing process for their orders from raw material extraction and processing, to the transportation of materials and goods along the supply chain, to the energy consumed in fabrication and the operations of the manufacturer. Additionally, we purchase carbon credits to offset 100% of the estimated impact of the shipment of parts to buyers from sellers and we promote green technologies like additive manufacturing which help to reduce the carbon footprint of the manufacturing industry globally.
Why Buyers Win
•Instant and Competitive Pricing and Lead Times. We create value for buyers through marketplace generation fueled by the continuous learning of our AI technology. The data generated by platform interactions improves the efficiency of our marketplace, lowering prices and improving lead times for buyers.

By embedding Xometry intelligence into workflows, we are able to deliver more reliable and relevant manufacturing solutions for buyers. 
 •Production Flexibility. We allow buyers to purchase any number of parts and services. From one part to millions, buyers have access to several manufacturing processes for rapid prototyping, product development, or high-volume production. These processes can also be combined with over 75 finishes available across CNC machining, sheet forming and cutting and additive manufacturing along with thousands of raw material and color combinations. Given this ability to provide tailored and scaled solutions, we find that buyers typically expand their use of our marketplace, sourcing a greater number of parts and processes over time. 
 Why Suppliers Win
•Cost-Efficient, Real-Time New Business Generation. We offer suppliers access to manufacturing opportunities from our large, geographically and industry-diverse buyer base, allowing suppliers to gain new customers without increasing their sales and marketing spend. As our AI technology improves, our ability to generate new business for suppliers increases. This model is designed to lower customer acquisition costs and improve suppliers margins over time. 
 •Repeat, High-Quality Customers. Following a successful transaction, we initially offer the same supplier the exclusive opportunity to accept the next repeat order in order to increase efficiency and reliability. Our ability to attract repeat buyers helps stabilize demand for suppliers so they can operate their businesses more efficiently.
 •Operational Excellence. We aim to be a completely digital one-stop-shop for all workflow solutions for suppliers. Our intuitive cloud application helps our suppliers digitize their operations so they can work smarter and faster. We provide order management, shipping and collaboration tools, reducing friction for suppliers and improving overall manufacturing order process efficiency. During 2022, we introduced Workcenter which gives suppliers a one-stop view into all of their Xometry and non-Xometry work. A cloud-based manufacturing execution system, Workcenter brings the job board and financial services into one, easy-to-use platform. With Workcenter, shop owners can build and manage workflows for all their projects, including those from non-Xometry customers, and also quote new projects from Xometry and Thomas. 
 •Financial Stability and Security. Our suite of financial services and Xometry maintenance, repair, and operating partnerships help suppliers enhance their cash flows and lower operating costs at all stages of production. Suppliers can receive cash advances for their work, accelerated payouts and a seamless digital invoicing process in an industry that frequently still relies on analog payments that are prone to delays. These services help suppliers manage their business more efficiently. 
 •Marketing and Data Solutions. Our suite of marketing and data services provided by Thomas helps suppliers grow and efficiently run their business. We offer suppliers a full slate of marketing services, including website building, search-engine optimization (“SEO”) and targeted advertising to buyers, resources that will help them further growth their business. 
 •Increased Utilization. We are focused on helping suppliers realize their potential by providing manufacturing opportunities that can be procured in a single click. Knowing that there is a reliable way to find extra work gives suppliers the confidence they need to invest in a new machine, hire an extra employee, or focus on a big job with a longer lead time, while relying on our technology platform to fill in available capacity. The convenience of this automated cycle drives greater order fulfillment and increased utilization across our supplier network. 
 •Supplier Community. Through our supplier-focused community initiatives, we empower suppliers of a variety of sizes to grow their businesses. Our Community Portal is an active and dedicated place where we can interact with our suppliers to better understand their needs and interests, and also give suppliers a platform to support one another. Our suppliers take pride in their crafts and are often sharing tips on machining best practices as well as how they leverage Xometry to work best for their shop. 
 Why We Win
•Rich Data and Constantly Improving AI Technology. In an industry that historically used intuition and basic data to drive purchasing and pricing decisions, we offer our customers pricing using our proprietary predictive algorithms. Our platform interactions generate millions of data inputs that are reinvested to continue improving our proprietary technology, machine learning and data analytics models. Leveraging this growing data set, we have been refining our AI technology to improve 

sourcing, pricing and lead time quotes for buyers and suppliers. This data in combination with our machine learning algorithms fuels the continuous learning of our models. As our models improve, our platform becomes more efficient and our offerings become more tailored for individual buyers and suppliers.
•Custom-Built, Extensible Platform. Our manufacturing processes and supply offerings are tailored to the complex and industry-specific design and order needs of manufacturing. These custom offerings are powered by our diverse and growing supplier network which contributes differentiated processes and our AI-enabled technology that facilitates intelligent matches between buyers and suppliers.

With the acquisition of Thomasnet, we expect to continue to add new manufacturing processes to help both our buyers and suppliers thrive. 
 •Powerful Network Effects. Today, we are the largest AI-enabled digital manufacturing marketplace by revenue. As we continue to scale, we benefit from a self-reinforcing, virtuous cycle, in which marketplace interactions contribute valuable data points and insights that improve our AI-enabled platform, increasing lifetime customer value and fueling strong unit economics. 
 •Buyer Engagement and Expansion. Our flexible ordering process allows us to land new customers and increases buyer stickiness, fueling an efficient go-to-market model. Over time, our accounts typically increase their spend with us through the addition of buyers and incremental processes, increasing order frequency and spend. For the quarter ended December 31, 2022, 96% of our revenue was generated from existing accounts. We define an existing account as an account where at least one buyer has made a purchase on our marketplace. For the quarter ended December 31, 2022, we saw a 47% year-over-year increase in accounts with at least $50,000 annual spend. 
 •Globally Distributed Supplier Network. Our global network of over 10,000 supplier brings together a range of manufacturing processes and industry-specific knowledge. With the acquisition of Thomas, we have access to an additional 500,000 suppliers. This enables us to serve a large, diverse and growing set of buyers. We offer our suppliers products and services to help them manage their businesses more efficiently and connect our entire supplier community for access to shared resources and support. 
 •Mission-Driven Culture. As we accelerate innovation in manufacturing, we remain focused on empowering local businesses and enabling new product development for companies around the world. Our corporate culture is centered around our mission through our commitments to serve the local communities in which we operate, champion technological innovation, and drive sustainability for manufacturing worldwide. 
 Our Growth Strategy
•Attract new buyers and grow wallet share with existing buyers. We intend to continue investing in acquiring new buyers through traditional paid sales and marketing techniques as well as leveraging our strong organic referral network to drive awareness and build trust. We are also focused on increasing buyer stickiness and buyer spend within existing accounts by investing in our sales and marketing capabilities. 
 •Deepen and expand supplier partnerships. Creating the largest, most connected, and efficient supplier network in the world benefits our entire platform. We are focused on attracting new suppliers, recognizing the massive opportunity still in front of us and the intrinsic benefit an active, diverse supplier population brings to the overall platform.
 •Become an enterprise solution for our suppliers. As we continue to grow the amount of data processed by our algorithms, we can provide our suppliers with progressively sophisticated data insights and analytics. Combined with our workflow management software and other supplier services, we will increasingly become the enterprise solution for suppliers to manage their businesses on and off platform. 
 •Enhance and offer additional supplier products and services. Our supplier products and services allow us to deepen supplier relationships and increase engagement. Revenue from our supplier services was approximately 20% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022. We plan to continue to market our financial service products to U.S. suppliers, enhance features that allow quicker conversion of purchase orders to cash, and build toward a full-service digital wallet for suppliers to use for payouts and purchases. 
 •Continue our international expansion. We believe there is significant opportunity in the global manufacturing ecosystem for a marketplace like Xometry. With operations throughout the majority of the contiguous United States and customers in Europe and Asia we have established footholds in major markets around the world.

 •Pursue strategic acquisitions. With the size and complexity of the manufacturing industry we believe there is significant opportunity for targeted investments and acquisitions to strengthen our competitive position and processes. 
Government Regulation
Our business activities are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules, and regulations. Compliance with these laws, rules, and regulations has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations, and competitive position as compared to prior periods. Nevertheless, compliance with existing or future governmental regulations, including, but not limited to, those pertaining to privacy, data protection, taxation, intellectual property, advertising, environmental, labor and employment, consumer protection and unsolicited email and taxes, could have a material impact on our business in subsequent periods. For more information on the potential impacts of government regulations affecting our business, see “Item 1A - Risk Factors.”
Data Privacy and Security Laws
  We may be subject to privacy and security laws in the various jurisdictions in which we operate, obtain or store personally identifiable information. Most states have enacted laws and regulations requiring notification to users when there is a security breach of personal data, or requiring the adoption of minimum information security standards that are often vaguely defined and difficult to practically implement. The costs of compliance with these laws and regulations may increase in the future as a result of amendments or changes in interpretation. Furthermore, any failure on our part to comply with these laws and regulations may subject us to significant liabilities.
  We are also subject to federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy and protection of data. Our privacy policies describe our practices concerning the use, storage, transmission and disclosure of personal information, including visitor and user data. Any failure by us to comply with these terms or privacy related laws and regulations could result in proceedings against us by governmental authorities or others, which could harm our business. In addition, the interpretation of privacy and data protection laws and regulations and their application to online services are unclear, evolving and in a state of flux. There is a risk that these laws and regulations may be interpreted and applied in conflicting ways from state to state, country to country, or region to region, and in a manner that is not consistent with our current data protection practices, or that new laws or regulations will be enacted. In addition, because our website platform is accessible worldwide, certain foreign governments may claim that we are required to comply with their laws and regulations, including with respect to the storage, use and disclosure of user information, even in jurisdictions where we have no local entity, employees, or infrastructure. Foreign data protection, privacy, consumer protection, content regulation and other laws and regulations are often more restrictive than those in the United States. Complying with these varying domestic and international requirements could cause us to incur additional costs and change our business practices. Further, any failure by us to adequately protect our users’ privacy and data could result in a loss of user confidence in our services and ultimately in a loss of users, which could adversely affect our business.
Human Capital
 To be a Xometry employee means taking an active role in building and serving our communities. We believe that our strong corporate culture and our investment in our employees’ development and engagement are key to our success. As of December 31, 2022, we had 914 employees.
Xometry Culture
 Our global team is unified by our mission, and we are passionate about delivering every day for our buyers, suppliers and partners. Our core values, which are rooted in the spirit of entrepreneurism, guide how we connect with our industry, our community and each other. We take pride and celebrate our focus on the customer, whether external or internal, our inclusive collaboration, our desire to deliver exceptional solutions and service, and our creativity and innovation.
Compensation and Benefits
 Our primary compensation strategy is to promote a pay-for-performance culture to attract, incentivize, and retain talented employees who can develop, implement, and drive long-term value creation strategies. We’ve designed our compensation program so that many of our employees have a component of their compensation that is performance or incentive driven. We offer competitive compensation that we believe is aligned with the market and fair relative to our peers.
 We offer industry competitive wages and benefits and are committed to maintaining a workplace environment that promotes employee productivity and satisfaction. While the philosophy around our benefits is the same worldwide, specific benefits vary regionally due to local regulations and preferences.


Employee Development and Engagement
 We strive to recruit, develop and engage diverse, highly talented and driven employees who connect to our mission and model our core values. Xometry is committed to cultivating ongoing learning and development and creating a sense of community throughout our global teams. We offer our teams comprehensive compensation and benefits programs that include a range of offerings to reward, incentivize and support our employees.
Diversity and Inclusion
 We are committed to growing and empowering inclusive communities in our company, our industry, and the neighborhoods in which we live. We know that a diverse and thriving workforce is critical to attract and retain the talent necessary to grow our business. Our success depends on ideas. We can foster more productive ideas if we amplify all voices and provide the tools and resources to those who need them.
We drive diversity, equity and inclusion (“DEI”) forward through programs, investments and initiatives including:
 •Diverse Manufacturers. We provide work to thousands of small machine shops that typically do not have exposure to jobs from large corporations. Our suppliers include many minority, veteran, and women-owned companies.
 •Talent. We are increasing and broadening the pools of candidates from which we hire, both externally and internally, and are further refining the requirements, assessment criteria and selection process for each of our roles. 
 •Education. We devote considerable time and resources to the continuing education of our employees. This effort begins on an employee’s first day and remains part of our employee’s experience through regular panel discussions and focus groups to ignite conversations and ideas around DEI priorities.
 •Culture. We established a DEI Advisory Committee that takes an active role not only in our programs but also as thought leaders and change agents. Through the guidance of this committee, we launched a number of Employee Resource Groups (“ERGs”) that bring employees together to foster a diverse and inclusive workplace and further strengthen our community.
 
Environment
 We are committed to reducing the carbon footprint of manufacturing. We purchase carbon credits to offset 100% of the estimated impact of the shipment of parts, and offer buyers the ability to instantly see the price to purchase carbon credits to offset the carbon used to make their parts. We also promote technologies like additive manufacturing that reduce the carbon footprint.
 
Non-Profit Organizations
 We want to help non-profits that are making a difference addressing other crucial problems facing our world. We created a donor advised fund (see www.xometry.org which is part of our company and not a separate entity) to fund non-profit entities leading the fight against urgent problems such as education and climate change. We have a moral obligation to share some of our good fortune with others and protect our planet for future generations. We integrate this work into our culture and we use our commitment to ideas beyond just building the company to attract, retain and motivate our employees. We do not see this work as a side-project or distraction. To the contrary it is core to the culture we are building at Xometry and ultimately we believe the support we provide through our donor advised fund makes our business stronger and more successful.
We have embraced the Pledge 1% movement, and are committed to donating 1% of our equity over time, to fund and support the operations of the donor advised fund. We have initially reserved 402,658 shares of Class A common stock, representing 1% of our fully diluted capitalization as of the date of approval by our board of directors, for issuance over the next five years for this purpose, in an amount not to exceed 20% of the initial reserve amount per calendar year. During 2022, as part of the commitment, Xometry is providing scholarships for 250 students over the next two years at community colleges in six key manufacturing states: Maryland, Kentucky, Wisconsin, South Carolina, Connecticut and New York. Additionally, during 2021, Xometry pledged more than $900,000 to provide eight scholarships over the next four school years to students enrolled in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the Howard University College of Engineering and Architecture.

Competition
 The domestic and global on-demand manufacturing industry is localized and highly fragmented and we compete for both buyers and suppliers.
 We compete for buyers with service bureaus and brokers. Our competitors include vertically integrated service bureaus, the service bureau divisions of the additive original equipment manufacturing (“OEM”) companies such as Stratasys and 3D Systems and
independent machine shops and 3D printing service bureaus. For buyers, we compete on the basis of competitive pricing, user experience, and superior customer service.
 For suppliers, we compete with brokers and listing services. Suppliers will pay the independent brokers commissions to connect with buyers as well as list their services in offline trade publications and online listing services. We also compete with companies that sell software and services to suppliers, enabling them to sell from their own website or otherwise run their business independently of our platform. We are able to compete for suppliers on the basis of providing real-time access to orders, cash flow stability, global access to customers and supplier services and financial products.
 
Intellectual Property
Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain, maintain and protect intellectual property and other proprietary rights for our current and future technologies and services. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as license agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements, and other contractual protections, to establish, maintain and protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights, including our proprietary technology, software, know-how, and brand. However, these laws, agreements, and procedures provide only limited protection.
 As of December 31, 2022, we own eight issued United States patents directed to the use of machine learning for generating fabrication and manufacturing predictions, such as price, manufacturability and suitable materials and three pending patents applications (two in the United States and one in Europe) directed to similar technologies. Our issued patents in the U.S. will expire between 2036 and 2037 and the pending patent applications, if issued, are expected to expire between 2039 and 2040, excluding any extension of patent terms that may be available.
 As of December 31, 2022, we have approximately 45 registered U.S. trademarks and more than 100 registered foreign trademarks internationally for our name and certain words and phrases that we use in our business, and we rely on copyright laws and licenses to use and protect software and certain other elements of our proprietary technologies.
We enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and confidentiality agreements with other third parties, and we actively monitor access to our proprietary technologies. In addition, we license third-party software, open source software and other technologies that are used in the provision of or incorporated into some elements of our services. Many parts of our business are significantly reliant on proprietary technology and/or licensed technology, including open source software.
 Although we take steps to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights, we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will be sufficient or effective to prevent the unauthorized access, use, copying or the reverse engineering of our technology and other proprietary information, including by third parties who may use our technology or other proprietary information to develop services that compete with ours. Moreover, others may independently develop technologies or services that are competitive with ours or that infringe on, misappropriate, or otherwise violate our intellectual property and proprietary rights. Policing the unauthorized use of our intellectual property and proprietary rights can be difficult. The enforcement of our intellectual property and proprietary rights also depends on any legal actions we may bring against any such parties being successful, but these actions are costly, time-consuming, and may not be successful, even when our rights have been infringed, misappropriated, or otherwise violated. In addition, aspects of our platform and services include software covered by open source licenses. The terms of various open source licenses have not been interpreted by United States courts, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our services.
 Although we rely on intellectual property and proprietary rights, including patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets, as well as contractual protections, in our business, we also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our intellectual property and proprietary rights through appropriate technological restrictions, such as physical and electronic security measures.
 See the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business” for a more comprehensive description of risks related to our intellectual property and proprietary rights.

 •During our first assessment of internal control over financial reporting, as required under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting that existed as of December 31, 2022. Notwithstanding this material weakness, we confirm that our consolidated financial statements as included in this Annual Report fairly present, in all material respects, our consolidated financial condition as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and our consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, in conformity with US GAAP. Management has implemented remediation steps to address the material weakness and to improve our internal control over financial reporting. If we are unable to remediate this material weakness, or if other control deficiencies are identified, we may not be able to accurately or timely report our financial condition or results of operations in the future.
 Risks Related to Our Business
 We have incurred net losses in the past, expect to incur net losses in the future and may never achieve or sustain profitability.
 We have incurred net losses since our inception in 2013. We incurred a net loss available to common stock holders of $76.0 million in 2022 and, as a result of these losses, we had an accumulated deficit of $249.4 million as of December 31, 2022. We expect to continue the development and expansion of our business, and we anticipate additional costs in connection with legal, accounting and other administrative expenses related to operating as a public company. If our revenue declines or fails to grow at a rate sufficient to offset increases in our operating expenses, we will not be able to achieve profitability in future periods or, if we do become profitable, sustain profitability. As a result, we may continue to generate net losses. We cannot ensure that we will achieve profitability in the future or that, if we do become profitable, we will be able to sustain profitability.
 We may not continue to grow on pace with historical rates.
 We have grown rapidly over the last several years, but our recent revenue growth rate and financial performance should not be considered indicative of our future performance. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, our revenue was $381.1 million, $218.3 million and $141.4 million, respectively. We may also experience declines in our revenue growth rate as a result of a number of factors, including slowing demand for our platform, insufficient growth in the number of buyers and suppliers who transact on our marketplace, increasing competition, a decrease in the growth of our overall market, our failure to continue to capitalize on growth opportunities, failure to realize anticipated revenue growth from our supplier services and the maturation of our business, among others. You should not rely on our revenue or key operational and business metrics for any previous quarterly or annual period as any indication of our revenue, revenue growth, key business metrics, or key operational and business metrics growth in future periods. In particular, our revenue growth rate has fluctuated in prior periods. We expect our revenue growth rate to continue to fluctuate over the short term and decline in the long term. We also expect to continue to make investments in the development and expansion of our business, which may not result in increased revenue or growth. If our revenue growth rate declines, investors’ perceptions of our business and the trading price of our Class A common stock could be adversely affected.
 If we are unable to manage the anticipated growth of our business, our future revenue and operating results may be adversely affected.
 We have experienced substantial growth in our operations, and we expect to experience continued substantial growth in our business. This growth has placed, and will continue to place, significant demands on our management and our operational infrastructure. Any growth that we experience in the future could require us to expand our sales and marketing personnel and general and administrative infrastructure. In addition to the need to scale our organization, future growth will impose significant added responsibilities on management, including the need to identify, recruit, train and integrate additional employees. We cannot assure you that any increases in scale, related improvements and quality assurance will be successfully implemented or that appropriate personnel will be available to facilitate the growth of our business. Rapid and significant growth may strain our administrative and operational infrastructure and could require significant capital expenditures that may divert financial resources from other projects, such as product development. Our ability to manage our business and growth will require us to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls, and reporting systems and procedures. If we do not effectively manage our growth effectively, such as by failing to implement necessary procedures, transition to new processes or hire necessary personnel, it may be difficult for us to execute our business strategy and our business could be adversely affected.
 Our operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter, which makes our future results difficult to predict.
 Our quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future. As a result, you should not rely upon our past quarterly operating results as indicators of future performance. We have encountered, and will continue to encounter, risks and uncertainties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly evolving markets, such as the risks and uncertainties described herein. You should take into account these risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in rapidly evolving
markets. Our operating results in any given quarter can be influenced by numerous factors, many of which are unpredictable or are outside of our control, including:
 •our ability to maintain and grow our community of buyers and suppliers;
 •our ability to retain and increase revenue from existing customers;
 •the demand for and types of manufacturing processes, capabilities and materials that are sourced on our marketplace to suppliers;
 •spending patterns of buyers, including whether those buyers who transact on our marketplace frequently, or for larger services, reduce their use of our marketplace or stop transacting on our marketplace completely;
 •timing of large orders on our marketplace;
 •the impact of holidays on purchase activity;
 •fluctuations in the prices charged to buyers transacting on our marketplace;
 •changes to our pricing model;
 •our ability to introduce new features and services and enhance our existing platform and our ability to generate significant revenue from new features and services;
 •the impact of outages of our platform and associated reputational harm;
 •changes to financial accounting standards and the interpretation of those standards that may affect the way we recognize and report our financial results;
 •increases in, and timing of, operating expenses that we may incur to grow and expand our business and to remain competitive;
 •costs related to the acquisition of businesses, talent, technologies, or intellectual property, including potentially significant amortization costs and possible impairments;
 •actual or perceived breaches of, or failures relating to security or data privacy and associated remediation costs;
 •litigation, adverse judgments, settlements, or other litigation-related costs;
 •developments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or proprietary rights or our solutions, or third-party intellectual property or proprietary rights;
 •changes in the common law, statutory, legislative, or regulatory environment, such as with respect to privacy and data protection, wage and hour regulations, worker classification (including classification of independent contractors or similar service providers and classification of employees as exempt or non-exempt), internet regulation, payment processing, import and export controls, global trade, or tax requirements;
 •fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates;
 •uncertainties regarding the effect of general economic, business and market conditions, including inflationary pressures, general economic downturn or recession, market volatility, increasing interest rates and changes in monetary policy;
 •political unrest, changes and uncertainty associated with terrorism, hostilities and war, including the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and sanctions imposed against Russia by the international community;
 •general economic and political conditions and government regulations in the countries where we currently have significant numbers of users, or where we currently operate or may expand in the future; and
 •natural disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, wildfires, and threats to public health, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and other public health crises.
 
The impact of one or more of the foregoing and other factors may cause our operating results to vary significantly. As such, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. If we fail to meet or exceed the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the trading price of our ordinary shares could fall substantially, and we could face costly lawsuits, including securities class action suits.

Our growth depends on our ability to attract and retain a large community of buyers and suppliers, and the loss of our buyers and suppliers, or failure to attract new buyers and suppliers, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
 We derive a majority of our revenue from sales to buyers transacting on our marketplace seeking sophisticated manufacturing solutions. The size and diversity of our community of buyers and suppliers is critical to our success. Over the past few years, we have experienced strong growth in the number of buyers and suppliers transacting on our marketplace, including the number of active buyers, but we do not know whether we will be able to achieve similar growth rates in the future. Suppliers have alternative ways of marketing their services and finding buyers, including meeting and contacting prospective buyers through other platforms or marketplaces, advertising to prospective buyers online or offline through other methods, or interacting directly with a business. Buyers also have other ways to find suppliers, such as engaging suppliers directly, finding suppliers through other online or offline platforms or marketplaces. Buyers and suppliers may also source connections through our Thomasnet platform. Additionally, buyers may use in-house manufacturing processes. Use of these other options available to buyers and suppliers may make our marketplace less attractive to them and could lead to decreased use of our marketplace, which could result in a decrease in revenue. In addition, a decrease in engagement from buyers, including due to a general decrease in spending, could diminish the network effects that results from expanding the number of buyers within a particular account, or decrease the attractiveness of our marketplace to suppliers. If we fail to attract new buyers and suppliers or our existing buyers or suppliers decrease their use of or cease using our marketplace, the breadth and diversity of manufacturing processes offered on our marketplace may be reduced, or the quality of products manufactured by suppliers transacting on our marketplace is not satisfactory to buyers, buyers and suppliers may decrease their use of our marketplace.
 Key factors in attracting and retaining buyers include our ability to grow our brand awareness, attract and retain high-quality suppliers and increase the quantity, quality and diversity of manufacturing processes, including with respect to technique and materials, offered on our marketplace. In addition, our AI-enabled instant quoting engine provides price quotes for buyers and offers the opportunity to fill buyer orders at a different price to suppliers. The prices quoted must appeal to both buyers and suppliers; if the quoted prices are unattractive to either buyers or suppliers, we could incur losses on certain orders, or buyers or suppliers could decrease their activity or stop transacting on our marketplace. A key factor in attracting and retaining suppliers, in turn, is maintaining and increasing the number and diversity of buyers transacting on our marketplace. Achieving growth in our community of buyers and suppliers may require us to increasingly engage in sophisticated and costly sales and marketing efforts that may not result in growth in our community of buyers and suppliers.
 Buyers or suppliers can stop transacting on our marketplace at any time. Buyers or suppliers may stop transacting on our marketplace if the quality of their experience on our platform, including our support capabilities in the event of a problem, or the quality of the manufactured product, does not meet expectations or keep pace with the quality of the user experience generally offered by competitors or manufactured parts sourced through other means. Buyers or suppliers may also stop transacting on our marketplace if they perceive that our pricing is not in line with competitors. In addition, expenditures by buyers may be cyclical and be affected by adverse changes in overall economic conditions or budgeting patterns. If we fail to attract new buyers or new suppliers or fail to maintain existing buyers and existing suppliers, our revenue may grow more slowly than expected, or decline, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
 
Our success depends on our ability to deliver products and manufacturing processes that meet the demand of buyers transacting on our marketplace and our ability to adapt to technological changes and improvements.
 Our business may be affected by changes in buyer requirements and preferences, including as a result of decreased consumer demand for products, supplier manufacturing processes, availability of manufacturing materials and machinery, rapid technological change, and the emergence of new standards and practices, any of which could render our marketplace less attractive, uneconomical or obsolete. To the extent that our buyers’ demand for manufacturing decreases significantly for any reason, including because of shifting consumer preferences, it would likely have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations and harm our competitive position. In addition, computer-aided design simulation and other technologies may reduce the demand for physical parts. Therefore, we believe that to remain competitive, we must continually expend resources to enhance and improve our technology and ability to provide buyers with traditional and emerging manufacturing processes.
 In particular, we plan to expand the network of suppliers transacting on our marketplace to increase the number of suppliers available to fulfill orders, ensure production quality, expand upon the manufacturing processes, techniques and materials available to buyers, and continue to develop industry playbooks to offer increasingly customized solutions and serve additional industries over time. We believe successful execution of this part of our business plan is critical for our ability to grow our business and differentiate ourselves from our competition, and there are no guarantees we will be able to do so in a timely fashion, or at all. There are no guarantees that the resources devoted to executing on this aspect of our business plan will improve our business and operating results or result in increased demand for our offerings. Failures in this area could adversely impact our operating results and harm our reputation and brand. Even if we are successful in executing in these areas, our industry is subject to rapid and significant technological change, and our competitors may develop new technologies, processes and capabilities that are superior to ours.

Any failure to properly meet the needs of buyers and suppliers or respond to changes in our industry on a cost-effective and timely basis, or at all, would likely have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations and harm our competitive position.
 
If we fail to maintain and improve the quality of our platform, customer support and ancillary services available through our platform, we may not be able to attract and retain buyers and suppliers.
 
To satisfy both buyers and suppliers, we need to continue to improve their user experience as well as innovate and introduce features and services that users find useful and that cause them to use our platform and transact on our marketplace more frequently. This includes improving our technology to optimize pricing and lead-time tools, improving upon and introducing new supplier products and services, like our Thomasnet platform, Xometry Pay and the Xometry Advance Card, improving upon and introducing new design guides and industry playbooks, expanding the availability of suppliers to additional geographic and industry segments and improving the user-friendliness of our platform and our ability to provide high-quality support. Our buyers and suppliers depend on our support organization to resolve issues relating to our platform. Our ability to provide effective support is largely dependent on our ability to attract and retain employees who are well versed in our platform and the needs of buyers and suppliers transacting on our marketplace. As we continue to grow our international user base, our support organization will face additional challenges, including those associated with continuing to deliver support in languages other than English. Any failure to maintain high-quality support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality support, could harm our reputation or adversely affect our ability to market the benefits of our platform and marketplace to existing and prospective users.

In addition, we need to continue to adapt, expand and improve our platform and user interfaces to keep up with changing user preferences. We invest substantial resources in researching and developing new seller products and services and enhancing our platform by incorporating these new features, improving functionality and adding other improvements to meet our users’ evolving demands. The success of any enhancements or improvements to our platform or any new features depends on several factors, including timely completion, adequate quality testing, integration with technologies on our platform and third-party partners’ technologies and overall market acceptance. Because further development of our platform is complex, challenging and dependent upon an array of factors, the timetable for the release of new features and enhancements to our platform is difficult to predict, and we may not offer new features as rapidly as users of our platform require or expect. Additionally, the time, money, energy and other resources we dedicate to developing new features or enhancements to our platform may be greater than the short-term, and potentially the total, returns from these new offerings.
 
It is difficult to predict the problems we may encounter in introducing new features to our platform, and we may need to devote significant resources to the creation, support and maintenance of these features. We provide no assurances that our initiatives to improve our user experience will be successful. We also cannot predict whether any new features will be well received by users, or whether improving our platform will be successful or sufficient to offset the costs incurred to offer these new features. If we are unable to improve or maintain the quality of our platform, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
 
Our platform is dependent on our AI-enabled instant quoting engine. If pricing, lead time or other aspects of a quote to buyers either do not meet such buyer’s expectations or prove to be incorrect, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
 
We provide quality assurance to buyers.
 
Our customer agreement with buyers provides that we will manufacture their order in accordance with their specifications. Whether or not the order is ultimately supplied by a supplier, in the event that a buyer deems that an order does not conform to its specifications, we agree to replace the order. Our standard customer agreement allows buyers three days to specify non-conformance; however, the duration of our warranty varies by contract, and in some cases, we may be responsible for replacing non-conforming orders for longer periods. While we require suppliers to meet certain quality standards before offering their services on our marketplace and provide operational support to our buyers and suppliers, such efforts may not prevent us from losses due to poor quality of parts manufactured for our buyers.
 
Our business model involves our agreeing to pricing with a buyer in advance of sourcing the opportunity to a seller. We are at risk that the price a buyer pays us may be less than the cost we ultimately pay a seller.
 
Buyers transacting on our marketplace enter into our customer agreement, which provides that we will manufacture their order in accordance with their specifications. In addition, our AI-enabled instant quoting engine provides a prospective buyer with pricing, design feedback and proposed shipping dates prior to our sourcing the manufacturing opportunity to a supplier with requisite manufacturing process. From time to time, we may quote buyers prices that are lower than the cost we agree with a supplier. If our platform is unable to find a supplier to source a manufacturing opportunity from a particular buyer at below the price we quote such buyer, or at all, our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.
 
It may be difficult for us to comply with non-standard contract terms with our customers.
 
Customers, including large customers with substantial negotiating and purchasing power, may request that we use their internally-prepared purchase order forms or agree to terms and conditions for purchases that include terms that affect the amount or timing of or our ability to recognize revenue, increase our costs, increase our liability or are otherwise inconsistent with our standard documentation. If we are required to agree to these requests in order to do business with such customers, it may increase our cost of complying with such terms or we may not be able comply with such terms at all, in which case our relationship with the affected customer may be negatively impacted.
 
We or our third-party partners or service providers may experience a security breach, including unauthorized parties obtaining access to buyers’ confidential information, personal or other data, or any other data privacy or data protection compliance issue. Any such security breach may harm our reputation and brand, and may expose us to liability.
 
Our business involves the collection, storage, processing, transmission and other use of proprietary, confidential and personal data of buyers and suppliers and other parties, as well as the use of third-party partners and service providers who collect, store, process, transmit and otherwise use such data. In particular, our platform stores and transmits to suppliers confidential buyer information, including the intellectual property in their part designs and other sensitive data. We also maintain certain other proprietary and confidential data relating to our business and personal data of our personnel and job applicants. In addition, a security breach or incident that we or our third-party partners or service providers experience could result in unauthorized access to, misuse of, or unauthorized acquisition of such data, the loss, corruption, or alteration of such data, interruptions in our operations, damage to our computers or systems or those of our platform’s users, or the loss of access to our systems by us or our buyers and suppliers.
 
Any such incidents could expose us to claims, litigation, regulatory or other governmental investigations, administrative fines and potential liability in various jurisdictions, including under applicable data privacy and security laws and regulations. An increasing number of online platforms have disclosed breaches of their security, some of which have involved sophisticated and highly targeted attacks on portions of their networks or services. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not foreseeable or recognized until launched against a target, we and our third-party partners and service providers may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. Further, we may need to expend significant resources to protect against, and to address issues created by, security breaches and other incidents.
 
If an actual or perceived breach of security of our networks or systems or those of any of our third-party partners’ or service providers’ security occurs, public perception of the effectiveness of our security measures and brand could be severely harmed, and we could lose buyers, suppliers or third-party partners. Data security breaches and other cybersecurity incidents may also result from non-technical means, for example, intentional, accidental or negligent actions by employees or contractors. Any compromise of our or our third-party partners’ or service providers’ security could result in a violation of applicable security, privacy or data protection, consumer and other laws, regulatory or other governmental investigations, enforcement actions and legal and financial exposure, including potential contractual liability, in all cases that may not always be covered by our insurance, in whole or in part. Any such compromise could also result in damage to our brand and a loss of confidence in our security and privacy or data protection measures. Further, we may need to expend significant resources to protect against, and to address issues created by, security breaches and other incidents, including, potentially, payments for investigations, forensic analyses, regulatory compliance, breach notification, legal advice, public relations advice, system repair or replacement, or other services. Security breaches and other security incidents, including any breaches of our security measures or those of parties with which we have commercial relationships (e.g., third-party service providers who provide development or other services to us) that result in the unauthorized access of buyers’ confidential, proprietary or personal data, or the belief that any of these have occurred, could damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability.
 
Our and our third-party partners’ along with those of our service may be vulnerable to computer viruses and other malicious software, physical or electronic break-ins, or weakness resulting from intentional or unintentional actions by us, our third-party partners or service providers, as well as similar disruptions that could make all or portions of our platform unavailable for periods of time. We cannot provide assurances that the various antivirus and computer protection software that we currently employ in our operations will in all cases successfully prevent hacking or the transmission of any computer virus or malware, which could result in significant damage to our hardware and software systems and databases, disruptions to our business activities, including to our e-mail and other communications systems, breaches of security and the inadvertent disclosure of personal, confidential or sensitive data, interruptions in access to our website through the use of “denial of service” or similar attacks and other material adverse effects on our operations. Significant unavailability of our platform due to attacks could cause users to cease using our platform and transacting on our marketplace. Although we maintain cybersecurity liability insurance, we cannot be certain our coverage will be adequate for expenses or liabilities actually incurred or will continue to be available to us on reasonable terms, or at all. Any of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.
 
Failure to deal effectively with bad actors engaging on our marketplace or platform could harm our business.
 
We have adopted policies and procedures that are intended to ensure compliance with law, including, for example anti-corruption, anti-money laundering, export control, and trade sanctions requirements, and we have measures in place to detect and limit the occurrence of illegal activity on our marketplace. However, those policies, procedures, and measures may not always be effective. Further, the measures that we use to detect and limit the occurrence of illegal activity will require significant investment and resources, particularly as our marketplace increases in public visibility and we increase the number of buyers and suppliers engaging on our marketplace. Regulations requiring marketplaces to detect and limit illegal activities are increasing. Our measures may not always keep up with these changes.
 
We may suffer reputational harm for actual or perceived bad acts or actual or perceived illegal activities of buyers and suppliers on our marketplaces, particularly related to factory or other workplace conditions. Failure to limit the impact of actual or perceived illegal activity on our marketplace, could subject us to penalties, fines, other enforcement actions and expenses, significant reputation harm and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.
 
We rely upon third-party service providers to perform certain compliance services. If we or our service providers do not perform adequately, our compliance tools may not be effective, which could increase our expenses, lead to potential legal liability, and negatively impact our business.
 
We may be subject to disputes between buyers and suppliers on our platform.
 
Our business model involves, in part, connecting buyers to suppliers who fulfill orders on our marketplace. It is possible that disputes may arise between buyers and suppliers with regard to the terms of orders, payment, confidentiality, work product and intellectual property ownership and infringement, misappropriation or other violation. While we are not parties to such contracts, we cannot guarantee that we will not be involved in disputes among buyers and the suppliers with whom we pair. If these disputes are not resolved amicably, the parties might escalate to formal proceedings, such as by filing claims with a court or arbitral authority. Given our role in facilitating and supporting the relationships between buyers and such suppliers, claims may be brought against us directly as a result of these disputes, or the parties may involve us in claims filed against each other. Even if these claims do not result in litigation or are resolved expediently, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to resolve them, could divert the resources of our management and result in unexpected expenses.
 
We rely on a third-party payment processor to process payments made by buyers and payments made to suppliers, and if we cannot manage our relationship with such third party and other payment-related risks, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.
 
We rely on a third-party payment processor, Stripe, to process payments made by buyers and payments made to suppliers. We also rely on Stripe for certain financial service offerings, an integrated payment processing tool for suppliers available through our platform, and the Xometry Advance Card. Under our commercial agreements with Stripe, Stripe may terminate the relationship with 120 days’ advance notice. If Stripe terminates its relationship with us or refuses to renew its agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, we would be required to find an alternate payment processor and may not be able to secure similar terms or replace such payment processor in an acceptable timeframe. Further, the software and services provided by Stripe may not meet our expectations, may contain errors or vulnerabilities, and could be compromised or experience outages. Any of these risks could cause us to lose our ability to accept online payments or other payment transactions, make timely payments to suppliers, or decrease the use of Xometry Pay or the Xometry Advance Card, any of which could disrupt our business for an extended period of time, make our platform less convenient, trustworthy and attractive to users, and adversely affect our ability to attract and retain qualified buyers and suppliers.
 
Most payments by our buyers are made by credit card or debit card or through third-party payment services, which subjects us to certain regulations and to the risk of fraud. We may in the future offer new payment options to buyers who may be subject to additional regulations and risks. We also receive payments in the form of bank checks, Fed wires or ACH. As a result, we are also subject to a number of other laws and regulations relating to the payments we accept from our buyers, including with respect to money laundering, money transfers, privacy, and information security. If we fail to, or are alleged to fail to, comply with applicable rules and regulations, we may be subject to claims and litigation, regulatory investigations and proceedings, civil or criminal penalties, fines and/or higher transaction fees and may lose the ability to accept online payments or other payment card transactions, which could make our platform less convenient and attractive to users. We also rely on data provided by Stripe for financial statement reporting, and there could be inaccuracies and other errors in such data. If any of these events were to occur, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
 
Further, if we are deemed to be a money transmitter as defined by applicable law, we could become subject to certain laws, rules, and regulations enforced by multiple authorities and governing bodies in the United States and numerous state and local agencies that may define money transmitter differently. For example, certain states may have a more expansive view of who qualifies as a money transmitter. Additionally, outside of the United States, we could be subject to additional laws, rules, and regulations
related to the provision of payments and financial services, and if we expand into new jurisdictions, the foreign regulations governing our business that we are subject to will expand as well. If we are found to be a money transmitter under any applicable regulation and we are not in compliance with such regulations, we may be subject to fines or other penalties in one or more jurisdictions levied by federal or state or local regulators. In addition to fines, penalties for failing to comply with applicable rules and regulations could include criminal and civil proceedings, forfeiture of significant assets, or other enforcement actions. We could also be required to make changes to our business practices or compliance programs as a result of regulatory scrutiny.
 
Additionally, our third-party payment processor requires us to comply with payment card network operating rules, which are set and interpreted by the payment card networks. The payment card networks could adopt new operating rules or interpret or re-interpret existing rules in ways that might prohibit us from providing certain services to some users, be costly to implement, or difficult to follow. If we fail to comply with these rules or regulations, we may be subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from consumers or facilitate other types of online payments, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. We have also agreed to reimburse our third-party payment processor for any reversals, chargebacks, and fines they are assessed by payment card networks if we violate these rules. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
 
We are required to comply with payment card network operating rules.
 
Payment networks, such as Visa, MasterCard and American Express, establish their own rules and standards that allocate liabilities and responsibilities among the payment networks and their participants. These rules and standards, including the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, govern a variety of areas, including how consumers and customers may use their cards, the security features of cards, security standards for processing, data security and allocation of liability for certain acts or omissions, including liability in the event of a data breach. The payment networks may change these rules and standards from time to time as they may determine in their sole discretion and with or without advance notice to their participants. These changes may be made for any number of reasons, including as a result of changes in the regulatory environment, to maintain or attract new participants, or to serve the strategic initiatives of the networks, and may impose additional costs and expenses on or be disadvantageous to certain participants. Participants are subject to audit by the payment networks to ensure compliance with applicable rules and standards. The networks may fine, penalize or suspend the registration of participants for certain acts or omissions or the failure of the participants to comply with applicable rules and standards. Our removal from networks’ lists of Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard compliant service providers could mean that existing merchants, customers, sales partners or other third parties may cease using or referring our services. Also, prospective merchants, customers, sales partners or other third parties may choose to terminate negotiations with us, or delay or choose not to consider us for their processing needs. In addition, the card networks could refuse to allow us to process through their networks. Any of the foregoing could materially adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.
 
Changes to these network rules or how they are interpreted could have a significant impact on our business and financial results. For example, changes in the payment card network rules regarding chargebacks may affect our ability to dispute chargebacks and the amount of losses we incur from chargebacks. Changes to and interpretations of the network rules that were inconsistent with the way we operated has in the past required us to make changes to our business, and any future changes to or interpretations of the network rules that are inconsistent with the way we currently operate may require us to make changes to our business that could be costly or difficult to implement. If we fail to make such changes or otherwise resolve the issue with the payment card networks, the networks could pass on fines and assessments in respect of fraud or chargebacks related to our merchants or disqualify us from processing transactions if satisfactory controls are not maintained, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
We rely on third parties to deliver buyer orders.
 
We rely on continued and unimpeded access to postal services and shipping carriers for us or our suppliers to deliver manufactured parts reliably and timely to buyers. From time to time, the postal services and shipping carriers have experienced increased delays in delivery of their goods, due to economic, geopolitical and other factors. If shipping delays or interruptions occur, or if shipping rates increase significantly, our suppliers may have increased costs, and/or our buyers may have a poor purchasing experience and may lose trust in our marketplace, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
 
We face significant competition and expect to face increasing competition in many aspects of our business, which could cause our operating results to suffer.
 
The manufacturing market is fragmented and highly competitive. We compete for buyers with a wide variety of manufacturers. Some of our current and potential competitors include captive in-house product lines, parts manufacturers, and other marketplaces for manufacturing services. Moreover, some of our existing and potential competitors are researching, designing, developing and marketing new manufacturing technologies and capabilities that may compete with or provide alternatives to our platform or our marketplace. We also expect that future competition may arise from the development of technologies that are not
encompassed by our patents, from the issuance of patents to other companies that may inhibit our ability to develop our capabilities and from improvements to existing technologies. Furthermore, our competitors may attempt to adopt and improve upon key aspects of our business model, such as development of technology that automates much of the manual labor conventionally required to quote and manufacture parts, implementation of interactive web-based and automated user interface and quoting systems and/or building scalable operating models specifically designed for efficient production. We may, from time to time, establish alliances or relationships with other competitors or potential competitors, and our competitors may also be suppliers transacting on our marketplace. To the extent companies terminate such relationships and establish alliances and relationships with our competitors, our business could be harmed.
 
Existing and potential competitors may have substantially greater financial, technical, marketing and sales, manufacturing, distribution and other resources and name recognition than us, as well as more substantial intellectual property portfolios and experience and expertise in intellectual property rights and operating within certain international locations, any of which may enable them to compete effectively against us.
 
Though we plan to expend resources to develop new technologies, processes and capabilities, we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our current position or continue to compete successfully against current and future sources of competition. Our challenge in developing new manufacturing processes is finding capabilities for which our marketplace offers an attractive value proposition. If we do not keep pace with technological change and introduce new technologies, processes and capabilities, the demand for our platform and transacting on our marketplace may decline and our business, financial condition, and results of operations may suffer.
 
Expansion into markets outside the United States is important to the growth of our business, and if we do not manage the business and economic risks of international expansion effectively, it could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.
 
We expect to continue to expand our international operations, which may include opening offices in new jurisdictions, adding buyers in additional countries, and providing our platform in additional languages. Expansion into new markets or countries may not be successful. In addition, our legal, accounting, financial compliance and other administrative costs will increase as we expand internationally. In addition, our ability to manage our business and conduct our operations internationally requires considerable management attention and resources, and is subject to the particular challenges of supporting a rapidly growing business in an environment of multiple languages, cultures, customs, legal and regulatory systems, alternative dispute systems and commercial markets. International expansion requires investment of significant funds and other resources. Operating internationally subjects us to new risks and may increase risks that we currently face, including risks associated with:
 
•recruiting, training and retaining talented and capable employees outside of the United States, Europe and Asia, and maintaining our company culture across all of our offices;
 •providing our platform and operating our business across a significant distance, in different languages and among different cultures, including the potential need to modify our platform and features to ensure that they are relevant in different countries;
 •compliance with applicable international laws and regulations, including laws and regulations with respect to privacy, data protection, labor and employment, consumer protection and unsolicited email, and the risk of penalties to our users and individual members of management or employees if our practices are deemed to be out of compliance;
 •operating in jurisdictions that do not protect intellectual property rights or other proprietary rights to the same extent as does the United States;
 •compliance by us and our business partners with anti-corruption laws, import and export control laws, tariffs, trade barriers, economic sanctions and other regulatory limitations on our ability to provide our platform and operate our marketplace in certain international markets;
 •political and economic instability, including that related to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine;
 •fluctuations in currency exchange rates;
 •potentially adverse tax consequences due to changes in the income and other tax laws of the United States or the international jurisdictions in which we operate; and
 •higher costs of doing business internationally, including increased legal, financial compliance, accounting, travel, infrastructure and other administrative costs.
 
We may be unable to keep current with changes in laws and regulations. Although we strive to comply with all applicable laws and regulations and are in the process of implementing policies and procedures designed to support compliance with such laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that we will always be in full compliance or that all of our employees, contractors, partners and
agents will comply at all times. Any violations could result in enforcement actions, fines, civil and criminal penalties, damages, injunctions, or reputational harm. If we are unable comply with these laws and regulations or manage the complexity of our global operations successfully, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.
 
Geopolitical instability outside of the U.S. may adversely impact the U.S. and global economies.
 
In February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine and the ensuing conflict has continued into 2023. In response, the U.S. government and other countries have imposed punishing sanctions against Russia, including significant restrictions on most companies’ ability to do business in Russia. The invasion of Ukraine and any retaliatory measures taken by the United States and other countries could threaten global security and result in further regional conflict and otherwise have a lasting impact on regional and global economies, any or all of which could adversely affect our business and the price of our Class A common stock.

We have contractors in Ukraine, Belarus and Russia. To the extent there are losses of life, disruptions to internet connectivity, or interruptions to banking payment systems, we and our employees could be adversely impacted.

It is not possible to predict the broader or longer-term consequences of the conflict in Ukraine, which could include further sanctions, embargoes, regional instability, geopolitical shifts and adverse effects on macroeconomic conditions, security conditions, currency exchange rates, the price and availability of energy and financial markets. Such geopolitical instability and uncertainty could have a negative impact on our ability to continue expanding our operations internationally and to otherwise generate revenues and attract buyers and suppliers internationally. In addition, a significant escalation or expansion of economic disruption or the conflict’s current scope could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation, financial condition and growth prospects.

Unstable market and economic conditions, including a global or domestic recession or the fear of a recession, may have serious adverse consequences on our business, financial condition and share price.
 
The global economy, including credit and financial markets, has experienced extreme volatility and disruptions, including severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, increases in unemployment rates, increases in inflation rates, higher interest rates and uncertainty about economic stability. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in widespread unemployment, economic slowdown and extreme volatility in the capital markets. Similarly, Russia’s ongoing incursion into Ukraine has created extreme volatility in the global capital markets and is expected to have further global economic consequences, including disruptions of the global supply chain and energy markets. In addition, rising inflation and other macroeconomic pressures in the United States and the global economy could exacerbate extreme volatility in the global capital markets and heighten unstable market conditions. Any such volatility and disruptions may have adverse consequences on us or the third parties on whom we rely. If the equity and credit markets continue to deteriorate, including as a result of political unrest, war or a global or domestic recession or the fear thereof, it may make any necessary debt or equity financing more difficult to obtain in a timely manner or on favorable terms, more costly or more dilutive. Increased inflation rates can adversely affect us by increasing our costs, including labor and employee benefit costs. In addition, higher inflation also could increase our customers’ operating costs, which could result in reduced marketing budgets for our customers and potentially less demand for our platform. Any significant increases in inflation and related increase in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
 
Our business could be adversely impacted by changes in the Internet and mobile device accessibility of users.
 
Our business depends on users’ access to our platform via a personal computer or mobile device and the Internet. We enable suppliers to access our platform via a mobile browser, which we believe is important to the growth of our business by adding suppliers to our marketplace and enabling faster supplier response times to orders. We may operate in jurisdictions that provide limited Internet connectivity, particularly as we expand internationally. Internet access and access to a mobile device or personal computer are frequently provided by companies with significant market power that could take actions that degrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of users’ ability to access our platform. In addition, the Internet infrastructure that we and users of our platform rely on in any particular geographic area may be unable to support the demands placed upon it and could interfere with the speed and availability of our platform. Any such failure in Internet or mobile device or computer accessibility, even for a short period of time, could adversely affect our results of operations.
 
Interruptions to or other problems with our website and platform, information technology systems, manufacturing processes or other operations could damage our reputation and brand and substantially harm our business and results of operations.
 
The satisfactory performance, reliability, consistency, integrity, security and availability of our websites, marketplace and platform, information technology systems, and other operations are critical to our reputation and brand, and to our ability to effectively service buyers and suppliers. Any interruptions or other problems that cause any of our websites, marketplace, platform or information technology systems to malfunction or be unavailable, or negatively impact our operations, may damage our reputation and brand, result in lost revenue, cause us to incur significant costs seeking to remedy the problem and otherwise substantially harm our business and results of operations.


A number of factors or events could cause such interruptions or problems, including: human and software errors, hackers, viruses, malware or other malicious activity, design faults, bugs, challenges associated with upgrades, changes or new facets of our business, power loss, telecommunication failures, fire, flood, extreme weather, political instability, acts of terrorism, war, break-ins and security breaches, supply chain attacks, exploitation of vulnerabilities in our network or platform, contract disputes, labor strikes and other workforce-related issues, capacity constraints due to an unusually large number of users accessing our websites or ordering parts at the same time, and other similar events. Our buyers come to us in part for our instant pricing capabilities and that feature is often of critical importance to these buyers. We are dependent upon our facilities, in which we house computer hardware necessary to operate our websites and systems as well as managerial, customer service, sales, marketing and other similar functions, and we have not identified alternatives to these facilities or established fully redundant systems in multiple locations. We also utilize cloud computing and server capabilities with respect to each of our operations. In addition, we are dependent in part on third parties for the implementation and maintenance of certain aspects of our communications and production systems, and therefore preventing, identifying and rectifying problems with these aspects of our systems is to a large extent outside of our control.
 
Moreover, the business interruption insurance that we carry may not be sufficient to compensate us for the potentially significant losses, including the potential harm to the future growth of our business that may result from interruptions in the use of our marketplace or platform and delivery of parts as a result of system failures. Any of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.
 
We are subject to stringent and evolving laws and regulations relating to consumer data privacy and data protection, and any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with such laws and regulations or our privacy policies could materially and adversely affect our business.
 
We receive, collect, store, process, transfer and otherwise use personal data and other sensitive data. The effectiveness of our technology, including our AI and platforms, and our ability to offer our platform to users rely on the collection, storage and use of this data, including personally identifying or other sensitive data. Our collection, storage, processing, transfer and other use of this data might raise privacy and data protection concerns, which could negatively impact the demand for our services. Privacy and data protection laws or misinterpretations of such laws could restrict or add regulatory and compliance processes to our ability to effectively use and profit from those services.
 
There are numerous federal, state and international laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection, information security and the collection, storing, sharing, use, processing, transfer, disclosure and protection of personal data and other content, the scope of which are changing, subject to differing interpretations, and may be inconsistent among countries or conflict with other laws and regulations. We are also subject to the terms of our privacy and information policies and contractual or other obligations to third parties related to privacy, data protection and information security. We strive to comply with applicable laws, regulations, policies and other legal obligations relating to privacy, data protection and information security to the extent possible. However, the regulatory framework for privacy and data protection worldwide is, and is likely to remain for the foreseeable future, uncertain and complex, and it is possible that these or other actual or alleged obligations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that we do not anticipate or that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or our practices. Further, any significant change to applicable laws, regulations or industry practices regarding the collection, use, retention, security or disclosure of personal data, or their interpretation, or any changes regarding the manner in which the consent of users or other data subjects for the collection, use, retention or disclosure of such data must be obtained, could increase our costs and require us to modify our services and features, possibly in a material manner, which we may be unable to complete, and may limit our ability to store and process user data or develop new services and features.
 
If we were found to be in violation of any applicable privacy or data protection laws or regulations, our business may be materially and adversely affected, and we would likely have to change our business practices and potentially the services and features available through our platform. In addition, these laws and regulations could impose significant costs on us and could make it more difficult for us to use our current technology to and connect buyers and suppliers. In addition, if a breach of data security were to occur, or other violation of privacy or data protection laws and regulations were to be alleged, our solutions may be perceived as less desirable and our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
 
We expect that there will continue to be new laws, regulations and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection and information security proposed and enacted in various jurisdictions. For example, European legislators adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which became effective on May 25, 2018, and are now in the process of finalizing the ePrivacy Regulation to replace the European ePrivacy Directive (Directive 2002/58/EC as amended by Directive 2009/136/EC). The GDPR further implemented through binding guidance by the European Data Protection Board (and supplemented by national laws in individual EU member states), applies extra-territorially, imposes stringent data protection compliance requirements and provides for significant penalties for noncompliance. The GDPR created new compliance obligations applicable to our business and users, including obligations and restrictions concerning the consent and rights of individuals to whom the personal data relates, security breach notifications and the security and confidentiality of personal data. The GDPR has caused us to change, and we may in the future need to make further changes to, our business practices, and includes significant financial penalties for noncompliance
(including possible fines of up to the greater of €20 million and 4% of our global annual turnover for the preceding financial year for the most serious violations, as well as the right to compensation for financial or non-financial damages claimed by any individuals under Article 82 of the GDPR). We have taken steps to comply with the GDPR, but this is an ongoing compliance process. This may be onerous and if our efforts to comply with GDPR or other applicable EU laws and regulations are not successful, or are perceived to be unsuccessful, it could adversely affect our business in the EU.
 
Additionally, California passed the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which became effective on January 1, 2020. The CCPA provides data privacy rights for consumers and operational requirements for companies. Specifically, the CCPA mandates that covered companies provide new disclosures to California consumers and afford such consumers new data privacy rights that include, among other things, the right to request a copy from a covered company of the personal information collected about them and the right to request deletion of such personal information. The California Attorney General can enforce the CCPA, including seeking an injunction and civil penalties for violations. The CCPA also provides a private right of action for certain data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. Additionally, a new privacy law, the California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, became effective on January 1, 2023 and significantly modifies the CCPA, including by expanding consumers’ rights with respect to certain personal information and creating a new state agency to oversee implementation and enforcement efforts, potentially resulting in further uncertainty and requiring us to incur additional costs and expenses in an effort to comply. The CPRA will, among other things, give California residents the ability to limit use of certain sensitive personal information, further restrict the use of cross-contextual advertising, establish restrictions on the retention of personal information, expand the types of data breaches subject to the CCPA’s private right of action and provide for increased penalties for CPRA violations concerning California residents under the age of 16. Given its nascency, we cannot yet predict the full impact of the CPRA on our business or operations, but it may require us to modify our data practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses in an effort to comply. Additionally, the CCPA, CPRA and other legal and regulatory changes are making it easier for certain individuals to opt out of having their personal data processed and disclosed to third parties through various opt-out mechanisms, which could result in an increase to our operational costs to ensure compliance with such legal and regulatory changes. In recent years, there has also been an increase in attention to and regulation of data protection and data privacy across the globe, including in the United States with the increasingly active approach of the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) with respect to data privacy issues under Section 5 of the FTC Act’s unfair and deceptive acts framework, as well as contemplated data privacy statutes and regulations in many states as well as at the federal level. Current pending or future proposed legislation may result in changes to the current regulatory landscape, including enforcement measures and sanctions.
 
Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our posted privacy policies, our privacy-related obligations to users or other third parties, or any other legal obligations or regulatory requirements relating to privacy, data protection or information security may result in governmental investigations or enforcement actions, litigation, claims or public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others and could result in significant liability, cause our buyers, suppliers or third-party partners to lose trust in us, and otherwise materially and adversely affect our reputation and business. Furthermore, the costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, the laws, regulations and policies that are applicable to the businesses of our users may limit the adoption and use of, and reduce the overall demand for, our marketplace and platform. Additionally, if third parties we work with violate applicable laws, regulations or agreements, such violations may put our users’ data at risk, could result in governmental investigations or enforcement actions, fines, litigation, claims, or public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others and could result in significant liability, cause our buyers, suppliers or third-party partners to lose trust in us and otherwise materially and adversely affect our reputation and business. Further, public scrutiny of, or complaints about, technology companies or their data handling or data protection practices, even if unrelated to our business, industry or operations, may lead to increased scrutiny of technology companies, including us, and may cause government agencies to enact additional regulatory requirements, or to modify their enforcement or investigation activities, which may increase our costs and risks.
 
Additionally, certain actions of our users that are deemed to be a misuse of or unauthorized disclosure of another user’s personal data could negatively affect our reputation and brand and impose liability on us. While we have adopted policies regarding the misuse or unauthorized disclosure of personal data obtained through our services by our users and retain authority to put a hold on or permanently disable user accounts, users could nonetheless misuse or disclose another user’s personal data. The safeguards we have in place may not be sufficient to avoid liability on our part or avoid harm to our reputation and brand, especially if such misuse or unauthorized disclosure of personal data was high profile, which could adversely affect our ability to expand our user base, and our business and financial results.
 
Any court ruling or other governmental action that imposes liability on providers of online services for the activities of their users and other third parties could harm our business. In such circumstances, we may also be subject to liability under applicable law in a way which may not be fully mitigated by the user terms of service we require our users to agree to. Any of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.
 
Government regulation of the Internet and e-commerce is evolving, and unfavorable changes could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
 
We are subject to general business regulations and laws as well as federal and state regulations and laws specifically governing the Internet and e-commerce that are frequently evolving. Existing and future laws and regulations, or changes thereto, may impede
the growth of the Internet and e-commerce, or other online services, and increase the cost of operating our platform or operating our marketplace online, require us to change our business practices, or raise compliance costs or other costs of doing business. These regulations and laws, which continue to evolve, may cover taxation, tariffs, user privacy, data protection, pricing and commissions, content, copyrights, distribution, social media marketing, advertising practices, sweepstakes, mobile, electronic contracts and other communications, consumer protection, broadband residential Internet access, and the characteristics and quality of services. It is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, sales, use, and other taxes, libel, and personal privacy apply to the Internet and e-commerce. In addition, as we continue to expand internationally, it is possible that foreign government entities may seek to censor content available on our website or mobile application or may even attempt to block access to our website or mobile application. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with any of these laws or regulations could result in damage to our reputation and brand, a loss in business, and proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
 
Growth of our business will depend on a strong reputation and brand and any failure to maintain, protect, and enhance our brand would hurt our ability to retain or expand our base of buyers and suppliers and our ability to increase their level of engagement.
 
We believe that building a strong reputation, identity and brand are critical to our ability to attract and retain buyers and suppliers and increase their engagement with our platform and transactions on our marketplace, and will only become more important as competition in our industry intensifies. Successfully obtaining, maintaining, protecting, and enhancing our reputation and brand and increasing network effects of engagement on our platform and transactions on our marketplace will depend on the success of our sales and marketing efforts, our ability to provide consistent, high-quality services and support, and our ability to successfully secure, maintain, defend and enforce our intellectual property or other proprietary rights to use the “Xometry” mark, our logo, and other trademarks important to our brand, as well as a number of other factors, many of which are outside our control. We believe that our sales and marketing initiatives have been critical in promoting awareness of the products and services available to suppliers on our platform and buyers organically expanding their accounts by adding more users and service, but future marketing efforts may not be successful or cost-effective. Our buyers’ preferences may change from time to time. In addition, to expand our buyer base, we must appeal to new buyers who may have historically used other manufacturing methods.
 
Our reputation, brand, and ability to build trust with existing and new buyers and suppliers may be adversely affected by complaints and negative publicity about us, our buyers or our suppliers, even if factually incorrect or based on isolated incidents. Negative perception of our platform, marketplace or company may harm our reputation, brand, and network effects, including as a result of:
 •complaints or negative publicity about us, our platform, our marketplace, our buyers, our suppliers, or our policies and guidelines, including our pricing model;
 •price quote, production, lead time or shipping delays;
 •real or perceived manufacturing or quality control inadequacies;
 •fraud;
 •illegal, negligent, reckless, or otherwise inappropriate behavior by buyers, suppliers or third parties;
 •a failure to provide suppliers with a sufficient level of orders or repeat business;
 •a failure to offer buyers or suppliers competitive pricing and lead times;
 •a failure to provide a range of manufacturing processes sought by buyers;
 •a failure to provide manufacturing processes that limit environmental harm;
 •actual or perceived disruptions to or defects in our platform or similar incidents, such as privacy or data security breaches or other security incidents, site outages, payment disruptions, or other incidents that impact the reliability of our services, as discussed elsewhere in this “Risk Factors” section;
 •litigation over, or investigations by regulators into, our company or the industry in which we operate;
 •buyers’ or suppliers’ lack of awareness of, or compliance with, our policies;
 •changes to our policies that users or others perceive as overly restrictive, unclear, inconsistent with our values or mission, or not clearly articulated;
 •a failure to comply with legal, tax, and regulatory requirements, as discussed elsewhere in this “Risk Factors” section;
 •a failure to enforce our policies in a manner that users perceive as effective, fair, and transparent;
 •a failure to operate our business in a way that is consistent with our values and mission;
 •inadequate or unsatisfactory support experiences;

•illegal or otherwise inappropriate behavior by our management team or other employees or contractors;
 •negative responses by buyers or suppliers to new services or manufacturing processes available on our marketplace;
 •a failure to register or to prevent infringement, misappropriation or other violation of our trademarks;
 •perception of our treatment of buyers and suppliers and our response to buyer or seller sentiment related to political or social causes or actions of management; or
 •any of the foregoing with respect to our competitors, to the extent such resulting negative perception affects the public’s perception of us or our industry as a whole.
 Our company culture and values have contributed to our success and if we cannot maintain and evolve our culture as we grow, our business could be adversely affected.
 We believe that our company culture has been critical to our success. We face a number of challenges that may affect our ability to sustain our corporate culture, including:
 •failure to identify, attract, reward, and retain people in leadership positions in our organization who share and further our culture, values, and mission;
 •failure to further our diversity efforts with respect to our leadership team and our offerings;
 •the increasing size and geographic diversity of our workforce;
 •competitive pressures to move in directions that may divert us from our mission, vision, and values;
 •the continued challenges of a rapidly evolving industry; and
 •the integration of new personnel and businesses from acquisitions.
 If we are not able to maintain and evolve our culture, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.
 
Any failure to offer high-quality support may harm our relationships with buyers and suppliers and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
 
Our ability to attract and retain buyers and suppliers is dependent in part on our ability to provide high-quality support. Buyers and suppliers depend on our support organization to resolve any issues relating to our platform or transactions on our marketplace. In particular, our operational support team is critical to delivering manufactured parts to buyers timely and in accordance with their orders. We rely on third parties to provide some support services and our ability to provide effective support is partially dependent on our ability to attract and retain third-party software to enable and optimize our support functions. As we continue to grow our business and improve our offerings, we will face challenges related to providing high-quality support services at scale. Additionally, as we continue to grow our international business and the number of international users on our platform and transacting on our marketplace, our support organization will face additional challenges, including those associated with delivering support in languages other than English. Any failure to maintain high-quality support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality support, could harm our reputation and adversely affect our ability to scale our platform, marketplace and business, our financial condition, and results of operations.
 
Our business is subject to a variety of laws and regulations, both in the United States and internationally, many of which are evolving.
 
We are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations. Laws, regulations and standards governing issues such as worker classification, employment, payments, worker confidentiality obligations, intellectual property, consumer protection, taxation, import and export controls, privacy and data security are often complex and subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity and, as a result, their application in practice may change or develop over time through judicial decisions or as new guidance or interpretations are provided by regulatory and governing bodies, such as federal and state administrative agencies. Many of these laws were adopted prior to the advent of the internet and related technologies and, as a result, do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the internet and related technologies. Other laws and regulations may be adopted in response to internet and related technologies. New and existing laws and regulations (or changes in interpretation of existing laws and regulations) may also be adopted, implemented, or interpreted to apply to us and other online marketplaces. As our marketplace’s geographical scope expands, regulatory agencies or courts may claim that we, or our buyers or suppliers, are subject to additional requirements or that we are prohibited from conducting our business in or with certain jurisdictions. It is also possible that certain provisions in agreements with our service providers or between buyers and suppliers may be found to be unenforceable or not compliant with applicable law.
 
Recent financial, political and other events may increase the level of regulatory scrutiny on larger companies, technology companies in general and, in particular, companies engaged in dealings with independent contractors or payments. Regulatory agencies may enact new laws or promulgate new regulations that are adverse to our business, or they may view matters or interpret
laws and regulations differently than they have in the past or in a manner adverse to our business. Such regulatory scrutiny or action may create different or conflicting obligations on us from one jurisdiction to another. In the past, we have received letters from certain jurisdictions indicating that we are required to pay taxes based on having certain minimum contacts in such jurisdictions. We may become subject to taxation in additional jurisdictions in the future.
 
We are subject to U.S. and other anti-corruption laws, trade controls, economic sanctions and similar laws and regulations. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us to civil, criminal and administrative penalties and harm our reputation.
 
We do business worldwide, which requires us to comply with the laws and regulations of the U.S. government and various foreign jurisdictions. These laws and regulations place restrictions on our operations, trade practices, partners and investments.
 
In particular, our operations are subject to U.S. and foreign anti-corruption and trade control laws and regulations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, export controls and economic sanctions programs, including those administered by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, the State Department’s Directorate of Defense Trade Controls, or DDTC, and the Bureau of Industry and Security, or BIS, of the Department of Commerce. As a result of doing business in foreign countries and with foreign customers, we are exposed to a heightened risk of violating anti-corruption and trade control laws and sanctions regulations.
 
As part of our business, we may deal with state-owned business enterprises, the employees of which are considered foreign officials for purposes of the FCPA’s prohibition on providing anything of value to foreign officials for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business or securing any improper business advantage. In addition, the provisions of anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws in some jurisdictions extend beyond bribery of foreign public officials and also apply to transactions with individuals that a government does not employ. Some of the international locations in which we may operate lack a developed legal system and have higher than normal levels of corruption. Our continued expansion outside the U.S. could increase the risk of FCPA, OFAC or other similar violations in the future.
 
As an exporter, we must comply with various laws and regulations relating to the export of products and technology from the U.S. and other countries having jurisdiction over our operations. In the U.S., these laws include the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, or ITAR, administered by the DDTC, the Export Administration Regulations, or EAR, administered by the BIS and trade sanctions against embargoed countries and destinations administered by OFAC. The EAR governs products, parts, technology and software which present military or weapons proliferation concerns, so-called “dual use” items, and ITAR governs military items listed on the United States Munitions List. Prior to shipping certain items, we must obtain an export license or verify that license exemptions are available. Any failures to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines, adverse publicity and restrictions on our ability to export our parts, and repeat failures could carry more significant penalties.
 
We are subject to various federal, state, local and non-U.S. laws and regulations relating to environmental protection.
 
We are subject to various federal, state, local and non-U.S. laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including the discharge, treatment, storage, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and wastes. We continually assess our compliance status and management of environmental matters to ensure our operations are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations; however, there is no guarantee that we comply with all applicable environmental laws and regulations, and as a result, we may incur costs associated with noncompliance, investigation, remediation, and operation and maintenance costs associated with environmental compliance. The cost of such compliance may increase over time, particularly as we expand our business into new jurisdictions.
 
Our intellectual property and proprietary rights are valuable, and any inability to obtain, maintain, protect or enforce them could substantially harm our business, products, services and brand.
 
Our trade secrets, trademarks, copyrights, patents, and other intellectual property and proprietary rights are critical to our success. We rely on, and expect to continue to rely on, a combination of confidentiality, invention assignment, and license agreements with our employees, consultants, and third parties with whom we have relationships, as well as trademark, trade dress, domain name, copyright, trade secret, and patent rights, to protect our brand, proprietary technology and other intellectual property rights. If we do not adequately protect our intellectual property, our brand and reputation could be harmed and competitors may be able to use our technologies and erode or negate any competitive advantage we may have, which could harm our business, negatively affect our position in the marketplace, limit our ability to commercialize our technology and delay or render impossible our achievement of profitability. A failure to protect our intellectual property in a cost-effective and meaningful manner could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete. We regard the protection of our current or future trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, trade dress, databases, domain names and patents as critical to our success.
 
We strive to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights by relying on federal, state and common law rights and other rights provided under foreign laws. These laws are subject to change at any time and could further restrict our ability to obtain,
maintain, protect or enforce our intellectual property rights. In addition, the existing laws of certain foreign countries in which we operate may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States.
 
Effective protection of intellectual property rights is expensive and difficult to maintain, both in terms of application and maintenance costs, as well as the costs of monitoring, defending and enforcing those rights. We routinely apply for patents in the U.S. and internationally to protect innovative ideas embodied in our technology, but we may not always be successful in obtaining patent grants from these applications. Moreover, there is no assurance that any resulting patent rights will adequately protect our intellectual property or provide us with any competitive advantages. We also pursue registration of trademarks, and domain names in the United States and in certain jurisdictions outside of the United States and may pursue registrations of copyrights in the future, but doing so may not always be successful or cost-effective. We may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring trademarks and domain names that are similar to, infringe upon, dilute or diminish the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights. Additionally, our trademarks may be challenged, circumvented, declared generic, lapsed or determined to be infringing on or dilutive of other marks. We may not be able to protect our rights in our trademarks, which we need in order to build name recognition with customers. If third parties succeed in registering or developing common law rights in our trademarks and we are not successful in challenging such third-party rights, or if our trademark rights are otherwise damaged, we may not be able to use our trademarks to commercialize our products and services in certain relevant jurisdictions.
 
Even where we have intellectual property rights, they may later be found to be unenforceable or have a limited scope of enforceability. In addition, we may not seek to pursue such protection in every jurisdiction. In particular, we believe it is important to maintain, protect and enhance our brands. Accordingly, we pursue the registration of domain names and our trademarks and service marks in the United States. Third parties may challenge our use of our trademarks, oppose our trademark applications or otherwise impede our efforts to protect our intellectual property in certain jurisdictions. We may encounter similar challenges in other international jurisdictions as we expand our business. In the event that we are unable to register our trademarks in certain jurisdictions, we could be forced to rebrand our products, which could result in loss of brand recognition and could require us to devote resources to advertising and marketing new brands.
 
Our competitors and others could attempt to capitalize on our brand recognition by using domain names or business names similar to ours. Domain names similar to ours have been registered in the United States and elsewhere. We may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring or using domain names and other trademarks that infringe on, are similar to, or otherwise decrease the value of our brands, trademarks or service marks. Effective trade secret, copyright, trademark, domain name and patent protection are expensive to develop and maintain, both in terms of initial and ongoing registration requirements and the costs of defending our rights. We may be required to protect our intellectual property in an increasing number of jurisdictions, a process that is expensive and may not be successful or which we may not pursue in every location. We may, over time, increase our investment in protecting our intellectual property through additional patent filings that could be expensive and time-consuming.
 
Our intellectual property rights may be infringed, misappropriated, violated or challenged, which could result in them being narrowed in scope or declared invalid or unenforceable. In order to protect our intellectual property rights, we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect these rights. We may not be able to detect infringement misappropriation or unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights, and defending or enforcing our intellectual property rights, even if successfully detected, prosecuted, enjoined or remedied, could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our proprietary rights or determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others. Any litigation of this nature, regardless of outcome or merit, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources, any of which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. We may also incur significant costs in enforcing our trademarks against those who attempt to imitate our brand and other valuable trademarks and service marks. Furthermore, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims, countersuits and adversarial proceedings such as oppositions, inter partes review, post-grant review, re-examination or other post-issuance proceedings, that attack the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. An adverse determination of any litigation proceedings could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put our related pending patent applications at risk of not issuing. Further, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential or sensitive information could be compromised by disclosure in the event of litigation. In addition, during the course of litigation there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our Class A common stock. If we fail to maintain, protect and enhance our intellectual property rights, our business may be harmed, and the market price of our Class A common stock could decline.
 
Similarly, our reliance on unpatented proprietary information and technology, such as trade secrets and confidential information, depends in part on agreements we have in place with employees and third parties that place restrictions on the use and disclosure of this intellectual property. However, we cannot guarantee that we have entered into such agreements with each party that may have or has had access to our trade secrets or proprietary technology and processes. Despite these efforts, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain
adequate remedies for such breaches. There can be no assurance that these agreements will be self-executing or otherwise provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other intellectual property or proprietary information. Further, our competitors could independently develop technology similar to our unpatented proprietary information and technology, which could cause us to lose any competitive advantage resulting from this intellectual property. Agreements restricting the use and disclosure of unpatented proprietary information may be insufficient or may be breached, or we may not enter into sufficient agreements with such individuals in the first instance, in either case potentially resulting in the unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets and other intellectual property, including to our competitors, which could cause us to lose any competitive advantage resulting from this intellectual property. Individuals not subject to invention assignment agreements may make adverse ownership claims to our current and future intellectual property. There can be no assurance that our intellectual property rights will be sufficient to protect against others offering a platform, products or services that are substantially similar to ours and that compete with our business.
 
Our competitors may also independently develop similar technology that does not infringe on or misappropriate our intellectual property rights. The laws of some foreign countries do not protect, or may not be as protective, of intellectual property rights as those in the United States, and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate. Effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our solutions or technology are hosted or available. Further, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain. The laws in the United States and elsewhere change rapidly, and any future changes could adversely affect us and our intellectual property. Our intellectual property rights may be contested, circumvented or found unenforceable or invalid, in whole or in part, and we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing, misappropriating, diluting or otherwise violating them. Our failure to meaningfully protect our intellectual property could result in competitors offering solutions that incorporate our most technologically advanced features, which could seriously reduce demand for our products and services.
 
Additionally, our intellectual property rights and other confidential business information are subject to risks of compromise or unauthorized disclosure if our security measures or those of our third-party service providers are unable to prevent cyber-attacks. Significant impairments of our intellectual property rights, and limitations on our ability to assert our intellectual property rights against others, could have a material and adverse effect on our business.
 
In order to protect and monitor for infringement, misappropriation or other violation of our intellectual property and proprietary rights, we may be required to spend significant resources. Litigation may be necessary to enforce and protect our trade secrets and other intellectual property and proprietary rights, which could be costly, time-consuming, and distracting to management, and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property. Further, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property and proprietary rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims, and countersuits attacking the ownership, scope, validity and enforceability of such rights. Our inability to protect our proprietary technology against unauthorized copying or use, as well as any costly litigation or diversion of our management’s attention and resources, could delay further sales or the implementation of our offerings or impair their functionality, delay introductions of new offerings, result in our substituting inferior or more costly technologies into our offerings, or injure our reputation. Any of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.
 
We could incur substantial costs and other harms as a result of any claim of infringement, misappropriation or other violation of another party’s intellectual property or proprietary rights.
 
Whether merited or not, we may face claims of intellectual property infringement allegations and claims from individuals or companies, including such parties who have acquired or developed patents in the fields of injection molding, CNC machining, 3D printing, sheet metal fabrication, or other manufacturing processes for products manufactured by suppliers transacting on our marketplace, or technologies for automatically calculating pricing information for products manufactured according to such techniques. We may also be subject to claims from individuals or companies asserting that we are liable for alleged violations of intellectual property rights associated with parts created for buyers. Any claims that such products, processes or parts infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of others, regardless of the merit or resolution of such claims, could cause us to incur significant costs in responding to, defending and resolving such claims, and as a result, could have a material and adverse effect on our business.
 
Additionally, in recent years, individuals and groups have begun purchasing intellectual property assets for the purpose of making claims of infringement, misappropriation or other violation and attempting to extract settlements from companies like ours. We may also face allegations that our employees have infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated the intellectual property or proprietary rights of their former employers or other third parties. It may be necessary for us to initiate litigation to defend ourselves in order to determine the scope, enforceability and validity of third-party intellectual property or proprietary rights, or to establish our respective rights. Regardless of whether claims that we are infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating patents or other intellectual property or proprietary rights have merit, such claims can be time-consuming, divert management’s attention and financial resources and can be costly to evaluate and defend. Results of any such litigation are difficult to predict and may require us to stop commercializing or using our products or technology, obtain licenses, modify our services and technology while we develop non-infringing substitutes or incur substantial damages, settlement costs or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from
marketing or providing the affected products and services. If we require a third-party license, it may not be available on reasonable terms or at all, and we may have to pay substantial royalties, upfront fees or grant cross-licenses to intellectual property rights for our products and services. We may also have to redesign our products or services so they do not infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate third-party intellectual property or other proprietary rights, which may not be possible or may require substantial monetary expenditures and time, during which our technology and products may not be available for commercialization or use. Even if we have an agreement to indemnify us against such costs, the indemnifying party may be unable to uphold its contractual obligations. If we cannot or do not obtain a third-party license to the infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated technology, license the technology on reasonable terms or obtain similar technology from another source, our revenue and earnings could be adversely impacted.
 
From time to time, we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business with respect to intellectual property. Some third parties may be able to sustain the costs of complex litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. Even if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses and could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments, and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a material adverse effect on the price of our Class A common stock. Moreover, any uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our operations. Assertions by third parties that we violate their intellectual property rights could therefore harm our business.
 
Any intellectual property litigation to which we might become a party, or for which we are required to provide indemnification, may require us to do one or more of the following:
 •cease selling or using offerings that incorporate or are otherwise covered by the intellectual property rights that we allegedly infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate;
 •make substantial payments for legal fees, settlement payments or other costs or damages, including potentially treble damages and attorneys’ fees if we are found liable for willful infringement;
 •obtain a license to sell or use the relevant technology, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all, may be non-exclusive and thereby allow our competitors and other parties access to the same technology, and may require the payment of substantial licensing, royalty or other fees; or
 •redesign the allegedly infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating offerings to avoid infringement, misappropriation or other violation, which could be costly, time-consuming or impossible.
 
Any of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.
 
We may not be able to successfully execute future acquisitions or efficiently manage any acquired business.
 
We have acquired, and may in the future seek to acquire or invest in, additional businesses, products or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our marketplace, enhance the technical capabilities, products and services available on our platform, or otherwise offer growth opportunities. The success of any acquisition will depend upon several factors, including our ability to: identify and cost-effectively structure and acquire businesses; integrate acquired user data, operations, products and technologies into our organization effectively; and retain and motivate key personnel.
 
The process of integrating an acquired company, business or technology may create unforeseen operating challenges, risks and expenditures, including that the acquisitions do not advance our corporate strategy, that we get an unsatisfactory return on our investment, that the acquisitions distract management, or that we may have difficulty: (i) integrating an acquired company’s accounting, financial reporting, management information and information security, human resource and other administrative systems to permit effective management; (ii) integrating the controls, procedures and policies at companies we acquire into our internal control over financial reporting; and (iii) transitioning the acquired company’s operations, suppliers and customers to us. It may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits from these acquisitions, such as increased revenue, enhanced efficiencies or increased market share, or the benefit may ultimately be smaller than we expected. Moreover, if any of our acquisitions or investments increase our international operations, it would expose us to additional risks relating to operating outside the United States, including increased operational and regulatory risks. Our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or investments, incur unanticipated liabilities and harm our business generally. If an acquired business, product or technology fails to meet our expectations or results in unanticipated costs and expenses, our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer.
 
In addition, we cannot be certain that any acquisition, if completed, will be successfully integrated into our existing operations. If we are unable to effectively integrate an acquired business, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. The pursuit of potential acquisitions may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur
various costs and expenses in identifying, investigating and pursuing suitable acquisitions, whether or not they are consummated. We may not be able to identify desirable acquisition targets or be successful in entering into an agreement with any particular target or obtain the expected benefits of any acquisition or investment.
 
Acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of equity or equity-linked securities, the use of our available cash, or involve us taking on debt or give rise to new liabilities, whether to fund the upfront purchase price of the transaction or deferred or contingent payments we agree to as part of the transaction.
 
Natural or man-made disasters affecting the manufacturing facilities of our suppliers or of our facilities could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
 
Suppliers manufacture orders in a number of geographic locations; however, these facilities and the manufacturing equipment used would be costly to replace and could require substantial lead time to repair or replace. Such facilities and manufacturing equipment may be harmed by natural or man-made disasters, including, without limitation, earthquakes, floods, tornadoes, fires, hurricanes, tsunamis and nuclear disasters.
 
In the event any of our suppliers’ facilities or manufacturing equipment are affected by a disaster, suppliers may:
 •be unable to meet the shipping deadlines of our buyers;
 •experience disruptions in our ability to process orders, manufacture and ship orders;
 •be forced to rely on third-party manufacturers or otherwise fail to fulfill orders of our buyers; or
 •be unable to source materials required for orders.
 
In the event of any of our facilities are affected by a disaster, we may:
 •experience disruptions in our ability to process orders, provide sales and marketing support and customer service, and otherwise operate our business, any of which could negatively impact our business; or
 •need to expend significant capital and other resources to address any damage caused by the disaster. 
 
Any disruption as a result of natural or man-made disaster strikes of the manufacturing facilities of our suppliers or of our facilities, we may lose buyers, damage our brand and reputation, and we may be unable to regain those buyers or fail to attract new buyers.
 
Although we possess insurance for damage to our property and the disruption of our business from casualties, this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all, nor will it address the impact that a disruption of suppliers’ facilities or manufacturing equipment may cause. Furthermore, certain of our manufacturing partners may not possess adequate insurance coverage for damage incurred at their facilities which affects parts for our buyers.
 
We depend upon talented employees to grow, operate and improve our business, and if we are unable to retain and motivate our personnel and attract new talent, we may not be able to grow effectively.
 
We believe our success has depended, and our future success depends, in part on the efforts and talents of our senior management, including Randolph Altschuler, our Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer. There can be no assurance that the services of any employee will continue to be available to us in the future.

To maintain and grow our business, we will need to continue to identify, attract, hire, develop, motivate, and retain highly skilled employees. This requires significant time, expense, and attention. In addition, from time to time, there may be changes in our management team that may be disruptive to our business. If our management team, fails to work together effectively and to execute our plans and strategies on a timely basis, our business could be harmed. Competition for highly skilled personnel in our business sector is intense, particularly in the Washington D.C. metropolitan area where our headquarters is located. We may need to invest significant amounts of cash and equity to attract and retain new employees, and we may never realize returns on these investments. Additionally, potential changes in U.S. immigration policy may make it difficult to renew or obtain visas for any highly skilled foreign personnel that we have hired or are actively recruiting. Furthermore, our international expansion and our business in general may be materially adversely affected if legislative or administrative changes to applicable immigration or visa laws and regulations impair our hiring processes or projects involving personnel who are not citizens of the country where the work is to be performed. If we cannot add and retain employees effectively, our ability to achieve our strategic objectives will be adversely affected, and our business and growth prospects may be harmed.
 
Our management team has limited experience managing a public company.
 
Most members of our management team have limited experience managing a publicly traded company, interacting with public company investors and complying with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to public companies in the United States. It is possible that our management team may experience challenges managing the significant regulatory oversight and reporting obligations under the U.S. federal securities laws and the continuous scrutiny of securities analysts and investors applicable to public companies. These obligations require significant attention from our senior management and could divert their attention away from the day-to-day management of our business, which could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.
 
Changes in, or in the interpretation of, tax rules and regulations may impact our effective tax rate and future profitability.
 
We are a multinational company based in the United States and subject to tax in multiple tax jurisdictions, both domestic and abroad. Our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in statutory tax rates or in the interpretation of tax rules and regulations in jurisdictions in which we do business, changes in the amount of revenue or earnings in countries with varying statutory tax rates, obligations to pay sales, use, value-added, goods and services and similar taxes in jurisdictions in which we do not currently pay such taxes, or changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities.
 
In addition, we may be subject to audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, and other domestic and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the potential impact of such examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income and other taxes. We believe such estimate to be reasonable, but there is no guarantee that will be the case.
 Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.
 As of December 31, 2022, we have net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and similar state amounts, of approximately $224.6 million available to reduce future income subject to income taxes before limitations. Of the total loss carryforward available, approximately $58.4 million of net operating losses were attributable to the acquisition of the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary Thomas Publishing. Under Section 382 and Section 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” the corporation’s ability to use its pre-change NOLs and other tax attributes, including R&D tax credits, to offset its post-change income may be limited. In general, an “ownership change” will occur if there is a cumulative change in our ownership by “5 percent stockholders” that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. During 2022, management completed its evaluation of any limitations on the ability of the Company to utilize the Thomas subsidiary net operating loss carryforward of $58.4 million. As a result of this evaluation, management has determined that the annual limitation, as determined under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, would not prevent the Company from utilizing the net operating losses before expiration to the extent the Company is able to generate sufficient future taxable income.
Under the Tax Act, as amended by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or the CARES Act, net operating losses arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2021 may be carried back to each of the five taxable years preceding the tax year of such loss, but net operating losses arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2020 may not be carried back. Additionally, under the Tax Act, as modified by the CARES Act, net operating losses from tax years that began after December 31, 2017 may offset no more than 80% of current taxable income annually for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2020, but the 80% limitation on the use of net operating losses from tax years that began after December 31, 2017 does not apply for taxable income in tax years beginning before January 1, 2021. NOLs arising in tax years ending after December 31, 2017 can be carried forward indefinitely, but NOLs generated in tax years ending before January 1, 2018 will continue to have a two-year carryback and twenty-year carryforward period. As we maintain an almost full valuation allowance against our U.S. NOLs, these changes will not have a significant impact our balance sheet as of December 31, 2022. However, in future years, if and when a net deferred tax asset is recognized related to our NOLs, the changes in the carryforward and carryback periods as well as the new limitation on use of NOLs may significantly impact our valuation allowance assessments for NOLs generated after December 31, 2020.
 There is also a risk that due to regulatory changes, such as suspensions on the use of NOLs and tax credits by certain jurisdictions, including in order to raise additional revenue to help counter the fiscal impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, possibly with retroactive effect, or other unforeseen reasons, our existing NOLs and tax credits could expire or otherwise be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. A temporary suspension of the use of certain NOLs and tax credits has been enacted in California, and other states may enact suspensions as well. For these reasons, we may not be able to realize a tax benefit from the use of our NOLs and tax credits.
 
Earnings for future periods may be impacted by impairment charges for goodwill and intangible assets.
 We carry a significant amount of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Goodwill is the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the net assets of acquired businesses. We assess goodwill, indefinite-lived and definite-lived intangible assets for impairment each year, or more frequently if circumstances suggest an impairment may have occurred. We have concluded that there were no impairments of goodwill, indefinite-lived or definite-lived intangibles in 2022. If we
determine that a significant impairment has occurred in the value of our intangible assets, right of use assets or fixed assets in 2023 or beyond, we could be required to write off a portion of our assets, which could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition or our reported results of operations.
 Our use of “open source” software could adversely affect our ability to offer our services and subject us to possible litigation.
 We use open source software in connection with our products and services, and we expect to continue to incorporate open source software in our offerings in the future. Some open source software licenses contain certain requirements, including requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon, incorporating, linking to or using the open source software (which could include valuable proprietary code), and that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of a particular open source license or other license granting third-parties certain rights of further use. By the terms of certain open source licenses, we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software, and to make our proprietary software available under open source licenses, if we combine and/or distribute our proprietary software with open source software in certain manners, for reduced or no cost. Although we monitor our use of open source software, we do not have a formal open source policy and we cannot be sure that all open source software is reviewed prior to use in our proprietary software, that our programmers have not incorporated open source software into our proprietary software, or that they will not do so in the future. Additionally, the terms of many open source licenses to which we are subject have not been interpreted by U.S. or foreign courts. There is a risk that open source software licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to provide our solutions to our clients. In addition, the terms of open source software licenses may require us to provide software that we develop, using such open source software, to others, including our competitors, on unfavorable license terms.
 As a result of our current or future use of open source software, we may face claims or litigation, be required to release our proprietary source code, pay damages for breach of contract, re-engineer our technology, discontinue sales in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis or at all, or take other remedial action that may divert resources away from our development efforts, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. If an author or other third party that distributes such open source software were to allege that we had not complied with the conditions of one or more of these licenses, we could incur significant legal expenses defending against such allegations and could be subject to significant damages, enjoined from the sale of our offerings that contain the open source software and required to comply with onerous conditions or restrictions on these offerings, which could disrupt the distribution and sale of these offerings. In addition, the licensors of such open source software may provide no warranties or indemnities with respect to such claims. In any of these events, we and our buyers could be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering or utilizing our platform, products and solutions, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all. We and our buyers may also be subject to suits by parties claiming infringement, misappropriation or other violation of third-party intellectual property or proprietary rights due to the reliance by our solutions on certain open source software, and such litigation could be costly for us to defend and subject us to injunctions, payments for damages and other liabilities and obligations. Some open source projects provided on an “as-is” basis have known or unknown vulnerabilities and architectural instabilities which, if not properly addressed, could negatively affect the performance of any offering incorporating the relevant software. Any of the foregoing could result in lost revenue, require us to devote additional research and development resources to re-engineer our solutions, cause us to incur additional costs and expenses, and result in customer dissatisfaction and damage to our reputation, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.
 We rely on Amazon Web Services to operate our platform, and any disruption of service from Amazon Web Services or material change to our arrangement with Amazon Web Services could adversely affect our business.
 The operation of our platform depends on certain third-party service providers. In particular, we currently host our platform, serve our users and support our operations using Amazon Web Services, or AWS, a provider of cloud infrastructure services. We do not have control over the operations of the facilities of AWS that we use. AWS’ facilities are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, cybersecurity attacks, terrorist attacks, power losses, telecommunications failures and similar events. In the event that AWS’ or any other third-party provider’s systems or service abilities are hindered by any of the events discussed above, our ability to operate our platform may be impaired, resulting in missing financial targets for a particular period. A decision to close the facilities without adequate notice, or other unanticipated problems, could result in lengthy interruptions to our platform. All of the aforementioned risks may be augmented if our or our partners’ business continuity and disaster recovery plans prove to be inadequate. The facilities also could be subject to break-ins, computer viruses, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and other misconduct. Our platform’s continuing and uninterrupted performance is critical to our success. Users may become dissatisfied by any system failure that interrupts our ability to provide our platform to them. We may not be able to easily switch our AWS operations to another cloud or other data center provider if there are disruptions or interference with our use of or relationship with AWS, and, even if we do switch our operations, other cloud and data center providers are subject to the same risks. Sustained or repeated system failures would reduce the attractiveness of our platform to users, thereby reducing revenue. Moreover, negative publicity arising from these types of disruptions could damage our reputation and may adversely impact use of our platform. We may not carry sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur as a result of any events that cause interruptions in our service.

Our failure to meet our buyers’ price expectations would adversely affect our business and results of operations.
 Demand for manufactured products is sensitive to price. We believe our algorithmic pricing tool has been an important factor in our results to date. Therefore, changes in our pricing strategies could have a significant impact on our business and ability to generate revenue. If we fail to meet our buyer’s price expectations with respect to any given order, demand for our platform could be negatively impacted and our business and results of operations could suffer.
 Our business depends in part on our ability to process a large volume of new part designs from a diverse group of buyers and successfully identify significant opportunities for our business based on those submissions.
 We believe the volume and variety of designs and manufacturing processes we process, and the size and diversity of our buyers give us valuable insight into the needs of our prospective buyers and the ability of our community of suppliers to meet those needs. We utilize this industry knowledge to better match buyers and suppliers and to improve pricing. If the number and diversity of designs and manufacturing processes we process, or the size and diversity of our buyer or supplier bases decrease, our ability to expand our business and improve pricing could be negatively impacted. In addition, even if we do continue to process a large number and variety of designs and manufacturing processes and work with significant and diverse buyer and supplier bases, there are no guarantees that we will successfully identify significant business opportunities, improve the products and services available on our platform or increase the number of transactions on our platform as a result.
 If our present single or limited source suppliers become unavailable or inadequate, our buyer relationships, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.
 While most manufacturing equipment and materials for our buyers’ orders are available from multiple suppliers, certain of those items are only available from single or limited sources. Should any of our present single or limited source suppliers for manufacturing equipment or materials become unavailable or inadequate, or impose terms unacceptable to us such as increased pricing terms, we may fail to procure alternate sources of supply, and we may not be successful in doing so on terms acceptable to us, or at all. As a result, the loss of a single or limited source supplier could adversely affect our relationship with our buyers and our results of operations and financial condition.
 Our reported results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in GAAP.
 GAAP is subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, the SEC, and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported results of operations and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change. It is difficult to predict the impact of future changes to accounting principles or our accounting policies, any of which could negatively affect our reported results of operations.
 The impact of economic conditions, including the resulting effect on consumer spending, may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
 Our performance is in part subject to economic conditions and their impact on levels of consumer spending, as consumer spending impacts buyers and suppliers transacting on our marketplace. Some of the factors having an impact on consumer spending include general economic conditions, unemployment, consumer debt, reductions in net worth, residential real estate and mortgage markets, taxation, energy prices, interest rates, consumer confidence, and other macroeconomic factors. Consumer purchases of generally decline during recessionary periods and other periods in which disposable income is adversely affected, contributing to small business closures. Economic conditions in certain regions may also be affected by natural disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, wildfires, and threats to public health, such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic and other health crises. Further, small businesses that do not have substantial resources, like some of the buyers and suppliers transacting on our marketplace, tend to be more adversely affected by poor economic conditions than large businesses. If buyers or suppliers on our platform were to cease operations, temporarily or permanently, or face financial distress or other business disruption, our business, financial condition, and results of operation may be materially and adversely affected.
 Currency exchange rate fluctuations affect our results of operations, as reported in our financial statements.
 We report our financial results in U.S. dollars. We collect our revenue primarily in U.S. dollars. A portion of the cost of revenue, product development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses of our operations in jurisdictions outside the United States are incurred in foreign currency. As a result, we are exposed to exchange rate risks that may materially and adversely affect our financial results. If the foreign currency appreciates against the U.S. dollar or if the value of the foreign currency declines against the U.S. dollar at a time when the rate of inflation in the cost of goods and services in such jurisdictions exceeds the rate of decline in the relative value of the applicable foreign currency, then the U.S. dollar cost of our operations in non-U.S. jurisdictions would increase and our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. For example, there has been and may continue to be volatility in currency exchange rates as a result of the conflict in Ukraine. We do not currently enter into hedging transactions and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to effectively hedge against currency fluctuations in the future.


Risks Related to the Acquisition of Thomas
 
We may not realize all of the anticipated benefits from the acquisition of Thomas because of difficulties related to integration, the achievement of synergies, and other challenges.
 We acquired Thomas on December 9, 2021 (the “Thomas Acquisition”), our largest acquisition to date. We believe that there are substantial benefits and synergies that may be realized through combining the businesses. However, the integration process requires significant time and resources, and our ability to acquire and integrate larger or more complex companies, products, or technologies in a successful manner is unproven. If we are not able to successfully integrate Thomas’ business with ours or pursue our customer and product strategy successfully, the anticipated benefits of the Thomas Acquisition may not be realized fully, including the anticipated growth opportunities, or may take longer than expected to be realized. Further, it is possible that there could be a loss of our and/or Thomas’ key employees and customers, disruption of either company’s or both companies’ ongoing businesses or unexpected issues, and higher than expected costs. Specifically, the following issues, among others, must be addressed in combining Thomas’s operations with ours in order to fully realize the anticipated benefits of the Thomas Acquisition so the combined company performs as the parties anticipate:
 •combining the companies’ corporate functions;
 •combining Thomas’s business with our business in a manner that permits us to achieve the synergies anticipated to result from the Thomas Acquisition, the failure of which would result in the anticipated benefits of the Thomas Acquisition not being realized in the time frame currently anticipated or at all;
 •maintaining existing agreements with customers, partners and talent and avoiding delays in entering into new agreements with prospective customers, distributors, providers, talent and vendors;
 •determining whether and how to address possible differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies;
 •integrating the companies’ administrative and information technology infrastructure;
 •developing products and technology that allow value to be unlocked in the future;
 •ensuring the effectiveness of Thomas’ internal control over financial reporting;
 •evaluating and forecasting the financial impact of the Thomas Acquisition transaction, including accounting charges; and
 •effecting potential actions that may be required in connection with obtaining regulatory approvals.
 
Failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of the Thomas Acquisition could adversely affect our results of operations or cash flows, cause dilution to our earnings per share, decrease or delay any accretive effect of the acquisition and negatively impact the price of our Class A common stock.
 We have incurred, and may continue to incur costs in connection with the Thomas Acquisition and integrating the operations of Xometry and Thomas. Management cannot ensure that the elimination of duplicative costs or the realization of other efficiencies will offset the transaction and integration costs in the near term or at all.
Risks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock
Our stock price may be volatile, and the value of our Class A common stock may decline.
 The market price of our Class A common stock may be highly volatile and may fluctuate or decline substantially as a result of a variety of factors, some of which are beyond our control, and may not be related to our operating performance including:
 •price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;
 •actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results or financial condition;
 •variance in our financial performance from expectations of securities analysts;
 •changes to our pricing model;
 •changes in our projected operating and financial results;
 •changes in laws or regulations applicable to our business;
 •announcements by us or our competitors of significant business developments, acquisitions, or new offerings;
 •our involvement in any litigation;

•future sales of our Class A common stock by us or our stockholders;
 •whether our results of operations meet previously announced guidance or the expectations of securities analysts or investors;
 •actual or perceived data breaches, disruptions or other incidents involving our platform, marketplace or products or services;
 •developments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or proprietary rights or our solutions, or third-party intellectual or proprietary rights;
 •changes in senior management or key personnel;
 •the trading volume of our Class A common stock;
 •changes in the anticipated future size and growth rate of our market; and
 •general economic and market conditions and overall fluctuations in the financial markets in the United States and abroad, including as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and Russia’s ongoing war with Ukraine.
 The market for technology stocks or and the stock market in general have recently experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies, including our own. These fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political, regulatory and market conditions, may continue to negatively impact investor confidence and the market price of equity securities, including our Class A common stock. Broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political, regulatory, and market conditions, may also negatively impact the market price of our Class A common stock. In addition, technology stocks have historically experienced high levels of volatility. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their securities have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future, which could result in substantial expenses and divert our management’s attention.
 Our issuance of additional capital stock in connection with financings, acquisitions, investments, our equity incentive plans, or otherwise will dilute all other stockholders.
 We expect to issue additional capital stock in the future that will result in dilution to all other stockholders. We expect to grant equity awards to employees, directors, and consultants under our equity incentive plans. We may also raise capital through equity financings in the future. As part of our business strategy, we may acquire or make investments in companies, products, or technologies and issue equity securities to pay for any such acquisition or investment. Any such issuances of additional capital stock may cause stockholders to experience significant dilution of their ownership interests and the per share value of our Class A common stock to decline.
 If our operating and financial performance in any given period does not meet the guidance that we provide to the public or the expectations of investment analysts, the market price of our Class A common stock may decline.
 We may, but are not obligated to, provide public guidance on our expected operating and financial results for future periods. Any such guidance will comprise forward-looking statements, subject to the risks and uncertainties described in this filing and in our other public filings and public statements. Our actual results may not always be in line with or exceed any guidance we have provided, especially in times of economic uncertainty, such as the current global economic uncertainty being experienced as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. If, in the future, our operating or financial results for a particular period do not meet any guidance we provide or the expectations of investment analysts, or if we reduce our guidance for future periods, the market price of our Class A common stock may decline as well. Even if we do issue public guidance, there can be no assurance that we will continue to do so in the future.
 If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish unfavorable or inaccurate research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.
 Our stock price and trading volume is heavily influenced by the way analysts and investors interpret our financial information and other disclosures. Securities and industry analysts do not currently, and may never, publish research on our business. We do not have control over these analysts. If few securities analysts commence coverage of us, or if industry analysts cease coverage of us, our stock price would be negatively affected. If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, downgrade our Class A common stock, or publish negative reports about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our Class A common stock could decrease, which might cause our stock price to decline and could decrease the trading volume of our Class A common stock.
 
We may require additional capital to support the growth of our business, and this capital might not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.

We have funded our operations since inception primarily through equity financings and sales. We cannot be certain when or if our operations will generate sufficient cash to fully fund our ongoing operations or the growth of our business. We intend to continue to make investments to support our business, which may require us to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. In addition, we may require increasing amounts of working capital or other sources of liquidity to support our financial service offerings, as they become more widely used by suppliers. Additional financing may not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to invest in future growth opportunities, which could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. If we incur additional debt, the debt holders would have rights senior to holders of common stock to make claims on our assets, and the terms of any debt could restrict our operations, including our ability to pay dividends on our Class A common stock.
 Furthermore, if we issue additional equity securities, stockholders will experience dilution, and the new equity securities could have rights senior to those of our Class A common stock. Because our decision to issue securities in the future will depend on numerous considerations, including factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing, or nature of any future issuances of debt or equity securities. As a result, our stockholders bear the risk of future issuances of debt or equity securities reducing the value of our Class A common stock and diluting their interests.
 As of December 31, 2022, we had $319.4 million in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities. While we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least twelve months, we cannot assure you that we will be able to generate sufficient liquidity as and when needed, or that our revenue will be adequate to fund our operating needs or achieve or sustain profitability. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Changing circumstances, some of which may be beyond our control, could cause us to consume capital significantly faster than we currently anticipate, and we may need to seek additional funds sooner than planned.
 The dual-class structure of our common stock will have the effect of concentrating voting control with our co-founders, which will limit your ability to influence the outcome of important transactions and to influence corporate governance matters, such as electing directors, and to approve material mergers, acquisitions, or other business combination transactions that may not be aligned with your interests.
 Our Class B common stock has twenty votes per share, whereas our Class A common stock has one vote per share. Our co-founders collectively own Class B common stock representing approximately 54.4% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock, based on the number of shares outstanding as of December 31, 2022.
 As a result, the holders of our Class B common stock will have the ability to control the outcome of most matters requiring stockholder approval for the foreseeable future, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or our assets, even if their stock holdings represent less than a majority of the outstanding shares of our capital stock. This concentration of ownership will limit the ability of other stockholders to influence corporate matters and may cause us to make strategic decisions that could involve risks to you or that may not be aligned with your interests. This control may adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock. In addition, this may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our capital stock that you may feel are in your best interest as one of our stockholders.
 Our Class B common stock will convert automatically into Class A common stock, on a one-to-one basis, upon: (1) the sale or transfer of such shares of Class B common stock (except for certain transfers described in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, including transfers for tax and estate planning purposes, so long as the transferring holder continues to hold sole voting and dispositive power with respect to the shares transferred); (2) the death or incapacity of the Class B common stockholder; (3) such holder’s departure from our board of directors; and (4) on the final conversion date, defined as the earlier of (a) the seventh anniversary of our initial public offering; or (b) the date specified by vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Class B common stock.
In addition, while we do not expect to issue any additional shares of Class B common stock following the listing of our Class A common stock on The Nasdaq Global Select Market, any future issuances of Class B common stock would be dilutive to holders of Class A common stock. Such issuances would also reduce the voting power of our Class A common stock as compared to Class B common stock and could further concentrate the voting power of holders of our Class B common stock relative to holders of our Class A common stock.
 We cannot predict the impact our dual-class structure may have on the market price of our Class A common stock.
 We cannot predict whether our dual-class structure, combined with the concentrated control of our co-founders, will result in a lower or more volatile market price of our Class A common stock or in adverse publicity or other adverse consequences. For example, certain index providers have announced restrictions on including companies with multiple class share structures in certain of their indices. In July 2017, FTSE Russell and Standard & Poor’s announced that they would cease to allow most newly public companies utilizing dual or multi-class capital structures to be included in their indices. Under the announced policies, our dual-class capital structure would make us ineligible for inclusion in any of these indices. Given the sustained flow of investment funds into passive
strategies that seek to track certain indexes, exclusion from stock indices would likely preclude investment by many of these funds and could make our Class A common stock less attractive to other investors. As a result, the market price of our Class A common stock could be adversely affected.
 We will continue to incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management is required to devote substantial time to compliance with our public company responsibilities and corporate governance practices.
 As a public company, and particularly now that we are no longer an emerging growth company, we incurred and expect to continue to incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. For example, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2022 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the listing requirements of The Nasdaq Global Select Market, and any the rules and regulations of the SEC. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to compliance with these requirements. Moreover, these rules and regulations increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly.
In addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time-consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expense and a diversion of management’s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us, and our business and prospects may be harmed. As a result of disclosure of information in the filings required of a public company and in this filing, our business and financial condition will become more visible, which may result in threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors and other third parties. If such claims are successful, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially harmed, and even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to resolve them, could divert the resources of our management and materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
 Being a public company and these new rules and regulations make it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified executive officers and members of our board of directors, particularly to serve on our audit and compensation committees.
 In addition, as a result of our disclosure obligations as a public company, we will have reduced strategic flexibility and will be under pressure to focus on short-term results, which may materially and adversely affect our ability to achieve long-term profitability.
 Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of our company more difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management and limit the market price of our Class A common stock.
 Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include provisions that:
 •authorize our board of directors to issue, without further action by the stockholders, shares of undesignated preferred stock with terms, rights, and preferences determined by our board of directors that may be senior to our Class A common stock;
 •require that any action to be taken by our stockholders be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting and not by written consent;
 •specify that special meetings of our stockholders can be called only by our board of directors, the chairperson of our board of directors, or our chief executive officer;
 •establish an advance notice procedure for stockholder proposals to be brought before an annual meeting, including proposed nominations of persons for election to our board of directors;
 •establish that our board of directors is divided into three classes, with each class serving three-year staggered terms;
 •prohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors;
 •provide that our directors may be removed for cause only upon the vote of sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of our outstanding shares of our voting common stock;

•provide that vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum; and
 •require the approval of our board of directors or the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of our outstanding shares of common stock to amend our bylaws and certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation.
 These provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally, subject to certain exceptions, prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any “interested” stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an “interested” stockholder. Any of the foregoing provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our Class A common stock, and they could deter potential acquirers of our company, thereby reducing the likelihood that you would receive a premium for your shares of our Class A common stock in an acquisition.
 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and, to the extent enforceable, the federal district courts of the United States of America as the exclusive forums for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which restricts our stockholders’ ability to choose the judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.
 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if and only if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware lacks subject matter jurisdiction, any state court located within the State of Delaware or, if and only if all such state courts lack subject matter jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware) is the exclusive forum for actions or proceedings brought under Delaware statutory or common law: (1) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; (2) any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty; (3) any action asserting a claim against us arising under the Delaware General Corporation Law; (4) any action regarding our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws; (5) any action as to which the Delaware General Corporation Law confers jurisdiction to the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware; or (6) any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This provision does not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the U.S. federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.
 In addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the federal district courts of the United States of America is the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause or causes of action arising under the Securities Act, including all causes of action asserted against any defendant to such complaint. For the avoidance of doubt, this provision is intended to benefit and may be enforced by us, our officers and directors, the underwriters to any offering giving rise to such complaint, and any other professional entity whose profession gives authority to a statement made by that person or entity and who has prepared or certified any part of the documents underlying the offering.
 These exclusive-forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any of our securities shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to these provisions. There is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce such provisions, and the enforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies’ charter documents has been challenged in legal proceedings. It is possible that a court could find these types of provisions to be inapplicable or unenforceable, and if a court were to find either exclusive-forum provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, which could seriously harm our business. For example, under the Securities Act, federal courts have concurrent jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act, and investors cannot waive compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.
 Risks Related to our Convertible Notes
Servicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt.
 Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness, including the $287.5 million aggregate principal amount of 1.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2027 (the "Notes") that we issued in February 2022, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. If the assumptions underlying our cash flow guidance are incorrect, our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt, including the Notes, and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or issuing additional equity, equity-linked or debt instruments on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. If we are unable to engage in any of these activities or
engage in these activities on desirable terms, we may be unable to meet our debt obligations, including the Notes, which would materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results.
 Conversion of the Notes may dilute the ownership interest of our stockholders or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock.
 The conversion of some or all of the Notes may dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders. Upon conversion of the Notes, we have the option to pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock. If we elect to settle our conversion obligation in shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, any sales in the public market of our common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the Notes could be used to satisfy short positions, or anticipated conversion of the Notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock.
 Certain provisions in the indenture governing the Notes may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover attempt of us.
 Certain provisions in the indenture governing the Notes may make it more difficult or expensive for a third party to acquire us. For example, the indenture governing the Notes will require us, except as described in the indenture, to repurchase the notes for cash upon the occurrence of a "fundamental change" (as defined in the indenture) and, in certain circumstances, to increase the conversion rate for a holder that converts its Notes in connection with a "make-whole fundamental change" (as defined in the indenture). A takeover of us may trigger the requirement that we repurchase the Notes and/or increase the conversion rate, which could make it costlier for a potential acquirer to engage in such takeover. Such additional costs may have the effect of delaying or preventing a takeover of us that would otherwise be beneficial to investors.
 General Risk Factors
 If we fail to retain and motivate members of our management team or other key personnel, our business and future growth prospects would be harmed.
 Our success and future growth depend largely upon the continued services of our executive officers as well as other key personnel. These executives and key personnel have been primarily responsible for determining the strategic direction of the business and executing our growth strategy and are integral to our brand, culture and reputation with buyers and suppliers. From time to time, there may be changes in our executive management team or other key personnel resulting from the hiring or departure of these personnel. The loss of one or more of executive officers, or the failure by the executive team to effectively work with employees and lead the company, could harm our business.
 
Litigation or legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and have a negative impact on our reputation or business.
 From time to time, we may be party to various claims and litigation proceedings. We evaluate these claims and litigation proceedings to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and to estimate, if possible, the amount of potential losses. Based on these assessments and estimates, we may establish reserves, as appropriate. These assessments and estimates are based on the information available to management at the time and involve a significant amount of management judgment. Actual outcomes or losses may differ materially from our assessments and estimates. We are not currently party to any material litigation.
 In the past, securities class action litigation often has been brought against a company following a decline in the market price of its securities. In addition, stockholder activism, which could take many forms and arise in a variety of situations, has been increasing recently, and new universal proxy rules could significantly lower the cost and further increase the ease and likelihood of stockholder activism. This risk is especially relevant for us because technology companies have experienced significant stock price volatility in recent years. Volatility in our stock price or other reasons may in the future cause us to become the target of securities litigation or stockholder activism. Securities litigation and stockholder activism, including potential proxy contests, could result in substantial costs, including significant legal fees and other expenses, and divert our management and board of directors’ attention and resources from our business. Additionally, securities litigation and stockholder activism could give rise to perceived uncertainties as to our future, adversely affect our relationships with customers and business partners, adversely affect our reputation, and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel. Our stock price could also be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by the events, risks and uncertainties of any securities litigation and stockholder activism.
 Even when not merited, the defense of these lawsuits may divert management’s attention, and we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits. The results of litigation and other legal proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse judgments or settlements in some of these legal disputes may result in adverse monetary damages, penalties or injunctive relief against us, which could negatively impact our financial position, cash flows or results of operations. Any claims or litigation, even if fully indemnified or insured, could damage our reputation and make it more difficult to compete effectively or to obtain adequate insurance in the future.

Furthermore, while we maintain insurance for certain potential liabilities, such insurance does not cover all types and amounts of potential liabilities and is subject to various exclusions as well as caps on amounts recoverable. Even if we believe a claim is covered by insurance, insurers may dispute our entitlement to recovery for a variety of potential reasons, which may affect the timing and, if the insurers prevail, the amount of our recovery.
 Changes in tax laws may materially adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.
 New income, sales, use or other tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be enacted at any time, which could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. Further, existing tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be interpreted, changed, modified or applied adversely to us. For example, the Tax Act enacted many significant changes to the U.S. tax laws. Future guidance from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, or the IRS, with respect to the Tax Act may affect us, and certain aspects of the Tax Act could be repealed or modified in future legislation. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or the CARES Act, has already modified certain provisions of the Tax Act. In addition, it is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the Tax Act, the CARES Act or any newly enacted federal tax legislation.
 If we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired.
 As a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the listing standards of The Nasdaq Global Select Market. We expect that the requirements of these rules and regulations will continue to increase our legal, accounting, and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming, and costly, and place significant strain on our personnel, systems, and resources. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In addition, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley-Act, we are now required to perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow our management to furnish a report on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for the fiscal year covered by this Annual Report, and we are also required, as of the date of this Annual Report, to have our independent registered public accounting firm issue an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis.
In order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, we have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to expend, significant resources, including accounting-related costs and significant management oversight. If any of these new or improved controls and systems do not perform as expected, we may experience deficiencies in our controls.
 Our current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in our business. Further, weaknesses in our disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting may be discovered in the future. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement could harm our results of operations or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and may result in a restatement of our financial statements for prior periods. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting also could adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that we will eventually be required to include in our periodic reports that will be filed with the SEC. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our Class A common stock. In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on The Nasdaq Global Select Market.
If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, the market price of our common shares could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by The Nasdaq Global Select Market, the SEC or other regulatory authorities. Any failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition and could cause a decline in the market price of our Class A common stock.

We have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. If we are unable to remediate this material weakness, or if other control deficiencies are identified, we may not be able to accurately or timely report our financial condition or results of operations in the future.
 During our first assessment of internal control over financial reporting, as required under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting that existed as of December 31, 2022. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We did not identify any misstatements to the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 because of the material weakness.

On December 9, 2021, the Company completed its acquisition of Thomas Publishing, Inc. (“Thomas”). The additional workload on our resources to integrate Thomas contributed to the Company’s inability to timely perform an effective risk assessment related to the achievement of its control objectives in certain processes, primarily revenue and costs of revenue. As a result, we were unable to design and operate effective process-level controls as of December 31, 2022.
 Our management has concluded that, notwithstanding the identified material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, the financial statements in this filing fairly present, in all material respects, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with U.S. GAAP.
 Management has implemented remediation steps to address the material weakness and to improve our internal control over financial reporting. Specifically, now that Thomas has been fully integrated, we have improved our review processes over risk assessment, which also includes the documentation to support the operating effectiveness of our controls. While the Company has implemented remediation steps, the material weakness cannot be considered fully remediated until the improved controls have been in place and operate for a sufficient period of time. If we are unable to remediate this material weakness, or if other control deficiencies are identified, we may not be able to accurately or timely report our financial condition or results of operations in the future.
