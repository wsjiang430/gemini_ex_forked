Overview 
Travelzoo (including its subsidiaries and affiliates, the “Company” or “we”) is a global Internet media company. Travelzoo® provides its 30 million members with exclusive offers and one-of-a-kind experiences personally reviewed by our deal experts around the globe. We have our finger on the pulse of outstanding travel, entertainment, and lifestyle experiences. We work in partnership with more than 5,000 top travel suppliers—our long-standing relationships give Travelzoo members access to irresistible offers. 
Travelzoo attracts a high-quality audience of travel enthusiasts across multiple digital platforms, including email, websites, social media and mobile applications. The Travelzoo website is visited by 5.4 million to 6.6 million unique visitors each month. We have over 4.5 million followers on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. Our Apple and Android mobile applications have been downloaded 7.4 million times.
Our most important products and services are the Travelzoo website (travelzoo.com), the Travelzoo iPhone and Android apps, the Top 20® email newsletter, the Travelzoo Network, and Jack's Flight Club®. Our Travelzoo website and newsletters include Local Deals and Getaways listings that allow our members to purchase vouchers for offers from local businesses such as spas, hotels and restaurants. Jack's Flight Club is a subscription service that provides members with information about exceptional airfares.
We also license Travelzoo products and our intellectual property to licensees in various countries in Asia Pacific, including but not limited to Australia, Japan and Southeast Asia. 
 In March 2022, we announced the development of Travelzoo META, a subscription service that intends to provide members with exclusive access to innovative, high quality Metaverse travel experiences. On December 30, 2022, we acquired Metaverse Travel Experiences, Inc., now Metaverse Travel Experiences, LLC (“MTE”), a Metaverse experience scouting business to support Travelzoo META. 
As of December 31, 2022, we had 30.4 million members worldwide. In North America, the unduplicated number of Travelzoo members was 16.3 million as of December 31, 2022, down 4% from December 31, 2021. In Europe, the unduplicated number of Travelzoo members was 9.0 million as of December 31, 2022, up 8% from December 31, 2021. Jack’s Flight Club had 1.9 million subscribers as of December 31, 2022, up 8% from December 31, 2021.
More than 5,000 travel and local providers use our advertising and marketing services, including Air France, Air New Zealand, Air Tahiti Nui, Alaska Airlines, Cathay Pacific Airways, Club Med, Emirates, Etihad, Exoticca, Fairmont Hotels and Resorts, Fiji Airways, Gate 1 Travel, Hilton Hotels & Resorts, Hyatt Corporation, Icelandair, InterContinental Hotels Group, Lion World Travel, Myrtle Beach Area Conventions & Visitors Bureau, Princess Cruises, Royal Caribbean, Singapore Airlines, Starwood Hotels & Resorts and United Airlines.
Revenues from the Travelzoo brand and business are generated primarily from advertising fees from two categories of revenue: Travel and Local. The “Travel” category consists of advertising or publishing revenues, primarily (a) listing fees paid by travel companies for the publishing of their offers on Travelzoo’s media properties and (b) commission from the sale of Getaways vouchers. Listing fees are based on audience reach, placement, number of listings, number of impressions, number of clicks, and actual sales. For publishing revenue, we recognize revenue upon delivery of the emails and delivery of the clicks, over the period of the placement of the advertising. For Getaways vouchers, we recognize a percentage of the face value of the vouchers upon the sale of the vouchers. The "Local" category consists of publishing revenue for negotiated high quality offers from local businesses, such as restaurants, spas, shows, and other activities and includes Local Deals vouchers and entertainment offers. 
Jack’s Flight Club revenue is generated from paid subscriptions by members. Subscription options are quarterly, semi-annually, and annually. We recognize the revenue monthly pro rata over the subscription period.
The Company also has licensing arrangements with licensees in (a) Australia, New Zealand, and Southeast Asia and (b) Japan and South Korea, in each case, where the Company is entitled to a quarterly royalty payment based on a percentage of net revenue. The Company records royalties on a one-quarter lag basis and recognized $25,000 and $12,000 in royalties in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Under the licensing agreements, Travelzoo's existing members in the applicable territories will continue to be owned by the Company as the licensor.
In connection with the development of Travelzoo META, the Company acquired MTE, a wholly owned subsidiary of Azzurro Capital Inc. ("Azzurro"), and also completed a private placement of newly issued shares. Ralph Bartel, who founded the Company, is the sole beneficiary of the Ralph Bartel 2005 Trust, which is the controlling shareholder of Azzurro. Azzurro was the Company’s largest shareholder as of the time of this transaction and Azzurro and Ralph Bartel owned as of December 31, 2022 approximately 50.3% the Company's outstanding shares. On December 28, 2022, the stockholders of Travelzoo approved the issuance and sale of 3.4 million shares of common stock (the “Shares”) of Travelzoo to Azzurro, in exchange for certain consideration, and on December 30, 2022 (the “Closing Date”), the transaction was consummated. The closing price of Travelzoo’s common stock on December 30, 2022 was $4.45 per share, resulting in an aggregate fair value $15.2 million. The Purchase Price was paid as follows: (a) $1.0 million in cash paid on the Closing Date; (b) $4.8 million paid in the form of a promissory note issued on the Closing Date and payable by June 30, 2023 with accrued interest of 12%; and (c) the transfer to the Company of all outstanding capital stock of Metaverse Travel Experiences, Inc. (“MTE”), which transfer was effected pursuant to a merger of MTE with a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company on the Closing Date. The Company recorded the $4.8 million promissory note as Note receivable from shareholder in the stockholders' equity section on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022. 
In January 2022 and July 2022, the Company’s German branch of Travelzoo (Europe) Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (“Travelzoo Germany”), received the notification and payment of approximately $1.2 million and $494,000, respectively, from the German Federal Government Bridging Aid III plan and Bridging Aid III+. This program was for companies that suffered a pandemic-related decrease in sales of at least 30% in one month compared to the reference month in 2019. Travelzoo Germany applied for the funding in 2021 and 2022, respectively, and was approved by the German government in January 2022 and July of 2022. The Company has to submit a final declaration in connection with this grant by June 30, 2023. The Company believes it was eligible to participate in the plan and is entitled to the payment and does not expect significant changes to the amount already received from the final submission. The Company recorded $1.2 million and $494,000 gains in Other income, net in the first and third quarters of 2022.
In April 2020 and May 2020, the Company received $3.1 million and $535,000, respectively, pursuant to loans under the Paycheck Protection Program (the “PPP”) of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) administered by the Small Business Association. In 2021, the principal and the interest of the $3.1 million PPP loan were forgiven and a gain was recorded, the Company also settled the $535,000 PPP loan, $429,000 was forgiven which was recorded as a gain and the remaining outstanding balance of the loan and interest of $111,000 was paid off in 2021.
Historically, the Company managed its business geographically and operated in three reportable segments including Asia Pacific, Europe and North America. In 2020, the Company classified the results of its Asia Pacific segment as discontinued operations in its consolidated financial statements for all periods presented. On January 13, 2020, Travelzoo purchased 60% of the outstanding shares of JFC Travel Group Co. (“Jack’s Flight Club”). Upon acquisition, the Company reviewed and evaluated Jack's Flight Club as a separate segment. The Company currently has three reportable operating segments: Travelzoo North America, Travelzoo Europe and Jack’s Flight Club. Travelzoo North America consists of the Company’s operations in Canada and the U.S. Travelzoo Europe consists of the Company’s operations in France, Germany, Spain, and the UK. Jack’s Flight Club consists of subscription revenue from premium members to access and receive flight deals from Jack’s Flight Club via email or via Android or Apple mobile applications. For the year ended December 31, 2022, Travelzoo North America operations were 67% of revenues, Travelzoo Europe operations were 28% of revenues and Jack’s Flight Club operations were 5% of revenues. Financial information with respect to our business segments and certain financial information about geographic areas appears in Note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 
Our principal business office is located at 590 Madison Avenue, 35th Floor, New York, New York 10022.

Travelzoo is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “TZOO.” 
Our Industry 
The outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19) in 2020 had a material impact on the global travel and hospitality industries, including severe restrictions on travel, dining and in-person activities (through border closures, quarantine and stay-at-home requirements, travel restrictions, limited operations of restaurants, spas, hotels, airlines and travel agencies, etc.), as well as on the level of economic activity around the globe. As the Company and many of our advertisers are part of the global travel and hospitality industries, the measures implemented to contain COVID-19 had a significant negative effect on our business. Many of the Company's advertising partners paused, canceled, and/or stopped advertising. Additionally, there were significant levels of cancellations for the Company's hotel partners and travel package partners and refund requests for our vouchers. As airlines were unable to complete or cancelled flights and routes, and people were significantly restricted from traveling, the need for flight alert services was greatly reduced, and consequently the premium membership of Jack’s Flight Club declined.
However, in 2021, we saw many of the effects of the pandemic start to subside, as countries began to accept tourists, travel opened up again and travel demand in general started to return to pre-pandemic levels. Advertising clients who had previously paused or cancelled placements with us began to return and ramp up spending again. Airlines began adding flights and routes back, increasing inventory, and with the returning demand for travel, the need for flight alert services returned. Consumer demand in many ways outpaced the readiness of airlines, hotels and restaurants, who had drastically cut staff to save costs in response to the pandemic. This, in some cases, resulted in an under-supply, causing airline and hotel room prices to increase. In 2021, we also started to see the way that the pandemic impacted the economies of various countries, resulting in many cases in significant inflation and decreases in discretionary spending by consumers
While some of these trends continued into 2022, as airlines, hotels and restaurants returned to normal operations, we have seen an increase in supply, resulting in many of our partners working with us again to provide exclusive offers for our members. According to the World Trade & Tourism Council (WTTC), the global Travel & Tourism industry produced $5.8 trillion in value for the total global economy in 2021 compared to $4.7 trillion in 2020. The global economy from travel and tourism is set to grow on average by 5.8% annually between 2022 and 2032 based on WTTC's August 2022 report. In 2022, however, we also continued to see increases in the airfare prices, which according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Consumer Price Index data, hit an all-time high in May 2022.
Our mission is to provide our audience with the highest quality information about the best travel, entertainment and local offers. Our revenues are generated from advertising and subscription fees. According to Zenith Media's forecast in June 2022, global advertising expenditure will continue its recovery from the 2020 pandemic with 8% growth in 2022, after 15.6% growth in 2021. Zenith forecasted that global ad spend will increased by $58 billion to $781 billion in 2022 from $723 billion in 2021. Based upon this outlook for the travel industry, we believe that we are well positioned with our operations in Europe and North America to capture high quality travel and entertainment offers for our members. With increasing air fares, we believe that our Jack’s Flight Club subscription flight alert service will be more relevant than ever.
Digital Advertising 
Digital advertising, a notable market in which we operate, has been growing continuously. According to Zenith Media, digital advertising is expected to account for 62% of global advertising spending in 2022 and 65% by 2024. In addition, according to the Kelsey Group's (BIA/Kelsey) new U.S. Local Media Forecast in November 2022, BIA/Kelsey estimates total local advertising spending to be $166 billion in 2023, indicating a 4.8% increase over year-over-year. Although traditional media outlets such as newspapers, television and radio continue to be another medium for travel, entertainment and local businesses to advertise offers, the percentage spent on advertising in these traditional media outlets has been decreasing.
We believe that several factors are causing and will continue to cause travel, entertainment and local businesses to focus a majority of their spending on the digital advertising of offers: 
    The Internet Is Consumers' Preferred Information Source. Market research shows that the Internet is consumers' preferred information source for travel. 
    Benefits of Internet Advertising vs. Print, TV and Radio Advertising. Internet advertising provides advertisers advantages compared to traditional advertising. These advantages include real-time listings, real-time updates, and performance tracking. The Internet also allows advertisers to advertise their sales and specials in a fast, flexible, and cost-effective manner. 
    Suppliers Selling Directly. We believe that many travel suppliers prefer to sell directly to consumers through suppliers' websites versus selling through travel agents.
    Reach to Consumers. With a majority of consumers transacting on their computers, tablets and phones on a daily basis, we believe digital advertising is the best way for businesses to quickly provide relevant information and enter into a consumer’s decision set. 
We believe that travel, entertainment and local businesses often face the challenge of being able to effectively and quickly market and sell their excess inventory (i.e. airline seats, hotel rooms, cruise cabins, theater seats, spa appointments or restaurant seats that are likely to be unfilled) and therefore need a fast, flexible, and cost-effective solution for marketing excess inventory. The solution must be fast, because such travel-related services are a quickly expiring commodity. The solution must be flexible, because the demand for excess inventory is difficult to forecast. The marketing must be cost-effective, because excess inventory is often sold at highly discounted prices, which lowers margins. It is also integral that advertisements for excess inventory and travel offers be timely and able to convey information (such as mistake fares or rates, flash sales, etc.) to a large number of consumers quickly.
We believe that newspaper, TV and radio advertising, with respect to advertising excess inventory, suffers from a number of limitations which do not apply to digital advertising and media: 
•typically, ads must be submitted 2 to 5 days prior to the publication or airing date, which makes it difficult to advertise last-minute inventory; 
•once an ad is published, it cannot be updated or deleted when an offer is sold out; 
•once an ad is published, the company cannot change a price or offer; 
•in many markets, the small number of newspapers, television companies, radio stations and other print media reduces competition, resulting in high rates for traditional advertising;  
•offline advertising does not allow for detailed performance tracking;
•creative content can be very expensive to develop; and
•delivery of traditional media can be slow, with limited touchpoints to a consumer.
 We believe the core Travelzoo business is well positioned to continue to assist travel partners with advertising their excess inventory, in a way that traditional newspaper, TV and radio advertising cannot, particularly as the demand for travel readjusts to normal levels post-pandemic.
Subscription Services and the Metaverse
Since its inception, Travelzoo has provided free subscription services to its members. With free subscription services to consumers, revenue is generated from advertising fees and commissions. Upon the acquisition of Jack’s Flight Club, we entered the market for paid subscription services and added an additional revenue stream to our business. According to Juniper Research, which collects data from 27 countries, the collected global subscription economy in 2021 was at $224 billion dollars and was expected to grow to $275 billion in 2022. Although physical goods are estimated to represent 45% of the subscription market, digital services, will be a major revenue stream, representing 39% of the global subscription market. 
Additionally, a new and potentially large market in which we are starting to operate is that of the Metaverse and specifically, Metaverse travel experiences. According to a report published by ReportLinker in February 2022, the U.S. Metaverse market in 2021 was estimated at approximately $58.5 billion, which accounted for 41% of global market share. In 2022, the Metaverse market size in terms of revenue was estimated to be $61.8 billion and is anticipated to rise to $426.9 billion by 2027. We believe that our development of a new paid subscription service for Metaverse travel experiences will enable us to be a first-mover in this fast-growing space. Our acquisition of MTE, a business focused on scouting creators of Metaverse experiences, will allow us to build a collection of high quality, exclusive experiences for members.
