     Item 1. Business
     Overview
     We are a specialty pharmaceutical company committed to being the leader in responsible pain management. Our first product, Xtampza ER, is an abuse-deterrent, extended-release, oral formulation of oxycodone. In April 2016, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, approved our New Drug Application, or NDA, for Xtampza ER for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate. In June 2016, we announced the commercial launch of Xtampza ER.
     Our product portfolio also includes Nucynta ER and Nucynta IR, or the Nucynta Products. In December 2017, we entered into a Commercialization Agreement with Assertio Therapeutics, Inc. (formerly known as Depomed), or Assertio, pursuant to which we acquired the right to commercialize the Nucynta Products in the United States and began marketing the Nucynta Products in February 2018. Nucynta ER is an extended-release, or ER, formulation of tapentadol that is indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around the clock, long term opioid treatment, including neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy in adults, and for which alternate treatment options are inadequate. Nucynta IR is an immediate-release formulation of tapentadol that is indicated for the management of acute pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatments are inadequate in adults.
     For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, we generated $280.4 million in net revenues, comprised of $69.4 million from sales of Xtampza ER and $211.0 million from sales of the Nucynta Products.
     We are headquartered in Stoughton, Massachusetts and our common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, or NASDAQ, under the trading symbol “COLL.”
     Pain, Pain Management and Opioid Abuse in the United States
     Acute and Chronic Pain
     Pain can be classified along many different variables, including severity, duration and etiology. There are two broad categories of pain based on duration: acute pain, or pain that is self-limited and generally requires treatment for no more than up to a few weeks, and chronic pain, or pain that lasts beyond the healing of an injury or that persists longer than 3-6 months. Chronic pain affects between 50-100 million U.S. adults annually, with as many as 19.6 million of those adults experiencing high impact chronic pain, defined as pain that interferes with daily life or work activities.  Acute pain is even more prevalent and can occur after an injury, burn, or trauma or after surgery. Moreover, acute pain and chronic pain are closely related: nearly all cases of chronic pain begin as acute pain. 
     Chronic pain leads to over $560 billion in healthcare and productivity costs each year according to the Institute of Medicine. Patients with chronic pain make an estimated ten more physician visits per year than those without chronic pain and see more doctors. In addition, studies suggest that healthcare costs for people suffering from chronic pain are higher, and often substantially higher, than for those without chronic pain.
     The Role of Prescription Opioids in the Treatment of Pain
     Prescription opioids continue to serve as important tools in the treatment of acute and chronic pain where alternative treatments have been inadequate. Prescription opioids are available in immediate-release formulations as well as in

extended-release formulations, which incorporate a time-release mechanism designed to deliver steady amounts of opioid, typically over 12 to 24 hours. Extended-release opioids are designed to offer more convenient dosing with a longer period of consistent blood levels of the active drug as compared to immediate-release formulations.  
     In 2018, there were approximately 189 million prescriptions for opioids written in the United States, representing a 12 % decline from 2017 levels and including approximately 4.3 million prescriptions for branded extended-release opioids, approximately 16 million prescriptions for generic extended-release opioids, and greater than 168 million prescriptions for immediate-release opioids.
     Increasingly, practitioners and regulators are focusing on multidisciplinary, multimodal approaches to pain management, including opioid and nonopioid medications, physical and psychotherapy, and exercise. Recognizing the role that opioid therapy continues to play in effective pain management, these groups are advocating for best practices that support appropriate opioid prescribing practices that may minimize risk of addiction and other adverse events to patients.
     Prescription Opioid Abuse is an Epidemic in the United States
 Prescription opioids of all kinds, including both immediate-release and extended-release formulations, are subject to manipulation, misuse, and abuse. Abuse-deterrent technologies, including the DETERx platform that is incorporated in Xtampza ER, have emerged to reduce the risk of abuse of prescription opioids, but these technologies do not eliminate the possibility of misuse and abuse.
     Extended-release opioids, with their large payload of active pharmaceutical ingredient, may be especially attractive to potential abusers, who tamper with these formulations to overcome the extended-release mechanism and achieve the euphoria that results from rapid increases in the blood concentration of the active pharmaceutical ingredient, a potentially fatal activity known as dose dumping. 
     The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, described abuse of prescription drugs in the United States as a vast and deadly epidemic. According to a 2018 CDC report, there were a record-high 63,632 drug overdose deaths in the United States in 2017, representing a rate of 19.8 per 100,000 persons. Prescription and/or illicit opioids were involved in 42,249, or 66.4%, of these drug overdose deaths, with over 17,000 of these fatalities attributed to prescription opioids alone. Although the most recent data available suggests that overdose fatalities in the United States are now declining from their peak in 2017, the CDC reports that there were still 46,151 drug overdose deaths relating to prescription and/or illicit opioids during the twelve months ended May 2018. 
     The opioid epidemic has, in addition to its death toll, imposed significant burdens on the U.S. healthcare system. In 2015, an estimated 78,840 hospitalizations occurred for opioid-related poisonings in the U.S. In addition, 2015 saw an estimated 140,077 emergency department visits for opioid-related poisonings in the U.S. A nonprofit group that studies the health economy recently estimated that the opioid epidemic has cost the U.S. more than a trillion dollars since 2001, based on CDC mortality data through June of 2017. The greatest financial cost of the epidemic, according to the report, is in lost earnings and productivity losses to employers.
     Despite the reduction in opioid prescriptions and the heightened awareness of the risks associated with opioid use, abuse of prescription opioids, including extended-release formulations, continues to be a major public health issue. In 2016, an estimated 11,824,000, or 4.4% of persons aged 12 and older, reported opioid misuse in the prior year. In response to issues surrounding abuse of prescription opioids, pharmaceutical companies have developed novel, abuse-deterrent formulation strategies. Abuse-deterrent formulations target the known or expected routes of abuse, such as crushing in order to snort or dissolving in order to inject, for the specific opioid drug substance. The FDA has encouraged the development of prescription opioids with abuse-deterrent formulations to help combat the opioid crisis, and expanding access to abuse deterrent formulations is part of the FDA’s comprehensive Opioids Action Plan. 
     Legislative and Regulatory Actions
     In response to widespread prescription opioid abuse, the U.S. government and a number of state legislatures have enacted legislation and regulations intended to fight the opioid epidemic. The number and scope of legislative and regulatory actions, particularly in the last three years, emphasize the severity of the opioid epidemic and its impact on our society. The FDA has stated that addressing prescription drug abuse is a priority and has reaffirmed that the development of abuse-deterrent opioids is a key part of that strategy.

     Recent actions to address the opioid abuse epidemic include:
    
· | FDA guidance: In April 2015, the FDA adopted final guidance regarding studies and clinical trials that should be conducted to demonstrate that a given formulation has abuse-deterrent properties, how those studies and clinical trials will be evaluated, and what product labeling claims may be approved based on the results of those studies and clinical trials. The guidance describes four categories of abuse-deterrence studies and clinical trials: Categories 1, 2 and 3 consist of pre-marketing studies and clinical trials designed to evaluate a product candidate’s potentially abuse-deterrent properties under controlled conditions, while Category 4, post-marketing clinical trials and studies, assesses the real-world impact of abuse-deterrent formulations. The final guidance also provides examples of product label claims that may be made based on the results of the corresponding studies and clinical trials.

· | FDA Opioids Action Plan: In February 2016, the FDA released an action plan to address the opioid abuse epidemic and reassess the FDA’s approach to opioid medications. The FDA’s plan is part of a broader initiative led by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, to address opioid-related overdose, death and dependence. As part of the HHS initiative:

o | CDC Prescribing Guidelines: In March 2016, the CDC released a new Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain intended to assist primary care providers treating adults for chronic pain in outpatient settings. The guideline provides recommendations to improve communications between doctors and patients about the risks and benefits of opioid therapy for chronic pain, improve the safety and effectiveness of pain treatment, and reduce the risks associated with long-term opioid therapy.

o | Enhanced Warnings and Safety Labeling: In March 2016, the FDA announced required enhanced warnings for immediate-release opioid pain medications related to risks of misuse, abuse, addiction, overdose, and death. Subsequently, there have been several class-wide labeling changes, including the addition of boxed warnings relating to serious risks of using certain opioids medications along with benzodiazepines and other central nervous system depressants, including alcohol (Decembers 2016); and additional information relating to the new class-wide REMS (Septembers 2018).

· | Passage of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA and CARA 2.0): In 2016, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, or CARA, was enacted to address the national epidemics of prescription opioid abuse and heroin use. Consistent with the initiatives of HHS, this legislation sought to, among other things, expand the availability of naloxone for law enforcement and other first responders; form an interagency task force to develop best practices for pain management with opioid medications; and provide resources to improve state monitoring of controlled substances, including opioids. In 2018, CARA 2.0 was introduced as follow-up legislation to limit initial prescriptions for opioids to 3 days, while exempting initial prescriptions for chronic care, cancer care, hospice or end of life care, and palliative care. CARA 2.0 also increased civil and criminal penalties for opioid manufacturers that fail to report suspicious orders for opioids or fail to maintain effective controls against diversion of opioids.

· | Passage of the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act (SUPPORT Act): In November 2018, the SUPPORT Act was enacted as a comprehensive legislative response to the continuing opioid epidemic. It includes a number of measures directed towards regulation and improvement of treatment for substance use-disorder and increased coverage by CMS of medically-assisted treatment options. In addition, the SUPPORT Act requires HHS to report to Congress on existing barriers to access to abuse-deterrent opioid formulations by Medicare Part C and D beneficiaries.

 Xtampza ER
 In April 2016, the FDA approved our NDA for Xtampza ER (extended-release oxycodone) for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate. The approved labeling for Xtampza ER includes human abuse potential studies, as well as data supporting the administration of the product as a sprinkle or administered through feeding tubes. In June 2016, we launched Xtampza ER in the United States. Xtampza ER is formulated using our novel abuse-deterrent technology platform, DETERx, which provides extended-release delivery, while also providing barriers to common methods of abuse and misuse (e.g., crushing, chewing, heating and injecting). This technology combines an active opioid ingredient with a fatty acid and waxes to form microspheres that are filled into a capsule – these wax-based microspheres are designed to resist particle size reduction and dose dumping when subjected to physical and chemical manipulation. Xtampza ER’s label indicates a dosing regimen of one capsule every 12 hours and it must be taken with food. 
     Xtampza ER, OxyContin OP from Purdue, and the authorized generic version of OxyContin (which is identical to the branded version) are the only extended-release oxycodone products marketed in the United States as of January 2019. In 2018, the extended-release oxycodone (OER) market generated approximately $1.8 billion in U.S. sales and there were approximately 3.4 million prescriptions written. OxyContin is the largest selling extended-release oxycodone (and largest-selling branded extended-release opioid) in the United States by dollars and prescription volume, with approximately $1.5 billion in U.S. sales and approximately 2.6 million prescriptions written in 2018. Relative to 2017, dollars generated by sales for OxyContin and its authorized generic forms written in the United States in 2018 declined 19 %, with a 21% decline prescription volume. In 2018, there were approximately 327,000 prescriptions of Xtampza ER written.
     Xtampza ER and OxyContin OP (along with its authorized generic) feature the same active pharmaceutical ingredient and feature abuse-deterrent technologies – though the abuse deterrent technologies are designed differently. In November 2017, we announced FDA approval of a Supplemental New Drug Application, or sNDA, for Xtampza ER to include comparative oral pharmacokinetic data from a clinical study evaluating the effect of physical manipulation by crushing Xtampza ER compared with OxyContin OP and a control (oxycodone hydrochloride immediate-release). In the study, Xtampza ER maintained its extended-release pharmacokinetic profile when crushed, while OxyContin OP showed a rapid release of oxycodone when crushed with common household tools; crushed OxyContin OP was bioequivalent to crushed oxycodone IR. The sNDA also added results from an oral human abuse potential study and an oral abuse deterrent claim to the label, making Xtampza ER the only single-agent extended-release oxycodone with oral, intranasal, and intravenous abuse-deterrent labeling.
     We believe Xtampza ER represents an abuse-deterrent extended-release oxycodone formulation and is well-positioned to capture a significant share of extended-release oxycodone market.
     Nucynta ER and Nucynta IR
     In December 2017, we entered into the Nucynta Commercialization Agreement, pursuant to which Assertio agreed to grant us a sublicense of certain of its intellectual property related to the Nucynta Products for commercialization of such products in the United States. On January 9, 2018, we amended the Nucynta Commercialization Agreement and consummated the transactions contemplated thereby.
     Pursuant to the Nucynta Commercialization Agreement, we assumed all commercialization responsibilities, including sales and marketing, for the Nucynta Products, while Assertio continues to control manufacturing of the Nucynta Products. We began shipping and recognizing product sales on the Nucynta Products on January 9, 2018 and we began commercial promotion of the Nucynta Products in February 2018. The Nucynta Commercialization Agreement initially required us to pay guaranteed minimum royalty of $135.0 million per year through December 2021, as well as a variable royalty based on annual net sales over $233.0 million. On November 8, 2018, we announced an amendment to certain terms of the Nucynta Commercialization Agreement, which adjusted the royalty structure such that beginning on January 1, 2019 and thereafter, we are obligated to make royalty payments to Assertio conditional upon net sales, and the $135.0 million guaranteed minimum annual royalties were eliminated after 2018.
     Nucynta ER is an extended-release formulation of tapentadol that is indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long term opioid treatment, and for which alternate treatment options are inadequate. Nucynta ER is also the only extended-release opioid approved by the FDA for management of the

neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Nucynta IR is an immediate-release formulation of tapentadol that is indicated for the management of acute pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatments are inadequate in adults. Nucynta ER and Nucynta IR are the only tapentadol-based products marketed in the US and the drug substance is patent-protected.
     Nucynta ER’s label includes data from separate clinical trials that demonstrate its efficacy in improving pain intensity for patients suffering from chronic low back pain and neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Nucynta IR’s label includes data from a clinical trial that demonstrates its efficacy in improving pain intensity for post-surgical acute pain.
    
Manufacturing of Our Products
     Overview
     Xtampza ER is manufactured using a proprietary process. This process is reproducible, scalable and cost-efficient, and we believe that the microsphere formulation — and the related manufacturing process — is unique in the extended-release opioid market. To date, we have produced Xtampza ER at a contract manufacturing organization, Patheon, a subsidiary of Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc. Our microsphere production is currently conducted in an area of the manufacturing plant that is shared with other clients. We are in the process of building out a dedicated manufacturing suite within the same Patheon site. Patheon has an established record of manufacturing products approved in the United States, including products containing controlled substances. We own all of the intellectual property, including know-how and specialized manufacturing equipment, necessary to be able to replicate the manufacturing equipment currently located at Patheon’s facility at an alternative location (and with an alternative vendor) if necessary.
     Pursuant to our Nucynta Commercialization Agreement, Assertio is responsible for manufacturing and delivering to us the Nucynta Products for commercialization in the United States. As part of our partnership with Assertio, we participate in a Joint Manufacturing Steering Committee with our counterparts at Assertio, through which we take part in decisions regarding the commercial manufacturing of the Nucynta Products. 
     Drug Substances
     The active pharmaceutical ingredient used in Xtampza ER, oxycodone base, is an odorless white crystalline powder. We currently procure this active pharmaceutical ingredient pursuant to a supply agreement with a single U.S.-based manufacturer. We are aware of other suppliers who we would expect to be able to satisfy our commercial orders.
     The active pharmaceutical ingredient used in the Nucynta Products is tapentadol, which is supplied to Assertio, the manufacturer of the Nucynta Products, by a single U.S.-based manufacturer.  
     Oxycodone base and tapentadol are classified as narcotic controlled substances under U.S. federal law. Accordingly, Xtampza ER and the Nucynta Products are classified by the DEA as Schedule II controlled substances, meaning that they have a high potential for abuse and dependence among drugs that are recognized as having an accepted medical use. Consequently, the manufacturing, shipping, dispensing and storing of our products are subject to a high degree of regulation, as described in more detail under the caption “— Governmental Regulation — DEA and Opioid Regulation.” 
     Marketing and Commercialization
     We commercialize Xtampza ER and the Nucynta Products in the United States with a dedicated field sales force, consisting of approximately 150 sales representatives and managers, to call on the approximately 10,700 physicians who write approximately 60% of the branded extended-release opioid prescriptions in the United States, with a primary focus on pain specialists. In addition, we employ medical science liaisons, or MSLs, to respond to clinician inquiries about Xtampza ER and the Nucynta Products. We also employ a market‑access team to support our formulary approval and payor contracting.
     We have developed positioning and messaging campaigns, a publication strategy, initiatives with payor organizations, and distribution and national accounts strategies. Our marketing strategy focuses on increasing awareness of the differentiated features of Xtampza ER and the Nucynta Products.

 We primarily sell our products to wholesalers, retail drug store chains, supermarket chains, mass merchandisers, distributors, mail order accounts, hospitals and government agencies. Our wholesalers and distributors purchase products
 from us and, in turn, supply products to retail drug store chains, independent pharmacies and managed health care organizations. Customers in the managed health care market include health maintenance organizations, nursing homes, hospitals, clinics, pharmacy benefit management companies and mail order customers. Three of our customers comprised 10% or more of our revenue during the year ended December 31, 2018. These customers comprised 36%, 31% and 27% of revenue, respectively.
     Intellectual Property 
     The protection of patents, designs, trademarks and other proprietary rights that we own or license are critical to our success and competitive position. Xtampza ER is protected by fourteen issued patents in the United States (seven of which claim compositions of matter, three of which claim both compositions of matter and methods of use, and two that claim methods of use), one granted and two pending applications in the European Patent Office, two issued patents in Canada, and one issued patent in each of Japan and Australia. Finally, we have six patent applications pending in the United States, one pending patent application in each of Canada and Japan, and one pending PCT application. Our issued U.S. patents are projected to expire in 2023, 2025, 2030, and 2036 and our pending patent applications in the United States, if issued, would be projected to expire in 2023, and 2025. In addition, we use a unique and proprietary process to manufacture our products that requires significant know‑how, which we currently protect as trade secrets.
     We have concluded that some of our technology is best protected as proprietary know-how, rather than through obtaining patents. Except for the licenses and sublicenses contained in our Nucynta Commercialization Agreement, pursuant to which we commercialize the Nucynta Products in the United States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, our technology and products are not in-licensed from any third party, and we own all of the rights to Xtampza ER. We believe we have freedom to operate in the United States and other countries, but there can be no assurance that other companies, known and unknown, will not attempt to assert their intellectual property against us.
     We also rely on trademarks and trade designs to develop and maintain our competitive position. We have received trademark registration for Collegium Pharmaceutical, Inc., DETERx, and Xtampza ER in the United States, and license the right to use trademarks associated with the Nucynta Products.
     We also depend upon the skills, knowledge and experience of our scientific and technical personnel, as well as that of our advisors, consultants and other contractors. To help protect our proprietary know-how that is not patentable, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests. To this end, we generally require our employees, consultants and advisors to enter into confidentiality agreements prohibiting the disclosure of confidential information and, in some cases, requiring disclosure and assignment to us of the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions important to our business. Additionally, these confidentiality agreements require that our employees, consultants and advisors do not bring to us, or use without proper authorization, any third party’s proprietary technology.
     Competition
     Our industry is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. We face competition and potential competition from a number of sources, including pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, generic drug companies, drug delivery companies and academic and research institutions. Most of the existing and potential competitors have significantly more financial and other resources than we do.
     Xtampza ER
     Currently, the only extended-release opioid drugs on the market that have an abuse-deterrent product label, in addition to Xtampza ER, are OxyContin OP and Hysingla®, both from Purdue, Embeda from Pfizer, and MorphaBond ER from Daiichi Sankyo. Hysingla is a once a day hydrocodone product. Embeda is a combination of morphine and naltrexone, an opioid antagonist that contains a boxed warning on its product label stating that “the capsules are not to be crushed, dissolved, or chewed due to the risk of rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of morphine.” MorphaBond ER is a twice daily morphine product formulated with a hard tablet and gelling polymers.

 In addition, there are four other extended-release opioids that have been approved with abuse deterrent product labeling Targiniq from Purdue, Arymo from Egalet, Vantrela ER from Teva, and Troxyca ER from Pfizer, none of which are currently on the market. In 2018, the NDAs for Vantrela ER and Troxyca ER were withdrawn by the FDA at the request of the sponsors. Targiniq is a combination of oxycodone and naloxone, an opioid antagonist. Vantrela ER is a twice daily hydrocodone product. Troxyca ER is a combination of oxycodone and naltrexone, an opioid antagonist. A number of other large and small companies are developing abuse deterrent drugs for pain. Many other companies have products indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe, around-the-clock, long-term pain for which alternative treatments are not available, but these products do not have abuse-deterrent claims in their labels, including Pernix and Mallinckrodt, as well as several generic companies.
     We believe the key competitive factors that will affect the commercial success of Xtampza ER include the degree of abuse deterrence, bioavailability, therapeutic efficacy, and convenience of dosing and distribution, as well as their safety, cost and tolerability profiles. Xtampza ER may also face competition from commercially available generic and branded extended-release and long-acting opioid drugs other than oxycodone, including fentanyl, hydromorphone, oxymorphone and methadone, as well as opioids that are currently in clinical development, including a generic version of Xtampza ER for which Teva recently submitted an Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA, to the FDA and which is the subject of patent infringement litigation filed by us in February 2018.
     Xtampza ER competes against all extended-release opioids, including Purdue’s OxyContin OP and its authorized generics. Although no generic oxycodone extended-release products are currently commercially available, it is possible that generic forms of OxyContin OP could become available, in which case Xtampza ER would compete with any such generic oxycodone extended-release products.  
     Additionally, we are aware of companies with oxycodone product candidates in late-stage development, including Intellipharmaceutics, Nektar Therapeutics and Pain Therapeutics. If these products are successfully developed, approved for marketing and become commercially available, they could represent significant competition for Xtampza ER. It is also possible that a company that has developed an abuse-deterrent technology could initiate an abuse-deterrent oxycodone program at any time.
     The Nucynta Products
     Nucynta ER competes against other long-acting opioid medications, including: OxyContin; Butrans; Belbuca; and Embeda.
     Nucynta IR competes primarily against short-acting opioids used for the management of moderate to severe acute pain in adults. There are numerous such medicines, including: generic hydrocodone acetaminophen; generic oxycodone; generic oxycodone acetaminophen; and generic tramadol.     Government Regulation
     FDA Approval Process
     In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FD&C Act, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, withdrawal of the product from the market, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution. Failure to meet FDA requirements for approval would also result in a medication not being approved for marketing.
     The process of developing a pharmaceutical product and obtaining FDA approval to market the medication in the United States typically involves:
    
· | completion of preclinical laboratory and animal testing and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practices, or GLP, regulation;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

· | submission to the FDA of an IND for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin in the United States;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with current good clinical practices, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication for which FDA approval is sought;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the facility or facilities at which the product is manufactured to assess compliance with the FDA’s cGMP regulations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | submission to the FDA of an NDA;
--+---------------------------------


· | satisfactory completion of a potential review by an FDA advisory committee, if applicable; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | FDA review and approval of the NDA.
--+------------------------------------

      Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product or disease.
     Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, stability and toxicity, as well as animal studies to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLPs. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted.
     Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or subjects under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations, including GCP, an international standard meant to protect the rights, safety and wellbeing of subjects and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators, and monitors; and (ii) under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and any effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. subjects and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
     Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined. 

· | Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients, and is tested to assess safety, dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, PK, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 2: The drug is typically tested in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication, dosage tolerance, and optimum dosage, and to identify common AEs and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more extensive Phase 3 clinical trials.

· | Phase 3: If a drug demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of subjects, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. A single Phase 3 trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in rare instances where the clinical trial is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would

be practically or ethically impossible. Sponsors of clinical trials generally must register and report key parameters of certain clinical trials at the NIH-maintained website ClinicalTrials.gov.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. Pursuant to agreements reached during reauthorization of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, the FDA has a goal of acting on most original NDAs within six months or ten months of the application submission or filing date (the FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission before accepting them for filing), depending on the nature of the drug. The FDA has a number of programs intended to help expedite testing, review, and approval of drug candidates that meet the applicable eligibility criteria. The FDA may refer applications for novel drug products, or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee — typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts — for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. 
     If the FDA’s evaluations of the NDA and of the sponsor’s manufacturing facilities are favorable, the FDA will issue an approval letter, and the sponsor may begin marketing the drug for the approved indications, subject to any post-approval requirements, described further below. If the FDA determines it cannot approve the NDA in its current form, it will issue a complete response letter indicating that the application will not be approved in its current form. The complete response letter usually describes the specific deficiencies that the FDA identified in the application and may require additional clinical or other data or impose other conditions that must be met in order to obtain approval of the NDA. Addressing the deficiencies noted by the FDA could be impractical, and it is possible that the sponsor could withdraw its application or approval may not be obtained or may be costly and may result in significant delays prior to approval.
     Where a sponsor wishes to expand the originally approved prescribing information, such as adding a new indication, it must submit and obtain approval of an sNDA. Changes to an indication generally require additional clinical studies, which can be time-consuming and require the expenditure of substantial additional resources. Under PDUFA, the target timeframe for the review of an sNDA to add a new clinical indication is six or ten months from the receipt date, depending on whether or not the sNDA has priority review. As with an NDA, if the FDA determines that it cannot approve an sNDA in its current form, it will issue a complete response letter as discussed above.
     REMS
     The FDA has the authority to require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, as a condition of the approval of an NDA or after approval to ensure that the benefits of a drug outweigh its risks. If the FDA determines a REMS is necessary for a new drug, the drug sponsor must submit a proposed REMS plan as part of its NDA prior to approval. The FDA may also impose a REMS requirement on a drug already on the market if the FDA determines, based on new safety information, that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the drug’s benefits continue to outweigh its risks. A REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and Elements To Assure Safe Use, or ETASU. In addition, the REMS must include a timetable to periodically assess the strategy, at a minimum, at 18 months, three years, and seven years after the REMS approval. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of a drug.
     In July 2012, the FDA approved a class-wide REMS for extended-release and long-acting opioid products. Extended-release formulations of oxycodone, morphine, hydrocodone and hydromorphone, for example, are required to have a REMS. Manufacturers subject to this class-wide REMS must work together to implement the REMS as part of a single shared system to reduce the burden of the REMS on the healthcare system. The central component of the extended-release/long acting opioid REMS program is an education program for prescribers and patients. Specifically, the REMS includes a Medication Guide available for distribution to patients who are dispensed the drug, as well as a number of ETASU. These ETASU include training for healthcare professionals who prescribe the drug; information provided to prescribers that they can use to educate patients in the safe use, storage, and disposal of opioids; and information provided to prescribers of the existence of the REMS and the need to successfully complete the necessary training. Prescriber training required as part of the REMS is conducted by accredited, independent continuing education providers, without cost to healthcare professionals, under unrestricted grants funded by the opioid analgesic manufacturers. Moreover, REMS assessments must be submitted on an annual basis to assess the extent to which the ETASU are meeting the goals of the REMS and whether the goals or elements should be modified.
    
 
  11

 

 In September 2018, and pursuant to its Opioids Action Plan, the FDA approved the final class-wide REMS, which includes several measures to facilitate communication of the risks associated with opioid pain medications to patients and health care professionals and, for the first time, applies to immediate-release and extended-release/long-acting opioid analgesics intended for use in an outpatient setting. The new REMS requires that training be made available to health care providers who are involved in the management of patients with pain (including nurses and pharmacists), and not only to prescribers, and requires that the education cover broader information about appropriate pain management, including alternatives to opioids for the treatment of pain. In connection with the new REMS, the FDA also approved new product labeling containing information about the health care provider education available through the new REMS.
     Advertising and Promotion
     The FDA and other federal regulatory agencies closely regulate the marketing and promotion of drugs through, among other things, guidance and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, communications regarding unapproved uses, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the Internet. A product cannot be commercially promoted before it is approved. After approval, product promotion can include only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that are consistent with the labeling approved by the FDA. Healthcare providers are permitted to prescribe drugs for “off‑label” uses — that is, uses not approved by the FDA and therefore not described in the drug’s labeling — because the FDA does not regulate the practice of medicine. However, FDA regulations impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers’ communications regarding off‑label uses. Failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements and restrictions in this area may subject a company to adverse publicity and enforcement action by the FDA, the U.S. Department of Justice, or the Office of the Inspector General of the HHS, as well as state authorities. This could subject a company to a range of penalties that could have a significant commercial impact, including civil and criminal fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes drug products.
     Post‑Approval Requirements
     Once an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to drug listing and registration, recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, adverse event reporting and advertising, marketing and promotion restrictions.
     Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following FDA approval of an NDA. The FDA also may require, in addition to REMS discussed above, post-market testing, known as Phase 4 testing, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control, drug manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration subjects entities to periodic announced or unannounced inspections by the FDA or these state agencies, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals, request product recalls, or take other punitive action if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered. 
     The FDA may require post-approval studies and clinical trials if the FDA finds that scientific data, including information regarding related drugs, deem it appropriate. The purpose of such studies would be to assess a known serious risk or signals of serious risk related to the drug or to identify an unexpected serious risk when available data indicate the potential for a serious risk. The FDA may also require a labeling change if it becomes aware of new safety information that it believes should be included in the labeling of a drug.
     The Hatch‑Waxman Amendments
     Orange Book Listing
     In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent whose claims cover the applicant’s product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential generic competitors in support of approval of an ANDA. An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active pharmaceutical
 
  12

 
ingredient in the same strengths and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown through bioequivalence testing to be therapeutically equivalent to the listed drug. Other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing, ANDA applicants are not required to conduct, or submit results of, preclinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or efficacy of their drug product. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the listed drug, and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug.
     The ANDA applicant is required to make certain certifications to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify that: (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. The ANDA applicant may also elect to submit a section viii statement certifying that its proposed ANDA label does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than make certifications concerning a listed method-of-use patent. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.
     A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents, or that such patents are invalid, is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.
 The ANDA application also will not be approved until any applicable non‑patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired. For further detail regarding our litigation with Teva regarding the ANDA filed by Teva relating to Xtampza ER, refer to “Item 3. Legal Proceedings”.
     Exclusivity
     Upon NDA approval of a new chemical entity, or NCE, which is a drug that contains no active moiety that has been approved by FDA in any other NDA, that drug receives five years of marketing exclusivity during which FDA cannot receive any ANDA seeking approval of a generic version of that drug or any Section 505(b)(2) NDA, discussed in more detail below, that relies on the FDA’s findings regarding that drug. A sponsor may obtain a three-year period of exclusivity for a change to an approved drug, such as the addition of a new indication to the labeling or a new formulation, if the supplement includes reports of new clinical trials (other than bioavailability clinical trials) essential to the approval of the supplement.
     An ANDA may be submitted one year before NCE exclusivity expires if a Paragraph IV certification is filed. If there is no listed patent in the Orange Book, there may not be a Paragraph IV certification, and, thus, no ANDA may be filed before the expiration of the exclusivity period.
     Section 505(b)(2) NDAs
     Generally, drug products obtain FDA marketing approval pursuant to an NDA or an ANDA. A third alternative is a Section 505(b)(2) NDA, which enables the applicant to rely, in part, on data not developed by the applicant, such as the FDA’s findings of safety and efficacy in the approval of a similar product or published literature in support of its application.
     Section 505(b)(2) NDAs may provide an alternate path to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products. Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from clinical trials not conducted by, or for, the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all, or some, of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.
    
 
  13

 

 To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on the FDA’s findings of safety and effectiveness for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would. Thus approval of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA can be stalled until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired; until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a NCE, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired; and, in the case of a Paragraph IV certification and subsequent patent infringement suit, until the earlier of 30 months, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the Section 505(b)(2) applicant. In the interim period, the FDA may grant tentative approval. Tentative approval indicates that the FDA has determined that the applicant meets the standards for approval as of the date that the tentative approval is granted. Final regulatory approval can only be granted if the FDA is assured that there is no new information that would affect final regulatory/ approval. As with traditional NDAs, a Section 505(b)(2) NDA may be eligible for three-year marketing exclusivity, assuming the NDA includes reports of new clinical trials (other than bioavailability clinical trials) essential to the approval of the NDA. For further detail regarding our litigation with Purdue regarding our Section 505(b)(2) NDA for Xtampza ER , refer to “Item 3. Legal Proceedings”. 
     DEA and Opioid Regulation
     Our products are regulated as “controlled substances” as defined in the Controlled Substances Act, or CSA, which establishes registration, security, recordkeeping, reporting, storage, distribution, importation, exportation and other requirements administered by the DEA. 
     The DEA regulates controlled substances as Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances. Schedule I substances by definition have no established medicinal use and may not be marketed or sold in the United States. A pharmaceutical product may be listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V, with Schedule II substances considered to present the highest risk of abuse and Schedule V substances the lowest relative risk of abuse among such substances. 
     Xtampza ER is listed by the DEA as a Schedule II controlled substance under the CSA. The Nucynta Products are also listed by the DEA as Schedule II controlled substances under the CSA. Consequently, the manufacturing, shipping, storing, selling and using of our products is subject to a high degree of regulation. Schedule II drugs are subject to the strictest requirements for registration, security, recordkeeping and reporting. Also, distribution and dispensing of these drugs are highly regulated. For example, all Schedule II drug prescriptions must be signed by a physician, presented to a pharmacist and may not be refilled without a new prescription.
     Annual registration is required for any facility that manufactures, distributes, dispenses, imports or exports any controlled substance. The registration is specific to the particular location, activity and controlled substance schedule. For example, separate registrations are needed for import and manufacturing, and each registration will specify which schedules of controlled substances are authorized.
     In addition, a DEA quota system, which was amended in 2018 to require sponsors to strengthen controls over diversion of controlled substances, controls and limits the availability and production of controlled substances in Schedule I or II. In November 2017, the DEA reduced the amount of almost every Schedule II opiate and opioid medication that may be manufactured in the U.S. in calendar year 2018 by 20%. For 2019, the DEA proposed decreased manufacturing quotas for the six most frequently misused opioids, including oxycodone, by an average of 10% as compared to the 2018 quotas.
     Distributions of any Schedule I or II controlled substance must also be accompanied by special order forms, with copies provided to the DEA. Because Xtampza ER and the Nucynta Products are regulated as a Schedule II controlled substances, they are subject to the DEA’s production and procurement quota scheme. The DEA establishes annually an aggregate quota for how much active opioid ingredients, such as oxycodone and tapentadol, may be produced in total in the United States based on the DEA’s estimate of the quantity needed to meet legitimate scientific and medicinal needs. The limited aggregate amount of opioids that the DEA allows to be produced in the United States each year is allocated among individual companies, who must submit applications annually to the DEA for individual production and procurement quotas. We and our contract manufacturers must receive an annual quota from the DEA in order to produce or procure any Schedule I or Schedule II substance, including oxycodone base for use in manufacturing Xtampza ER. In addition, Assertio and its contract manufacturers must receive an annual quota from the DEA in order to produce or procure tapentadol for use in manufacturing the Nucynta Products. The DEA may adjust aggregate production quotas 

 
  14

 
and individual production and procurement quotas from time to time during the year, although the DEA has substantial discretion in whether or not to make such adjustments.
     The DEA also requires drug manufacturers to design and implement a system that identifies suspicious orders of controlled substances, such as those of unusual size, those that deviate substantially from a normal pattern and those of unusual frequency, prior to completion of the sale. A compliant suspicious order monitoring, or SOM, system includes well-defined due diligence, “know your customer” efforts and order monitoring.
     To enforce these requirements, the DEA conducts periodic inspections of registered establishments that handle controlled substances. Failure to maintain compliance with applicable requirements, particularly as manifested in loss or diversion, can result in administrative, civil or criminal enforcement action that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations or initiate administrative proceedings to revoke those registrations. In certain circumstances, violations could result in criminal proceedings.
     Individual states also independently regulate controlled substances. We and our contract manufacturers are subject to state regulation on distribution of these products.
     Two new federal laws address the national epidemics of prescription opioid abuse and illicit opioid use. First, passed in 2016, CARA expands the availability of naloxone for law enforcement and other first responders, forms an interagency task force to develop best practices for pain management with opioid medications and provides resources to improve state monitoring of opioids. The SUPPORT Act, which was signed into law in November 2018, includes a number of measures directed towards regulation and improvement of treatment for substance use-disorder and increased coverage by CMS of medically-assisted treatment options. In addition, the SUPPORT Act requires HHS to report to Congress on existing barriers to access to abuse-deterrent opioid formulations by Medicare Part C and D beneficiaries.
     Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws and Compliance Requirements
     We are subject to federal, state and local laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry, violations of which can lead to civil and criminal penalties, including fines, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. These laws are potentially applicable to us as both a manufacturer and a supplier of products and they also apply to hospitals, physicians and other potential purchasers of our products. The applicable federal fraud abuse laws apply to products or services reimbursed by federal healthcare programs. Some states, however, have applicable fraud and abuse laws that apply more broadly to include products or services reimbursed by private payors.
     The federal Anti-Kickback Statute (42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b(b)) prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending, or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Remuneration is not defined in the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including for example, gifts, discounts, coupons, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payments, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market value. Under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the applicable criminal healthcare fraud statutes contained within 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b, a person or entity need not have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim, including items or services resulting from a violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b, constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act (discussed below) or the civil monetary penalties statute, which imposes fines against any person who is determined to have presented or caused to be presented claims to a federal healthcare program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute and implementing regulations provide for certain exceptions for “safe harbors” for certain discounting, rebating or personal services arrangements, among other things. However, the lack of uniform court interpretation of the Anti-Kickback Statute makes compliance with the law difficult. Violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute can result in significant criminal fines, exclusion from participation in Medicare and Medicaid and follow-on civil litigation, among other things, for both entities and individuals.
     Other federal healthcare fraud-related laws also provide criminal liability for violations. The Criminal Healthcare Fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1347 prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit 

 
  15

 
program, including private third-party payers. Federal criminal law at 18 U.S.C. § 1001, among other sections, prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. 
     The civil False Claims Act and similar state laws impose liability on any person or entity who, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal healthcare program. The qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act and similar state laws allow a private individual to bring civil actions on behalf of the federal or state government and to share in any monetary recovery. The Federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act and similar state laws impose reporting requirements for various types of payments to physicians and teaching hospitals. Failure to comply with required reporting requirements under these laws could subject manufacturers and others to substantial civil money penalties. In addition, government entities and private litigants have asserted claims under state consumer protection statutes against pharmaceutical and medical device companies for alleged false or misleading statements in connection with the marketing, promotion and/or sale of pharmaceutical and medical device products, including state investigations and litigation by certain government entities regarding the Company’s marketing of opioid products.
     Third‑Party Payor Coverage and Reimbursement
     The commercial success of Xtampza ER and the Nucynta Products will depend, in part, upon the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors at the federal, state and private levels. Third-party payors include governmental programs such as Medicare or Medicaid, private insurance plans and managed care plans. These third-party payors may deny coverage or reimbursement for a product or therapy in whole or in part if they determine that the product or therapy was not medically appropriate or necessary. Also, third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage through the use of formularies and other cost-containment mechanisms and the amount of reimbursement for particular procedures or drug treatments. In addition, some third-party payors also require preapproval of coverage for new or innovative devices or drug therapies before they will reimburse healthcare providers who prescribe such therapies.
     The cost of pharmaceuticals and devices continues to generate substantial governmental and third-party payor interest. We expect that the pharmaceutical industry will experience pricing pressures due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of managed care organizations and additional legislative proposals. Our results of operations and business could be adversely affected by current and future third-party payor policies as well as healthcare legislative reforms.
     While we cannot predict whether any proposed cost‑containment measures will be adopted or otherwise implemented in the future, these requirements or any announcement or adoption of such proposals could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain adequate prices for Xtampza ER, the Nucynta Products and any other products we may seek to commercialize, and to operate profitably.
     Healthcare Reform
     In the United States, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect our future results of operations. In particular, there have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the U.S. federal and state levels that seek to reduce healthcare costs. The Medicare Modernization Act imposed new requirements for the distribution and pricing of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities which will provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Part D plans include both stand‑alone prescription drug benefit plans and prescription drug coverage as a supplement to Medicare Advantage plans. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for our products. However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the Medicare Modernization Act applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow 

 
  16

 
Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from Medicare Part D may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors.
     In March 2010, the Affordable Care Act was enacted, which significantly changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among the provisions of the Affordable Care Act of importance to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry are the following:
    
· | an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | an increase in the rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1% and 13% of the average manufacturer price for branded and generic drugs, respectively;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts to negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | extension of manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the Federal Poverty Level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a licensure framework for follow-on biologic products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


· | a Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a requirement to annually report drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | establishment of a Center for Medicare Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending that began on January 1, 2011.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. The Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend proposals in spending reductions to Congress. The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction did not achieve its targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2012 through 2021, triggering the legislation’s automatic reductions to several government programs. These reductions include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and, due to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, will remain in effect through 2025 unless additional action is taken by Congress. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on our customers and, accordingly, our financial operations.
     In December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the TCJA, repealed the shared responsibility payment for individuals who fail to maintain minimum essential coverage under section 5000A of the Internal Revenue Code, commonly referred to as the individual mandate, beginning in 2019. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that the repeal will result in over 13 million Americans losing their health insurance coverage over the next ten years, and is likely to lead to increases in insurance premiums. It is uncertain how or whether this legislation may affect our customers and, accordingly, our financial operations.

     Other Regulatory Requirements
     We are also subject to various laws and regulations regarding laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals, and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances in connection with our research. In each of these areas, as above, the FDA and other regulatory authorities have broad regulatory and enforcement powers, including, among other things, the ability to levy fines and civil penalties, suspend or delay issuance of approvals, seize or recall products, and withdraw approvals, any one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on us.     Employees
     As of December 31, 2018, we had a total of 266 full‑time employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor organization or under any collective‑bargaining arrangements. We consider our employee relations to be good.
     Executive Officers of the Company
     The following table lists the positions, names and ages of our executive officers as of February 27, 2019:
