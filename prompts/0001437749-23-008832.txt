AuctionInc Software. AuctionInc is a suite of online shipping and tax management tools assisting businesses with e-commerce storefronts, shipping solutions, tax calculation, inventory management, and auction processing. The application was designed to focus on real-time carrier calculated shipping rates and tax calculations. The product does have tools to assist with other aspects of the fulfillment process, but the main purpose of the product is to provide accurate shipping and tax calculations and packaging algorithms that provide customers with the best possible shipping and tax solutions. This product has been retired and the Company is transitioning these clients to our PaidWeb, PaidCart and PaidShipping solutions.
 
BeerRun Software. BeerRun Software is a brewery management and Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau tax reporting software. Small craft brewers can utilize the product to manage brewery schedules, inventory, packaging, sales and purchasing. Tax reporting can be processed with a single click and is fully customizable by state or province. The software is designed to integrate with QuickBooks accounting platforms by using our powerful sync engine. We currently offer two versions of the software BeerRun and BeerRun Light which excludes some of the enhanced features of BeerRun without disrupting the core functionality of the software. Additional features include Brewpad and Kegmaster and can be added on to the base product. Craft brewing continues to grow in the United States and we feel that there is potential to grow this portion of our business.
 
Paid, Inc. PaidPayments provides commerce solutions to small - and medium-sized businesses by enabling them to sell their goods and services, accept payment, and create repeat sales though an online payment processing solution. The Company has offered PaidPayments as a Payment Facilitator since 2019, which enables our merchants to get the benefit of instant boarding and discounted rates. Our platform provides all aspects required for payment processing, including merchant boarding, underwriting, fraud monitoring, settlement, funding to the sub-merchant, and monthly reporting and statements. The Company controls all of these necessary aspects in the payment process and is then able to supply a one-step boarding process for our partners and value-added resellers. This capability also provides cost advantages, rapid response to market needs, simplified processes for boarding business and a seamless interface for our merchant customers.
Business Strategy
 
The Company’s focus in 2022 was to effectively execute the integration of Paid Inc. and ShipTime while ensuring that our vision (“To provide a comprehensive e-commerce platform for small to medium enterprises”) continued to move toward this goal by the adding fundamental tools for our members to compete in today’s on-line marketplace.
 
While the ShipTime portion of our business is our key revenue driver; our strategy in 2022 was to continue to buildout the foundation of the Paid platform of e-commerce products while driving our core business forward. By continuing to offer small to medium enterprises meaningful solutions and an integrated infrastructure platform we can enhance the value proposition to both our channel partners and our growing customer base allowing us to cost effectively break into new markets.
 
In order to support the Company’s members via our strategic build-out of e-commerce services, our Heroic Support™ team remains focused on a Support and Customer Success mindset. Our Sales and Account Management Teams will be engaging with our prospects and members to provide guidance and support in utilizing Paid platform tools and services. Paid will provide agencies, associations and partners with the infrastructure to help small to medium businesses grow and be more effective with their digital offerings. We continue to focus on clients in both the United States and Canada. Paid products will continue to grow in 2023 with the launch of our PaidShipping, PaidWeb and PaidCart platforms.
 
Our strategy for the legacy shipping calculator clients includes migrating the AuctionInc clients to our new Paid platform as we have several Paid options that meet the needs of this small group of clients.

BeerRun continues to be a valuable component of the Company and remains effective for the existing clients. Our strategy for 2023 is to wind down this segment of the business as we are no longer investing in new technologies and development in the Craft Brewing industry.
 
As ShipTime has been cash flow positive we are able to take advantage of the excess cash with a short-term investment. During 2022, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with respect to a secured $1.875 million convertible note made by Embolx, Inc., a California corporation. Pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement, the Company loaned USD $1.5 million to Embolx. The Note is purchased at a 20% ($375,000) original issue discount and is subject to a 9-month maturity, after which, if unpaid, will then carry a 20% interest rate.  The Company has the option to convert the note into shares of common stock of Embolx.  As additional consideration, the Company received a 5-year Warrant to purchase additional shares of common stock of Embolx. The shares are subject to certain piggyback registration rights under a Registration Rights Agreement, and the note is secured by all assets of Embolx pursuant to a Security Agreement. Under the Securities Purchase Agreement, the Company has a right to purchase additional shares on the same terms for a total potential investment amount of $2 million. Management continues to evaluate the financial status of Embolx and has considered the extension of the note as it has a favorable return on investment. 
 
The business strategy described above is intended to expand our markets, increase revenue per member while enhancing our opportunities in the online ecommerce market. There are always a variety of factors that may impact our plans and inhibit our success. See “Risk Factors” included in Item 1A. Therefore, we have no guarantees and can provide no assurances that our plans will be successful.
 
Marketing and Sales
 
The Company continues to successfully nurture and grow the relationships with our channel partners and has added new relationships that are global in scope. While much of the growth and success in 2022 was the result of the cooperative efforts of ShipTime, our channel partners and our new marketing strategies. Additions to our marketing team have allowed us to continue to pursue digital marketing efforts, as well as increasing our in-house sales team to fast forward our growth.
 
The Company will continue to market PAID and ShipTime throughout 2023 and beyond. Cross selling efforts will be enhanced and new features are being added to our Paid platform. Based on experience and feedback with existing partnerships that promote our product lines, the Company believes that creating additional partnerships beyond North America is an effective marketing tool to promote and encourage new registrations. Additional resources and marketing initiatives will be utilized to increase onboarding and converting our members to being active long-time users of the Company’s services in order to accelerate our growth. 
 
Revenue Sources
 
In 2022, our revenues were primarily derived from our label generation services. This portion of our business has maintained consistent growth since our merger in 2016. In addition to the label generation services we continue to focus on launching our new e-commerce platforms. See “Risk Factors” included in Item 1A. We have no guarantees and can provide no assurances that our plans will be successful.
Competition
 
Technology within the logistics industry is highly competitive and we have focused a variety of differentiators including our Heroic Customer Support™ to elevate our services beyond those of our competition. Our product offerings may also be available from other companies in our industry and we continue to emphasize value and quality customer support. The ShipTime trademark has been registered in both Canada and the United States. Our line of AuctionInc shipping calculator software is proprietary. Our intellectual property rights do not guarantee any competitive advantage and may not sufficiently protect us against competitors with similar technology. We believe that our products and other proprietary rights do not infringe on the proprietary rights of third parties. However, there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future with respect to current or future products or other works of ours.
 
We also utilize free open-source technology in certain areas. Unlike proprietary software, open-source software has publicly available source code and can be copied, modified and distributed with minimal restrictions. We use open-source software and technology as well to support the growing social and viral opportunities on the internet. By using 'best-of-breed' products and tools we can maximize our clients’ opportunities while minimizing our costs, which we are able to pass on to our customers.

As with any software product BeerRun is not excluded from the competitive market. There are a growing number of competitors in the industry all with a unique perspective. The updates to our existing offering have helped us maintain a presence in the brewery management industry. Our support team stays informed with the competition and we have the ability to modify our product as the industry changes.
 
Research and Development
 
Over the past years, the Company has made progress developing new integrations with e-commerce shopping cart platforms. The Company now employs several developers who are focused on the growth of the PAID brand and ShipTime products and their technologies. Our technology roadmap has been projected from 2023 through the 2024 calendar year and we have enhancements scheduled for all aspects of our businesses. Our strategy includes continuous user enhancements on our existing platforms, new websites, updates to our e-commerce shopping cart solution, enhancements to our merchant payment processing platform, shipping calculator enhancements and many additional features and upgrades to our online shopping and shipping tools.
Employees
 
As of March 31, 2023, the Company currently has twenty-two full time equivalent employees and one part-time employee. We have no collective bargaining agreements and consider the relationship with our employees to be excellent.
Government Regulation
 
We are not currently subject to direct federal, state or local regulation, and laws or regulations applicable to access or commerce on the Internet, other than regulations applicable to businesses generally. However, due to the increasing popularity and use of the Internet and other online services, it is possible that a number of laws and regulations may be adopted with respect to the Internet or other online services covering issues such as user privacy, freedom of expression, pricing, content and quality of products and services, taxation, advertising, intellectual property rights and information security.
