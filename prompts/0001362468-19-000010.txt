Item 1.  Business
Overview

We are a leisure travel company focused on providing travel services and products to residents of under-served cities in the United States. We were founded in 1997 and, in conjunction with our initial public offering in 2006, we incorporated in the state of Nevada. Our unique business model provides diversified revenue streams from various travel services and product offerings which distinguish us from other travel companies. We operate a low-cost passenger airline marketed primarily to leisure travelers in under-served cities, allowing us to sell air transportation both on a stand-alone basis and bundled with the sale of air-related and third party services and products. In addition, we provide air transportation under fixed fee flight arrangements. Our developed route network, pricing philosophy, advertising, and product offerings built around relationships with premier leisure companies, are all intended to appeal to leisure travelers and make it attractive for them to purchase air travel and related services and products from us.
Most recently, and in conjunction with our leisure travel focus, we are developing Sunseeker Resort in Florida, operating a golf course near the resort location, managing a golf course management solution and beginning to open family entertainment centers in cities in our route network. 
Below is a brief description of the travel services and products we provide to our customers:
Scheduled service air transportation.  We provide scheduled air transportation on limited-frequency, nonstop flights predominantly between under-served cities and popular leisure destinations. As of February 15, 2019, our operating fleet consisted of 79 Airbus A320 series aircraft. As of that date, we were selling travel on 450 routes to 122 cities. In this document, references to "Airbus A320 series aircraft" are intended to describe both Airbus A319 and A320 aircraft.
Ancillary air-related products and services.  We provide unbundled air-related services and products in conjunction with air transportation for an additional cost to customers. These optional air-related services and products include baggage fees, advance seat assignments, our own travel protection product, change fees, use of our call center for purchases, priority

boarding, a customer convenience fee, food and beverage purchases on board, and other air-related services. The revenue for ancillary air-related products and services is reflected in the Passenger revenue income statement line item, along with scheduled service air transportation revenue. 
Third party products and services.  We offer third party travel products such as hotel rooms and ground transportation (rental cars and hotel shuttle products) for sale to our passengers. The marketing component of revenue related to our co-branded credit card is also accounted for in this category.
Fixed fee contract air transportation.  We provide air transportation through fixed fee agreements and charter service on a year-round and ad-hoc basis.
Other revenue. We may choose to temporarily act as a lessor as an avenue to opportunistically acquire aircraft and/or engines. Upon the expiration of the leases, we have operated the assets ourselves, or are preparing them for future service. We are also currently leasing spare engines to a third party and may choose to act as lessor temporarily in the future on an opportunistic basis. This line item also includes revenue from our golf course acquired in 2018 and our management solution to golf courses around the country. 
Our principal executive offices are located at 1201 N. Town Center Drive, Las Vegas, Nevada 89144. Our telephone number is (702) 851-7300. Our website address is http://www.allegiant.com. We have not incorporated by reference into this annual report the information on our website and investors should not consider it to be a part of this document. Our website address is included in this document for reference only. Our annual report, quarterly reports, current reports and amendments to those reports are made available free of charge through the investor relations section on our website as soon as reasonably practicable after electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).
Unique Business Model
We have developed a unique business model that focuses on leisure travelers in small and medium-sized cities. The business model has evolved as our experienced management team has looked differently at the traditional way business has been conducted in the airline and travel industries. Our focus on the leisure customer allows us to eliminate the significant costs associated with serving a wide variety of customers and to concentrate our product appeal on a customer base which is under-served by traditional airlines. We have consciously developed a business model which distinguishes us from the traditional airline approach:

 | Traditional Airline Approach | Allegiant Approach 
Customer Base: | Business and leisure | Leisure 
Network: | Primarily large and mid-sized markets | Small/medium-sized under-served markets 
Competition: | High | Low 
Schedule: | Uniform throughout the week | Low frequency/variable capacity 
Distribution: | Sell through various intermediaries | Sell only directly to travelers 
Fare Strategy: | Bundled pricing | Unbundled pricing of air-related services and products

By unbundling our air-related services and products such as baggage fees, advance seat assignments, travel protection, change fees, priority boarding, and food and beverage purchases, we are able to lower our airfares and target leisure travelers who are more concerned with price and the ability to customize their experience with us by only purchasing the additional conveniences they value. This strategy allows us to generate additional passenger revenues from these ancillary charges.
We have established a route network with a national footprint, providing service on 405 routes (and currently selling 450 routes) between 99 origination cities and 23 leisure destinations, and serving 42 states and Puerto Rico as of February 15, 2019. In most of these small and medium-sized cities, we provide service to more than one of our leisure destinations which are offered either on a year-round or seasonal basis. 
5

The geographic diversity of our route network protects us from regional variations in the economy and helps insulate us from competitive actions, as it would be difficult for a competitor to materially impact our business by targeting one city or region. Our widespread route network also contributes to the continued growth of our customer base. The below map illustrates our route network as of February 15, 2019, including service announcements as of that date.
In developing a unique business model, our ancillary offerings (ancillary air-related items included in passenger revenue as well as the sale of third party products and services) have been a significant source of our revenue growth. We have increased revenue related to these ancillary items from $5.87 per passenger in 2004 to $49.98 per passenger in 2018. We own and manage our own air reservation system, which gives us the ability to modify our system to enhance product offerings based on specific needs, without being dependent on non-customized product upgrades from outside suppliers. We believe the control of our automation systems has allowed us to be innovators in the industry by providing our customers with a variety of different travel services and products, and allowing us to seek to increase revenues through testing of alternative revenue management approaches.
We believe the following strengths from our unique business model allow us to maintain a competitive advantage in the markets we serve:
Focus on leisure traffic from small and medium-sized cities
We believe small and medium-sized cities represent a large, under-served market, especially for leisure travel. Prior to the initiation of our service, leisure travelers from these markets had limited desirable options to reach leisure destinations because existing carriers are generally focused on connecting business customers through their hub-and-spoke networks. 
We believe our low fare, nonstop service, along with our leisure company relationships, make it attractive for leisure travelers to purchase airfare and travel-related products from us. The size of the markets we serve, and our focus on the leisure customer, 
6

allow us to adequately serve these markets with less frequency, and to vary our air transportation capacity to match seasonal and day-of-the-week demand patterns.
By focusing primarily on under-served cities and routes, we believe we avoid the intense competition in high traffic domestic air corridors. In most of our small and medium-sized city markets, travelers previously faced high airfares and cumbersome connections (long drives) to major airports in order to reach our leisure destinations. Based on published data from the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”), we believe the initiation of our service stimulates demand, as we have typically seen a substantial increase in traffic subsequent to new service beginning. Our market strategy is neither hostile to legacy carriers, whose historical focus has been connecting small cities to business markets with regional jets, nor to traditional low cost or ultra-low cost carriers generally focused on larger markets. Additionally, many major carriers have reduced service to medium-sized cities which we believe they no longer consider to be core hubs.
Capacity management
We actively manage our seat capacity to match leisure demand patterns. Our ability to quickly adjust capacity helps us maintain profitability in the dynamic travel industry. Because of our low fixed costs, our low unit costs are not dependent on high utilization.
Our core business model manages seat capacity by increased utilization of our aircraft during periods of high leisure demand and decreased utilization in low leisure demand periods. In 2018, during our peak demand period in March, we averaged 8.3 system block hours per aircraft per day while in September, our lowest month for demand, we averaged 4.8 system block hours per aircraft per day. Our management of seat capacity also includes changes in weekly frequency of certain markets based on identified peak and off-peak travel demand throughout the year. For example, the leisure destination of Palm Springs, CA, is more desirable for our customers from Bellingham, WA during winter months. Therefore, we seasonally decrease the frequency of our Bellingham-Palm Springs flights in the summer, and increase flights per week in the winter. Unlike other carriers which provide a fairly consistent number of flights every day of the week, we concentrate our flights on high leisure demand travel days and fly a smaller portion of our schedule on low demand days such as Tuesdays and Wednesdays.
Our strong revenue production from ancillary items, coupled with our ability to rapidly deploy or contract capacity, has allowed us to operate profitably throughout periods of high fuel prices and economic recession. We manage our capacity with a goal of being profitable on each route. 
Low cost structure
We believe a low cost structure is essential to competitive success in the airline industry. Our operating expense per available seat mile ("CASM") was 9.56¢ in 2018 and 9.41¢ in 2017. Excluding the cost of fuel, our operating CASM was 6.57¢ in 2018 and also excluding fuel plus a one-time impairment charge to our MD-80 fleet, our operating CASM was 6.63¢ in 2017. 
We continue to focus on maintaining low operating costs through the following tactics and strategies:
Low Aircraft Ownership Costs. We achieve low aircraft ownership costs by purchasing primarily used aircraft with meaningful remaining useful lives, at reduced prices. As of February 15, 2019, we own all but five of our aircraft and believe that we properly balance lower aircraft acquisition costs and operating costs to minimize our total costs. Although our 13 newly manufactured Airbus A320 series aircraft have higher purchase prices, we expect the benefits of a greater number of seats, better fuel efficiency, and longer depreciable lives will make these aircraft efficient additions to our fleet. In addition, our network has evolved such that we are maintaining higher levels of daily utilization on the newly manufactured aircraft. As of February 15, 2019, our operating fleet consists of 79 Airbus A320 series aircraft, of which 74 are owned by the Company.
Highly Productive Workforce. Our high level of employee productivity is due to our cost-driven scheduling, fewer unproductive labor work rules, and the effective use of automation and part-time employees. Although the number of our full-time equivalent employees per operating aircraft increased annually from 2015 to 2017 (largely as a result of the fleet transition), this number remained consistent from 2017 to 2018. In an effort to control costs, we also outsource major maintenance, stations and other functions to reliable third-party service providers.
Simple product. We believe offering a simple product is critical to achieving low operating costs. As such, we sell only nonstop flights; we do not code-share or interline with other carriers; we have a single class cabin; we do not provide any free catered items - everything on board is for sale; we do not provide cargo or mail services; and we do not offer other perks such as airport lounges.
7

Low distribution costs. Our nontraditional marketing approach results in very low distribution costs. We do not sell our product through outside sales channels, thus avoiding the fees charged by travel web sites (Expedia, Orbitz or Travelocity) and traditional global distribution systems (“GDS”) (Sabre or Worldspan). Our customers can only purchase travel at our airport ticket counters or, for a fee, on our website or through our telephone reservation center. The purchase of travel through our website is the least expensive form of distribution for us and accounted for 93.8 percent of our scheduled service revenue during 2018.
Small and medium-sized city market airports. Our business model focuses on residents of small and medium-sized cities in the United States. Typically, the airports in these cities have lower operating costs than airports in larger cities. These lower costs are driven by less expensive passenger facilities, landing, and ground service charges. In addition to inexpensive airport costs, many of our airports provide marketing support.
Cost-driven schedule. We aim to build our scheduled service so that our crews and aircraft return to base each night. This allows us to maximize crew efficiency, and more cost-effectively manage maintenance, spare aircraft and spare parts. Additionally, this structure allows us to add or subtract markets served by a base without incremental costs. We believe leisure travelers are generally less concerned about departure and arrival times than business travelers, so we are able to schedule flights at times that enable us to reduce costs while remaining desirable to our leisure customers.
Ancillary product offerings
We believe many leisure travelers are concerned primarily with purchasing air travel at the least expensive price. As such, we have unbundled the air transportation product by charging fees for services many U.S. airlines have historically bundled in their product offering. This pricing structure allows us to target travelers who are most concerned with low fare travel while also allowing travelers to customize their experience with us by purchasing only the additional conveniences they value. For example, we do not offer complimentary advance seat assignments; however, customers who value this product can purchase advance seat assignments for a small incremental cost. In addition, snacks and beverages are sold individually on the aircraft, allowing passengers to purchase only items they value.
Revenue from ancillary items will continue to be a key component in our total average fare as we believe leisure travelers are less sensitive to ancillary fees than the base fare.
Our third party product offerings give our customers the opportunity to purchase hotel rooms, rental cars and airport shuttle service. Our third party offerings are available to customers based on our agreements with various travel and leisure companies. For example, we have an exclusive agreement with Enterprise Holdings Inc. for the sale of rental cars packaged with air travel, which generated approximately 64 percent of our third party products revenue in 2018. The pricing of each product and our margin can be adjusted based on customer demand because our customers purchase travel directly through our booking engine.
Financial position
As of December 31, 2018, we had $447.5 million of unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and investment securities, and total debt and capital lease obligations of $1.3 billion. As of February 15, 2019, we also had 27 unencumbered aircraft available to use as collateral in the secured debt market. As we are profitable and have been able to consistently generate cash from operations, we believe we have more than adequate resources, along with outside financing expected to be available, to invest in the growth of our fleet, information technology, infrastructure, development, Sunseeker Resort, and our other non-airline initiatives, while meeting short-term obligations.
Our financial position and discipline regarding use of capital allows us to have greater financial flexibility to grow our business and to efficiently and effectively adapt to changing economic conditions.

Routes and schedules
Our current scheduled air service (including seasonal service) predominantly consists of limited frequency, nonstop flights into leisure destinations from under-served cities across the continental United States. The scheduled service routes we are selling as of February 15, 2019 are summarized below (includes 405 routes we are currently serving, and 45 new routes which will begin service in 2019):

Routes to Orlando | 70 
Routes to Tampa/St. Petersburg | 53 
Routes to Las Vegas | 53 
Routes to Punta Gorda | 43 
Routes to Phoenix | 43 
Routes to Destin | 29 
Routes to Los Angeles | 26 
Other routes | 133
Total routes | 450

The number of routes served varies from time to time as some routes are offered seasonally.
Marketing and Distribution
Our website is our primary distribution method, and we also sell through our call center and at our airport ticket counters. This distribution approach creates significant cost savings and enables us to continue building loyalty with our customers through increased interaction with them. We are also able to utilize customer email addresses in our database, which provides multiple cost effective opportunities to market products and services, including at the time of travel purchase, between purchase and travel, and after travel is complete. In addition, we market products and services to our customers through digital advertising. We believe the breadth of options we offer allows us to provide a “one-stop” shopping solution to enhance the customer travel experience. When we enter new markets, we may advertise in local print publications, on the radio and/or television, to introduce our new service to the community. These activities are often supported by the local airport authority which has sought our initiation of service to the community. We continue to see benefit from marketing contributions of airport authorities and destination marketing organizations. 
We continue to enhance our automation and expect the continuous improvements to our website and other automation enhancements will create additional revenue opportunities by allowing us to capitalize on customer loyalty with additional product offerings.
Our low cost distribution strategy results in reduced expenses by avoiding the fees associated with the use of GDS distribution points. This distribution strategy also permits us to closely manage ancillary product offerings and pricing while developing and maintaining a direct relationship with our customers. We believe this continuous communication will result in substantial benefits over time. With our own automation system, we have the ability to continually change ancillary product offerings and pricing points, which allows us to find the optimal pricing levels for our various offerings. We believe this would be difficult and impractical to achieve through the use of the GDS.
Competition
The airline industry is highly competitive. Passenger demand and fare levels have historically been influenced by, among other things, the general state of the economy, international events, fuel prices, industry capacity, and pricing actions taken by other airlines. The principal competitive factors in the airline industry are price, schedule, customer service, routes served, types of aircraft, safety record and reputation, code-sharing relationships, and frequent flyer programs.
Our competitors include legacy airlines, low cost carriers ("LCCs"), ultra-low cost carriers ("ULCC"), regional airlines, new entrant airlines, and other forms of transportation to a much lesser extent. Many of the airlines are larger, have significantly greater financial resources, are better known, and have more established reputations than us. In a limited number of cases, following our entry into a market, competitors have chosen to add service, reduce their fares, or both. Competitors may also choose to enter after we have developed a market.
9

We believe our under-served city strategy has reduced the intensity of competition we might otherwise face. As of February 15, 2019, we are the only mainline domestic scheduled carrier operating out of the Orlando Sanford International Airport, Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport, Punta Gorda Airport, and St. Petersburg Airport. Although no other mainline domestic scheduled carriers operate in these airports, most U.S. airlines serve the major airports for Orlando, Phoenix, and Tampa. In addition, many U.S. airlines serve our other leisure destinations. As a result, there is potential for increased competition on our routes.
As of February 15, 2019, we face mainline competition on approximately 25 percent of our operating routes. We compete with Southwest Airlines on 61 routes, Frontier Airlines on 60 routes, Spirit Airlines on 27 routes, American Airlines on ten routes, Delta Airlines on ten routes, JetBlue Airlines on eight routes, United Airlines on six routes, and Sun Country Airlines on two routes. We may also experience additional competition based on recent route announcements of other airlines.
Indirectly, we compete with Southwest and other carriers that provide nonstop service to our leisure destinations from airports near our cities. We also face indirect competition from legacy carriers offering hub-and-spoke connections to our markets, although these fares tend to be substantially higher, with much longer elapsed travel times. Several airlines also offer competitive one-stop service from the medium-sized cities we serve. 
In our fixed fee operations, we compete with other scheduled airlines in addition to independent passenger charter airlines. We also compete with aircraft owned or controlled by large tour companies. The basis of competition in the fixed fee market is cost, equipment capabilities, service, reputation, and schedule flexibility.
Data Security
We continue to invest heavily in cyber-security, cyber-risk, and privacy initiatives. We employ experienced staff dedicated to cyber-security and cyber-risk analysis, process and technology. We continue to evaluate and proactively implement new preventive and detective processes and technologies including forward-looking threat intelligence and data-centric security measures.
An example of our adoption of advanced security technologies is the use of Format Preserving Encryption to protect e-commerce payment card transactions. In essence, we do not store any credit card data, but rather we use stateless tokenization. 
Aircraft Fuel

The cost of fuel is volatile, as it is subject to many economic and geopolitical factors we can neither control nor predict. Significant increases in fuel costs could materially affect our operating results and profitability. We have not used financial derivative products to hedge our exposure to fuel price volatility in many years, nor do we have any plans to do so in the future. 
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we employed 3,901 full-time equivalent employees, which consisted of 3,643 full-time and 516 part-time employees. Full-time equivalent employees consisted of approximately 860 pilots, 1,160 flight attendants, 260 airport operations personnel, 330 mechanics, 170 reservation agents, 40 flight dispatchers, and 1,080 management and other personnel.
Salary and benefits expense was our second largest expense in 2018, having represented 29 percent of total operating expenses. The collective bargaining agreement with our Flight Attendants went into effect in December 2017.
10

Our relations with labor organizations representing our employee groups are governed by the Railway Labor Act ("RLA"). Under this act, if direct negotiations do not result in an agreement, either party may request the National Mediation Board ("NMB") to appoint a federal mediator. If no agreement is reached in these mediated discussions, the NMB may offer binding arbitration to the parties. If either party rejects binding arbitration, a “cooling off” period begins. At the end of this “cooling-off” period, the parties may engage in self-help, which among other events, could result in a strike from employees or for us to hire new employees to replace any striking workers. The table below identifies the status of pending collective bargaining negotiations with employee groups:

Employee Group | Representative | Status of Agreement 
Flight Dispatchers | International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Airline Division, Local 986 | Elected representation in October 2016. Negotiations are ongoing. 
Maintenance Technicians | International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Airline Division, Local 986 | Elected representation in March 2018. Negotiations began in January 2019.

The collective bargaining agreements for our pilots and flight attendants last for a contractual term of five years each, expiring in 2021 and 2022, respectively.
If we are unable to reach a labor agreement with any employee group, they may seek to institute work interruptions or stoppages. We have not previously experienced any work interruptions or stoppages from our non-unionized or unionized employee groups.

Aircraft Maintenance
We have a Federal Aviation Administration ("FAA") approved maintenance program, which is administered by our maintenance department headquartered in Las Vegas. Technicians employed by us have appropriate experience and hold required licenses issued by the FAA. We provide them with comprehensive training and maintain our aircraft in accordance with FAA regulations. The maintenance performed on our aircraft can be divided into three general categories: line maintenance, major maintenance, and component and engine overhaul and repair. Line maintenance is generally performed by our personnel in certain cities of our network and by contractors elsewhere. We contract with outside organizations to provide major maintenance and component and engine overhaul and repair. We have chosen not to invest in facilities or equipment to perform our own major maintenance, engine overhaul or component work. Our management closely supervises all maintenance functions performed by our personnel and contractors employed by us, and by outside organizations. In addition to the maintenance contractors we presently utilize, we believe there are sufficient qualified alternative providers of maintenance services that we can use to satisfy our ongoing maintenance needs.
Community Involvement
We have worked with the Make-A-Wish® Foundation since 2012 by flying "wish kids" and their families to their desired destinations, at no cost, and donating the proceeds from our in-flight Wingz Snack Pack program to the Foundation. Additionally, we donate the use of 7,500 square feet of office space at our headquarters' campus to the Southern Nevada chapter of Make-A-Wish® Foundation, providing a home for the nonprofit organization's administrative headquarters. The site also serves as the host location for volunteer training, meetings and a place of support for families of children receiving wishes. 
We also support Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics ("STEM") education programs that provide access to careers in aeronautical sciences. In 2018, we donated over $0.4 million in aircraft parts to a Las Vegas high school in support of its aviation magnet program.

Non-Airline Initiatives
Sunseeker Resort
We are developing a hotel resort in Southwest Florida. We have purchased approximately 24 acres on the harbor in Port Charlotte, Florida for the construction of Sunseeker Resort - Charlotte Harbor. We have also purchased a nearby golf course we plan to market with the resort. Our current plans include the construction of a 500-room hotel and two towers offering an estimated 180 one, two and three bedroom suites, bar and restaurant options, and other amenities. 
11

We intend to begin construction on the project in the first quarter 2019 with completion of the hotel in late 2020. We intend to finance a significant portion of the project. Upon completion, we expect we will continue to own the hotel and all food and beverage options on the property.
This location was particularly attractive to us because of the number of flights we operate to the Punta Gorda airport, which is a short drive from the resort site. During 2018, we operated over 9,000 flights to Punta Gorda from our small and medium-sized cities and carried approximately 1.4 million passengers. The resort is also within driving distance from the nearby airports in Fort Myers, Sarasota and St. Petersburg. During 2018, we operated over 14,000 flights to St. Petersburg from our small and medium-sized cities and carried more than 2.0 million passengers to that destination. In addition, we currently offer service to Sarasota from three cities, and have recently announced service from nine additional cities, with routes planned to start in the first two quarters of 2019. Southwest Florida also attracts a substantial number of tourists by car.
Teesnap
We have worked to adapt our “buy-on-board” technology into a golf course management solution. As of December 31, 2018, we were providing these services to approximately 590 golf courses in 48 states throughout the country. To date, the financial results have not been significant to our overall performance. 
Family Entertainment Centers
Our first family entertainment center opened in January 2019 in Clearfield, UT, near the Ogden, UT airport. It features games, attractions, and food. We plan to expand our family entertainment center offerings in locations near airports we serve. Plans for future locations of entertainment centers include Warren, MI (near the Flint, MI airport), and Fort Wayne, IN (near the Fort Wayne, IN airport). 
Other travel and leisure initiatives 
Consistent with our travel and leisure company focus, we intend to pursue other travel and leisure initiatives in the future. 
Insurance 

We maintain insurance policies we believe are of types customary in the airline industry and as required by the DOT, and are in amounts we believe to be adequate to protect us against material loss. The policies principally provide coverage for public liability, war-risk, passenger liability, baggage and cargo liability, property damage, including coverages for loss or damage to our flight equipment, directors and officers, workers’ compensation, and cyber security insurance. There is no assurance, however, that the amount of insurance we carry will be sufficient to protect us from material loss in all cases. Available commercial insurance in the future could be more expensive, could have material differences in coverage than is currently provided, and may not be adequate to protect us from risk of loss.
Government Regulation

We are subject to federal, state and local laws affecting the airline industry and to extensive regulation by the DOT, the FAA, and other governmental agencies.
DOT.  The DOT primarily regulates economic issues affecting air transportation such as certification and fitness of carriers, insurance requirements, consumer protection, competitive practices, and statistical reporting. The DOT also regulates requirements for accommodation of passengers with disabilities. The DOT monitors the continuing fitness of carriers and has the authority to promulgate regulations and to investigate (including by on-site inspections) and institute proceedings to enforce its regulations and related federal statutes, and may assess civil penalties, suspend or revoke operating authority, and seek criminal sanctions. The DOT also has authority to restrict or prohibit a carrier’s cessation of service to a particular community if such cessation would leave the community without scheduled airline service.
We hold DOT certificates of public convenience and necessity authorizing us to engage in scheduled air transportation of passengers, property and mail within the United States, its territories and possessions, and between the United States and all countries that maintain a liberal aviation trade relationship with the United States (known as “open skies” countries). We also hold DOT authority to engage in charter air transportation of passengers, property, and mail on a domestic and international basis.
FAA.  The FAA primarily regulates flight operations and safety, including matters such as airworthiness and maintenance requirements for aircraft, pilot, mechanic, dispatcher and flight attendant training and certification, flight and duty time limitations, and air traffic control. The FAA requires each commercial airline to obtain and hold an FAA air carrier certificate. This certificate, in combination with operation specifications issued to the airline by the FAA, authorizes the airline to operate 
12

at specific airports using aircraft certificated by the FAA. We have and maintain in effect FAA certificates of airworthiness for all of our aircraft, and we hold the necessary FAA authority to fly to all of the cities we currently serve. Like all U.S. certificated carriers, our provision of scheduled service to certain destinations may require specific governmental authorization. The FAA has the authority to investigate all matters within its purview, to modify, suspend or revoke our authority to provide air transportation, to approve or disapprove the addition of aircraft to our operation specifications, and to modify, suspend or revoke FAA licenses issued to individual personnel, for failure to comply with FAA regulations. The FAA can assess civil penalties for such failures and institute proceedings for the collection of monetary fines after notice and hearing. The FAA also has authority to seek criminal sanctions. The FAA can suspend or revoke our authority to provide air transportation on an emergency basis, without notice and hearing, if, in the FAA’s judgment, safety requires such action. A legal right to an independent, expedited review of such FAA action exists. Emergency suspensions or revocations have been upheld with few exceptions. The FAA monitors our compliance with maintenance, flight operations and safety regulations on an ongoing basis, maintains a continuous working relationship with our operations and maintenance management personnel, and performs pre-scheduled inspections as well as frequent spot inspections of our aircraft, employees and records.
The FAA also has the authority to promulgate rules and regulations and issue maintenance directives and other mandatory orders relating to, among other things, inspection, repair and modification of aircraft and engines, increased security precautions, aircraft equipment requirements, noise abatement, mandatory removal and replacement of aircraft parts and components, mandatory retirement of aircraft, and operational requirements and procedures. Such rules, regulations and directives are normally issued after an opportunity for public comment, however, they may be issued without advance notice or opportunity for comment if, in the FAA’s judgment, safety requires such action.
We believe we are operating in compliance with applicable DOT and FAA regulations, interpretations and policies and we hold all necessary operating and airworthiness authorizations, certificates and licenses.
 Security.  Within the United States, civil aviation security functions, including review and approval of the content and implementation of air carriers’ security programs, passenger and baggage screening, cargo security measures, airport security, assessment and distribution of intelligence, threat response, and security research and development are the responsibility of the Transportation Security Administration (“TSA”) of the Department of Homeland Security. The TSA has enforcement powers similar to the DOT’s and FAA’s described above. It also has the authority to issue regulations, including in cases of emergency, the authority to do so without advance notice, including issuance of a grounding order as occurred on September 11, 2001.
Aviation Taxes and Fees. The authority of the federal government to collect most types of aviation taxes, which are used, in part, to finance the nation’s airport and air traffic control systems, and the authority of the FAA to expend those funds must be periodically reauthorized by the U.S. Congress. On October 5, 2018, the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 was signed into law extending certain commercial aviation taxes (known generally as Federal Excise Taxes or "FET") through September 30, 2023. All carriers are required to collect these taxes from passengers and pass them through to the federal government.
In addition to FET, there are federal fees related to services provided by the TSA, and, in the case of international flights, U.S. Customs and Border Protection ("CBP"), U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (“CIS”), and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service ("APHIS"). There are also FAA-approved Passenger Facility Charges ("PFCs") imposed by most of the airports we serve. Like FET, air carriers are required to collect these fees from passengers and pass them through to the respective federal agency or airport authority. These fees do not need to be reauthorized, although their amounts may be revised periodically.
In 2019 or thereafter, Congress may consider legislation that could increase the amount of FET and/or one or more of the other federally imposed or approved fees identified above. By thus increasing the overall price charged to passengers, such action could lessen demand for air travel or force carriers, including us, to lower fares to maintain demand. Also in 2019 or thereafter, Congress may consider privatization of the U.S air traffic control ("ATC") system with user fee based funding. The effect of such action, if adopted as law, on our operating costs is unknown. Additionally, federal funding to airports and/or airport bond financing could be affected through future legislation, which could result in higher fees, rates, and charges at many of the airports we serve.
Environmental.  We are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and affecting matters such as aircraft engine emissions, aircraft noise emissions, and the discharge or disposal of materials and chemicals, which laws and regulations are administered by numerous state and federal agencies. These agencies have enforcement powers similar to the DOT’s and FAA’s described above. In addition, we may be required to conduct an environmental review of the effects projected from the addition of our service at airports.
In July 2016 the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) formally concluded that current and projected concentrations of greenhouse gases emitted by various aircraft, including all of the aircraft we and other air carriers operate, threaten public 
13

health and welfare. This finding is a precursor to EPA regulation of commercial aircraft emissions in the United States, as has taken effect for operations within the European Union under EU legislation. Binding international measures adopted under the auspices of the International Civil Aviation Organization (“ICAO”), a specialized agency of the United Nations, are scheduled to become effective over the next several years. In 2016 the EPA indicated the regulations it intends to propose will be no less stringent than the ICAO standards.
Federal law recognizes the right of airport operators with special noise problems to implement local noise abatement procedures so long as those procedures do not interfere unreasonably with interstate and foreign commerce and the national air transportation system. These restrictions can include limiting nighttime operations, directing specific aircraft operational procedures during takeoff and initial climb, and limiting the overall number of flights at an airport. None of the airports we serve currently imposes restrictions on the number of flights or hours of operation that have a meaningful impact on our operations. It is possible one or more such airports may impose additional future restrictions with or without advance notice, which may impact our operations.
Foreign Ownership.  To maintain our DOT and FAA certificates, our airline operating subsidiary and we (as the airline’s holding company) must qualify continuously as citizens of the United States within the meaning of U.S. aeronautical laws and regulations. This means we must be under the actual control of U.S. citizens and we must satisfy certain other requirements, including that our president/chief executive officer and at least two-thirds of our board of directors and other managing officers are U.S. citizens, and that not more than 25 percent of our voting stock is owned or controlled by non-U.S. citizens. The amount of non-voting stock that may be owned or controlled by non-U.S. citizens is strictly limited as well. We believe we are in compliance with these ownership and control criteria.
Other Regulations.  Air carriers are subject to certain provisions of federal laws and regulations governing communications because of their extensive use of radio and other communication facilities, and are required to obtain an aeronautical radio license from the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”). To the extent we are subject to FCC requirements, we intend to continue to comply with those requirements.
The quality of water used for drinking and hand-washing aboard aircraft is subject to regulation by the EPA. To the extent we are subject to EPA requirements, we intend to continue to comply with those requirements.
Working conditions of cabin crewmembers while onboard aircraft are subject to regulation by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration ("OSHA") of the Department of Labor. To the extent we are subject to OSHA requirements, we intend to continue to comply with those requirements.
Our operations may become subject to additional federal requirements in the future under certain circumstances. During a period of past fuel scarcity, air carrier access to jet fuel was subject to allocation regulations promulgated by the Department of Energy. Changes to the federal excise tax and other government fees imposed on air transportation have been proposed and implemented from time to time and may result in an increased tax burden for airlines and their passengers.
We are also subject to state and local laws, regulations, and ordinances at locations where we operate and to the rules and regulations of various local authorities that operate the airports we serve. None of the airports in the cities in which we operate have slot control, gate availability, or curfews that pose meaningful limitations on our operations. However, some airports we serve have short runways that require us to operate some flights at less than full capacity.
International air transportation, whether provided on a scheduled or charter basis, is subject to the laws, rules, regulations, and licensing requirements of the foreign countries to, from, and over which the international flights operate. Foreign laws, rules, regulations and licensing requirements governing air transportation are generally similar, in principle, to the regulatory scheme of the United States as described above, although in some cases foreign requirements are comparatively less onerous and in others, more onerous. We must comply with the laws, rules and regulations of each country to, from, or over which we operate. International flights are also subject to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Agriculture requirements and the requirements of equivalent foreign governmental agencies.
Future Laws and Regulations.  Congress, the DOT, the FAA, the TSA, and other governmental agencies have under consideration, and in the future may consider and adopt, new laws, regulations, interpretations and policies regarding a wide variety of matters that could affect, directly or indirectly, our operations, ownership, and profitability. We cannot predict what other matters might be considered in the future by the FAA, the DOT, the TSA, other agencies, or Congress, nor can we judge what impact, if any, the implementation of any of these proposals or changes might have on our business. 
Civil Reserve Air Fleet.  We are a participant in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (“CRAF”) Program which affords the U.S. Department of Defense the right to charter our aircraft during national emergencies when the need for military airlift exceeds 
14

the capability of available military resources. During the Persian Gulf War of 1990-91 and on other occasions, CRAF carriers were required to permit the military to use their aircraft in this manner. As a result of our CRAF participation, we are eligible to bid on and be awarded peacetime airlift contracts with the military.
