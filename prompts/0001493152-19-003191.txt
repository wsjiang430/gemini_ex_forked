Company History
 
Advanced Credit Technologies Inc. (“ACRT”, ‘We” or the “Company”) was incorporated in Nevada on February 5, 2008. The Company has never been the subject of any bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceeding. The Company has never been involved in any material reclassification, merger, or consolidation.
 
On June 15, 2017, the Company created a private limited company in the United Kingdom named CyberloQ Technologies LTD. CyberloQ Technologies LTD is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and any business that the Company has in the United Kingdom will be transacted through CyberloQ Technologies LTD. However, to date CyberloQ Technologies LTD has had no activity, operational or otherwise.
 
Current Overview of the Company
 
ACRT is a development-stage technology company focused on fraud prevention and credit management.
 
The Company offers a proprietary software platform branded as CyberloQ™ . While previously the Company licensed CyberloQ, in the third quarter of 2017, the Company acquired the CyberloQ technology and is now the exclusive owner of CyberloQ.
 
CyberloQ is a banking fraud prevention technology that is offered to institutional clients in order to combat fraudulent transactions and unauthorized access to customer accounts. Through the use of a customer’s smart-phone, CyberloQ uses a multi-factor authentication system to control access to a bank card, transaction type or amount, website, database or digital service. The mobile applications for CyberloQ have been built, and have been successfully integrated into the banking ecosystem.

In addition to CyberloQ, the Company offers a web-based proprietary software platform under the brand name Turnscor® which allows customers to monitor and manage their credit from the privacy of their own homes. Although individuals can sign-up for Turnscor on their own, the Company also intends to market Turnscor to certain institutional clients, where appropriate, in conjunction with CyberloQ as a value-added benefit to offer their customers.
 
Furthermore, in 2018 the Company introduced CyberloQ Vault, a secure cloud-based storage solution which allows users to store, retrieve and share content securely.
 
Finally, the Company is able to develop secure databases for clients by developing and attaching a private blockchain to the SQL database and further securing the database through use of the Company’s CyberloQTM technology. The blockchain being developed by the Company is a private blockchain and is an invitation-only network governed by a single entity. Entrants to the network require permission to read, write or audit the blockchain.
 
The Company currently has three full-time employees — its President, Vice-President and Chief Technology Officer. There are no other employees of the Company at this time.
