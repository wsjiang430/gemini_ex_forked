ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
We are a blank check company incorporated in November 2017 as a Delaware corporation formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this report as our initial business combination. To date, our efforts have been limited to organizational activities as well as activities related to our initial public offering. We have generated no operating revenues to date and we do not expect that we will generate operating revenues until we consummate our initial business combination.
 
While we may pursue an acquisition opportunity in any business, industry, sector or geographical location, we have initially focused our search on industries that complement our management teams background in healthcare or healthcare related industries.
 
Our strategy is to identify, acquire and, after our initial business combination, build, a healthcare or healthcare related business. We intend to focus our investment effort broadly across the entire healthcare industry, which encompasses services, therapeutics, devices, diagnostics and animal health.
 
The company was jointly founded by our management team and Deerfield Management, a healthcare investment firm with $10.07 billion in regulatory assets under management as of December 31, 2018. We believe that the experience of our management team and our relationship with Deerfield Management will allow us to source, identify and execute an attractive transaction for our shareholders.
 
Our management team is led by Richard Barasch, our President and Chief Executive Officer, who has more than 30 years of experience in healthcare services, health insurance, and related industries. Mr. Barasch was Chief Executive Officer of Universal American Corp., a publicly-traded health insurance company focused on the senior health market, from 1995 until Universal Americans acquisition by WellCare Health Plans in April 2017. Mr. Barasch has a track record of value creation for shareholders through both organic growth and acquisitions. In 1988, Mr. Barasch and his team invested in Universal American and acquired operating control of a small health insurance company. Including a number of special dividends and proceeds from the sale to WellCare, the shareholders of Universal American ultimately received over $2.5 billion. Universal Americans revenue grew from less than $100 million to over $5.5 billion during his tenure as CEO. Under Mr. Baraschs leadership, Universal American evolved from a life and health insurance company to a diversified health services provider focused on the senior market, Medicare and Medicaid. Universal American pioneered a physician partnership and engagement model designed to lower costs while improving quality and outcomes. Mr. Barasch also has significant merger and acquisition experience, as Universal American executed over 20 acquisitions and divestitures during his tenure as CEO. This acquisition experience includes the purchase of MemberHealth, a Part D Prescription Drug company, in September 2007, and the subsequent sale of Universals Part D Prescription Drug business to CVS Caremark for approximately $1.4 billion in April 2011, in a structured transaction that unlocked substantial value for shareholders.
 
Our co-founder, Deerfield Management, is an investment firm with over $10.07 billion of regulatory assets under management as of December 31, 2018. Since its launch in 1994, Deerfield Management has focused exclusively on the healthcare industry. Deerfield Managements investment activity spans both public and private securities, offering an investment flexibility as well as access to investment opportunities across all stages of a companys life cycle and operating history. Deerfield Management invests broadly across all healthcare sectors, with no restrictions on the size of the company or type of security, and typically has in excess of 100 positions at any given time. In addition to public capital market and private equity investing experience, Deerfield Management has an operational team that provides varying levels of support to Deerfield Managements portfolio companies. The operational teams capabilities complement Deerfield Managements private transactions group which custom designs transactions to accommodate long-term structured investments in healthcare companies. The private transaction group has dedicated fundamental teams with deep product expertise in numerous healthcare sectors, including biotechnology, pharmaceutical devices and healthcare services, as well as a range of corporate finance, accounting and tax resources to source and structure attractive transactions. Deerfield Management also benefits from its in-house research institute, which provides market research and extensive scientific expertise to both the investment team and portfolio companies. These attributes combine to allow Deerfield Management to identify and structure tailored investments that can create growth opportunities for targeted companies. In 2017, Deerfield Management consummated over 50 transactions involving new and existing portfolio companies. We believe that we will benefit from Deerfield Managements diverse capabilities. Deerfield is represented on our board of directors by Steven Hochberg, who is one of the leaders of Deerfields private transactions group and has over 20 years of healthcare investing experience. The Deerfield Funds invested in Universal American and Deerfield Management has a long-standing relationship with Mr. Barasch.
 
Our management team also includes Christopher Wolfe, our Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Wolfe was a partner of Capital Z Partners Management, a middle-market private equity fund that has invested $3 billion in over 50 transactions since 1990. Capital Z first invested in Universal American in 1998 and has a long-standing relationship with Mr. Barasch.
 
We have also assembled a group of independent directors who bring us public company governance, executive leadership, operations oversight, private equity investment management and capital markets experience. The members of our board of directors have extensive
 
3




experience, having served as directors or officers for numerous publicly-listed and privately-owned companies. Our directors have experience with acquisitions, divestitures and corporate strategy and implementation, which we believe will significantly benefit us as we evaluate potential acquisition or merger candidates as well as following the completion of our initial business combination.
 
We believe our management team is well positioned to take advantage of the growing set of acquisition opportunities focused on the healthcare industry and that our contacts and relationships, ranging from owners of private and public companies, private equity funds, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and business brokers will allow us to generate an attractive transaction for our shareholders.
 
The past performance of the members of our management team, Deerfield Management or their affiliates is not a guarantee that we will be able to identify a suitable candidate for our initial business combination or of success with respect to any business combination we may consummate. You should not rely on the historical record of the performance of our management, Deerfield Management or any of its affiliates performance as indicative of our future performance. In addition, Deerfield Management and certain of its personnel have been the subject of SEC proceedings. Such proceedings and/or any additional SEC or other governmental actions may harm our ability to complete an initial business combination, including by making prospective target companies less likely to consummate a business combination with us. In addition, if any future SEC or other governmental actions were to preclude Deerfield Management from making further investments, or otherwise curtail Deerfield Managements operations, Deerfield Managements ability to purchase shares of our common stock in a private placement in connection with our initial business combination could be impaired.
 
Competitive Advantages
 
We intend to capitalize on the following competitive advantages in our pursuit of a target company:
 
Proactive and Proprietary Transaction Sourcing. Our management team believes that its leading market reputation, proactive approach to sourcing transactions, and extensive network of relationships will provide proprietary investment opportunities. Deerfield Managements deep industry expertise across all numerous parts of the healthcare spectrum and throughout the capital structure often make them a viable option for healthcare companies seeking capital solutions. Our sponsor believes that they have an established record of generating proprietary investment opportunities resulting from original research. Within targeted sub-sectors, our sponsor analyzes current trends, develops investment theses and creates strategies for originating and evaluating investment opportunities. This research-oriented, data-intensive process allows us to proactively identify trends, find opportunities and execute transactions ahead of potential competitors. Additionally, given Richard Baraschs long track record and reputation in the healthcare services sector as well as his broad and diverse network, there will be significant potential for Mr. Barasch to source new opportunities that may not be broadly marketed.
Execution and Structuring Capability. Our management team believes that its industry expertise and reputation allow them to source and complete transactions possessing structural attributes that create an attractive investment thesis. These types of transactions are typically complex and require creativity, industry knowledge and expertise, rigorous due diligence, and extensive negotiation and documentation. Deerfield Managements private transactions group has experience investing in healthcare assets throughout a companys life cycle. For example, companies that are majority-owned or controlled by the Deerfield Funds range from de novo startups to enterprises having thousands of employees. In addition, complexity associated with healthcare payment mechanics are also well understood by the management team and provide for a broader opportunity set. Our sponsor believes that by focusing its investment activities on these types of transactions, it is able to generate investment opportunities that have attractive risk/reward profiles based on their valuations, structural characteristics and relatively low levels of financial leverage.
Broad Experience Across Public and Private Markets. Our management team and Deerfield Management combine experience in public market investing and private equity transactions. Mr. Barasch was the CEO of a public company for over 22 years, and Mr. Wolfe has extensive experience in sourcing and structuring private equity transactions. Deerfield Management has experience across both public and private markets, with over half of their assets dedicated for investment in privately negotiated transactions. We believe that this versatility of experience and understanding of both public and private markets will allow our sponsor to identify companies that could make successful public market candidates, and prepare them to make the transition to strong publicly-traded companies.
Significant Value-Add Capability. The sector expertise and broad network of relationships of our management team will allow them to add significant value after consummation of an initial transaction. We anticipate that our management team will be involved with a target company in a number of capacities, including: (i) assisting in setting strategic direction and priorities; (ii) designing specific performance improvement projects; (iii) helping to identify and recruit managers; (iv) advising on acquisition and financing transactions; (v) contributing market information; and (vi) developing a targeted investor relations program. Furthermore, our management team is also experienced in navigating complex reimbursement and regulatory issues that many companies in healthcare manage over time. Our management believes that its ability to identify and implement value creation initiatives has been an essential driver of past performance and will remain central to its acquisition strategy.
Industry Opportunity
 
While we may acquire a business in any industry, we have initially focused our search on the healthcare industry in the United States and other developed countries. We believe the healthcare industry is attractive for a number of reasons:
Large Target Market. The healthcare industry represents an enormous target market. Total U.S. national health expenditure exceeds $3
 
4




trillion, and the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services has estimated that total healthcare spending will approach 20% of total U.S. Gross Domestic Product over the coming years. The number of private companies in the healthcare industry is significant, with over 30,000 firms focused on various sub-sectors of the healthcare value chain in the United States alone. The market dynamics are similar in Europe and other developed countries.
Broad Universe of Potential Targets. We intend to focus our investment effort broadly across the healthcare industry, which encompasses services, therapeutics, devices, diagnostics and animal health. We believe that our investment and operating expertise in healthcare across multiple industry verticals will give us a large, addressable universe of potential targets. The diversity of the target universe and the number of largely uncorrelated sub-sectors maximizes that likelihood that the management team will be able to identify and execute an attractive transaction.
Limited Competition. Our management team believes that the complexity of the healthcare industry acts as a barrier to entry, requiring investors to have significant sector-specific knowledge and expertise to identify and appropriately analyze investment opportunities. Technical and scientific knowledge, an understanding of the reimbursement environment and regulatory landscape, complex valuation methodologies, specialized accounting treatments, and regulatory and political considerations may deter competition from generalist firms.
Favorable Trends. Total global healthcare expenditure has grown at a pace substantially above the rate of inflation in the recent past, and this growth is projected to continue over the years to come, including an aging population, increased prevalence of chronic disease and improved access to healthcare. While the size of healthcare spending has grown and will continue to grow, this expense has put significant pressure on payors, including federal and state governments as well as individuals. This dynamic has offered opportunities to services companies that can both control cost and improve the overall quality of healthcare, and Mr. Barasch has specialized in identifying these opportunities throughout his career.
 
The Deerfield Funds have indicated an interest to purchase up to an aggregate of $100,000,000 of our shares of common stock in a private placement that would occur concurrently with the consummation of our initial business combination. However, because indications of interest are not binding agreements or commitments to purchase, the Deerfield Funds may determine not to purchase any such shares, or to purchase fewer shares than they have indicated an interest in purchasing. Furthermore, we are not under any obligation to sell any such shares. If we sell shares to the Deerfield Funds (or any other investor) in connection with our initial business combination, the equity interest of our public stockholders in the combined company may be diluted and the market prices for our securities may be adversely affected. In addition, if the per share trading price of our common stock is greater than the price per share paid in the private placement, the private placement will result in value dilution to you.
 
Acquisition Criteria
 
Consistent with our strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. We will use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, but we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines.
 
·                  Middle-Market Businesses. We believe that the middle market segment provides the greatest number of opportunities for investment and is consistent with our sponsors historical investment history. This segment is where we believe we also have the strongest network to identify the greatest number of attractive opportunities and we believe the larger market capitalization and public float of the resulting company will be more attractive to our investors.
 
·                  Established Companies with Proven Track Records. We will seek to acquire one or more established companies with consistent historical financial performance. We will typically focus on companies with a history of strong operating and financial results and strong fundamentals. We do not intend to acquire start-up companies or companies without a path to long-term profitability.
·                  Companies with Recurring and Embedded Revenue and Earnings Growth or Potential for Revenue and Earnings Growth. We will seek to acquire one or more businesses that have achieved or have the potential for significant revenue and earnings growth through a combination of organic growth, synergistic add-on acquisitions, new product markets and geographies, increased production capacity, expense reduction and increased operating leverage.
 
·                  Companies with, or with the Potential for, Strong Free Cash Flow Generation. We will seek to acquire one or more businesses that already have, or have the potential to generate, consistent, stable and recurring free cash flow. We will focus on one or more businesses that have predictable revenue streams with high visibility.
 
·                  Strong Competitive Position. We intend to focus on acquisition targets that have a leading, growing or niche market position in their respective industries. We will analyze the strengths and weaknesses of target businesses relative to their competitors. We will seek to acquire one or more businesses that demonstrate advantages when compared to their competitors, which may help to protect their market position and profitability.
 
5




·                  Experienced Management Team. We will seek to acquire one or more businesses with a complete, experienced management team that provides a platform for us to further develop the acquired businesss management capabilities. We will seek to partner with a potential targets management team and expect that the operating and financial abilities of our executive team and board of directors will complement their own capabilities.
·                  Benefit from Being a Public Company. We intend to acquire one or more businesses that will benefit from being publicly traded and can effectively utilize the broader access to capital and the public profile that are associated with being a publicly traded company.
 
These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant.
 
Initial Business Combination
 
Our initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance in the trust account (less any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, or a qualified independent accounting firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. Our stockholders may not be provided with a copy of such opinion, nor will they be able to rely on such opinion.
 
We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses.
 
Acquisition Process
 
In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review which will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial, operational, legal and other information which will be made available to us.
 
We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or a qualified independent accounting firm that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view.
 
Members of our management team may directly or indirectly own our common stock and warrants, and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination.
 
Each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to another entity pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor these obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entities, and may only decide to present it to us if such entities reject the opportunity and consummating the same would not violate any restrictive covenants to which they are subject. Such officers or directors shall also have
 
6




the right in the absence of such fiduciary or contractual obligations to offer certain business opportunities to such entities before presenting them to us and, in some instances, may be required to present such opportunities to such other entities before having the ability to offer of such opportunities to us. We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations or other rights of our officers or directors will materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue.
 
Our sponsor, executive officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to a written letter agreement, not to participate in the formation of, or become an officer or director of, any other special purpose acquisition companies with a class of securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, until we have entered into a definitive agreement regarding our initial business combination or we have failed to complete our initial business combination by February 21, 2020.
 
Our Management Team
 
Members of our management team are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time that any member of our management team will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the current stage of the business combination process.
 
We believe our management teams operating and transaction experience and relationships with companies will provide us with a substantial number of potential business combination targets. Certain members of our management team have spent significant portions of their careers working with businesses in the healthcare industry and have developed a wide network of professional services contacts and business relationships in that industry. The members of our board of directors also have significant executive management and public company experience with healthcare and healthcare related companies.
 
Status as a Public Company
 
We believe our structure will make us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses. As an existing public company, we offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination. In this situation, the owners of the target business would exchange their shares of stock in the target business for shares of our stock or for a combination of shares of our stock and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. Although there are various costs and obligations associated with being a public company, we believe target businesses will find this process a more certain method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering.
 
Furthermore, once a proposed business combination is completed, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, which could prevent the offering from occurring. Once public, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital and an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with stockholders interests. It can offer further benefits by augmenting a companys profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees.
 
While we believe that our structure and our management teams backgrounds will make us an attractive business partner, some potential target businesses may have a negative view of us since we are a blank check company, without an operating history, and there is uncertainty relating to our ability to obtain stockholder approval of our proposed initial business combination and retain sufficient funds in our trust account in connection therewith.
 
We are an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period.
 
Financial Position
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had funds available for a business combination in the amount of approximately $245.1 million, assuming no redemptions and after payment of up to approximately $7,875,000 of deferred underwriting fees. With these funds we can offer a target business a variety of options such as creating a liquidity event for its owners, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt ratio. Because we are able to complete our business combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires. However, there can be no assurance that third party financing will be available to us.

Significant Activities Since Inception
 
In December 2017, our sponsor purchased an aggregate of 7,187,500 founder shares for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000. In December 2017 and January 2018, our sponsor transferred 100,000 founder shares to Mr. Wolfe and 30,000 founder shares to each of our independent directors. Following the expiration of the underwriters over-allotment option on April 2, 2018, the initial stockholders forfeited an aggregate of 937,500 founder shares, so that the founder shares would represent 20.0% of our issued and outstanding shares after our initial public offering.
 
The registration statement for our initial public offering was declared effective on February 15, 2018. On February 21, 2018, we consummated our initial public offering of 25,000,000 units at $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $250,000,000. Simultaneously with the closing of our initial public offering, we consummated the sale of 4,333,333 private placement warrants at a price of $1.50 per warrant in a private placement to our sponsor, generating gross proceeds of $6,500,000.
 
A total of $250,000,000 of the net proceeds from our initial public offering and the private placement were deposited in a trust account established for the benefit of our public stockholders.
 
Our units began trading on February 16, 2018 on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol DFBHU. Commencing on April 16, 2018, the common stock and warrants comprising the units began separate trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbols DFBH and DFBHW, respectively. Those units not separated continue to trade on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol DFBHU.
 
Effecting our Initial Business Combination
 
We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations until we consummate our initial business combination. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of our initial public offering and the private placement warrants, our capital stock, debt or a combination of these as the consideration to be paid in our initial business combination. We may seek to complete our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses.
 
If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our business combination or used for redemptions of purchases of our common stock, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.
 
Although our management will assess the risks inherent in a particular target business with which we may combine, we cannot assure you that this assessment will result in our identifying all risks that a target business may encounter. Furthermore, some of those risks may be outside of our control, meaning that we can do nothing to control or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely impact a target business.
 
We may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities in connection with the completion of our initial business combination, and we may effectuate our initial business combination using the proceeds of such offering rather than using the amounts held in the trust account. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would complete such financing only simultaneously with the completion of our business combination. In the case of an initial business combination funded with assets other than the trust account assets, our tender offer documents or proxy materials disclosing the business combination would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by law, we would seek stockholder approval of such financing. There are no prohibitions on our ability to raise funds privately or through loans in connection with our initial business combination. At this time, we are not a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities or otherwise.
 
Origination and Sourcing of Target Business Opportunities
 
Certain members of our management team have spent significant portions of their careers working with businesses in the healthcare industry, and have developed a wide network of professional services contacts and business relationships in that industry. The members of our board of directors also have significant executive management and public company experience with healthcare and healthcare related companies.
 
This network has provided our management team with a flow of referrals that have resulted in numerous transactions. We believe that the network of contacts and relationships of our management team will provide us with an important source of acquisition opportunities. In addition, we anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment market participants, private equity groups, investment banks, consultants, accounting firms and large business enterprises.
 
We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, executive officers or directors, or making the acquisition through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with our sponsor, executive officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete an initial business combination with a target that is affiliated with our sponsor, executive officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking
 
8




which is a member of FINRA or a qualified independent accounting firm that such an initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context.
 
If any of our executive officers becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity, including public and private funds under management of Deerfield management, to which he or she has pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she may be required to present such business combination opportunity to such entity prior to presenting such business combination opportunity to us. All of our executive officers currently have certain relevant fiduciary duties or contractual obligations that may take priority over their duties to us. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue.
 
We anticipate that target business candidates will also be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment bankers, private investment funds and other intermediaries. Target businesses may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls or mailings. These sources may also introduce us to target businesses in which they think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis, since many of these sources will know what types of businesses we are targeting. Our officers and directors, as well as their affiliates, may also bring to our attention target business candidates that they become aware of through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows or conventions. In addition, we expect to receive a number of proprietary opportunities that would not otherwise necessarily be available to us as a result of the track record and business relationships of our officers and directors.
 
Selection of a Target Business and Structuring of Our Initial Business Combination
 
Our initial business combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance in the trust account (less any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. The fair market value of the target or targets will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community, such as discounted cash flow valuation or value of comparable businesses. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or a qualified independent accounting firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We do not intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our initial business combination. Subject to this requirement, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations.
 
In any case, we will only complete an initial business combination in which we own or acquire 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquire a controlling interest in the target sufficient for us not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. If we own or acquire less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses, the portion of such business or businesses that are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. There is no basis for our public stockholders to evaluate the possible merits or risks of any target business with which we may ultimately complete our business combination.
 
To the extent we effect our business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.
 
In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review which will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial and other information which will be made available to us.
 
The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination.
 
Lack of business diversification
 
For an indefinite period of time after the completion of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. By completing our business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:
 
9




·                  subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination, and
 
·                  cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services.
 
Limited ability to evaluate the targets management team
 
Although we intend to closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting our business combination with that business, our assessment of the target businesss management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of members of our management team, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following our business combination, it is unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our business combination. Moreover, members of our management team may not have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business.
 
Following a business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that the additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.
 
Stockholders may not have the ability to approve our initial business combination
 
We may conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC. However, we will seek stockholder approval if it is required by law or applicable stock exchange rule, or we may decide to seek stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons. Presented in the table below is a graphic explanation of the types of initial business combinations we may consider and whether stockholder approval is currently required under Delaware law for each such transaction.
 

Type of Transaction | Whether Stockholder Approval is Required 
----------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------
Purchase of assets | No 
Purchase of stock of target not involving a merger with the company | No 
Merger of target into a subsidiary of the company | No 
Merger of the company with a target | Yes 

 
Under Nasdaqs listing rules, stockholder approval would be required for our initial business combination if, for example:
 
·                  we issue common stock that will be equal to or in excess of 20% of the number of shares of our common stock then outstanding;
 
·                  any of our directors, officers or substantial stockholders (as defined by Nasdaq rules) has a 5% or greater interest (or such persons collectively have a 10% or greater interest), directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired or otherwise and the present or potential issuance of common stock could result in an increase in outstanding shares of common stock or voting power of 5% or more; or
 
·                  the issuance or potential issuance of common stock will result in our undergoing a change of control.
 
Permitted purchases of our securities
 
In the event we seek stockholder approval of our business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. None of the funds in the trust account will be used to purchase shares in such transactions. They will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the sellers or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. Such a purchase may include a contractual acknowledgement that such stockholder, although still the record holder of our shares is no longer the beneficial owner thereof and therefore agrees not to exercise its redemption rights. Our insiders must: (i) refrain from purchasing shares during certain blackout periods and when they are in possession of any material non-public information and (ii) to clear all trades with our legal counsel prior to execution. We cannot currently determine whether our insiders will make such purchases pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan, as it will be dependent upon several factors, including but not limited to, the timing and size of such purchases. Depending on such circumstances, our insiders may either make such purchases pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan or determine that such a plan is not necessary.
 
In the event that our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public stockholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights, such selling stockholders would be required to revoke
 
10




their prior elections to redeem their shares. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules.
 
The purpose of such purchases would be to (i) vote such shares in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining stockholder approval of the business combination or (ii) to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. This may result in the completion of our business combination that may not otherwise have been possible.
 
In addition, if such purchases are made, the public float of our common stock may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange.
 
Our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates anticipate that they may identify the stockholders with whom our sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates may pursue privately negotiated purchases by either the stockholders contacting us directly or by our receipt of redemption requests submitted by stockholders following our mailing of proxy materials in connection with our initial business combination. To the extent that our sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates enter into a private purchase, they would identify and contact only potential selling stockholders who have expressed their election to redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the trust account or vote against the business combination. Our sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates will only purchase shares if such purchases comply with Regulation M under the Exchange Act and the other federal securities laws.
 
Any purchases by our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates who are affiliated purchasers under Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act will only be made to the extent such purchases are able to be made in compliance with Rule 10b-18, which is a safe harbor from liability for manipulation under Section 9(a)(2) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. Rule 10b-18 has certain technical requirements that must be complied with in order for the safe harbor to be available to the purchaser. Our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates will not make purchases of common stock if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act.
 
Redemption rights for public stockholders upon completion of our initial business combination
 
We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of common stock upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price which is payable in cash and equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable by us and any amounts released to us to fund working capital requirements, subject to an annual limit of $250,000) divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described elsewhere in this report. The amount in the trust account is $250,000,000, excluding any interest, which is equal to $10.00 per public share. The per-share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. Our initial stockholders have entered into letter agreements with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and any public shares they may hold in connection with the completion of our business combination.
 
Manner of Conducting Redemptions
 
We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of common stock upon the completion of our initial business combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the business combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek stockholder approval under the law or stock exchange listing requirement. Asset acquisitions and stock purchases would not typically require stockholder approval while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our outstanding common stock or seek to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation would require stockholder approval. We intend to conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC unless stockholder approval is required by law or stock exchange listing requirement or we choose to seek stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons.
 
If a stockholder vote is not required and we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation:
 
·                  conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers, and
 
·                  file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under
 
11




Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies.
 
Upon the public announcement of our business combination, we or our sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 to purchase shares of our common stock in the open market if we elect to redeem our public shares through a tender offer, to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act.
 
In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public stockholders not tendering more than a specified number of public shares which are not purchased by our sponsor, which number will be based on the requirement that we may not redeem public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon consummation of our initial business combination (so that we are not subject to the SECs penny stock rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. If public stockholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete the initial business combination.
 
If, however, stockholder approval of the transaction is required by law or stock exchange listing requirement, or we decide to obtain stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation:
 
·                  conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules, and
 
·                  file proxy materials with the SEC.
 
In the event that we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public stockholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the initial business combination.
 
If we seek stockholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination. Subject to the Deerfield Funds approval right regarding the initial business combination, our initial stockholders have agreed to vote their founder shares and any public shares purchased during or after our initial public offering in favor of our initial business combination. These voting agreements may make it more likely that we will consummate our initial business combination. Each public stockholder may elect to redeem their public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. In addition, our initial stockholders have entered into letter agreements with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and any public shares purchased during or after our initial public offering in connection with the completion of our business combination, and the Deerfield Funds have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to the public shares it purchased in our initial public offering.
 
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon consummation of our initial business combination (so that we are not subject to the SECs penny stock rules). Redemptions of our public shares may also be subject to a higher net tangible asset test or cash requirement pursuant to an agreement relating to our initial business combination. For example, the proposed business combination may require: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all shares of common stock that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares, and all shares of common stock submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof.
 
Limitation on redemption upon completion of our initial business combination if we seek stockholder approval
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a group (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering, which we refer to as the Excess Shares.. We believe this restriction will discourage stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed business combination as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public stockholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holders shares are not purchased by us or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our stockholders ability to redeem no more than 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing
 
12




condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our stockholders ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our business combination.
 
Tendering stock certificates in connection with a tender offer or redemption rights
 
We may require our public stockholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in street name, to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent prior to the date set forth in the tender offer documents, or up to two business days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve the business combination in the event we distribute proxy materials, or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using Depository Trust Companys DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holders option. The tender offer or proxy materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate whether we are requiring public stockholders to satisfy such delivery requirements. Accordingly, a public stockholder would have from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, or up to two days prior to the vote on the business combination if we distribute proxy materials, as applicable, to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Given the relatively short exercise period, it is advisable for stockholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares.
 
There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker $80.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated.
 
The foregoing is different from the procedures used by some other blank check companies. In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with their business combinations, some other blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the stockholders vote on an initial business combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his or her redemption rights. After the business combination was approved, the company would contact such stockholder to arrange for him or her to deliver his or her certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the stockholder then had an option window after the completion of the business combination during which he or she could monitor the price of the companys stock in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, the stockholder could sell its shares in the open market before actually delivering its shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which stockholders were aware they needed to commit before the stockholder meeting, became option rights surviving past the completion of the business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming holders election to redeem is irrevocable once the business combination is approved.
 
Any request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the date set forth in the tender offer materials or the commencement of the meeting of stockholders held to approve the initial business combination, as applicable. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our business combination.
 
If our initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares.
 
If our initial proposed business combination is not completed, we may continue to try to complete a business combination with a different target until February 21, 2020.
 
Redemption of public shares and liquidation if no initial business combination
 
We will have only until February 21, 2020 to complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our business combination within such time period, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price which is payable in cash and equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (less up to $50,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses, which interest shall be net of taxes payable by us and any amounts released to us to fund working capital requirements, subject to an annual limit of $250,000) divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our business combination within the 24-month time period.
 
Our initial stockholders have entered into letter agreements with us, pursuant to which they have waived their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to their founder shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination by
 
13




February 21, 2020. However, if our initial stockholders acquire public shares in or after our initial public offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the allotted 24-month time period.
 
Our sponsor, executive officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to a written letter agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by February 21, 2020, unless we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their shares of common stock upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price which is payable in cash and equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable by us and any amounts released to us to fund working capital requirements, subject to an annual limit of $250,000) divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. However, we may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon consummation of our initial business combination (so that we are not subject to the SECs penny stock rules). If this optional redemption right is exercised with respect to an excessive number of public shares such that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement (described above), we would not proceed with the amendment or the related redemption of our public shares at such time. Prior to acquiring any securities from our initial stockholders, permitted transferees must enter into a written agreement with us agreeing to be bound by the same restriction.
 
We expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from amounts remaining out of proceeds held outside the trust account, which were approximately $947,000 as of December 31, 2018, although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose. However, if those funds are not sufficient to cover the costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, to the extent that there is any interest accrued in the trust account not required to pay taxes, we may request the trustee to release to us an additional amount of up to $50,000 of such accrued interest to pay those costs and expenses.
 
If we were to expend all of the net proceeds of our initial public offering, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the per-share redemption amount received by stockholders upon our dissolution would be approximately $10.00. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public stockholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per-share redemption amount received by stockholders will not be substantially less than $10.00. Under Section 281(b) of the DGCL, our plan of dissolution must provide for all claims against us to be paid in full or make provision for payments to be made in full, as applicable, if there are sufficient assets. These claims must be paid or provided for before we make any distribution of our remaining assets to our stockholders. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors claims.
 
Although we have sought and will continue to seek to have all vendors, service providers, except our independent registered accounting firm, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public stockholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third-party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third partys engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third-party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. In order to protect the amounts held in the trust account, our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a vendor for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a definitive agreement for a business combination, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below (i) $10.00 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets other than due to the failure to obtain such waiver, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, then our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. We cannot assure you, however, that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. None of our officers will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.
 
In the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below (i) $10.00 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets other than due to the failure to obtain such waiver, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, and our sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular
 
14




claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be substantially less than $10.00 per share.
 
We have sought and will continue to seek to reduce the possibility that our sponsor will have to indemnify the trust account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account. Our sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. As of December 31, 2018, we have access to approximately $947,000 from the proceeds of our initial public offering with which to pay any such potential claims (including costs and expenses incurred in connection with our liquidation, currently estimated to be no more than approximately $50,000). In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, stockholders who received funds from our trust account could be liable for claims made by creditors.
 
Under the DGCL, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our trust account to be distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our business combination by February 21, 2020 may be considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the DGCL intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholders pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution.
 
Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our business combination by February 21, 2020 is not considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful (potentially due to the imposition of legal proceedings that a party may bring or due to other circumstances that are currently unknown), then pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidation distribution. If we are unable to complete our business combination by February 21, 2020, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price which is payable in cash and equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes and less up to $50,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Accordingly, it is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following February 21, 2020, and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with those procedures. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date.
 
Because we will not be complying with Section 280, Section 281(b) of the DGCL requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent 10 years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses. As described above, pursuant to the obligation contained in our underwriting agreement, we have sought and will continue to seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account.
 
As a result of this obligation, the claims that could be made against us are significantly limited and the likelihood that any claim that would result in any liability extending to the trust account is remote. Further, our sponsor may be liable only to the extent necessary to ensure that the amounts in the trust account are not reduced below (i) $10.00 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets other than due to the failure to obtain such waiver, in each case net of the amount of interest withdrawn to pay taxes or working capital expenses and less any per-share amounts distributed from our trust account to our public stockholders in the event we are unable to complete our business combination by February 21, 2020 and will not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims.
 
If we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the
 
15




trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return $10.00 per share to our public stockholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a preferential transfer or a fraudulent conveyance. As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons.
 
Our public stockholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) the completion of our initial business combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in connection with a stockholder vote to amend any provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation relating to stockholders rights or pre-initial business combination activity, and (iii) the redemption of all of our public shares if we are unable to complete our business combination by February 21, 2020, subject to applicable law. In no other circumstances will a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. In the event we seek stockholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, a stockholders voting in connection with the business combination alone will not result in a stockholders redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the trust account. Such stockholder must have also exercised its redemption rights described above.
 
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation
 
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains certain requirements and restrictions relating to our initial public offering that apply to us until the consummation of our initial business combination. If we seek to amend any provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation relating to stockholders rights or pre-initial business combination activity, we will provide dissenting public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares in connection with any such vote. Our initial stockholders have agreed to waive any redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our initial business combination. Specifically, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides, among other things, that:
 
·                  prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, we shall either (1) seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which stockholders may seek to redeem their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable by us and any amounts released to us to fund working capital requirements, subject to an annual limit of $250,000) or (2) provide our stockholders with the opportunity to tender their shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable by us and any amounts released to us to fund working capital requirements, subject to an annual limit of $250,000) in each case subject to the limitations described elsewhere in this report;
 
·                  we will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon consummation of our initial business combination and, solely if we seek stockholder approval, a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination;
 
·                  if our initial business combination is not consummated by February 21, 2020, then our existence will terminate and we will distribute all amounts in the trust account; and
 
·                  prior to our initial business combination, we may not issue additional shares of capital stock that would entitle the holders thereof to (i) receive funds from the trust account or (ii) vote on any initial business combination.
 
These provisions cannot be amended without the approval of holders of 65% of our common stock. In the event we seek stockholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we may consummate our initial business combination only if approved by a majority of the shares of common stock voted by our stockholders at a duly held stockholders meeting.
 
Competition
 
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the
 
16




resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.
 
Employees
 
We currently have two executive officers. Members of our management team are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time that Mr. Barasch and Mr. Wolfe or any other members of our management team will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the current stage of the business combination process, but we expect that Mr. Barasch and Mr. Wolfe will devote a substantial portion of their professional time to our affairs. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our business combination.
Periodic Reporting and Financial Information
 
We have registered our units, common stock and warrants under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports will contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accounting firm. These filings are available to the public via the Internet at the SECs website located at http://www.sec.gov. You may also read and copy any document that we file with the SEC at the SECs public reference room located at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. For more information, please call the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. You may request a copy of our filings with the SEC (excluding exhibits) at no cost by writing or telephoning us at the following address or telephone number:
DFB Healthcare Acquisitions Corp.
 780 Third Avenue
 New York, NY 10017
 Tel: (212) 551-1600
 
We will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing the target business. In all likelihood, these financial statements will need to be prepared in accordance with, or be reconciled to, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, or international financial reporting standards, or IFRS, depending on the circumstances. We cannot assure you that any particular target business selected by us as a potential acquisition candidate will have the necessary financial statements. To the extent that this requirement cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business. While this may limit the pool of potential acquisition candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material.
 
We will be required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the year ending December 31, 2019 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. As long as we maintain our status as an emerging growth company, we will not be required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement on our internal control over financial reporting. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.
 
We are an emerging growth company, as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
 
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
 
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of:
 
·                  the last day of the fiscal year:
 
·                  following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering,
 
·                  in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or
 
17




·                  in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th; and
 
·                  the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period.
 
References in this report to emerging growth company shall have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.

DFB HEALTHCARE ACQUISITIONS CORP.
 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
Note 1Description of Organization and Business Operations
 
DFB Healthcare Acquisitions Corp. (the Company) was incorporated in Delaware on November 22, 2017. The Company was formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (the Business Combination). Although the Company is not limited to a particular industry or sector for purposes of consummating a Business Combination, the Company intends to focus its search on the healthcare or healthcare related industries. The Company is an emerging growth company and, as such, the Company is subject to all of the risks associated with emerging growth companies.
 
As of December 31, 2018, the Company had not commenced any operations. All activity for the period from November 22, 2017 (inception) through December 31, 2018 relates to the Companys formation, the Companys initial public offering (the Initial Public Offering), and, since the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the search for a prospective initial Business Combination. The Company will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of its initial Business Combination, at the earliest. The Company will generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on cash and cash equivalents from the proceeds derived from the Initial Public Offering.
 
The Companys sponsor is Deerfield/RAB Ventures, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the Sponsor). The registration statement for the Companys Initial Public Offering was declared effective on February 15, 2018. On February 21, 2018, the Company consummated its Initial Public Offering of 25,000,000 units (each, a Unit and collectively, the Units) sold to the public at the price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $250 million and incurring offering costs of approximately $13.06 million, inclusive of $7.875 million in deferred underwriting commissions (Note 5). The underwriter was granted a 45-day option from the date of the final prospectus relating to the Initial Public Offering to purchase up to 3,750,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments, if any, at $10.00 per Unit. The over-allotment option was not exercised prior to its expiration on April 2, 2018.
 
Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the private placement (the Private Placement) of 4,333,333 warrants (each, a Private Placement Warrant and collectively, the Private Placement Warrants), at a price of $1.50 per Private Placement Warrant in a private placement to the Sponsor, generating gross proceeds of $6.5 million (Note 4). The Sponsor had agreed that, had the over-allotment option been exercised, the Sponsor would have purchased up to an additional 500,000 Private Placement Warrants at a price of $1.50 per Private Placement Warrant.
 
Upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement, $250 million ($10.00 per Unit) of the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement was placed in a trust account (the Trust Account), located in the United States at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee, and invested only in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act (as defined below), with a maturity of 180 days or less or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund selected by the Company meeting the conditions of paragraphs (d)(2), (d)(3) and (d)(4) of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act (as defined below), as determined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i) the completion of a Business Combination and (ii) the distribution of the Trust Account as described below.
 
At December 31, 2018, the Company had approximately $947,000 in cash held outside of the Trust Account. The Companys management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a Business Combination. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to complete a Business Combination successfully. The Company must complete one or more initial Business Combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the assets held in the Trust Account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on income earned on the Trust Account) at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial Business Combination. However, the Company will only complete a Business Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act).
 
The Company will provide its holders of the outstanding shares of its common stock, par value $0.0001, sold in the Initial Public Offering (the public stockholders) with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares (as defined below in Note 3) upon the completion of a Business Combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether the Company will seek stockholder approval of a Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by the Company, solely in its discretion. The public stockholders will be entitled to redeem their Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account (initially at $10.00 per Public Share). The per-share amount to be distributed to public stockholders who redeem their Public Shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions the Company will pay to the underwriters (as discussed in Note 5). These Public Shares are recorded at a redemption value and classified as temporary equity in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Boards (FASB) Accounting Standards
 
F-7




Codification (ASC) Topic 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. In such case, the Company will proceed with a Business Combination if the Company has net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation of a Business Combination and a majority of the shares voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination. If a stockholder vote is not required by law and the Company decides not to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation), conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) and file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination. If, however, stockholder approval of the transactions is required by law, or the Company decides to obtain stockholder approval for business or legal reasons, the Company will offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. Additionally, each public stockholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. If the Company seeks stockholder approval in connection with a Business Combination, the initial stockholders (as defined below) agreed to vote their Founder Shares (as defined below in Note 4) and any Public Shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering in favor of a Business Combination. The Companys insiders must: (i) refrain from purchasing shares during certain blackout periods and when they are in possession of any material non-public information and (ii) to clear all trades with the Companys legal counsel prior to execution. In addition, the initial stockholders agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their Founder Shares and Public Shares in connection with the completion of a Business Combination.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a group (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% or more of the common stock sold in the Initial Public Offering, without the prior consent of the Company.
 
The Companys Sponsor, officers and directors (the initial stockholders) agreed not to propose an amendment to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation that would affect the substance or timing of the Companys obligation to redeem 100% of its Public Shares if the Company does not complete a Business Combination, unless the Company provides the public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their shares of common stock in conjunction with any such amendment.
 
If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within 24 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering, or February 21, 2020, (the Combination Period), the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including interest (less up to $50,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses, which interest shall be net of taxes payable by the Company and any amounts released to the Company to fund working capital requirements, subject to an annual limit of $250,000), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Companys remaining stockholders and the Companys board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to the Companys obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.
 
The initial stockholders agreed to waive their liquidation rights with respect to the Founder Shares if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. However, if the initial stockholders should acquire Public Shares in or after the Initial Public Offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to such Public Shares if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. The underwriters agreed to waive their rights to their deferred underwriting commission (see Note 5) held in the Trust Account in the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination within in the Combination Period and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the other funds held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the residual assets remaining available for distribution (including Trust Account assets) will be only $10.00 per share initially held in the Trust Account. In order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, the Sponsor has agreed to be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a vendor for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account. This liability will not apply with respect to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the Trust Account or to any claims under the Companys indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act). Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. The Company has sought and will continue to seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account.

Liquidity and Going Concern
 
As of December 31, 2018, the Company had approximately $947,000 in its operating bank account, a working capital of approximately $406,000, and approximately $3.0 million of interest income available to fund a Business Combination (which interest shall be net of taxes payable and any amounts, subject to an annual limit of $250,000 released to the Company to fund working capital requirements). In order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor, or certain of the Companys officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds as may be required (Working Capital Loans) (see Note 4).
 
Through December 31, 2018, the Companys liquidity needs have been satisfied through receipt of a $25,000 capital contribution from the Sponsor in exchange for the issuance of the Founder Shares (Note 5) to the Sponsor, $270,531 in loans from the Sponsor, the proceeds from the consummation of the Private Placement not held in the Trust Account, and interest withdrawn from the Trust Account of approximately $1.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 for working capital and taxes purposes. The Company fully repaid the loans from the Sponsor on February 21, 2018.
 
In connection with the Companys assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with FASBs Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entitys Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, the Companys management has determined that the mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution raises substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. No adjustments have been made to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities should the Company be required to liquidate after February 21, 2020.
 
Note 2Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
 
Basis of Presentation
 
The Companys financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC.
Emerging Growth Company
 
Section 102(b)(1) of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act) exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard.
 
This may make comparison of the Companys financial statements with another public company that is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company that has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.
 
Concentration of Credit Risk
 
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash accounts in a financial institution, which, at times, may exceed the Federal Depository Insurance Coverage of $250,000. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company has not experienced losses on these accounts and management believes the Company is not exposed to significant risks on such accounts.
Financial Instruments
 
The fair value of the Companys assets and liabilities, which qualify as financial instruments under the FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, approximates the carrying amounts represented on the balance sheets.
Use of Estimates
 
The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the Companys management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
F-9




Offering Costs
 
Offering costs, which consist of legal, accounting, underwriting fees and other costs that were directly related to the Initial Public Offering, totaled approximately $13.06 million, inclusive of $7.875 million in deferred underwriting commissions. Offering costs were charged to stockholders equity upon the completion of the Initial Public Offering.
Common Stock Subject to Possible Redemption
 
The Company accounts for its common stock subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in ASC Topic 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. Shares of common stock subject to mandatory redemption (if any) are classified as liability instruments and are measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable shares of common stock (including shares of common stock that feature redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within the Companys control) are classified as temporary equity. At all other times, shares of common stock are classified as stockholders equity. The Companys common stock features certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of the Companys control and subject to the occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, at December 31, 2018, 24,054,988 shares of common stock subject to possible redemption at the redemption amount are presented as temporary equity, outside of the stockholders equity section of the Companys balance sheet.
Net Income (Loss) per Share
 
Net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the periods. The Company has not considered the effect of the warrants sold in the Initial Public Offering (including the consummation of the over-allotment) and the Private Placement to purchase an aggregate of 12,666,666 shares of the Companys common stock in the calculation of diluted income per share, since their inclusion would be anti-dilutive under the treasury stock method.
 
The Companys statements of operations include a presentation of income per share for common stock subject to redemption in a manner similar to the two-class method of income per share. Net income per common share, basic and diluted for Public Shares is calculated by dividing the interest income earned on the Trust Account of approximately $4.2 million, net of applicable taxes and funds available to be withdrawn from the Trust Account for working capital purposes (subject to an annual limit of $250,000), resulting in a total of approximately $2.9 million, by the weighted average number of Public Shares outstanding for the periods. Net income per common share, basic and diluted for Founder Shares for year ended December 31, 2018 is calculated by dividing the net income, less income attributable to Public Shares by the weighted average number of Founder Shares outstanding for the periods.
 
Net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. At December 31, 2017, the Company did not have any dilutive securities and other contracts that could, potentially, be exercised or converted into shares of common stock and then share in the earnings of the Company. As a result, diluted loss per share is the same as basic loss per share for the period from November 22, 2017 (inception) through December 31, 2017.
 
Income Taxes
 
The Company follows the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes under FASB ASC 740, Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that included the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.
 
FASB ASC 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. There were no unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. The Company is currently not aware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals or material deviation from its position. The Company is subject to income tax examinations by major taxing authorities since inception.
 
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
 
In August 2018, the SEC adopted the final rule under SEC Release No. 33-10532, Disclosure Update and Simplification, amending certain disclosure requirements that were redundant, duplicative, overlapping, outdated or superseded. In addition, the amendments expanded the disclosure requirements on the analysis of stockholders equity for financial statements. Under the amendments, an analysis of changes in each caption of stockholders equity presented in the balance sheet must be provided in a note or separate statement. The analysis should present a reconciliation of the beginning balance to the ending balance of each period for which a statement of income is required to be filed. The Company anticipates its first presentation of the revised presentation of changes in
F-10




stockholders equity will be included in its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2019.
 
The Companys management does not believe that there are any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, that, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Companys financial statements.
Note 3Public Offering
 
On February 21, 2018, the Company sold 25,000,000 Units at a price of $10.00 per Unit in the Initial Public Offering. Each Unit consists of one share of common stock (such shares of common stock included in the Units being offered, the Public Shares), and one-third of one redeemable warrant (each, a Public Warrant). Each Public Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of common stock at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment (see Note 6).
Note 4Related Party Transactions
 
Founder Shares
 
On December 15, 2017, the Sponsor purchased 7,187,500 shares (the Founder Shares) of the Companys common stock, par value $0.0001 for an aggregate price of $25,000. In December 2017 and January 2018, the Sponsor transferred 100,000 Founder Shares to Christopher Wolfe, the Companys Chief Financial Officer, and 30,000 Founder Shares to each of Steven Hochberg, Dr. Susan Weaver, Dr. Mohit Kaushal and Dr. Gregory Sorensen, the Companys independent directors. The initial stockholders agreed to forfeit up to 937,500 Founder Shares to the extent that the over-allotment option was not exercised in full by the underwriters. The forfeiture was to be adjusted to the extent that the over-allotment option was not exercised in full by the underwriters so that the Founder Shares would represent 20.0% of the Companys issued and outstanding shares after the Initial Public Offering. On April 2, 2018, the over-allotment option expired and an aggregate of 937,500 shares were subsequently forfeited by the initial stockholders.
 
The initial stockholders agreed, subject to limited exceptions, not to transfer, assign or sell any of their Founder Shares until the earlier to occur of: (A) one year after the completion of the initial Business Combination or (B) subsequent to the initial Business Combination, (x) if the last sale price of the common stock equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150 days after the initial Business Combination, or (y) the date on which the Company completes a liquidation, merger, capital stock exchange or other similar transaction that results in all of the Companys stockholders having the right to exchange their shares of common stock for cash, securities or other property.
 
Private Placement Warrants
 
Concurrently with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Sponsor purchased an aggregate of 4,333,333 Private Placement Warrants at a price of $1.50 per Private Placement Warrant, generating gross proceeds of $6.5 million in the Private Placement. The Sponsor had agreed that if the over-allotment option was exercised, the Sponsor would have purchased up to an additional 500,000 Private Placement Warrants at a price of $1.50 per Private Placement Warrant, for additional gross proceeds of $750,000.
 
Each Private Placement Warrant is exercisable for one share of common stock at a price of $11.50 per share. The proceeds from the Private Placement Warrants will be added to the proceeds from the Initial Public Offering to be held in the Trust Account. If the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, the Private Placement Warrants will expire worthless. The Private Placement Warrants will be non-redeemable and exercisable on a cashless basis so long as they are held by the Sponsor or its permitted transferees.
 
The Sponsor and the Companys officers and directors agreed, subject to limited exceptions, not to transfer, assign or sell any of their Private Placement Warrants until 30 days after the completion of the initial Business Combination.
 
An affiliate of Deerfield Management Company, L.P, a Delaware series limited partnership (Deerfield Management), which is a significant owner of the Sponsor, purchased 2,500,000 Units in the Initial Public Offering at $10.00 per Unit. The underwriters did not receive any underwriting discounts or commissions on the Units purchased by Deerfield Managements affiliate. In addition, Deerfield Management has indicated an interest to purchase up to an aggregate of $100 million of the Companys shares of common stock in a private placement that would occur concurrently with the consummation of the initial Business Combination. The funds from such private placement would be used as part of the consideration to the sellers in the initial Business Combination, and any excess funds from such private placement would be used for working capital in the post-transaction company. However, because indications of interest are not binding agreements or commitments to purchase, Deerfield Management may determine not to purchase any such shares, or to purchase fewer shares than they have indicated an interest in purchasing. Furthermore, the Company is not under any obligation to sell any such shares.
 
F-11




Related Party Loans
 
The Sponsor loaned the Company an aggregate of $270,531 to cover expenses related to the Initial Public Offering and working capital needs. The loan was non-interest bearing. The Company repaid this loan on February 21, 2018.
 
In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor, or certain of the Companys officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds as may be required (the Working Capital Loans). If the Company completes a Business Combination, the Company would repay the Working Capital Loans out of the proceeds of the Trust Account released to the Company. Otherwise, the Working Capital Loans would be repaid only out of funds held outside the Trust Account. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, the Company may use a portion of proceeds held outside the Trust Account to repay the Working Capital Loans but no proceeds held in the Trust Account would be used to repay the Working Capital Loans. Except for the foregoing, the terms of such Working Capital Loans, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. The Working Capital Loans would either be repaid upon consummation of a Business Combination, without interest, or, at the lenders discretion, up to $1.5 million of such Working Capital Loans may be convertible into warrants of the post Business Combination entity at a price of $1.50 per warrant. The warrants would be identical to the Private Placement Warrants. To date, the Company had no borrowings under the Working Capital Loans.
 
Note 5Commitments & Contingencies
 
Registration Rights
 
The holders of Founder Shares, Private Placement Warrants and warrants that may be issued upon conversion of Working Capital Loans, if any, will be entitled to registration rights (in the case of the Founder Shares, only after conversion of such shares to shares of common stock) pursuant to a registration rights agreement entered into on February 15, 2018. These holders will be entitled to certain demand and piggyback registration rights. However, the registration rights agreement provides that the Company will not permit any registration statement filed under the Securities Act to become effective until the termination of the applicable lock-up period for the securities to be registered. The Company will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements.
Administrative Services Agreement
 
The Company entered into an agreement, commencing on February 16, 2018 through the earlier of the Companys consummation of a Business Combination and its liquidation, to pay the Sponsor a total of $10,000 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support.
 
The Company is obligated to pay $7,500 per month to Mr. Wolfe, the Companys Chief Financial Officer, for his services prior to the consummation of the initial Business Combination, subject to the terms of the strategic services agreement.
 
The Sponsor, executive officers and directors, or any of their respective affiliates, will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on the Companys behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable Business Combinations. The Companys audit committee will review on a quarterly basis all payments that were made to the Sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates and will determine which expenses and the amount of expenses that will be reimbursed. There is no cap or ceiling on the reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such persons in connection with activities on the Companys behalf.
 
The Company recorded an aggregate of $183,000 and $0 in general and administrative expenses in connection with the related agreements in the accompanying statements of operations during the year ended December 31, 2018 and for the period from November 22, 2017 (inception) through December 31, 2017, respectively.
 
Underwriting Agreement
 
The Company granted the underwriters a 45-day option from the date of the final prospectus relating to the Initial Public Offering to purchase up to 3,750,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments, if any, at the Initial Public Offering price less the underwriting discounts and commissions. The option expired on April 2, 2018.
 
The underwriters were entitled to an underwriting discount of $0.20 per Unit, or $4.5 million in the aggregate, paid upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering. In addition, $0.35 per Unit, or $7.875 million in the aggregate will be payable to the underwriters for deferred underwriting commissions. The deferred fee will become payable to the underwriters from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that the Company completes a Business Combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement.
 
The underwriters did not receive any underwriting discounts or commissions on the 2,500,000 Units purchased by Deerfield Management in the Initial Public Offering.

Note 6Stockholders Equity
 
Common StockOn February 15, 2018, the Company filed its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to increase its number of authorized common stock to 200,000,000 shares with a par value of $0.0001 per share. Holders of common stock are entitled to one vote for each share. As of December 31, 2017, there were 7,187,500 shares of common stock outstanding, including 937,500 shares subject to forfeiture to the Company by the Sponsor for no consideration to the extent that the underwriters over-allotment option is not exercised in full or in part. On April 2, 2018, the over-allotment option expired, and 937,500 shares were forfeited accordingly. As of December 31, 2018, there were 31,250,000 shares of common stock outstanding, including 24,054,988 shares of common stock subject to possible redemption.
Preferred StockThe Company is authorized to issue 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock with such designations, voting and other rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by the Companys board of directors. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, there were no shares of preferred stock issued or outstanding.
WarrantsPublic Warrants may only be exercised for a whole number of shares. No fractional Public Warrants will be issued upon separation of the Units and only whole Public Warrants will trade. The Public Warrants will become exercisable 30 days after the completion of a Business Combination; provided that the Company has an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the common stock issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants and a current prospectus relating to them is available (or the Company permits holders to exercise their Public Warrants on a cashless basis and such cashless exercise is exempt from registration under the Securities Act). The Company has agreed that as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 20 business days, after the closing of a Business Combination, the Company will use its best efforts to file with the SEC a registration statement for the registration, under the Securities Act, of the common stock issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants. The Company will use its best efforts to cause the same to become effective and to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement, and a current prospectus relating thereto, until the expiration of the Public Warrants in accordance with the provisions of the warrant agreement. If a registration statement covering the common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants is not effective by the sixtieth (60th) day after the closing of the initial Business Combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement and during any period when the Company will have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a cashless basis in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act or another exemption. The Public Warrants will expire five years after the completion of a Business Combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation.
 
The Private Placement Warrants are identical to the Public Warrants underlying the Units sold in the Initial Public Offering, except that the Private Placement Warrants and the common stock issuable upon exercise of the Private Placement Warrants will not be transferable, assignable or salable until 30 days after the completion of a Business Combination, subject to certain limited exceptions. Additionally, the Private Placement Warrants will be non-redeemable so long as they are held by the initial purchasers or such purchasers permitted transferees. If the Private Placement Warrants are held by someone other than the initial stockholders or their permitted transferees, the Private Placement Warrants will be redeemable by the Company and exercisable by such holders on the same basis as the Public Warrants.
 
The Company may call the Public Warrants for redemption (except with respect to the Private Placement Warrants):
 
·            in whole and not in part;
 ·    at a price of $0.01 per warrant;
 ·    upon a minimum of 30 days prior written notice of redemption; and
 ·    if, and only if, the last reported closing price of the ordinary shares equals or exceeds $18.00 per share for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders.
 
If the Company calls the Public Warrants for redemption, management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise the Public Warrants to do so on a cashless basis, as described in the warrant agreement.
 
The exercise price and number of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the event of a share dividend, or recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. However, the warrants will not be adjusted for issuance of common stock at a price below its exercise price. Additionally, in no event will the Company be required to net cash settle the warrant shares. If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and the Company liquidates the funds held in the Trust Account, holders of warrants will not receive any of such funds with respect to their warrants, nor will they receive any distribution from the Companys assets held outside of the Trust Account with the respect to such warrants. Accordingly, the warrants may expire worthless.

Note 7Fair Value Measurements
 
The following table presents information about the Companys assets that are measured on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2018 and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques that the Company utilized to determine such fair value.

 | Quoted Prices | | Significant Other | Significant Other 
-------------------------------------------------------+-------------------+-------------+-------------------+--------------------
 | in Active Markets | | Observable Inputs | Unobservable Inputs
Description | (Level 1) | | (Level 2) | (Level 3) 
Cash and marketable securities held in Trust Account | $ | 253,019,179 | | 

 
Approximately $906 of the balance in the Trust Account was held in cash as of December 31, 2018.
 
Note 8  Income Taxes
 
The income tax provision (benefit) consists of the following:
 

 | December 31 | 
--------------------------------+-------------+--------
 | 2018 | | 2017 | 
Current | | | | 
Federal | $ | 829,807 | | $ | 
State |  | |  | 
Deferred | | | | 
Federal | 217,349 | | 146 | 
State |  | |  | 
Change in valuation allowance | (217,349 | ) | (146 | )
Income tax provision expense | $ | 829,807 | | $ | 

 
The Companys net deferred tax assets are as follows:
 

 | December 31 | 
---------------------------------------+-------------+--------
 | 2018 | | 2017 | 
Deferred tax asset | | | | 
Startup/Organizational Costs | $ | 217,494 | | $ | 145
Total deferred tax assets | 217,494 | | 145 | 
Valuation Allowance | (217,494 | ) | (145 | )
Deferred tax asset, net of allowance | $ |  | | $ |  

 
In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences representing net future deductible amounts become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax assets, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. After consideration of all of the information available, Management believes that significant uncertainty exists with respect to future realization of the deferred tax assets and has therefore established a full valuation allowance. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the valuation allowance was approximately $217,000.
 
A reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rate (benefit) to the Companys effective tax rate is as follows:
 

 | December 31 | 
------------------------------------------+-------------+--
 | 2018 | | 2017 | 
Statutory federal income tax rate | 21.0 | % | (21.0 | )%
State taxes, net of federal tax benefit | 0.0 | % | 0.0 | % 
Meals & entertainment | 0.0 | % | 0.0 | % 
Valuation allowance | 7.5 | % | 21.0 | % 
Income tax provision expense | 28.5 | % | 0.0 | %
