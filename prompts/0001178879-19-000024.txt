Item 1.    BUSINESS
Overview
We are a global patient-dedicated biotechnology company engaged in the discovery, development and commercialization of a diverse set of novel treatments for patients living with rare metabolic diseases. With one medicine for Fabry disease achieving global approval, a differentiated biologic for Pompe disease in late-stage clinical development and fourteen gene therapy programs in the pipeline, including two clinical stage gene therapies for Batten disease, we have a leading portfolio of therapies for lysosomal storage disorders (“LSDs”).
The cornerstone of our portfolio is Galafold®, (also referred to as “migalastat HCl” or “migalastat”), the first and only approved oral precision medicine for people living with Fabry disease who have amenable genetic variants, or mutations. Galafold® is currently approved in the United States (“U.S.”), European Union (“EU”) and Japan, with additional approvals granted and applications pending in several geographies. During the third quarter of 2018, we initiated the commercial launch of Galafold® in the U.S. for the treatment of adult patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Fabry disease and an amenable genetic variant.

The lead biologics program of our pipeline is Amicus Therapeutics GAA (“AT-GAA”, also known as ATB200/AT2221), a novel, clinical-stage, potential best-in-class treatment paradigm for Pompe disease. Our Chaperone-Advanced Replacement Therapy (“CHART®”) platform technology is leveraged to combine our novel Pompe biologic ATB200 with a pharmacological chaperone AT2221. 
During the second half of 2018, we expanded our portfolio to include fourteen new gene therapy programs. During the third quarter of 2018, we acquired worldwide development and commercial rights for ten gene therapy programs for neurologic LSDs developed at The Center for Gene Therapy at The Research Institute at Nationwide Children’s Hospital ("NCH") and The Ohio State University through the acquisition of Celenex, Inc. (“Celenex”), a private, clinical stage gene therapy company, for cash consideration of $100.0 million and additional consideration payable upon the achievement of certain development and approval milestones. The acquisition establishes Amicus as a leading company in neurologic LSDs. The lead programs in CLN6, CLN3, and CLN8 Batten disease are potential first-to-market curative therapies for these rare, devastating diseases. 
In October 2018, we further expanded our gene therapy portfolio through a collaboration agreement with the Gene Therapy Program in the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania (“Penn”) to pursue the research and development of novel gene therapies for four additional indications, including Pompe disease, Fabry disease, CDKL5 deficiency disorder (“CDD”) and one additional undisclosed rare metabolic disorder. This relationship will combine our protein engineering and glycobiology expertise with Penn’s adeno associated virus (“AAV”) gene transfer technologies to develop AAV gene therapies designed for optimal cellular uptake, targeting, dosing, safety and manufacturability. 
 In February 2019, we announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation (“BTD”) to AT-GAA in late onset Pompe disease. AT-GAA is the first ever investigational product for Pompe disease to receive BTD. The BTD will facilitate multidisciplinary, comprehensive discussions of the AT-GAA development program with the FDA, including planned clinical trials and plans for expediting manufacturing development strategy. The BTD for AT-GAA is based on clinical efficacy results from the ongoing ATB200-02 Phase 1/2 clinical study, including improvements in six-minute walk distance in late onset Pompe patients and comparison to natural history of treated patients.
We believe that our platform technologies and our product pipeline uniquely position us and drive our commitment to advancing and expanding a robust pipeline of cutting-edge, first- or best-in-class medicines for rare metabolic diseases.

Our Strategy
Our strategy is to create, manufacture, test and deliver the highest quality medicines for people living with rare metabolic diseases through internally developed, acquired or in-licensed products and product candidates that have the potential to obsolete current treatments, provide significant benefits to patients, and be first- or best-in-class. In addition to our lead programs in Fabry and Pompe, we have begun to leverage our global capabilities to develop and expand our robust pipeline through our recent entry into genomic medicine. Since the beginning of 2017, we have made significant progress toward fulfilling our vision to build a leading global biotechnology company focused on rare metabolic diseases. 
Highlights of our progress in 2018 include:

• | Commercial and regulatory success in Fabry disease. During the year ended December 31, 2018, Galafold® revenue totaled approximately $91.2 million. Revenue has been generated primarily in the EU since May of 2016. In 2018, we received approvals for Galafold® in the U.S. and Japan.


• | Pompe clinical program milestones. We reported a series of positive data from a Phase 1/2 clinical study to evaluate Pompe disease patients treated with our novel treatment paradigm AT-GAA for up to 18 months. We also initiated a global pivotal study of AT-GAA (ATB200-03, also known as PROPEL) which is expected to enroll approximately 100 participants with late-onset Pompe disease at up to 90 global sites.


• | Pipeline Growth: With 14 new gene therapy programs for LSDs, we have established a leading portfolio of medicines for people living with rare metabolic disorders. Through our license with NCH, we acquired worldwide development and commercial rights for ten gene therapy programs in rare, neurologic LSDs with lead programs in CLN6, CLN3, and CLN8 Batten disease. An additional four programs were added to the pipeline through the collaboration with Penn to pursue research and development of novel gene therapies for Pompe disease, Fabry disease, CDKL5 deficiency disorder (“CDD”) and one additional undisclosed rare metabolic disorder. 


• | Manufacturing. We successfully scaled up manufacturing of our Pompe biologic to commercial scale (1,000L) for our pivotal PROPEL study and commercial supply. Our supply agreement with WuXi Biologics and current capacity are expected to produce sufficient quantities to serve the entire Pompe population as quickly as possible after receipt of applicable regulatory approvals. Through our collaborations with NCH and Penn, we also gain access to their preclinical manufacturing capabilities, clinical supply and CMO relationships for those gene therapy programs.


• | Financial strength. Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $504.2 million at December 31, 2018 compared to $358.6 million at December 31, 2017. The current cash position, including expected Galafold® revenues, is sufficient to fund ongoing Fabry, Pompe and gene therapy program operations into at least mid-2021. Potential future business development collaborations, pipeline expansion, and investment in manufacturing capabilities could impact our future capital requirements.

Our Commercial Product and Product Candidates
Galafold® (Migalastat HCl) for Fabry Disease
Our oral precision medicine Galafold® was granted accelerated approval by the FDA in August 2018 under the brand name Galafold® for the treatment of adults with a confirmed diagnosis of Fabry disease and an amenable galactosidase alpha gene ("GLA") variant based on in vitro assay data. The FDA approved Galafold® for 348 amenable GLA variants. Galafold® was approved in the EU in May 2016 as a first-line therapy for long-term treatment of adults and adolescents, aged 16 years and older, with a confirmed diagnosis of Fabry disease and who have an amenable variant. The approved EU label includes 367 Fabry-causing variants, which represent up to half of all patients with Fabry disease. Approvals have also been granted in Australia, Canada, Israel, Japan, South Korea, and Switzerland, with additional applications pending in other geographies. We have been granted pricing and reimbursement in 22 countries. We plan to continue to launch Galafold® in additional countries during 2019.
As an orally administered monotherapy, Galafold® is designed to bind to and stabilize an endogenous alpha-galactosidase A (“alpha-Gal A”) enzyme in those patients with genetic variants identified as amenable in a GLP cell-based amenability assay. Galafold® is an oral precision medicine intended to treat Fabry disease in patients who have amenable genetic variants and, at this time, it is not intended for concomitant use with ERT.

Fabry Disease Background
Patients with Fabry disease have an inherited deficiency of the alpha-Gal A enzyme that would normally degrade the lipid substrate globotriaosylceramide in the lysosome. Genetic variants that cause changes in the amino acid sequence of alpha-Gal A result in an unstable enzyme that does not efficiently fold into its correct three-dimensional shape and cannot be trafficked properly in the cell, even if it has the potential for biological activity. Galafold® is an oral small molecule pharmacological chaperone that is designed to bind to and stabilize a patient’s own endogenous target protein. This is considered a precision medicine because Galafold® targets only patients with GLA variants amenable to Galafold®.
Fabry disease is an X-linked disease caused by mutations in the GLA gene, which encodes the alpha-Gal A enzyme. These mutations can cause alpha-Gal A to be either absent or deficient. When alpha-Gal A is absent or deficient the substrates, GL-3 and lyso-Gb3 accumulate, leading to damage of cells within affected parts of the individual's body and causing the various pathologies seen in Fabry disease. Fabry disease leads to progressive, irreversible organ damage, typically involving the nervous, cardiac, and renal systems, as well as multiple other tissues. The symptoms can be severe, differ from patient to patient, and begin at an early age, resulting in significant clinical, humanistic, and healthcare costs. Fabry disease requires lifelong medical intervention to manage the complications of this devastating disease across multiple organ systems.
Fabry disease is a relatively rare disorder. The annual incidence of Fabry disease in newborn males has been estimated to be 1:40,000-1:60,000 (Journal of the American Medical Association January 1999 and The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease 8th edition 2001). Recent newborn screening studies in Italy, Taiwan, Austria and the U.S., which screened more than 526,000 newborns, found the incidence of Fabry disease mutations to be between 1:2,400 to 1:8,454, more than ten times higher than previous estimates for classic patients. (American Journal of Human Genetics 2006, Human Mutation 2009, the Lancet 2011, Journal of Pediatrics 2017, and JAMA Pediatrics 2018). 
Based on this, we believe that approximately 35-50% of the Fabry disease patient population may benefit from treatment with Galafold® as a monotherapy. Additionally, we expect that as awareness of late-onset symptoms of Fabry disease grows, the number of patients diagnosed with the disease will increase. Increased awareness of Fabry disease, particularly for specialists not accustomed to treating Fabry disease patients, may lead to increased testing and diagnosis of patients with the disease.
Currently, two other products, both ERTs, are approved for the treatment of Fabry disease: agalsidase beta and agalsidase alfa. The net product sales of agalsidase beta and agalsidase alfa for 2018 were approximately $742.5 million as publicly reported by Sanofi Aventis, and $498.1 million as publicly reported by Takeda, respectively.
Gene Therapy for Fabry Disease
We are committed to continued innovation for all people living with Fabry disease. For people living with Fabry disease who have non-amenable variants, which are not suitable for Galafold® as a monotherapy, our strategy is to develop a Fabry gene therapy. In October 2018, we further expanded our gene therapy portfolio through a collaboration agreement with Penn to pursue research and development of novel gene therapies for Fabry disease. For additional information, see above “-Overview.”
Novel ERT for Pompe Disease
We are leveraging our biologics capabilities and CHART® platform to develop AT-GAA, a novel treatment paradigm for
Pompe disease. AT-GAA consists of a uniquely engineered rhGAA enzyme, ATB200, with an optimized carbohydrate structure to enhance lysosomal uptake, administered in combination with a pharmacological chaperone, AT2221, to improve activity and stability. We initiated a global phase 3 clinical study (ATB200-03, or PROPEL) of AT-GAA in adult patients with late onset Pompe disease in 2018, with the first patient dosed in December 2018.
Our strategy is to enhance the body of clinical data for AT-GAA in ongoing clinical studies, including the pivotal study (PROPEL) to deliver this potential new therapy to as many people living with Pompe disease as soon as possible. Based on regulatory feedback from both the U.S. FDA and the European Medicines Agency ("EMA"), the PROPEL study is expected to support approval for a broad indication, including ERT-switch and treatment-naïve patients. 
The pharmacological chaperone, AT2221 is not an active ingredient that contributes directly to GAA substrate reduction but instead acts to stabilize ATB200. The small molecule pharmacological chaperone AT2221 binds and stabilizes ATB200 to improve the uptake of active enzyme in key disease-relevant tissues, resulting in increased clearance of accumulated substrate, glycogen.

In preclinical studies, AT-GAA demonstrated greater tissue enzyme levels and further substrate reduction compared to the currently approved ERT for Pompe disease (alglucosidase alfa).
On February 5, 2019 we reported additional interim data from our clinical study ATB200-02 at the 15th Annual WORLDSymposium™. Highlights included safety and tolerability data in patients as well as pharmacodynamic "PD" data (muscle damage biomarker and disease substrate biomarker). To date, adverse events have been generally mild and transient. AT-GAA has resulted in a low rate of infusion-associated reactions (“IARs”) following 1,110+ infusions (16 events of IARs in six patients). The clinical pharmacokinetic profile has been consistent with previously reported preclinical data. Treatment with AT-GAA resulted in persistent and durable reductions in creatine kinase and urine hexose tetrasaccharide across all patient cohorts up to month 24.
With regard to efficacy, muscle function improved in 16 out of 17 patients who have available data for up to 21 or 24 months. Mean 6MWT improved in both ERT-naïve and ERT-switch patients with continued benefit observed out to month 24. All 5 ERT-naive patients showed increases in 6MWT distance at all time points out to month 21. The ERT-naïve patients showed mean increases of 42 meters at month 6 (n=5), 63 meters at month 12 (n=5), and 55 meters at month 21 (n=5). 6MWT increased in 7/10, 9/10, and 8/8 ERT-switch patients at Months 6, 12, and 24 respectively. The ERT-switch patients showed mean increases of 24 meters at month 6 (n=10), 42 meters at month 12 (n=10), and 54 meters at month 24 (n=8). Other motor function tests generally showed mean improvements consistent with 6MWT distance out to month 21 or 24 in both ambulatory cohorts. Non-ambulatory ERT-switch patients showed improvements in upper extremity strength (which includes elbow and shoulder) from baseline to month 24, as measured by quantitative muscle testing and manual muscle testing. Pulmonary function improved in ERT-naïve patients and was generally stable in ERT-switch patients. In ERT-naïve patients, mean absolute change in forced vital capacity (FVC), one of the main measures of pulmonary function in Pompe disease, was +4.2% at month 6 (n=5), +4.5% at month 12 (n=5), and +6.1% at month 21 (n=5). In ERT-switch patients mean absolute change in FVC was -1.2% at month 6 (n=9), -3.0% at month 12 (n=9), and -0.6% at month 24 (n=7). Overall, other pulmonary tests of maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP), a measure of inhalation, and maximal expiratory pressure (MEP), a measure of exhalation, were stable or increased in both ERT-naïve and ERT-switch patients.
Pompe Disease Background
Like Fabry disease, Pompe disease is an LSD that results from a deficiency in an enzyme, GAA. Signs and symptoms of Pompe disease can be severe and debilitating and include progressive muscle weakness throughout the body, particularly the heart and skeletal muscles. GAA deficiency causes accumulation of glycogen in cells, which is believed to result in the clinical manifestations of Pompe disease. Pompe disease ranges from a rapidly fatal infantile form with severe cardiac involvement to a more slowly progressive, late-onset form primarily affecting skeletal muscle. All forms are characterized by severe muscle weakness that worsens over time. In the early-onset form, patients are usually diagnosed shortly after birth and often experience enlargement of the heart and severe muscle weakness. In late-onset Pompe disease, symptoms may not appear until late childhood or adulthood and patients often experience progressive muscle weakness.
According to reported estimates of the Acid Maltase Deficiency Association, the United Pompe Foundation, and the Lysosomal Disease Program at Massachusetts General Hospital, there are 5,000-10,000 patients with Pompe disease worldwide.
Currently, one other product, an ERT, is approved for the treatment of Pompe disease: alglucosidase alfa. The net product sales of alglucosidase alfa for 2018 were approximately $827.5 million as publicly reported by Sanofi Aventis.
Gene Therapy for Pompe Disease
As part of our long-term commitment to provide multiple solutions to address the significant unmet needs of the Pompe community, we are also advancing a next-generation gene therapy as a potential cure for Pompe disease. In October 2018, we further expanded our gene therapy portfolio through a collaboration agreement with Penn to pursue research and development of novel gene therapies for, among other indications, Pompe disease. For additional information, see above “-Overview.”

CDKL5 Deficiency Disorder (“CDD”)
We are also researching a potential first-in-class protein replacement therapy approach. Through our collaboration with Penn, we are also researching a gene therapy for CDD. CDKL5 is a gene on the X-chromosome encoding the CDKL5 protein that regulates the expression of several essential proteins for normal brain development. Genetic mutations in the CDKL5 gene result in CDKL5 protein deficiency and CDD. This disorder manifests clinically as persistent seizures starting in infancy, followed by severe impairment in neurological development. Most children affected by CDD cannot walk or care for themselves and may also suffer from scoliosis, visual impairment, sensory issues, and gastrointestinal complications. 
Batten Disease Product Candidates
We are researching potential first-in-class gene therapies for multiple forms of Batten disease. Batten disease is the common name for a broad class of rare, fatal, inherited disorders of the nervous system also known as neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses, or NCLs. In these diseases, a defect in a specific gene triggers a cascade of problems that interferes with a cell’s ability to recycle certain molecules. Each gene is called CLN (ceroid lipofuscinosis, neuronal) and given a different number designation as its subtype. There are 13 known forms of Batten disease often referred to as CLN1-8; 10-14. The various types of Batten disease have similar features and symptoms but vary in severity and age of onset.
Most forms of Batten disease/NCLs usually begin during childhood. The clinical course often involves progressive loss of independent adaptive skills such as mobility, feeding, and communication. Patients may also experience vision loss, personality changes, behavioral problems, learning impairment, and seizures. Patients typically experience progressive loss of motor function and eventually those affected become wheelchair-bound, are then bedridden, and die prematurely.
The two clinical stage gene therapies are in CLN3 and CLN6 Batten disease. The CLN6 Batten disease Phase 1/2 study completed target enrollment, with 12 patients receiving a single administration of adeno-associated virus serotype 9 AAV9-CLN6 gene therapy. We expect to report additional two-year data from CLN6 Batten disease Phase 1/2 study in 2019. 
CLN6 Batten disease results from a mutation in the CLN6 gene which primarily affects the nervous system. The CLN6 population is approximately 1,000 patients across our commercial landscape today.
In the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company announced the initiation of a Phase 1/2 clinical study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a single intrathecal administration of adeno-associated virus serotype 9 AAV9-CLN3 gene therapy in children with CLN3 Batten disease. CLN3 Batten disease, the most common form of NCL results from a mutation in the CLN3 gene which primarily affects the nervous system. Children with this condition develop vision impairment, intellectual disability, progressive loss of motor function, speech difficulties, and seizures which worsen over time.
CLN3 impacts approximately 5,000 patients across our commercial landscape today and there are no approved therapies for this disorder.
Strategic Alliances and Arrangements

In October 2018, we further expanded our gene therapy portfolio through a collaboration agreement with Penn to pursue research and development of novel gene therapies for four additional indications, including Pompe disease, Fabry disease, CDD and one additional undisclosed rare metabolic disorder. For additional information, see above “—Overview.” See also "—Collaboration and License Agreements" below for additional information on strategic alliances and arrangements.
We will continue to evaluate business development opportunities as appropriate that build stockholder value and provide us with access to the financial, technical, clinical, and commercial resources necessary to develop and market technologies or products with a focus on rare metabolic diseases. We are exploring potential collaborations, alliances, and other business development opportunities on a regular basis. These opportunities may include the acquisition of preclinical-stage, clinical-stage or marketed products so long as such transactions are consistent with our strategic plan to develop and provide therapies to patients living with rare and orphan diseases.

Our Technology Platforms
Pharmacological Chaperone Technology
Our pharmacological chaperone technology has allowed us to develop our personalized medicine Galafold® (a monotherapy), our Chaperone-Advanced Replacement Therapy (“CHART®”) technology platform (pharmacological chaperones in combination with ERT), and has advanced our protein engineering expertise in enzyme targeting and gene therapy. Pharmacological chaperones are small molecules designed to selectively bind to a target protein, increase its stability, and help keep it folded in the correct three-dimensional shape. For LSDs, pharmacological chaperones are designed to bind to, stabilize, and facilitate trafficking of both endogenous and exogenous enzymes to the lysosome. 
Pharmacological Chaperone Monotherapy
As monotherapy agents for LSDs, pharmacological chaperones are designed to bind to and stabilize endogenous lysosomal enzymes for proper trafficking to the lysosome, which may also alleviate the buildup of mutant proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. Once in the lysosome, the pharmacological chaperone disassociates and the enzyme is free to break down substrate. Based on this mechanism, individuals with certain genetic variants (amenable variants) that result in some residual biological activity are potentially eligible for pharmacological chaperone monotherapy. This is the technology basis of our Galafold® treatment.
CHART® Technology Platform
ERT is the standard of care for several LSDs, based on the intravenous infusion of recombinant or gene-activated human enzyme. The enzyme is delivered into the blood in order to be taken up by cells and then transported to the lysosome. Upon entering the lysosome, this enzyme is intended to perform the function of the absent or deficient endogenous enzyme. However, the pH in blood is higher than the enzyme's natural acidic environment in the lysosome. As a result, the infused enzyme may unfold and lose activity and may be misdirected to non-target tissues or rapidly cleared from the body. Exposure to high concentrations of infused enzymes can impact efficacy or cause adverse effects.
We are applying our CHART® technology for our current Pompe treatment paradigm AT-GAA, where our chaperone AT2221 is designed to bind to and stabilize our recombinant rhGAA enzyme ATB200. The pharmacokinetic data from our Phase 1/2 ATB200-02 clinical study in Pompe patients, in addition to other studies of pharmacological chaperones in combination with currently marketed ERTs, have established initial human proof of concept that a pharmacological chaperone can stabilize enzyme activity. This technology may improve the stability, uptake, and activity of the enzyme. 
Our Protein Engineering Expertise for Enzyme Targeting and Gene Therapy
The uptake of ERTs into a patient's cells is mediated by a particular carbohydrate called mannose 6-phosphate ("M6P"). M6P enables binding and delivery of therapeutic drug to lysosomes via M6P receptors on cell surfaces. Many currently approved ERTs have limited amounts of M6P, thereby limiting the uptake of therapeutic drug into a patient's cells.
Our novel Pompe treatment paradigm AT-GAA includes our ERT ATB200 that is engineered with significantly higher amounts of M6P for improved lysosomal targeting and incorporates our chaperone AT2221 to improve enzyme stability.
In the case of gene therapy, limited amounts of M6P on the construct DNA may also limit uptake and require very high doses of protein in order to be taken up into a patient’s cells. Through our relationship with Penn, we will combine Amicus’ protein engineering and glycobiology expertise with Penn’s AAV gene transfer technologies to develop AAV gene therapies designed for optimal cellular uptake, targeting, dosing, safety and manufacturability. Our indications of focus include Fabry, Pompe, CDD and on additional undisclosed rare metabolic disorder.

Acquisitions
Celenex, Inc.
In September 2018, the Company expanded its pipeline by acquiring the rights and related intellectual property of ten gene therapy programs through its acquisition of Celenex. Celenex is a private, clinical stage gene therapy company whose lead programs are ten gene therapy programs including CLN6 and CLN3, which are in clinical stage, and several programs in pre-clinical stage. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, the Company acquired Celenex for cash consideration of $100 million. The Company has also agreed to pay up to an additional $15 million in connection with the achievement of certain development milestones, $262 million in connection with the achievement of certain regulatory approval milestones across multiple programs and up to $75 million in tiered sales milestone payments. Celenex has an exclusive license agreement with NCH. Under this license agreement, NCH is eligible to receive development and sales based milestones of up to $7.8 million for each product.

 The Company evaluated the Celenex transaction and concluded that the transaction did not meet the definition of a business and was an asset acquisition. Given the fact that the license has no alternative future use, the $100.0 million upfront payment was expensed to research and development expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2018.
MiaMed, Inc.
In July 2016, we acquired MiaMed, Inc., ("MiaMed"), which is a pre-clinical biotechnology company focused on developing protein replacement therapy for CDD and related diseases. Upon closing of the transaction we paid the former holders of MiaMed's capital stock an aggregate of $6.5 million, comprised of (i) approximately $1.8 million in cash (plus MiaMed's cash and cash equivalents at closing and less any of MiaMed's unpaid third-party fees and expenses related to the transaction), and (ii) 825,603 shares of our Company's common stock. In addition, we also agreed to pay up to an additional $83.0 million in connection with the achievement of certain clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones, for a potential aggregate deal value of $89.5 million. We accounted for this transaction as an acquisition of an asset as we did not acquire any employees from MiaMed; nor did we acquire any significant processes that we did not previously perform or manage.
Scioderm, Inc.
In September 2015, we acquired Scioderm Inc., ("Scioderm"), a privately-held biopharmaceutical company focused on developing innovative therapies for treating the rare disease, epidermolyis bullosa ("EB"). The acquisition potentially leveraged the Scioderm development team's EB expertise with our global clinical infrastructure to advance SD-101toward regulatory approvals and our commercial, patient advocacy, and medical affairs infrastructure to support a successful global launch. The acquisition of Scioderm was accounted for as a purchase of a business.
On September 13, 2017, we reported that top-line data from the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical study (ESSENCE, SD-005) to assess the efficacy and safety of the novel topical wound-healing agent SD-101 did not meet the primary endpoints or secondary endpoints in participants with EB. Based on these top-line data, we have no current plans to invest in any additional clinical studies or commercial preparation activities for SD-101. The associated impairment of Scioderm IPR&D is discussed in "— Note 4. Goodwill and Intangible Assets" in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Callidus Biopharma, Inc.
In November 2013, we entered into a merger agreement with Callidus Biopharma, Inc. ("Callidus"), a privately held biotechnology company that was engaged in developing a next-generation Pompe ERT. Callidus did not have complementary technologies but their technology was complementary to our own pharmacological chaperone technology.
-9-

In connection with our acquisition of Callidus, we agreed to issue an aggregate of 7.2 million shares of our common stock to the former stockholders of Callidus. In addition, we will be obligated to make additional payments to the former stockholders of Callidus upon the achievement of certain clinical milestones of up to $35 million and regulatory milestones of up to $80 million set forth in the merger agreement, provided that the aggregate merger consideration shall not exceed $130 million. We may, at our election, satisfy certain milestone payments identified in the merger agreement aggregating $40 million in shares of our common stock. The milestone payments not permitted to be satisfied in common stock (as well as any payments that we are permitted to, but choose not to, satisfy in common stock), as a result of the terms of the merger agreement, will be paid in cash. During the fourth quarter of 2018, we reached a clinical milestone for Callidus, which was the dosing of the first patient in a Phase 3 study. The milestone payment for this event was $9.0 million which was paid in our common stock during the first quarter of 2019.
Intellectual Property
Patents and Trade Secrets
Our success depends in part on our ability to maintain proprietary protection surrounding our product candidates, technology, and know-how, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others, and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by filing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, including both new inventions and improvements of existing technology, that are important to the development of our business, unless this proprietary position would be better protected using trade secrets. Our patent strategy includes obtaining patent protection, where possible, on compositions of matter, methods of manufacture, methods of use, combination therapies, dosing and administration regimens, formulations, therapeutic monitoring, screening methods, and assays. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation, in-licensing, and partnership opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. Lastly, we monitor third parties for activities that may infringe our proprietary rights, as well as the progression of third party patent applications that may have the potential to create blocks to our products or otherwise interfere with the development of our business. We are aware, for example, of U.S. patents, and corresponding international counterparts, owned by third parties that contain claims related to ERTs, and small molecules for stabilizing enzymes. If any of these patents were to be asserted against us, there is no assurance that a court would find in our favor or that, if we choose or are required to seek a license, a license to any of these patents would be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.
We own or license rights to several issued patents in the U.S., current member states of the European Patent Convention and numerous pending and issued foreign applications, which are foreign counterparts of many of our U.S. patents. We also own or license rights to several pending U.S. applications. Our patent portfolio includes patents and patent applications with claims relating to methods of increasing and/or stabilizing deficient enzyme activity to treat genetic diseases. The patent positions for Galafold®, and ATB200/AT2221 pharmacological chaperone/ERT combination therapy are described below and include both patents and patent applications we own or exclusively license:

• | We have an exclusive license to a number of issued U.S. patents that cover the use of Galafold® to treat Fabry disease, as well as corresponding European, Japanese, and Canadian patents.

We have two issued U.S. patents covering a method of treating a patient diagnosed with Fabry disease with Galafold® wherein the Fabry patient has one of several alpha-Gal A variants. These patents will expire in 2029. We also have a pending U.S. application covering a method of determining which alpha-Gal A variants are likely to be amenable to therapy with Galafold® which, if granted, will expire in 2029. Foreign counterpart patents have also been issued in Europe, Japan, Canada, Mexico, and Australia; all of which will also expire in 2029. We also have filed a patent application covering a method of treating renal symptoms in a Fabry patient in relevant jurisdictions. As of February 2019, we have allowance of the U.S. counterpart and when granted, the patent would expired in 2038.

• | As part of the Callidus acquisition, we acquired a portfolio of patent applications including an application series covering reagents and methods for coupling targeting peptides to recombinant lysosomal enzymes, including recombinant acid alpha-glucosidase. Patents in this series are issued in the U.S., Canada, China and Europe, and applications are pending in the U.S., Europe, Japan, Brazil, Canada, China, and South Korea. If patents issue from these applications, expiration will be in 2032 to 2034 depending on the specific application.


• | Another patent application portfolio related to a modified lysosomal enzyme (acid alpha-glucosidase) that binds more effectively to the receptor and more potent than conventional recombinant enzymes. These applications pending in the U.S., Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Eurasia, Europe, Israel, India, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, Singapore, Taiwan, South Africa, and other countries. If patents issue from this series, they will expire in 2035 to 2038.


• | As part of the acquisition of MiaMed, we acquired an exclusive worldwide license to certain patent rights held by the Università di Bologna. These patent rights include two issued U.S. patent and a pending U.S. patent application directed to novel CDD fusion proteins, as well as pending counterpart patent applications in several foreign countries. The issued U.S. patent and the patent applications, if issued, will expire in 2035.


• | From NCH through the acquisition of Celenex, we have an exclusive license to pending patent applications covering ten AAV program in neurodegenerative disorders, including CLN6, CLN3, and CLN8 Batten diseases. These patent rights include one issued European patent and several pending U.S. patent applications pertaining to various aspects of the gene therapy programs, as well as pending counterpart patent applications in several foreign countries. The issued European patent and the patent applications, if issued, will expire in 2033 or 2040.

Individual patents extend for varying periods depending on the effective date of filing of the patent application or the date of patent issuance, and the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, patents issued in the U.S. are effective for:

• | The longer of 17 years from the issue date or 20 years from the earliest effective filing date, if the patent application was filed prior to June 8, 1995; and


• | 20 years from the earliest effective filing date, if the patent application was filed on or after June 8, 1995.

The term of foreign patents varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is 20 years from the earliest effective filing date.
The U.S. Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, and amendments thereto, more commonly known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, provides for an extension of one patent, known as a Hatch-Waxman statutory extension, for each New Chemical Entity ("NCE") to compensate for a portion of the time spent in clinical development and regulatory review. However, the maximum extension is five years and the extension cannot extend the patent beyond 14 years from the new drug application ("NDA") approval. Similar extensions are available in European countries, known as Supplemental Protection Certificate ("SPC") extensions, Japan and other countries. However, in the United States we will not know what, if any, extensions are available until a drug is approved. In addition, in the U.S., under provisions of the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, we may be entitled to an additional six month period of patent protection or market exclusivity for completing pediatric clinical studies in response to an FDA issued Pediatric Written Request before said exclusivities expire.

The patent positions of companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, technical, scientific, and factual questions. Our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary position for our technology will depend on our success in promptly filing patent applications on new discoveries, and in obtaining effective claims and enforcing those claims once granted. We focus special attention on filing patent applications for formulations and delivery regimens for our products in development to further enhance our patent exclusivity for those products. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by contracting with our employees, collaborators, scientific advisors, and our commercial consultants to ensure that any inventions resulting from the relationship are disclosed promptly, maintained in confidence until a patent application is filed, and preferably until publication of the patent application, and assigned to us or subject to a right to obtain a license. We do not know whether any of our owned patent applications or those patent applications that are licensed to us will result in the issuance of any patents. Our issued patents and those that may issue in the future, or those licensed to us, may be challenged, narrowed, invalidated, circumvented, or be found to be invalid or unenforceable, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related products and reduce the term of patent protection that we may have for our products. Neither we nor our licensors can be certain that we were the first to invent the inventions claimed in our owned or licensed patents or patent applications. In addition, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies or duplicate any technology developed by us and the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with any meaningful competitive advantages against these competitors. Furthermore, because of the extensive time required for development, testing, and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that any related patent may expire prior to or shortly after commencing commercialization, thereby reducing the advantage of the patent to our business and products.
We may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We seek to protect our trade secret technology and processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with commercial partners, collaborators, employees, consultants, scientific advisors, and other contractors, and by contracting with our employees and some of our commercial consultants to ensure that any trade secrets resulting from such employment or consulting are owned by us. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations, and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be discovered independently by others. To the extent that our consultants, contractors, or collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
Collaboration and License Agreements
We have acquired rights to develop and commercialize our product candidates through licenses granted by various parties. The following summarizes our material rights and obligations under those licenses:
Nationwide Children's Hospital
In September 2018, we expanded our pipeline by acquiring the rights and related intellectual property of ten gene therapy programs through our acquisition of Celenex. Celenex has an exclusive license agreement with NCH. Under this license agreement, NCH is eligible to receive development and sales based milestones of up to $7.8 million for each product.
University of Pennsylvania
In October 2018, we further expanded our gene therapy portfolio through a collaboration agreement with Penn to pursue research and development of novel gene therapies for four additional indications, including Pompe disease, Fabry disease, CDD and one additional undisclosed rare metabolic disorder. This relationship will combine our protein engineering expertise with Penn’s AAV gene transfer technologies to develop AAV gene therapies designed for optimal cellular uptake, targeting, dosing, safety and manufacturability. In connection with the collaboration agreement, we made an upfront payment of $7 million in cash to Penn in October 2018 that was expensed to research and development expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and agreed to certain milestone payments following the achievement of certain developmental and commercial milestone events by a licensed product in each indication up to an aggregate of $86.5 million per indication.
-12-

GlaxoSmithKline
In November 2013, we entered into a Revised Agreement ("the Revised Agreement") with GlaxoSmithKline ("GSK"), pursuant to which, we obtained global rights to develop and commercialize Galafold® as a monotherapy and in combination with ERT for Fabry disease. The Revised Agreement amends and replaces in its entirety the earlier agreement entered into between us and GSK in July 2012. Under the terms of the Revised Agreement, for Galafold® monotherapy, GSK is eligible to receive post-approval and sales-based milestones, as well as tiered royalties in the mid-teens in eight major markets outside the U.S. There was no other consideration paid to GSK as part of the Revised Agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized approximately $6.9 million of royalty expense under the Revised Agreement.
Mt. Sinai School of Medicine
We have acquired exclusive worldwide patent rights to develop and commercialize Galafold® and other pharmacological chaperones for the prevention or treatment of human diseases or clinical conditions by increasing the activity of wild-type and mutant enzymes pursuant to a license agreement with Mt. Sinai School of Medicine ("MSSM") of New York University. Under this agreement, to date, we have paid no upfront or annual license fees and we have no milestone or future payments other than royalties on net sales. This agreement expires upon expiration of the last of the licensed patent rights, which will be in 2019, or 2024 if we develop a product for combination therapy (pharmacological chaperone plus/ERT) and a patent issues from the pending application covering the combination therapy, subject to any patent term extension that may be granted.
Under our license agreements, if we owe royalties on net sales for one of our products to more than one of the above licensors, then we have the right to reduce the royalties owed to one licensor for royalties paid to another. The amount of royalties to be offset is generally limited in each license and can vary under each agreement. For Galafold® in 2018, we incurred $0.8 million of royalty expense under the agreement with MSSM. Our rights with respect to these agreements to develop and commercialize Galafold® may terminate, in whole or in part, if we fail to meet certain development or commercialization requirements or if we do not meet our obligations to make royalty payments.
Manufacturing
We continue to rely on contract manufacturers to supply the active biopharmaceutical ingredients and final drug product for Galafold®, other pharmacological chaperones, our next-generation ERT product candidates, and our gene therapy product candidates. The active biopharmaceutical ingredients and final formulations for these products are manufactured under current Good Manufacturing Practice ("cGMP"). The components in the final formulation for each product are commonly used in other biopharmaceutical products and are well characterized ingredients. We have implemented appropriate controls for assuring the quality of both active biopharmaceutical ingredients and final drug products. Product specifications will be established in concurrence with regulatory bodies at the time of product registration.
Competition
Overview
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition, and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. In addition, several large pharmaceutical companies are increasingly focused on developing therapies for the treatment of rare diseases, both through organic growth and acquisitions and partnerships. While we believe that our technologies, knowledge, experience, and scientific resources, provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including commercial enterprises, academic institutions, government agencies, and private and public research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with both existing and new therapies that may become available in the future.
Many of our competitors may have significantly greater financial resources and expertise associated with research and development, regulatory approvals, and marketing approved products. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.
-13-

Our commercial opportunities could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer side effects, are more convenient, and/or are less expensive than products that we may develop. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected because in some cases insurers or other third party payors seek to encourage the use of generic products. This may have the effect of making branded products less attractive to buyers.
Major Competitors
Our major competitors include pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in the U.S. and abroad that have approved therapies or therapies in development for LSDs. Other competitors are pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that have approved therapies or therapies in development for rare diseases for which pharmacological chaperone technology, or next-generation ERT may be applicable. Additionally, we are aware of several early-stage, niche pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies whose core business revolves around protein misfolding; however, we are not aware that any of these companies is currently working to develop products that would directly compete with ours. We are also aware of several pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies who are developing various treatments for novel ERTs and gene therapy. The key competitive factors affecting the success of our product candidates are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, and price.
Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. The following table lists our principal competitors and publicly available information on the status of their clinical-stage product offerings:

Competitor | Indication | | Product | | Class of Product | | Status | | 2018 Sales

Government Regulation
FDA Approval Process
In the U.S., biopharmaceutical products, including gene therapies, are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, Public Health Services Act, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of biopharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to file a marketing application, to issue Complete Response letters or to not approve pending NDAs or biologic product license applications ("BLAs"), or to issue warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, litigation, government investigation, and criminal prosecution.
-14-

Biopharmaceutical product development in the U.S. typically involves nonclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug application ("IND"), which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required varies substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product or disease. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, and toxicity, as well as animal studies to assess the characteristics, potential safety, and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including Good Laboratory Practice ("GLP"). The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and at least one proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term preclinical safety evaluations, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, continue during the IND phase of development. Reproductive toxicity studies are required to allow inclusion of women of child bearing potential in clinical trials, whereas carcinogenicity studies are required for registration. The results of these long-term studies would eventually be described in product labeling.
A 30-day review period after the submission and receipt of an IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. The IND becomes effective 30 days after its receipt by the FDA, and trials may begin at that point unless the FDA notifies the sponsor that the investigations are subject to a clinical hold.
Clinical trials usually involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted in compliance with applicable government regulations, Good Clinical Practice ("GCP"), as well as under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
The FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The study protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an Institutional Review Board ("IRB"), for approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB's requirements, or may impose other conditions.
Clinical trials to support an NDA or BLA for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or patients, the drug is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, early evidence on pharmacodynamics effects and effectiveness.
Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication or indications, dosage tolerance, and optimum dosage, and identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of efficacy and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients over longer treatment periods, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug.
The FDA has established the Office of Tissue and Advanced Therapies within the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, or CBER, to consolidate the review of gene therapy and related products, and has established the Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies Advisory Committee to advise CBER in its review. 
In addition to the regulations discussed above, there are a number of additional standards that apply to clinical trials involving gene therapies. The FDA has issued various guidance documents regarding gene therapies, which outline additional factors that the FDA will consider at each of the above stages of development and relate to, among other things: the proper preclinical assessment of gene therapies; the CMC information that should be included in an IND application; the proper design of tests to measure product potency in support of an IND or BLA application; and measures to observe delayed adverse effects in subjects who have been exposed to investigational gene therapies when the risk of such effects is high. Further, the FDA usually recommends that sponsors observe subjects for potential gene therapy-related delayed adverse events for a 15-year period, including a minimum of five years of annual examinations followed by 10 years of annual queries, either in person or by questionnaire. NIH and the FDA have a publicly accessible database, the Genetic Modification Clinical Research Information System, which includes information on gene therapy trials and serves as an electronic tool to facilitate the reporting and analysis of adverse events on these trials. 
-15-

After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA or BLA is prepared and submitted to the FDA for the determination of efficacy and safety. FDA approval of the NDA or BLA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the U.S. The NDA or BLA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical, and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product's pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA or BLA is substantial. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs and BLAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee; although for orphan drugs these fees are waived, and the holder of an approved NDA or BLA may also be subject to annual product and establishment user fees. These fees are typically increased annually.
The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA or BLA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency's threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs. Marketing applications are assigned review status during the filing period. Review status could be either standard or priority. Most such applications for standard review are reviewed within 12 months under PDUFA V (two months for filing plus ten months for review). The FDA attempts to review a drug candidate that is eligible for priority review within six months, as discussed below. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to evaluate major amendments submitted during the pre-specified PDUFA V review clock. The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an Advisory Committee for public review, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an Advisory Committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. The FDA may also undertake an audit of nonclinical and clinical trial sites. The FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with cGMP is satisfactory and the NDA or BLA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied and to be marketed. During the product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, is necessary to assure the safe use of the product candidate. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans and elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the BLA without a REMS, if required.
After the FDA evaluates the NDA or BLA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues an approval letter or a complete response letter. Complete response letters outline the deficiencies in the submission that prevent approval and may require substantial additional testing or information for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA's satisfaction in an amendment submitted to the NDA or BLA, the FDA will then issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type and extent of information included.
An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require substantial post-approval commitments or requirements to conduct additional testing and/or surveillance to monitor the drug's safety or efficacy and may impose other conditions, including distribution and labeling restrictions which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained, problems are identified following initial marketing, or post-marketing commitments are not met.
The Hatch-Waxman Act
In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA certain patent(s) with claims that cover the applicant's product or approved method of use. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA's Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an Abbreviated New Drug Application ("ANDA"). An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same route of administration, active ingredients strength, and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown through bioequivalence testing to be, in most cases, therapeutically equivalent to the listed drug. ANDA applicants are not required to conduct or submit results of preclinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product, other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as "generic equivalents" to the listed drug and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed "innovator" drug.
-16-

The ANDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA's Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify that: (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product's listed patents or that such patents are invalid is called a Paragraph 4 certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.
If the ANDA applicant submits a Paragraph 4 certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph 4 certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph 4 certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph 4 certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.
Patent term and data exclusivity run in parallel. An ANDA application also will not be approved until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a NCE, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired (New Chemical Entity Market Exclusivity). Federal law provides a period of five years following approval of a drug containing no previously approved active ingredients, during which ANDAs for generic versions of those drugs cannot be submitted unless the submission contains a Paragraph 4 certification that challenges a listed patent, in which case the submission may be made four years following the original product approval.
Federal law provides for a period of three years of exclusivity following approval of a listed drug that contains previously approved active ingredients but is approved in a new dosage form, route of administration or combination, or for a new use, the approval of which was required to be supported by new clinical trials conducted by or for the sponsor, during which the FDA cannot grant effective approval of an ANDA based on that listed drug for the same new dosage form, route of administration or combination, or new use.
Other Regulatory Requirements
Once an NDA or BLA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, communications regarding unindicated uses, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet.
Drugs may be promoted only for approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, new safety information, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA, NDA supplement, BLA, or BLA supplement before the change can be implemented. New efficacy claims require submission and approval of an NDA supplement and BLA supplement for each new indication.
The efficacy claims typically require new clinical data similar to those included in the original application. The FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA and BLA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs and BLAs. Additional exclusivity may be granted for new efficacy claims. Generic ANDAs cannot be labeled for these types of claims until the new exclusivity period expires.
Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following FDA approval of an NDA or BLA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, risk evaluation and mitigation strategies, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control as well as drug manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMP, after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain subcontractors are required to register their establishments with FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to routine inspections by the FDA during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to access compliance with cGMP. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered.
-17-

Orphan Drugs
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the drug and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. The first NDA or BLA applicant with FDA orphan drug designation for a particular active ingredient to receive FDA approval of the designated drug for the disease indication for which it has such designation, is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period (Orphan Drug Exclusivity) in the U.S. for that product, for that indication. During the seven-year period, the FDA may not finally approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same disease, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity or if the license holder cannot supply sufficient quantities of the product. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition, provided that the sponsor has conducted appropriate clinical trials required for approval. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA or BLA application user fee for the orphan indication.
Pediatric Information
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2007 ("PREA"), NDAs or supplements to NDAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.
Fast Track Designation
Under the Fast Track program, the sponsor of an IND may request the FDA to designate the drug candidate as a Fast Track drug if it is intended to treat a serious condition and fulfill an unmet medical need. The FDA must determine if the drug candidate qualifies for Fast Track designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor's request. Once the FDA designates a drug as a Fast Track candidate, it is required to facilitate the development and expedite the review of that drug by providing more frequent communication with and guidance to the sponsor.
In addition to other benefits such as greater interactions with the FDA, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track drug's NDA or BLA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides, and the FDA approves, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, the FDA's review period as specified under PDUFA V for filing and reviewing an application does not begin until the last section of the NDA or BLA has been submitted. Additionally, the Fast Track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
Breakthrough Therapy Designation
Breakthrough Therapy designation is intended to expedite the development and review of a candidate that is planned for use to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition when preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. A Breakthrough Therapy designation conveys all of the Fast Track program features, as well as more intensive FDA guidance on an efficient drug development program. The FDA also has an organizational commitment to involve senior management in such guidance.
Priority Review
Under FDA policies, a drug candidate is eligible for priority review, or review within six months from filing for a new molecular entity ("NME") or six months from submission for a non-NME if the drug candidate provides a significant improvement compared to marketed drugs in the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of a disease. A Fast Track designated drug candidate would ordinarily meet the FDA's criteria for priority review. The FDA makes its determination of priority or standard review during the 60-day filing period after an initial NDA or BLA submission.

Accelerated Approval
Under the FDA's accelerated approval regulations, the FDA may approve a drug for a serious or life-threatening illness that provides meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments based upon a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. This approval mechanism is provided for under 21CRF314 Subpart H and Subpart E. In this case, clinical trials are conducted in which a surrogate endpoint is used as the primary outcome for approval. A surrogate endpoint is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or an effect on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. This surrogate endpoint substitutes for a direct measurement of how a patient feels, functions, or survives and is considered reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. Such surrogate endpoints may be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. A drug candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. When the Phase 4 commitment is successfully completed, the biomarker is deemed to be a surrogate endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, could lead the FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for drug candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA.
Section 505(b) (2) New Drug Applications
Most drug products obtain FDA marketing approval pursuant to an NDA, an ANDA, or a BLA. A fourth alternative is a special type of NDA, commonly referred to as a Section 505(b) (2) NDA, which enables the applicant to rely, in part, on the safety and efficacy data of an existing product, or published literature, in support of its application.
505(b) (2) NDAs often provide an alternate path to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products. Section 505(b)(2) permits the submission of a NDA for which at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. The applicant may rely upon certain preclinical or clinical studies conducted for an approved product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all or some of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b) (2) applicant.
To the extent that the Section 505(b) (2) applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already-approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent as an ANDA applicant. Thus approval of a 505(b)(2) NDA can be stalled until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired, until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of an NCE, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired, and, in the case of a Paragraph 4 certification and subsequent patent infringement suit, until the earlier of 30 months, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.

Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010
The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 ("BPCIA"), which was enacted as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 ("PPACA") created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are demonstrated to be "biosimilar" or "interchangeable" with an FDA-licensed reference biological product via an approved BLA. Biosimilarity to an approved reference product requires that there be no differences in conditions of use, route of administration, dosage form, and strength, and no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency. Biosimilarity is demonstrated in steps beginning with rigorous analytical studies or "fingerprinting", in vitro studies, in vivo animal studies, and generally at least one clinical study, absent a waiver from the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The biosimilarity exercise tests the hypothesis that the investigational product and the reference product are the same. If at any point in the stepwise biosimilarity process a significant difference is observed, then the products are not biosimilar, and the development of a stand-alone NDA or BLA is necessary. In order to meet the higher hurdle of interchangeability, a sponsor must demonstrate that the biosimilar product can be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product, and for a product that is administered more than once, that the risk of switching between the reference product and biosimilar product is not greater than the risk of maintaining the patient on the reference product. Complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the process by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation that are still being evaluated by the FDA. Under the BPCIA, a reference biologic is granted 12 years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the reference product.
Anti-Kickback, False Claims Laws, the Prescription Drug Marketing Act and Other Regulations
In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal laws have been applied to restrict certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry in recent years. These laws include anti-kickback statutes and false claims statutes as well as regulations related to payments and transfers of value to healthcare providers, the protection of the security and privacy of protected health information, and other compliance efforts. The federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federally financed healthcare programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. Violations of the anti-kickback statute are punishable by imprisonment, criminal fines, civil monetary penalties, and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor.
Federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also violate false claims laws. The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback law and false claims laws, which apply to items and services, reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.
Physician Drug Samples
As part of the sales and marketing process, pharmaceutical companies frequently provide samples of approved drugs to physicians. The Prescription Drug Marketing Act (the "PDMA") imposes requirements and limitations upon the provision of drug samples to physicians, as well as prohibits states from licensing distributors of prescription drugs unless the state licensing program meets certain federal guidelines that include minimum standards for storage, handling, and record keeping. In addition, the PDMA sets forth civil and criminal penalties for violations.

Regulation Outside the U.S.
In addition to regulations in the U.S., we are subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing clinical studies, commercial sales, and distribution of our products. Most countries outside the U.S. require that clinical trial applications be submitted to and approved by the local regulatory authority for each clinical study. In addition, whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of countries outside the U.S. before we can commence clinical studies or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
To obtain regulatory approval of an orphan drug under EU regulatory systems, we are mandated to submit MAAs in Centralized Procedure. The centralized procedure, which came into operation in 1995, allows applicants to obtain a marketing authorization that is valid throughout the EU. It is compulsory for medicinal products manufactured using biotechnological processes, for orphan medicinal products and for human products containing a new active substance which was not authorized in the Community before 20 May 2004 (date of entry into force of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004) and which are intended for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorder or diabetes. The centralized procedure is optional for any other products containing new active substances not authorized in the Community before 20 May 2004 or for products which constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or for which a Community authorization is in the interests of patients at Community level. When a company wishes to place on the market a medicinal product that is eligible for the centralized procedure, it sends an application directly to the European Medicines Agency, to be assessed by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ("CHMP"). The procedure results in a Commission decision, which is valid in all EU Member States. Centrally-authorized products may be marketed in all Member States. Centralized procedure: Full copies of the MA application are sent to a rapporteur and a co-rapporteur designated by the competent EMA scientific committee. They coordinate the EMA's assessment of the medicinal product and prepare draft reports. Once the draft reports are prepared (other experts might be called upon for this purpose), they are sent to the CHMP, whose comments or objections are communicated to the applicant. The rapporteur is therefore the privileged interlocutor of the applicant and continues to play this role, even after the MA has been granted.
The rapporteur and co-rapporteur then assess the applicant's replies, submit them for discussion to the CHMP and, taking into account the conclusions of this debate, prepare a final assessment report. Once the evaluation is completed, the CHMP gives a favorable or unfavorable opinion as to whether to grant the authorization. When the opinion is favorable, it shall include the draft summary of the product's characteristics, the package leaflet and the texts proposed for the various packaging materials. The time limit for the evaluation procedure is 210 days. The EMA then has fifteen days to forward its opinion to the Commission. This is the start of the second phase of the procedure: the decision-making process. The Agency sends to the Commission its opinion and assessment report, together with annexes containing: the SmPC (Annex 1); the particulars of the MAH responsible for batch release, the particulars of the manufacturer of the active substance and the conditions of the marketing authorization (Annex 2); and the labelling and the package leaflet (Annex 3). The annexes are translated into the 22 other official languages of the EU. During the decision-making process, the Commission services verify that the marketing authorization complies with Union law. The Commission has fifteen days to prepare a draft decision. The medicinal product is assigned a Community registration number, which will be placed on its packaging if the marketing authorization is granted. During this period, various Commission directorates-general are consulted on the draft marketing authorization decision.
The draft decision is then sent to the Standing Committee on Medicinal Products for Human Use, (Member States have one representative each in both of these committees) for their opinions. The Centralized Procedure, which is compulsory for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes and optional for those which are highly innovative, provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all EU member states. The Decentralized Procedure provides for approval by one or more other, or concerned, member states of an assessment of an application performed by one member state, known as the reference member state. Under this procedure, an applicant submits an application, or dossier, and related materials including a draft summary of product characteristics, and draft labeling and package leaflet, to the reference member state and concerned member states. The reference member state prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. Within 90 days of receiving the reference member state's assessment report, each concerned member state must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials. If a member state cannot approve the assessment report and related materials on the grounds of potential serious risk to the public health, the disputed points may eventually be referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states.

We have obtained an orphan medicinal product designation in the EU from the EMA for Galafold® for the treatment of Fabry disease ("FD"). The combination product, ATB200/AT2221, for the treatment of Pompe disease has currently received orphan drug designation in the U.S. with a pending review in the EU. Applications from persons or companies seeking "orphan medicinal product designation" for products they intend to develop for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of life-threatening or very serious conditions that affect not more than 5 in 10,000 persons in the EU are reviewed by the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products ("COMP"). In addition, orphan drug designation can be granted if the drug is intended for a life threatening, seriously debilitating, or serious and chronic condition in the EU and that without incentives it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the EU would be sufficient to justify developing the drug. Orphan drug designation is only available if there is no other satisfactory method approved in the EU of diagnosing, preventing, or treating the condition, or if such a method exists, the proposed orphan drug will be of significant benefit to patients.
Orphan drug designation provides opportunities for fee reductions for protocol assistance and access to the centralized regulatory procedures before and during the first year after marketing approval, which reductions are not limited to the first year after marketing approval for small and medium enterprises. In addition, if a product which has an orphan drug designation subsequently receives EMA marketing approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the EMA may not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of 10 years. The exclusivity period may be reduced to six years if the designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Competitors may receive marketing approval of different drugs or biologics for the indications for which the orphan product has exclusivity. In order to do so, however, they must demonstrate that the new drugs or biologics provide a significant benefit over the existing orphan product. This demonstration of significant benefit may be done at the time of initial approval or in post-approval studies, depending on the type of marketing authorization granted.
We have obtained a positive opinion for our pediatric investigation plan ("PIP") in the EU for Galafold® for the treatment of Fabry disease as well. In May 2016, we announced that we had received full European Commission approval for migalastat HCl, under the product name Galafold®, as a first-line therapy for long-term treatment of adults and adolescents aged 16 years and older with a confirmed diagnosis of Fabry disease and who have an amenable variant. A PIP is a development plan aimed at ensuring that the necessary data are obtained to support the authorization of a medicine for children, through studies in children. All applications for marketing authorization for new medicines have to include the results of studies as described in an agreed PIP, unless the medicine is exempt because of a deferral or waiver. This requirement also applies when a marketing-authorization holder wants to add a new indication, pharmaceutical form, or route of administration for a medicine that is already authorized and covered by intellectual property rights. Several rewards and incentives for the development of pediatric medicines for children are available in the EU. Medicines authorized across the EU with the results of studies from a PIP included in the product information are eligible for an extension of their supplementary protection certificate by six months. This is the case even when the studies' results are negative. For orphan medicines, the incentive is an additional two years of market exclusivity. Scientific advice and protocol assistance at the Agency are free of charge for questions relating to the development of pediatric medicines. Medicines developed specifically for children that are already authorized but are not protected by a patent or supplementary protection certificate are eligible for a pediatric-use marketing authorization ("PUMA"). If a PUMA is granted, the product will benefit from 10 years of market protection as an incentive.
We have obtained orphan drug designation in Japan for migalastat for the treatment of Fabry Disease. The Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare, based on the opinion of the Pharmaceutical Affairs and Food Sanitation Council, grants orphan status to drugs intended to address serious illnesses with high unmet medical need that affect fewer than 50,000 patients in Japan. Orphan designation provides certain benefits and incentives, including priority review for marketing authorization and a period of 10 years of market exclusivity if the drug candidate is approved for the designated indication.
In a referendum held in the United Kingdom (“UK”) on June 23, 2016, a majority of those voting voted for the UK to leave the EU, commonly referred to as “Brexit”. On March 29, 2017, the UK government delivered to the European Council notice of its intention to leave the EU and, in the absence of an executed withdrawal agreement with the EU, the effective date of the UK’s withdrawal from the EU will be March 29, 2019. The ultimate impact of the “leave” vote will depend on the terms that are negotiated in relation to the UK’s future relationship with the EU. Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the UK determines which EU laws to replicate or replace.

U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits U.S. corporations and individuals from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business abroad or to influence a person working in an official capacity. It is illegal to pay, offer to pay or authorize the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. Equivalent laws have been adopted in other foreign countries that impose similar obligations.
Pharmaceutical Pricing and Reimbursement
In the U.S. and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third party payors. Third party payors include government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers, and other organizations. These third party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services. In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare product candidates, and efforts are underway by the current U.S. administration and states to reduce the cost of prescription drugs overall. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products. Our product candidates may not be considered cost-effective. Adequate third party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
In 2003, the U.S. government enacted legislation providing a partial prescription drug benefit for Medicare recipients that began in 2006. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for any products for which we receive marketing approval. However, to obtain payments under this program, we would be required to sell products to Medicare recipients through managed care organizations and other health care delivery systems operating pursuant to this legislation. These organizations would negotiate prices for our products, which are likely to be lower than we might otherwise obtain. Federal, state, and local governments in the U.S. continue to consider legislation to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including the cost of prescription drugs. Future legislation could limit payments for biopharmaceuticals such as the drug candidates that we are developing.
The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid health care costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. Adoption of government controls and measures, and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceuticals. With the current administration and Congress, there have been efforts to make additional legislative changes, including repeal and replacement of certain provisions of the PPACA. It is unclear what impact such legislative changes will have on the availability of healthcare and/or containing or lowering the costs of healthcare.
The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, an increasing emphasis on managed care in the U.S. has increased and will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had 508 full-time employees, 268 of whom were primarily engaged in research and development activities and 240 of whom provided selling and administrative services. None of our employees were represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our employee relations to be good.
