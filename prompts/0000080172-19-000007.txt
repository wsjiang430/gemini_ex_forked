ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
 ﻿
 A.  DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
 ﻿
 The business of National Presto Industries, Inc. (the “Company" or “National Presto”) consists of two business segments.  For a further discussion of the Company’s business, the segments in which it operates, and financial information about the segments, please refer to Note L to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  The Housewares/Small Appliance segment designs, markets and distributes housewares and small electrical appliances, including pressure cookers and canners, kitchen electrics, and comfort appliances.  The Defense segment manufactures 40mm ammunition, precision mechanical and electro-mechanical assemblies, medium caliber cartridge cases; performs Load, Assemble and Pack (LAP) operations on ordnance-related products primarily for the U.S. Government and prime contractors; and manufactures detonators, booster pellets, release cartridges, lead azide, and other military energetic devices and materials.  
 ﻿
 On January 3, 2017, the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Presto Absorbent Products, Inc. (“PAPI”), entered into an asset purchase agreement wherein substantially all PAPI assets were sold and certain liabilities were assigned to Drylock Technologies, LTD. (“Drylock”) in exchange for $68,448,000.  The proceeds amount differs from the amount originally disclosed because of the customary post-closing adjustments that were finalized during the second quarter of 2017, totaling $1,448,000.  The asset purchase agreement also provided for additional proceeds of $4,000,000 upon the sale of certain delayed assets, consisting of machinery and equipment that were the subject of an involuntary conversion.  The sale of the delayed assets was consummated during the second quarter of 2018 and resulted in no gain or loss.  As a result of the aforementioned transactions, the Company classified its results of operations for all periods presented to reflect its Absorbent Products business as a discontinued operation and classified the assets and liabilities of its Absorbent Products business as held for sale.  See Note P for further discussion. The operations of PAPI previously comprised the Company’s Absorbent Products segment which manufactured and sold private label and branded adult incontinence products.  
 ﻿
 1. Housewares/Small Appliance Segment
 Housewares and electrical appliances sold by the Company include pressure cookers and canners; the Presto Control Master® heat control single thermostatic control line of skillets in several sizes, griddles, woks and multi-purpose cookers; slow cookers; deep fryers of various sizes; air fryers; waffle makers; pizza ovens; slicer/shredders; electric heaters; corn poppers (hot air, oil, and microwave); dehydrators; rice cookers; microwave bacon cookers; coffeemakers and coffeemaker accessories; electric tea kettles; electric knife sharpeners; a line of kitchen gadgets; and timers.  Pressure cookers and canners are available in various sizes and are fabricated of aluminum and, in the case of cookers, of stainless steel, as well.  Currently, sales include fire extinguishers sold by its subsidiary, Rusoh, Inc.
 ﻿
 For the year ended December 31, 2018, approximately 11% of consolidated net sales were provided by cast products (griddles, waffle makers, die cast deep fryers, skillets and multi-cookers), and approximately 16% by noncast/thermal appliances (stamped cookers and canners, pizza ovens, corn poppers, coffee makers, microwave bacon cookers, dehydrators, rice cookers, slow cookers, tea kettles, electric stainless steel appliances, non-cast fryers, air fryers and heaters).  For the year ended December 31, 2017, approximately 12% of consolidated net sales were provided by cast products, and approximately 16% by noncast/thermal appliances.  For the year ended December 31, 2016, approximately 12% of consolidated net sales were provided by cast products, and approximately 18% by noncast/thermal appliances.  For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, this segment had one customer which accounted for 10% or more of the Company’s consolidated net sales.  That customer was Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., which accounted for 10%, 10%, and 11% of consolidated net sales in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016,

respectively.  The loss of Wal-Mart Stores as a customer would have a material adverse effect on the segment.  
 ﻿
 Products are sold primarily in the United States and Canada directly to retailers and also through independent distributors.  Although the Company has long established relationships with many of its customers, it does not have long-term supply contracts with them.  The loss of, or material reduction in, sales to any of the Company's major customers could adversely affect the Company's business.  Most housewares and electrical appliances are sourced from vendors in the Orient.  (See Note J to the Consolidated Financial Statements.)  
 ﻿
 The Company has a sales force of 12 employees that sell to and service most customers.  A few selected accounts are handled by manufacturers' representatives who may also sell other product lines.  Sales promotional activities are conducted primarily through the use of newspaper advertising, in store promotions, and digital advertising.  The business is seasonal, with the normal peak sales period occurring in the fourth quarter of the year prior to the holiday season.  This segment operates in a highly competitive and extremely price sensitive environment.  Increased costs that cannot be fully absorbed into the price of products or passed along in the form of price increases to the retail customer can have a significant adverse impact on operating results.  Several companies compete for sales of housewares and small electrical appliances, some of which are larger than the Company’s segment and others which are smaller.  In addition, some customers maintain their own private label, as well as purchase brokered product directly from the Orient.  Product competition extends to special product features, product pricing, product quality, marketing programs, warranty provisions, service policies and other factors.  New product introductions are an important part of the Company's sales to offset the morbidity rate of other products and/or the effect of lowered acceptance of seasonal products due to weather conditions.  New products entail unusual risks.  Engineering and tooling costs are increasingly expensive, as are finished goods that may not have a ready market or achieve widespread consumer acceptance.  High-cost advertising commitments which may accompany such new products or may be required to maintain sales of existing products may not be fully absorbed by ultimate product sales.  Initial production schedules, set in advance of introduction, carry the possibility of excess unsold inventories.  New product introductions are further subject to delivery delays from supply sources, which can impact availability for the Company's most active selling periods.  
 ﻿
 Research and development costs related to new product development for the years 2018, 2017, and 2016 were expensed in operations of these years and were not a material element in the aggregate costs incurred by the Company. 
 ﻿
 Products are generally warranted to the original owner to be free from defects in material and workmanship for a period of one to twelve years from date of purchase, depending on the product.  The Company allows a sixty-day over-the-counter initial return privilege through cooperating dealers.  Products are serviced through a corporate service repair operation.  The Company's service and warranty programs are competitive with those offered by other manufacturers in the industry.  
 ﻿
 The Company primarily warehouses and distributes its products from distribution centers located in Canton and Jackson, Mississippi.  Selective use is made of leased tractors and trailers. 
 ﻿
 The Company invests funds not currently required for business activities (see Note A(5) to the Consolidated Financial Statements).  Income from invested funds is included in Other Income in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.  
 ﻿
 Earnings from investments may vary significantly from year to year depending on interest yields on instruments meeting the Company's investment criteria, and the extent to which funds may be needed for internal growth, acquisitions, newly identified business activities, and reacquisition of Company stock. 
 ﻿
 2. Defense Segment  
 AMTEC Corporation was acquired on February 24, 2001, and manufactures 40mm ammunition, and precision mechanical and electro-mechanical products for the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) and DOD prime contractors.  AMTEC’s 106,000 square foot manufacturing facility located in Janesville, Wisconsin,   

 
4
which includes the Company’s 2016 construction of 31,000 square feet of manufacturing space to meet anticipated production needs, is focused on producing niche market ordnance products (such as training ammunition, fuzes, firing devices, and initiators).  AMTEC is also the prime contractor for the 40mm ammunition system to the DOD (more fully described below).  
 ﻿
 Spectra Technologies LLC, a subsidiary of AMTEC, was acquired on July 31, 2003, and is engaged in the manufacture and delivery of munitions and ordnance-related products for the DOD and DOD prime contractors.  Spectra maintains 372,000 square feet of space located in East Camden, Arkansas, dedicated primarily to Load, Assemble and Pack (LAP) type work.
 ﻿
 Amron, a division of AMTEC, holds the assets that were purchased from Amron LLC on January 30, 2006.  Amron manufactures cartridge cases used in medium caliber ammunition (20mm, 25mm, 30mm and 40mm) primarily for the DOD and DOD prime contractors, which includes the 40mm systems program previously mentioned and referenced below.  The Amron manufacturing facility is 208,000 square feet and is located in Antigo, Wisconsin.  
 ﻿
 Tech Ord, a division of AMTEC, holds the assets of Chemring Energetic Devices, Inc.’s business located in Clear Lake, South Dakota and all of the real property owned by Technical Ordnance Realty, LLC that were acquired on January 24, 2014. The 88,000 square foot Clear Lake facility is a manufacturer of detonators, booster pellets, release cartridges, lead azide, and other military energetic devices and materials, and its major customers include US and foreign government agencies, AMTEC Corporation, and other defense contractors.  
 ﻿
 AMTEC Less Lethal Systems, Inc., a subsidiary of AMTEC Corporation, held the assets that were purchased from ALS Technologies, Inc, a small Arkansas manufacturer of less lethal ammunition, on November 1, 2011.  The subsidiary’s products included smoke and tear gas grenades, specialty impact munitions, diversionary devices and stun munitions, support accessories like launchers and gas masks, as well as training for the use of its products.  The subsidiary’s state-of-the-art less lethal ammunition manufacturing and training facility, which was completed in 2013, was 54,000 square feet and was located in Perry, Florida. In October of 2018, the Company divested itself of the less lethal business.  See Note Q to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  
 ﻿
 The Defense segment competes for its business primarily on the basis of technical competence, product quality, manufacturing experience, and price.  This segment operates in a highly competitive environment with many other organizations, some of which are larger and others that are smaller. 
 ﻿
 On April 25, 2005, AMTEC Corporation was awarded the high volume, five-year prime contract for management and production of the Army’s 40mm Ammunition System.  The Army selected AMTEC as one of two prime contractors responsible for supplying all requirements for 40mm practice and tactical ammunition for a period of five years.  Deliveries under the contract exceeded $671,000,000, with final deliveries completed in 2013.  On February 18, 2010, the Army awarded AMTEC a second five-year contract for the management and production of the 40mm Ammunition System.  As in the original five-year contract, AMTEC was awarded the majority share of the 40mm requirement. Deliveries under this contract exceeded $566,000,000, with the final deliveries completed in 2018. In addition, as part of an acquisition of a group of assets from DSE, Inc, a 40mm competitor, which was completed on November 7, 2013, AMTEC acquired through a novation agreement an additional $188,000,000, representing the remaining undelivered portion of the award that had been given to AMTEC’s competitor under the second five-year contract mentioned above. Total deliveries for the systems program under the novated DSE 40mm contract were completed in 2018.  The Company submitted its bid for a third contract, and although the FY15 (Army’s fiscal year beginning October 1, 2014) bid request was subsequently cancelled, the 40mm program requirements remained and were subsequently awarded to AMTEC as the Army’s FY16 40mm requirements in a single award valued at $84,500,000. Total deliveries for the FY16 contract were $82,000,000 through 2018. Additional shipments under this contract will be made in 2019.  On August 30, 2017, the Army awarded AMTEC, as the sole prime contractor, a third five-year 40mm system contract covering FY17-21 requirements.  The value to date is approximately $199,000,000 for FY17 and FY18, with deliveries scheduled to continue in 2019.  The actual annual and cumulative dollar volume with the

Army over the balance of the contract will be dependent upon military requirements and funding, as well as government procurement regulations and other factors controlled by the Army and the Department of Defense.    ﻿
 During 2018, almost all of the work performed by this segment directly or indirectly for the DOD was performed on a fixed-price basis.  Under fixed-price contracts, the price paid to the contractor is awarded based on competition at the outset of the contract and therefore is generally not subject to adjustments reflecting the actual costs incurred by the contractor, with the exception of some limited escalation clauses, which on the 2017 contract applied to only three materials – steel, aluminum and zinc.  The Defense segment’s contracts and subcontracts contain the customary provision permitting termination at any time for the convenience of the government, with payment for any work completed, associated profit and inventory/work in progress at the time of termination. The segment’s business does not tend to be seasonal.

 B.  OTHER COMMENTS
 ﻿
 1. Sources and Availability of Materials 
 See Note J to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  
 ﻿
 2. Patents, Trademarks, and Licenses
 Patents, particularly on new products, trademarks and know-how are considered significant to the Company’s Housewares/Small Appliance segment.  The Company's current and future success depends upon judicial protection of its intellectual property rights (patents, trademarks and trade dress).  Removal of that protection would expose the Company to competitors who seek to take advantage of the Company's innovations and proprietary rights.  The Company has dozens of U.S. and foreign patents pending and granted.  Of those U.S. patents granted, the following is a non-exhaustive list of those relevant to current products and their expiration dates, assuming continued payment of maintenance fees (the date is the latest expiration date of the corresponding patents):  Quick Release Appliance Cord Assemblies (US 6,719,576, December 2022,  and 6,527,570, October 2021), Coffee Brewer (US D695,064, December 2027), Cooking Apparatus with Safety Device (US 7,635,827, November 2027), Griddle with Attached Warming Tray (US D674,656, January 2027), Low Profile Griddle (US D575,098, August 2022), Stirring Popcorn Maker (US D615,797, May 2024), and Parabolic Heater (US D633,189, February 2025).  The Company also has dozens of U.S. and foreign trademarks pending and granted.  Of those U.S. trademarks granted, the following is a non-exhaustive list of those relevant to current products and their grant dates:  Presto (February 1941), FryDaddy (November 1977), SaladShooter (September 1988), Pizzazz (July 1999), PopLite  (June 1989), ControlMaster (November 1956), Pan Gogh (December 2018), Nomad (August 2018) and HeatDish (November 1989).To date, the Company has vigorously protected its rights and enjoyed success in all its intellectual property suits.  The Defense segment holds a United States patent related to its non-dud signature training round (US 8,640,621, Oct 2029), which would be deemed significant to its respective operations.
 ﻿
 3. Effects of Compliance with Environmental Regulations
 In May 1986, the Company's Eau Claire, Wisconsin site was placed on the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) National Priorities List (NPL) under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) because of hazardous waste deposited on the property.  At year end 1998, all remediation projects at the Eau Claire, Wisconsin, site had been installed, were fully operational, and restoration activities had been completed. 
 ﻿
 Based on factors known as of December 31, 2018, it is believed that the Company's environmental liability reserve will be adequate to satisfy on-going remediation operations and monitoring activities; however, should environmental agencies require additional studies or remediation projects, it is possible the existing accrual could be inadequate.  
 ﻿
 Management believes that in the absence of any unforeseen future developments, known environmental matters will not have any material effect on the results of operations or financial condition of the Company.

4. Number of Employees of the Company
 As of December 31, 2018, the Company and its subsidiaries had 949 employees compared to 982 employees at the end of December 2017.
 ﻿
 Approximately 170 employees of Amron are members of the United Steel Workers union.  The most recent contract between Amron and the union is effective through February 29, 2020.
 ﻿
 5. Industry Practices Related to Working Capital Requirements
 The major portion of the Company's sales was made with terms of 60 days or shorter.  
 ﻿
 For the Housewares/Small Appliance segment, inventory levels increase in advance of the selling period for products that are seasonal, such as pressure canners, heaters, and major new product introductions.  Inventory build-up also occurs to create stock levels required to support the higher sales that occur in the latter half of each year.  Buying practices of the Company's customers require "just-in-time" delivery, necessitating that the Company carry large finished goods inventories. 
 ﻿
 The ability to meet U.S. Department of Defense demands also necessitates the carrying of large inventories in the Defense segment.
 ﻿
 6. Order Backlog
 Shipment of most of the Company's Housewares/Small Appliance products occurs within a relatively short time after receipt of the order and, therefore, there is usually no substantial order backlog.  New product introductions may result in order backlogs that vary from product to product and as to timing of introduction.
 ﻿
 The contract backlog of the Defense segment was approximately $333,592,000, $308,173,000, and $358,931,000 at December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.  Backlog is defined as the value of orders from the customer less the amount of sales recognized against the orders.  It is anticipated that the backlog will be produced and shipped during an 18 to 24-month period, after December 31, 2018.
