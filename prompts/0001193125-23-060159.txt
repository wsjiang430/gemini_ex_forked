Company Overview 
 Calyxt, Inc. was founded in 2010 and incorporated in Delaware. Calyxt is a plant-based synthetic biology company. The Company leverages its proprietary PlantSpringTM technology platform to engineer plant metabolism to produce innovative, high-value, and sustainable materials and products for use in helping customers meet their sustainability targets and financial goals. The Company’s primary focus and commercialization strategy is on engineering synthetic biology solutions through its PlantSpring technology platform for manufacture using its proprietary and differentiated BioFactory™ production system for a diverse base of target customers across a range of end markets, including the cosmeceutical, nutraceutical, and pharmaceutical industries. The Company also commercializes its PlantSpring technology platform by licensing elements of the platform and historically developed traditional agriculture seed-trait product candidates, as well as selectively developing product candidates for customers in traditional agriculture. 
 The production of the Company’s plant-based chemistries occurs in its proprietary BioFactory production system. This strategic initiative was announced in October 2021. In the context of the Company’s PlantSpring technology platform and BioFactory production system, the term “sustainable”, as used in this Annual Report, refers to the plant-based chemistry production methods that use plant biomass as a raw material and are therefore renewable and do not completely use up or destroy natural resources. 
 The Company also out-licenses elements of the PlantSpring technology platform, has historically developed seed-trait product candidates for the traditional agriculture market, and may selectively develop products for customers in traditional agriculture. For example, in the third quarter of 2021, the Company announced it had entered into a research collaboration with a global food ingredient manufacturer based in Asia to develop an improved soybean capable of producing oil that would serve as a commercial alternative to palm oil. 
 The Company was previously focused on the development of traits for traditional agriculture that it planned to commercialize using either a vertically integrated or licensing business model. The Company’s first commercial product, a high oleic soybean, was launched in this manner in the first quarter of 2019. In August 2020, the Company announced it was winding down the vertically integrated soybean product line. The wind-down of this product line was completed in late 2021 with the final sales of soybean grain to a large soybean processor. The Company’s second product, an improved digestibility alfalfa, was developed with and licensed to S&W Seed Company (S&W). S&W is pursuing regulatory clearance for their product candidate and is targeting commercialization in 2023 at which time the Company expects to begin to receive initial royalty payments. The Company intends to use this licensing strategy for other historically developed, traditional agriculture seed-trait product candidates. 
 The Company has historically operated in a single segment primarily within the United States and its assets are located within the United States. 
 Prior to its initial public offering (IPO) on July 25, 2017, the Company was a wholly owned subsidiary of Cellectis. As of December 31, 2022, Cellectis owned 49.1 percent of the Company’s issued and outstanding common stock. Cellectis has certain contractual rights as well as rights pursuant to the Company’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws, in each case, for so long as it maintains threshold beneficial ownership levels in the Company’s shares. See “Risk Factors—Although Cellectis and its affiliates hold less than a majority of the Company’s outstanding common stock, Cellectis possesses certain rights that prevent other stockholders from influencing significant decisions.” 
 On September 22, 2022, the Company announced that the Board of Directors of the Company (the Board) had begun evaluating potential strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value, including financing alternatives, merger, reverse merger, other business combinations, sale of assets, licensing, or other transactions. 
 On January 13, 2023, the Company and Calypso Merger Subsidiary, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (Merger Subsidiary) entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement) with Cibus Global, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (Cibus) and certain other parties thereto. 
 Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, following the Transactions, Calyxt will be organized in an “Up-C” structure and re-named “Cibus, Inc.” and its only material asset will consist of common units of Cibus. If the Transactions are completed, the business of Cibus will continue as the primary business of the combined organization and the equity holders of Cibus will own a substantial majority of the issued and outstanding common stock of the Company. 
 The closing of the Transactions is subject to the approval of Calyxt’s stockholders, the approval of Cibus’ members, the receipt of required regulatory approvals (to the extent applicable) and satisfaction of other customary closing conditions. The closing is currently expected to occur in the second quarter of 2023. Additional information regarding the Transactions is included in Calyxt’s registration statement on Form S-4 initially filed with the SEC in February 2023. 
 In connection with the Transactions, beginning at the earlier of March 15, 2023 and the date Calyxt’s unrestricted cash balance first drops below $1,500,000, Calyxt can request, and Cibus has agreed to provide, an unsecured, interest-free revolving line of credit of up to $3,000,000 in cash, which amount may be increased to $4,000,000 if Cibus elects to extend the outside date (as defined in the Merger Agreement) to June 30, 2023 (the Interim Funding). Funds can be drawn by Calyxt in $500,000 increments and may only be used to fund operating expenses incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and consistent with the negative covenants in the Merger Agreement. The full outstanding balance of the Interim 
 
3 


  Funding will be reduced to zero in connection with the closing of the Transactions, if consummated. The full outstanding balance of the Interim Funding will be forgiven by Cibus if the Merger Agreement is terminated for any reason other than certain under certain conditions, as detailed in the Merger Agreement. The Interim Funding is subject to acceleration in connection with certain bankruptcy events. 
 As a result of the Company’s substantially narrowed operational focus and in light of the available Interim Funding from Cibus in connection with the proposed Transactions, the Company believes it has sufficient cash to fund operations through the end of the second quarter of 2023. 
 If, for any reason, the Transactions are not completed, the Company will reconsider its available alternatives at such time and could pursue one of the following courses of action, which the Company currently believes to be the most likely alternatives: 
 

• | Dissolve and liquidate. The Company may decide to dissolve and liquidate its assets. In such a circumstance, Calyxt would be required to pay all of its debts and contractual obligations and to set aside certain reserves for potential future claims. In light of Calyxt’s current capital resources, it is highly unlikely, in this case, that substantial resources, if any, would be available for distributions to stockholders.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pursue another strategic transaction. The Company may decide to resume the process of evaluating a potential merger, reorganization or other business combination transaction or to sell or otherwise dispose of certain of the Company’s assets. Any of these alternatives would be costly and time-consuming and would require that Calyxt obtain additional near-term funding in parallel to, or as part of, such a strategic transaction. The Company expects that it would be difficult to secure such funding in a timely manner, on favorable terms or at all.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Operate the business. Although substantially less likely than the alternatives above, the Calyxt board could elect to seek to continue to operate the Company’s business. This alternative would require that Calyxt obtain additional near-term funding, which the Company expects would be difficult to secure in a timely manner, on favorable terms or at all. If pursued, Calyxt would likely need to significantly delay or further scale back operations beyond its already narrowly focused operational activities.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Current Operational Focus 
 Prior to the announcement of the Transactions, the Company’s primary focus was on the development of synthetic biology products for its customers using its PlantSpring technology to develop various plant-based chemistries for production in its proprietary BioFactory production system. In light of the proposed Transactions and recent capital resource constraints, the Company has substantially scaled back its operations and has focused its current business activities on ensuring it has cash sufficient to achieve a closing of the proposed Transactions. Accordingly, Calyxt’s management has implemented cost reduction and other cash-focused measures, including reduction of headcount, reductions of capital expenditures, and renegotiation or termination of professional services agreements. To conserve cash, Calyxt has also strategically evaluated its arrangements with suppliers and service providers and has, in several instances, transitioned such relationships to lower cost alternative providers. 
 In limiting operations to core activities, the Company has focused its continuing operations on 
 

• | scaling production of a single Plant Cell MatrixTM (PCMTM) structures with its manufacturing partner, Evologic Technologies GmbH (Evologic);
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | licensing efforts with respect to its PlantSpring technology and plant traits, including the TALEN™ technology; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | continuing to progress its three current customer projects—(1) its research collaboration with a leading global food ingredient manufacturer to develop a soybean trait to serve as an alternative to palm oil, (2) its plant-based chemistry pilot project for a major consumer packaged goods company, and (3) supporting late-stage development activities for its improved digestibility alfalfa trait, which was developed with and licensed to S&W Seed Company.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The Company has suspended non-core activities, such as efforts toward the development and integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities (AIML) and the initiation, development and commercialization of additional synthetic biology products, or chemistries, beyond those involved in the continuing operations identified above. 
 The PlantSpring Technology Platform and Calyxt’s Development Process 
 The PlantSpring technology platform is founded on the Company’s more than a decade of experience engineering plant metabolism and incorporates its scientific knowledge and its proprietary systems, tools and technologies. PlantSpring also has the potential to incorporate AIML capabilities. 
 PlantSpring offers the potential to unleash the natural capabilities of plants—the original biological systems—and make available commercial innovations that produce unique plant-based chemistries from plant species, including rare or undomesticated species, in a manner that the Company believes is more robust and sustainable than other methods of production. Plants naturally produce many chemistries that may be valuable inputs for end products. Of the approximately 170,000 known and classified compounds derived from plants, bacteria, and fungi, approximately 78 percent are derived from plants. Moreover, some estimates suggest that there may be up to one million additional chemical compounds yet to be discovered. 
 
4 


 However, the yield of plant-based chemistries that occurs naturally may be insufficient for commercialization using traditional production methods, the plant that produces the chemistry may be scarce in nature or difficult to harvest, or there may be a socioeconomic concern with the harvest of the plant producing the chemistry. Additionally, the quality or quantity of a natural plant chemistry may be inconsistent, varying considerably over each variety, harvest, or field, and can be impacted by different contaminants in the soil where grown. 
 In PlantSpring, the Company identifies metabolic pathways to produce plant-based chemistries, designs strategies to reprogram host cells, engineers plant cell metabolism to optimally produce targeted compounds or plant traits. 
 The Company uses an efficient development process to deliver innovation through the PlantSpring technology platform, leveraging its extensive knowledge of plants and their metabolism when developing a plant-based chemistry or plant trait. The Company’s synthetic biology product development process is comprised of three primary stages: Design, Engineer, and Verify, and activities within each stage are as follows: 
 

• | Design – identify metabolic pathways to produce the target compound and the genes controlling these pathways, develop strategies for the optimized expression of the target genes, and design the technical approach to achieve the production of the targeted compound or trait. A metabolic pathway is a linked series of chemical reactions occurring within a cell. The reactants, products, and intermediates of an enzymatic reaction are known as metabolites, which are modified by a sequence of chemical reactions catalyzed by enzymes.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Engineer – direct changes in the plant cells using one or more genetic transformation and plant tissue culture techniques, and enhancements of genes in that plant species.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Verify – use a combination of analytical tools to verify the compound or trait produced against the intended specification. The analytical tools used include natural product chemistry, metabolomics, genomics, gene expression tools, and other analytics.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The typical timeline to complete the Design-Engineer-Verify process is currently estimated at 12 months. The Company is in the process of scaling plant-based chemistry production beyond the laboratory with its third-party manufacturing partner, Evologic Technologies GmbH. 
 Commercialization Strategies 
 The Company contemplates three commercialization strategies for its PlantSpring technology platform: (i) the development and sale of high-value synthetic biology products from the Company’s proprietary BioFactory production system, (ii) the licensing of elements of the PlantSpring technology platform and historically developed, traditional agriculture seed-trait product candidates, and (iii) selective product development for customers in traditional agriculture. In light of the Company’s capital resource constraints, the implementation of these strategies has been limited to implementation of the core activities described under “—Current Operational Focus.” 
The BioFactory Production System 
 The BioFactory production system is a bioreactor-based production system that is designed to be capable of continuous production of plant-based chemistries. The bioreactor can be of any size depending upon factors including yield and titer necessary to reach the required commercial scale. For production, multicellular PCM structures are placed inside the bioreactor, and growth media provides the PCM structures with nutrition. A PCM structure is a living system of various cell types, which is designed to emulate the intercellular metabolism of an entire plant, that grows over time and produces and stores, or excretes, the target chemistries. The growth media is the feedstock of the BioFactory production system and contains the essential inputs to support growth of the PCM structures and necessary chemistry production. 
 In 2022, the Company signed an agreement with an infrastructure partner, Evologic. Under the terms of the agreement, Evologic will work alongside Calyxt to grow and scale Calyxt’s proprietary PCM structures and is currently scaling one PCM for Calyxt. 
 In combination with the Company’s Design-Engineer-Verify stages of the development process, the Company estimates that the timeline to achieve commercial availability of a potential product is currently approximately 36 months, subject to potential regulatory extensions for certain industries.

 As a result, the Company believes that in combination its PlantSpring technology platform and its BioFactory production system are capable of unlocking the power of plants to produce high value and complex plant-based chemistries and plant traits that are finite, are difficult to source sustainably, and may not be able to be produced through other production systems or cannot be produced as efficiently in single cell plant culture systems. 
 Technology Licensing & Product Development for Agriculture 
 The Company maintains the capability to implement broad technology licensing arrangements and to selectively develop agricultural products. Potential commercial opportunities, include the licensing of elements of the PlantSpring technology platform as well as historically developed, traditional agriculture seed-trait product candidates. 
 With respect to licensing opportunities for select elements of the PlantSpring technology platform, the opportunities span the Company’s intellectual property portfolio built for more than a decade as a leading plant-based biotechnology company, including multiple gene editing platforms, plant breeding, and other capabilities. The Company’s PlantSpring technology platform has been utilized to drive industry-leading modernization of the hemp species, including improved characteristics for protein and oil production and use in advanced materials. Hemp can also contribute to enhancing a wide variety of materials, including strengthening plastics, reducing petroleum-based content, and providing greater strength and longevity compared to other plant-based fabrics like linen or cotton. The Company has successfully transformed the hemp genome and also has produced “pollen-proof” (seedless) hemp with its triploid breeding technology. Combined, the Company’s hemp advancements offer significant potential advantages in innovation, crop management, and harvest yield. 
 Additional technology-licensing activity may also continue in connection with the licensing of historically developed, traditional agriculture seed-trait product candidates, including soybeans with improved fatty-acid profiles; an improved digestibility alfalfa, which has been licensed for commercialization to S&W; wheat with a higher fiber content than traditionally bred varieties, and its second generation soybean product, which has an improved fatty acid profile compared to commodity soybeans and the Company’s initial soybean product launched in 2019. Among the Company’s other development successes are a soybean with improved flavor to help enable wider adoption for plant-based protein applications and controlling the production of storage sugars in potatoes to improve fry quality and reduce acrylamide. While the Company will pursue licensing opportunities for these product candidates, it is does not intend to invest in further development until specific licensee customers are contracted with. 
 The potential to opportunistically develop seed-trait product candidates for customers focused on traditional outdoor agriculture market also remains. In 2021, the Company entered into a research collaboration with a global food ingredient manufacturer based in Asia to develop an improved soybean capable of producing an oil that would serve as a commercial alternative to palm oil. The food ingredient manufacturer is funding the Company’s development costs over the term of the agreement and holds an option for future development and commercialization. The Company achieved the first $100 thousand milestone payment in the fourth quarter of 2022, with the overall project scheduled for completion in the first quarter of 2024, at which time the second milestone payment of $100 thousand would be due. 
 To manage prioritization of resources and to drive returns on its investment, the Company has developed a set of criteria by which all agricultural seed trait licensing and seed trait development opportunities are evaluated, which include the size of the overall opportunity, the nature of the product to be developed, and the amount of cash it expects to receive both up front and over time. At present, no new investments are being made in light of the limited implementation of the Company’s core activities described under “—Current Operational Focus.” 
 Research and Development 
 The Company’s proprietary technologies and intellectual property portfolio are focused on the PlantSpring technology platform, the BioFactory production system, TALEN, and other adjacent technologies, data analytics, plant breeding, systems, and work processes. 
 The Company’s Research and Development (R&D) team has technical expertise primarily in biochemistry, bioinformatics, chemistry, genetics and genetic engineering, molecular biology, plant physiology, tissue culture techniques, and other related fields. The Company’s R&D activities are conducted principally at its Minnesota facility. 
 Historically, the Company’s R&D cash usage has included investments in the development, enhancement and deployment of AIML capabilities, expenses to continue to enhance the capabilities of its PlantSpring technology platform and BioFactory production system, and various expenses and capital expenditures to expand its BioFactory production system from lab through various pilot vessel sizes. In light of Calyxt’s capital resource constraints, it has limited R&D cash usage. The Company’s current R&D cash usage primarily consists of expenses to continue to scaling production of a single PCM structure with its manufacturing partner, Evologic. 
 The Company has made substantial investments in R&D. For more information on R&D expenses, see the Company’s consolidated financial statements and related financial statement schedules on page F-1.
Market and Industry Overview 
 Calyxt believes that its technology platforms have the potential to revolutionize how the world uses plants, providing innovation opportunities in the space where customers’ needs to consume finite resources and their enhanced focus on the sustainability of the planet intersect. The global economy today faces numerous sustainability challenges, as evidenced by metrics such as carbon pollution, water scarcity, and soil erosion. To address their sustainability goals, many companies must produce products differently, and plant–based chemistries represent a differentiated and a more sustainable alternative to many products and materials in use today. More than 20 percent of the world’s 2,000 largest public companies have committed to carbon-neutrality, supporting a shift to plant-based solutions.

 The synthetic biology industry has expanded significantly over the past several years. New companies are being formed, investment capital is being deployed, and the number of public exits for once-private synthetic biology companies have accelerated. Companies within this group are pursuing novel methods of production to replace current approaches to the production of various compounds or products. Examples of such compounds include plant-based proteins, colorants, advanced materials, pharma-grade products (such as vaccine adjuvants and antibiotics), and many others. The Company believes it is the only company in the synthetic biology industry that has exclusively used plants as its core innovation species, with most competitors focused on single-cell organisms including yeast, bacteria (such as e coli), and algae. 
 The Company believes that potential end markets for plant-based sustainable solutions are broad and diverse because plant-based synthetic biology can be used to produce compounds and products with many desirable sustainability features. These end markets include the cosmeceutical, nutraceutical, and pharmaceutical industries. 
 Intellectual Property 
 Intellectual property protection is key to the Company. As of December 31, 2022, the Company’s patent estate is composed of patents and patent applications owned by the Company and in-licensed from other parties. Most of the in-licensed patents and patent applications are licensed from Cellectis or the University of Minnesota. The license from Cellectis includes technologies invented at Cellectis, technologies invented by the Company when it was a wholly owned subsidiary of Cellectis, and technologies licensed to Cellectis from third parties. The Company also has access to additional patents and patent applications through in-licensing agreements with other research institutions and universities. 
 The Company’s patent portfolio is categorized into three major platforms: PlantSpring, BioFactory and other products, and Licensing. Some patents and patent applications are applicable to multiple platforms, and as such are included in multiple categories. 
 The PlantSpring platform elements of the Company’s patent portfolio is intellectual property used with its PlantSpring platform and includes gene-editing technologies and hemp breeding technologies. This portion of the Company’s patent portfolio includes more than 160 patents and patent applications worldwide. 
 The BioFactory and products platform elements of the Company’s patent portfolio includes outputs from its BioFactory, gene edited crops, and its PCM structures. This portion of the Company’s patent portfolio includes approximately 45 patents and patent applications worldwide. 
 The technologies available for licensing within the Company’s patent portfolio includes in-licensed technology and Calyxt-originated IP, and includes gene-editing technologies (e.g., TALEN®), gene-edited traits for agriculture, and hemp breeding technologies. This portion of the Company’s patent portfolio includes approximately 490 patents and patent applications worldwide. 
 The Company is actively involved in the prosecution and protection of its technology. The Company’s global patent portfolio includes 67 patent families comprised of 369 patents and 113 patent applications. Of those patents, 47 have been issued in the United States, with the remaining issued in key geographies outside the United States, primarily Europe, Japan, and China. This number also includes European patents validated in individual European countries. Of those patent applications, 26 are pending in the United States, with the remaining pending as international applications or country-specific applications in key geographies outside the United States. 
 Individual patent terms extend for varying periods of time, depending upon the date of filing of the patent application, the date of patent issuance, and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. The issued patents that the Company has licensed in will expire on dates ranging from 2023 to 2037. If patents are issued on the pending patent applications owned by the Company or that it has in-licensed, the resulting patents are projected to expire on dates ranging from 2023 to 2043. The Company does not believe that the expiration of any patents expected to occur during 2023 would have a material effect on the Company’s business, including any impact on its future operations and financial position. For more information regarding the risks related to the Company’s intellectual property, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property.” 
 License Agreement with Cellectis 
 Through its license agreement with Cellectis, the Company has access to intellectual property that broadly covers the use of engineered nucleases for plant gene editing. This intellectual property covers methods to edit plant genes using “chimeric restriction endonucleases,” which include TALEN, CRISPR/Cas9, zinc finger nucleases, and some types of meganucleases. The Company believes this umbrella intellectual property applies broadly across gene editing in plants and makes this license an important element in the gene editing intellectual property space. 
 Under its license agreement with Cellectis, the Company has exclusive sublicense rights (subject to existing non-exclusive sublicenses to third parties) to intellectual property exclusively licensed to Cellectis from the University of Minnesota in the field of researching, developing, and commercializing agricultural and food products, including traits, seeds, and feed and food ingredients (excluding any application in connection with animals or animal cells). These patent applications cover the use of DNA replicons for gene editing. 
 The Company has also been granted a non-exclusive license to use the TALEN trademark in connection with its use of licensed products under the agreement. Any improvements it makes to the in-licensed intellectual property are owned by the Company and licensed back to Cellectis on an exclusive basis for any use outside of its exclusive agricultural field of use. The exclusivity of the Company’s license agreement with Cellectis is subject to certain non-exclusive licenses Cellectis granted to third parties in the field of research. 
 
7 


 In consideration for the license from Cellectis, the Company is required to pay to Cellectis, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, a royalty of three percent of net sales less certain items as defined, including costs for grain and seed of any products that are covered by the patents licensed from Cellectis. In addition, the Company is required to pay Cellectis 30 percent of revenue it receives for sublicensing its rights under the agreement to third parties. The Company’s payment obligations to Cellectis will expire upon the expiration of the last-to-expire valid claim of the patents licensed to the Company by Cellectis. 
 Under the Company’s license agreement with Cellectis, and as between the parties, Cellectis has the first right to control the prosecution, maintenance, defense and enforcement of the licensed intellectual property and the Company will have the right to step in and assume such control with respect to the patents owned by Cellectis and exclusively licensed to it under the agreement if Cellectis elects to not prosecute, maintain, defend, or enforce such patents. In certain circumstances, if Cellectis elects to abandon any patents owned by Cellectis and exclusively licensed to the Company under the agreement, it has the right to assume ownership of such patents. In addition, some of the intellectual property that is licensed to the Company by Cellectis consists of a sublicense of intellectual property originally licensed to Cellectis by the University of Minnesota. The Company’s license from Cellectis is subject to the license agreement between the University of Minnesota and Cellectis and should its activities under such sublicense violate the license agreement between Cellectis and the University of Minnesota, the Company is responsible for any related damages that Cellectis may incur. In addition, the Company is required to reimburse Cellectis for any payments made by Cellectis to the University of Minnesota pursuant to the license agreement between the University of Minnesota and Cellectis to the extent that such payments are required to be made as a result of its applicable activities. Under the license agreement between Cellectis and the University of Minnesota, the University of Minnesota has the first right to control the prosecution and maintenance of the licensed intellectual property. 
 The Company’s license agreement with Cellectis is perpetual. However, the agreement may be terminated at any time upon the mutual written agreement of both parties, either party’s uncured material breach of the agreement, or upon certain bankruptcy and insolvency related events. 
 License Agreement between Cellectis and Regents of the University of Minnesota—TALEN 
 In January 2011, Cellectis entered into an exclusive license agreement with the University of Minnesota, which was amended in 2012, 2014 and 2015. Pursuant to the agreement, as amended, Cellectis and its affiliates were granted an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing, sublicensable license, under certain patents and patent applications owned by the University of Minnesota, to make, use, sell, import, and otherwise dispose of products covered by the licensed patents, in all fields of use. These licensed patents relate to TALEN molecules and their use in gene editing. 
 Pursuant to the agreement, with respect to the agricultural field, Cellectis is required to pay to the University of Minnesota an annual fee, as well as a commercialization fee for every seed variety containing new traits developed using the licensed technology. Cellectis is also required to pay the University of Minnesota milestone payments based on the net sales of licensed products in the agricultural field. Cellectis must also pay the University of Minnesota certain patent-related expenses for prosecuting and maintaining the licensed patents; and under the Company’s license agreement with Cellectis, it is obligated to reimburse Cellectis for these prosecution costs. 
 The agreement will expire upon the expiration of the last to expire valid claim of the licensed patents. The University of Minnesota may terminate the agreement upon advance written notice in the event of the insolvency or bankruptcy of Cellectis, and immediately upon written notice if Cellectis challenges the validity or enforceability of any licensed patent in a court or other applicable authority. Cellectis and the University of Minnesota may terminate the agreement by written notice in the event of the other party’s breach that has not been cured within a specified number of days after receiving notice of such breach. 
 Trademarks 
 As of December 31, 2022, the Company had four registered trademarks in the United States. 
 Government Regulation and Product Compliance 
 The Company’s PlantSpring technology platform and its BioFactory production system operate in contained environments without the need for outdoor cropping systems. Any regulated materials used under this process, such as specific bacteria, are therefore subject to well-defined regulations in the United States. 
 The Company’s development and production processes involve the use, generation, handling, storage, transportation and disposal of hazardous chemicals and regulated biological materials. The Company is subject to a variety of federal, state, and local laws, regulations and permit requirements governing the use, generation, manufacture, transportation, storage, handling and disposal of these materials in the United States. In the future, to the extent the Company may operate or sell its products outside the United States, the Company would be subject to corresponding international laws and regulations. These laws, regulations and permits can require expensive fees, exposure or pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit actual or potential impact of the Company’s technology on the environment and violation of these laws could result in significant fines, civil sanctions, permit revocation or costs from environmental remediation. Future developments, including the commencement of or changes in the processes relating to commercial manufacturing of one or more of the Company’s products, more stringent environmental regulation, policies and enforcement, the implementation of new laws and regulations or the discovery of unknown environmental conditions, may require expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations or financial condition. 

Hemp, as defined in the 2018 Farm Bill as Cannabis sativa containing a delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) concentration of not more than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis, has been removed from the United States Federal Controlled Substances Act and is legally distinct from marijuana/cannabis, which is Cannabis sativa containing a THC concentration of more than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis. Hemp is recognized as an agricultural crop by the United States federal government. Federal and state laws and regulations on hemp address production, monitoring, manufacturing, distribution, and laboratory testing to ensure that that the hemp has a THC concentration of not more than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis. Federal laws and regulations also address the transportation or shipment of hemp or hemp products. 
 
8 


 Consistent with the 2018 Farm Bill, the Minnesota Department of Agriculture (MDA) operates a Hemp Program under its United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) approved Minnesota state plan. This plan establishes that a commercial hemp production license is required for growing and processing of hemp in the State of Minnesota. The Company holds an MDA Hemp Program License and has implemented an internal hemp compliance system including procedures, quality control and internal audits. USDA and/or MDA may audit the Company at any time for compliance with license requirements. 
 
9 


 Additionally, Calyxt has obtained USDA permits for specific regulated materials (e.g., bacteria) that are used as part of its PlantSpring technology platform and BioFactory production system. The Company has implemented the required compliance system in order to meet USDA permit conditions and ensure adequate documentation is in place. The USDA may audit the Company at any time for compliance with permit requirements. 
 The BioFactory production system has the capability of producing a diverse range of plant-derived compounds that may be used for applications in cosmeceuticals, nutraceuticals, pharmaceuticals, and more. As the Company delivers these valuable compounds to its customers, each customer will be responsible for determining for which applications the compounds are utilized and such customer-determined specific uses will determine applicable regulatory requirements. It is anticipated that because the Company’s customers would incorporate the purchased compounds into their existing product development processes and areas of applications, the customers will be best positioned to apply their specific expertise in the field to establish regulatory compliance and determine any additional requirements. 
 The Company also expects to continue to license its technology and develop seed traits for agricultural customers based on their needs. This would include the use of gene editing in crops for outdoor use. Neither the Company, nor its commercial partners, currently deploy the Company’s technology for use outside of the United States with the exception of the Company’s High Oleic Soybean product, which in addition to having clearance from the USDA and FDA, also has clearance from the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and Health Canada for use in Canada. In today’s global market, overall business development strategy for plant biology companies depends, in part, on the availability of regulatory clearance in strategic export markets, which enables broader flexibility for product expansion and is a key consideration in evaluating global trade opportunities. Regulatory predictability is critical in order to establish accurate product launch strategies. The costs of achieving clearance in foreign countries is often high, due to stricter regulatory environments than the United States, and there can be no assurance the Company will be granted clearance on favorable terms, if at all. 
 Under the Company’s partner-driven model, agricultural customers would likely be contractually responsible for obtaining the needed global regulatory clearance for agricultural products developed by the Company or using its licensed technology. Accordingly, outside of permitting expenses incurred in the ordinary course of business, the Company does not expect compliance with government regulations, including environmental regulations, to have a material effect on the Company’s capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. 
 Competition 
 The market for more sustainably produced products is highly competitive. Competition in synthetic biology is largely from fermentation-based companies who generally pursue the development of compounds by combining a single cell organism like a microbe, bacteria, or yeast with another organism’s DNA to achieve a desired result. These compounds are then marketed by third parties or directly by the fermentation company. These organizations may have substantially larger budgets for R&D, product commercialization, and regulatory process management and greater available capital resources. 
 Through its technology licensing, the Company believes that it faces competition from large agricultural biotechnology, seed, and chemical companies, certain of which have been actively involved in new trait discovery, development, and commercialization. Many of the Company’s competitors—particularly large chemical companies—have substantially larger budgets for R&D, product commercialization, and regulatory process management as well as substantially greater access to capital. Trait research and development companies as well as research universities and institutions are competitors that typically focus on a limited number of traits and do not generally have the product development, gene editing technologies, and regulatory infrastructure necessary to bring traits to market. They generally out-license trait technologies to large industry players with in-house development and regulatory capabilities at a relatively early stage of development. 
 The Company competes based on its expertise and the precision, specificity, cost effectiveness and development speed of its proprietary technologies. Nevertheless, certain of the Company’s competitors are more established in the synthetic biology industry and many of the Company’s current or potential competitors, either alone or with their R&D or collaboration partners, have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in R&D, manufacturing, testing, and marketing approved products than the Company. 
 The Company’s commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if its competitors develop and commercialize products faster, with lower research costs than the Company. 
 Human Capital 
 As of December 31, 2022, the Company had 48 employees, 30 of whom were in R&D. None of the Company’s employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. The Company considers its relationship with employees to be good.

 Seasonality 
 The Company maintains the capability to implement broad arrangements for technology licensing and product development for agriculture. Technology licensing opportunities span the Company’s intellectual property portfolio built over more than a decade as a leading plant-based biology company, including multiple gene editing platforms, plant breeding, and other capabilities. The Company may be exposed to the impact of seasonality that exits with traditional agriculture depending on the arrangement.
