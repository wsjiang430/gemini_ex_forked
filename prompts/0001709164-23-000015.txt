Item 1. BUSINESS
General
Hamilton Beach Brands Holding Company (“Hamilton Beach Holding” or the “Company”) is a holding company and operates through its wholly-owned subsidiary Hamilton Beach Brands, Inc. (“HBB”). HBB is the Company's single reportable segment.
The only material assets held by Hamilton Beach Holding is the investment in its consolidated subsidiary. Substantially all of its cash flows are provided by dividends paid or distributions made by its subsidiary. Hamilton Beach Brands Holding Company has not guaranteed any obligations of its subsidiary.
The Company also previously operated through its former wholly-owned subsidiary, The Kitchen Collection, LLC ("KC"), which is reported as discontinued operations in all periods presented herein. KC completed its dissolution on April 3, 2020 with a pro-rata distribution of its remaining assets to creditors, at which time the KC legal entity ceased to exist. 
HBB is a leading designer, marketer, and distributor of a wide range of branded small electric household and specialty housewares appliances, as well as commercial products for restaurants, fast food chains, bars, and hotels. HBB operates in the consumer, commercial and specialty small appliance markets.
On September 29, 2017, NACCO Industries, Inc. ("NACCO"), Hamilton Beach Holding's former parent company, spun-off the Company to NACCO stockholders. In the spin-off, NACCO stockholders, in addition to retaining their shares of NACCO common stock, received one share of Hamilton Beach Brands Holding Company Class A common stock ("Class A Common") and one share of Hamilton Beach Brands Holding Company Class B common stock ("Class B Common") for each share of NACCO Class A or Class B common stock. In accordance with applicable authoritative accounting guidance, the Company accounted for the spin-off from NACCO based on the historical carrying value of assets and liabilities.
The Company makes its annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to those reports available, free of charge, through its website, www.hamiltonbeachbrands.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).

Sales and Marketing
HBB designs, markets and distributes a wide range of branded, small electric household and specialty housewares appliances, including air fryers, blenders, coffee makers, food processors, indoor electric grills, irons, juicers, mixers, slow cookers, toasters and toaster ovens. HBB also designs, markets and distributes commercial products for restaurants, fast food chains, bars and hotels. HBB generally markets its “good” and “better” consumer products under the Hamilton Beach® and Proctor Silex® brands. HBB participates in the premium market with its owned brands Hamilton Beach® Professional and Weston® farm-to-table and field-to-table food processing equipment. Additionally, the Company participates in the premium market through multiyear licensing agreements to market and distribute a line of countertop appliances under the Wolf Gourmet® brand, a line of premium garment care products under the CHI® brand and the Bartesian® premium cocktail delivery system. The Company continues to expand in the home, health and wellness market, selling air purifiers under the Clorox® and TrueAir® brands, Hamilton Beach® Health smart Injection Care Management Systems, and Brita® water filtration systems. HBB markets its commercial products under the Hamilton Beach Commercial® and the Proctor Silex Commercial® brands. HBB supplies private label products on a limited basis. HBB also licenses certain of its trademarks to various licensees in categories such as microwave ovens, among others. Sales promotion activities are supported through print and digital marketing vehicles. HBB promotes certain of its innovative products primarily through the use of digital and print advertising.
Customers
Sales in North America are generated predominantly by a network of inside sales employees to mass merchandisers, ecommerce retailers, national department stores, variety store chains, drug store chains, specialty home retailers, distributors, restaurants, bars, hotels and other retail outlets. Walmart Inc. and its global subsidiaries accounted for approximately 26%, 28% and 35% of HBB’s revenue in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Amazon.com, Inc. and its subsidiaries accounted for approximately 23%, 22% and 16% of HBB's revenue in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. HBB’s five largest customers accounted for approximately 61%, 61%, and 64% of HBB’s revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 
Product Warranty
HBB's warranty program to the consumer consists generally of an assurance-type limited warranty lasting for varying periods of up to ten years for electric appliances, with the majority of products having a warranty of one to three years. There is no guarantee to the consumer as HBB may repair or replace, at its option, those products returned under warranty.
Working Capital
The market for small electric household and specialty housewares appliances is highly seasonal in nature. The majority of HBB's revenue and operating profit typically occurs in the second half of the year due to the fall holiday-selling season. Due to the seasonality of purchases of its products, HBB generally uses a substantial amount of cash or borrowings under our revolving credit facility to finance inventory in anticipation of the fall holiday-selling season.
Patents, Trademarks, Copyrights and Licenses
HBB holds patents and trademarks registered in the United States ("U.S.") and foreign countries for various products. HBB believes its business is not dependent upon any individual patent, copyright or license, but that the Hamilton Beach®, Proctor Silex®, Hamilton Beach® Professional, and Weston® trademarks are material to its business.
Product Design and Development
HBB incurred $11.8 million, $8.6 million and $10.0 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, on product design and development activities.
Key Suppliers and Raw Material
HBB’s products are produced to its specifications by third-party suppliers. HBB does not maintain long-term purchase contracts with suppliers and operates mainly on a purchase order basis. HBB negotiates the purchases from its foreign suppliers in U.S. dollars.
During 2022, HBB purchased substantially all of its finished products from suppliers in China. HBB purchases its inventory from approximately 65 suppliers, one of which represented more than 10% of purchases during the year ended December 31, 2022. HBB believes the loss of any one supplier would not have a long-term material adverse effect on its business because there are adequate supplier choices available that can meet HBB’s production and quality requirements. However, the loss of a supplier could, in the short term, adversely affect HBB’s business until alternative supply arrangements are secured.
The principal raw materials used by HBB’s third-party suppliers to manufacture its products are plastic, glass, steel, copper, aluminum and packaging materials. HBB believes adequate quantities of raw materials are available from various suppliers.
Competition
HBB believes the principal areas of competition with respect to its products are product design and innovation, quality, price, product features, supply chain excellence, merchandising, promotion and warranty. HBB competes with many manufacturers and distributors of housewares products. As brick and mortar retailers generally purchase a limited selection of branded, small electric appliances, HBB competes with other suppliers for retail shelf space. In the ecommerce channel, HBB must compete with a broad list of competitors for brand reputation through compelling content, strong ratings and reviews from consumers.
To meet these competitive challenges, the Company has focused on continued innovation in its leading brands as well as expanding into new categories using existing core competencies. HBB’s presence in a significant number of product categories across various price points allows the Company to meet the needs of a wide range of retailers and consumers. Based on publicly available information about the industry, HBB is one of the largest full-line distributors and marketers of small electric household and specialty housewares appliances in North America, including the U.S., Canada, Mexico and Latin America, based on key product categories. Hamilton Beach® is the #1 small kitchen appliance brand in the US, in brick-and-mortar and ecommerce channels, based on units sold. 
To a lesser degree, HBB retail product lines compete outside of North America. HBB's commercial products compete globally and have generated a strong position in these markets.
Government Regulation
HBB is subject to numerous federal and state health, safety and environmental regulations. HBB believes the impact of expenditures to comply with such laws will not have a material adverse effect on HBB.
As a marketer and distributor of consumer products, HBB is subject to the Consumer Products Safety Act and the Federal Hazardous Substances Act, which empower the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (“CPSC”) to seek to exclude products that are found to be unsafe or hazardous from the market. Under certain circumstances, the CPSC could require HBB to repair, replace or refund the purchase price of one or more of HBB’s products, or HBB may voluntarily do so.
Throughout the world, electrical appliances are subject to various mandatory and voluntary standards, including requirements in some jurisdictions that products be listed by Underwriters’ Laboratories, Inc. (“UL”) or other similar recognized laboratories. HBB also uses Intertek Testing Services for certification and testing of compliance with UL standards, as well as other national and industry specific standards. HBB endeavors to design its products to meet the certification requirements of, and to be certified in, each of the jurisdictions in which they are sold.
Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the "Dodd-Frank Act") requires public companies to disclose whether certain minerals, commonly known as "conflict minerals," are necessary to the functionality or production of a product manufactured by those companies and if those minerals originated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ("DRC") or an adjoining country. HBB conducts supply-chain due diligence investigations required by the conflict minerals rules and makes disclosures required by the Dodd Frank Act. Our compliance with these investigation and disclosure requirements could adversely affect our ability to sell products to customers that HBB is unable to designate as "DRC conflict free."

Fees for consulting services rendered by Mr. Rankin were $0.5 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020.
Human Capital Resources
Our business is dependent upon, and focused on, people—our employees, our customers and the consumers who enjoy our appliances, and the communities in which we live. Our culture is built on and centered around Good Thinking®, which incorporates teamwork, service and inspired thinking into all areas of our business. We believe that this values-based culture is a core strength that provides the foundation for our working environment and our employees. Good Thinking ® is more than developing new products; it inspires everything we do.
Within this culture, our people are our most valuable resource, and we expect them to remain the key to our success for decades to come. We strive to create an environment that attracts, engages and develops the talent necessary to enable our performance and growth, including by offering competitive compensation and benefits, providing attractive professional growth opportunities, and insisting that everyone be treated with dignity and respect and be afforded equal opportunity. We also recognize the basic human need to feel a sense of inclusion, belonging, and meaning. So, we strive to foster an environment in which our people are passionate about our business and our Good Thinking ® culture, have a seat at the table, and genuinely believe that they are doing meaningful work. We believe that employees with diverse backgrounds, experiences and viewpoints bring value to our Company, especially when coupled with a strong culture of trust in which competing ideas are not only allowed but encouraged to emerge. We strongly believe that this type of environment drives discretionary effort, morale, creativity, initiative and retention—and, in turn, long-term competitive advantage and value creation. Within the framework of our Good Thinking ® culture, we operate as One Team and strive to enrich the lives of our customers and consumers by delivering innovative solutions that improve everyday living, all while having a positive, lasting impact on our people and the communities in which we operate.
We are committed to achieving the highest standards of legal and ethical conduct, including by protecting the human rights and fair treatment of our employees. Our policies and programs—including our Code of Corporate Conduct and other compliance policies, our employment-related policies, and our Human Rights Policy—are designed to support this effort.
As of December 31, 2022, the Company employed approximately 700 employees in four countries—Canada, China, Mexico, and the United States, of which approximately 95% were full time and the remaining were part time. Approximately 3% of our workforce is covered by collective bargaining agreements, all of whom are based in Canada or Mexico. There are approximately 500 employees in the United States with about half of those based at the Company’s headquarters in Richmond, Virginia, which is home to the Company’s product design, development and marketing teams as well as its state-of-the-art test kitchen and UL-certified test laboratory. Most of the remaining employees in the United States support the operation of our Byhalia, Mississippi distribution centers. We consider employee relations to be good.
Occupational Health and Safety
One of our top priorities is protecting the health and safety of our workforce. We are committed to maintaining a safe work environment and operating in a safe, secure and responsible manner. We require all Company personnel to perform their work in a manner that complies with legal requirements protecting the safety and health of all persons from unreasonable risks. In addition to maintaining property and equipment in safe operating conditions, our occupational health and safety framework includes certain safety training programs and safety-related processes and procedures as we strive to ensure the health and safety of our workforce. Employees are encouraged to initiate safety improvements, participate in safety committees, and always reinforce safe behaviors.
Talent Acquisition, Development and Retention
The long-term success and growth of our business depend in large part on our ability to execute an effective talent strategy that attracts, engages and grows a highly talented and committed workforce capable of enabling and leading our performance. To meet our talent objectives, we utilize key strategies and processes related to recruitment while we remain focused on continuing to strengthen our onboarding and ongoing learning development. We monitor market compensation and benefits to be able to attract, retain and promote employees and reduce turnover and its associated costs. Through our total rewards programs, we strive to offer competitive compensation, benefits and services to our full-time employees including, incentive plans, recognition plans, defined contribution plans, healthcare benefits, tax-advantaged spending accounts, employee assistance programs and other programs such as sick leave and paid vacation and holidays.
We are a learning organization committed to the goal of continuous improvement and the development of our workforce. To empower our employees to reach their full potential, we offer certain training, learning experiences and resources, such as “Hamilton Beach University”—an ongoing, cross-functional learning program designed not only to help employees learn about our Company, our products and our industry but also to stay abreast of emerging trends and to develop job-specific skills.
Diversity and Inclusion
As an equal opportunity employer, we make decisions without regard to race, color, religion, creed, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, marital status, national origin, age, veteran status, disability, or any other protected class. We strive to cultivate diversity of perspective in our workforce and believe teammates with diverse backgrounds, experiences and viewpoints bring value to our organization and improve our Good Thinking ® and, in turn, our decision-making. We strive to create a workplace in which employee differences are embraced and competing perspectives are encouraged to emerge, allowing robust collaboration and teamwork to drive better decision making and more favorable results for all stakeholders. All employees participate in training intended to enhance our awareness of the benefits of a diverse and inclusive workforce, to encourage more meaningful collaboration, and to strengthen team effectiveness.
COVID-19
Throughout the pandemic we have monitored the changing landscape of local requirements and guidelines for all locations and have made changes to our workplace protocols as necessary. We continue to monitor diligently the developments related to COVID-19 and to adjust as needed to perform our business requirements while providing a safe environment for our workforce.
We have been impressed by the resiliency and adaptability demonstrated by our employees throughout the pandemic. We believe that their ability to remain flexible and to work productively and collaboratively and, in many cases, remotely during such stressful and unpredictable times is a testament to the strength of our Good Thinking® culture. We also believe that the pandemic-related challenges have strengthened us and that we now are better positioned to adjust work locations and patterns if other disruptive events were to occur.
