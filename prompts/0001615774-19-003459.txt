Company Overview 
 
The following information is qualified in its entirety by and should be read together with the more detailed information and audited financial statements, including the related notes, contained or incorporated by reference in this report.
General
 
We operate in the fragrance business and manufacture, market and distribute a wide array of fragrance and fragrance related products. We manage our business in two segments, European based operations and United States based operations. Certain prestige fragrance products are produced and marketed by our European operations through our 73% owned subsidiary in Paris, Interparfums SA, which is also a publicly traded company as 27% of Interparfums SA shares trade on the NYSE Euronext.
 
Our business is not capital intensive, and it is important to note that we do not own manufacturing facilities. We act as a general contractor and source our needed components from our suppliers. These components are received at one of our distribution centers and then, based upon production needs, the components are sent to one of several third party fillers which manufacture the finished product for us and deliver them to one of our distribution centers.
 
Our fragrance products focus on prestige brands, each with a devoted following. By concentrating in markets where the brands are best known, we have had many successful product launches. We typically launch new fragrance families for our brands every year or two, and more frequently seasonal and limited edition fragrances are introduced as well.
 
The creation and marketing of each product family is intimately linked with the brand’s name, its past and present positioning, customer base and, more generally, the prevailing market atmosphere. Accordingly, we generally study the market for each proposed family of fragrance products for almost a full year before we introduce any new product into the market. This study is intended to define the general position of the fragrance family and more particularly its scent, bottle, packaging and appeal to the buyer. In our opinion, the unity of these four elements of the marketing mix makes for a successful product.
 
As with any business, many aspects of our operations are subject to influences outside our control. We believe we have a strong brand portfolio with global reach and potential. As part of our strategy, we plan to continue to make investments behind fast-growing markets and channels to grow market share. We discuss in greater detail risk factors relating to our business in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, and the reports that we file from time to time with the SEC.
 
European Operations
 
We produce and distribute our fragrance products primarily under license agreements with brand owners, and fragrance product sales through our European operations represented approximately 80% of net sales for 2018. We have built a portfolio of prestige brands, which include Boucheron, Coach, Jimmy Choo, Karl Lagerfeld, Lanvin, Montblanc, Paul Smith, Repetto, Rochas, S.T. Dupont and Van Cleef & Arpels, whose products are distributed in over 100 countries around the world.

With respect to the Company’s largest brands, we own the Lanvin brand name for our class of trade, and license the Montblanc, Jimmy Choo and Coach brand names. As a percentage of net sales, product sales for the Company’s largest brands were as follows:
 
 | Year Ended December 31, | 
-----------+-----------------------------+---
 | 2018 | | | 2017 | | 2016
Montblanc | | 19 | % | | 21 | % | 23 | %
Jimmy Choo | | 17 | % | | 18 | % | 17 | %
Coach | | 15 | % | | 10 | % | 4 | %
Lanvin | | 10 | % | | 11 | % | 12 | %

United States Operations
 
Prestige brand fragrance products are also marketed through our United States operations, and represented 20% of sales for the year ended December 31, 2018. These fragrance products are sold under trademarks owned by us or pursuant to license or other agreements with the owners of brands, which include Abercrombie & Fitch, Agent Provocateur, Anna Sui, bebe, Dunhill, Hollister, French Connection, Graff, GUESS, Lily Aldridge and Oscar de la Renta.
Recent Developments
 
Lily Aldridge
 
In September 2018, Interstellar Brands LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, announced the development of a new fragrance line in collaboration with supermodel Lily Aldridge. The license agreement with Lily Aldridge runs through December 31, 2023, and is subject to royalty payments as are customary in our industry. This deal marks the beginning of a strategic partnership between Interstellar and IMG Models, which manages Lily Aldridge, to develop direct-to-consumer e-commerce fragrance and beauty businesses for IMG Models’ diverse and dynamic client base. Our initial fragrance product launch, a multi-scent collection, is planned for September 2019.
Van Cleef & Arpels License
 
In May 2018, the Company renewed its license agreement for an additional six years with Van Cleef & Arpels for the creation, development, and distribution of fragrance products through December 2024, without any material changes in terms and conditions. Our initial 12-year license agreement with Van Cleef & Arpels was signed in 2006.

Graff License
 
In April 2018, the Company entered into an exclusive, 8-year worldwide license agreement with London-based Graff for the creation, development and distribution of fragrances under the Graff brand. Our rights under such license agreement are subject to certain advertising expenditures and royalty payments as are customary in our industry. Initial product development includes a multi-scent collection planned for a late 2019 launch. Additionally, we are exploring opportunities for luxury travel amenities, including five star hotels.
 
GUESS License
 
In February 2018, the Company entered into an exclusive, 15-year worldwide license agreement with GUESS?, Inc. for the creation, development and distribution of fragrances under the GUESS brand. This license took effect on April 1, 2018, and our rights under such license are subject to certain minimum advertising expenditures and royalty payments as are customary in our industry. In 2018, our sales efforts were focused on existing fragrances; in 2019, we plan to add several flankers to existing product and in 2020, entirely new fragrances are scheduled for launch.
 
Income Tax Recovery
 
The French government had introduced a 3% tax on dividends or deemed dividends for entities subject to French corporate income tax in 2012. In 2017, the French Constitutional Court released a decision declaring that the 3% tax on dividends or deemed dividends is unconstitutional. As a result of that decision, the Company filed a claim for refund of approximately $3.9 million for these taxes paid since 2015 including accrued interest of approximately $0.4 million. The Company recorded the refund claim as of December 31, 2017 and has received the entire refund in 2018.
Impairment Loss
 
The Company reviews intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Product sales of some of our mass market product lines had been declining for many years and represent a very small portion of our net sales. In 2017, the Company set in motion a plan to discontinue several of these product lines over the next few years and as a result, recorded an impairment loss of $2.1 million as of December 31, 2017. The Company also increased its inventory obsolescence reserves by $0.5 million as of December 31, 2017, to adjust to net realizable value the inventory of the product lines to be discontinued.
Settlement with French Tax Authorities
 
As previously reported, the French Tax Authorities examined the 2012 tax return of Interparfums SA. The main issues challenged by the French Tax Authorities related to the commission rate and royalty rate paid to Interparfums Singapore Pte. and Interparfums (Suisse) SARL, respectively. Due to the subjective nature of the issues involved, in April 2016, Interparfums SA reached an agreement in principle to settle the entire matter with the French Tax Authorities. The settlement required Interparfums SA to pay a tax assessment of $1.9 million covering the issues for not only the 2012 tax year, but also covering the issues for the tax years ended 2013 through 2015. The settlement, which was finalized by the French Tax Authorities in the first quarter of 2017, was accrued as of December 31, 2016.

By maintaining a strong advertising and marketing commitment to Anna Sui over many years, we were rewarded as the Chinese economy improved. We also took advantage of the improving economy with a major new product launch Fantasia by Anna Sui, with distribution concentrated across Asia. In addition, the brand’s growing popularity in other Asian countries contributed to the upturn that began in 2017.

Bella Blanca, a new Oscar de la Renta scent, debuted in early 2018, and Bella Rosa is scheduled for a 2019 debut.
 
Oscar de la Renta is one of the world’s leading luxury goods firms. The New York-based company was established in 1965, and encompasses a full line of women’s accessories, bridal, childrenswear, fragrance, beauty and home goods, in addition to its internationally renowned signature women’s ready to wear collection. Oscar de la Renta products are sold globally in fine department and specialty stores, www.oscardelarenta.com and through wholesale channels.

Paul Smith— In May 2017, the Company renewed its license agreement for an additional four years with Paul Smith for the creation, development, and distribution of fragrance products through December 2021, without any material changes in terms and conditions. Our initial 12-year license agreement with Paul Smith was signed in 1998, and had previously been extended through December 31, 2017.
 
Paul Smith is an internationally renowned British designer who creates fashion with a clear identity. Paul Smith has a modern style which combines elegance, inventiveness and a sense of humor and enjoys a loyal following, especially in the UK and Japan. Fragrances include: Paul Smith, Paul Smith Extrême, and Paul Smith Rose. In 2018, Paul Smith Hello You, made its debut.
 
Repetto— In December 2011, we entered into a 13-year exclusive worldwide license agreement to create, produce and distribute fragrances under the Repetto brand.
 
Created in 1947 by Rose Repetto at the request of her son, dancer and choreographer Roland Petit, Repetto is today a legendary name in the world of dance. For a number of years, it has developed timeless and must-have collections with a fully modernized signature style ranging from dance shoes, ballet slippers, flat shoes, and sandals to more recently handbags and high-end accessories.
 
With Repetto boutiques in several countries throughout the world, the brand has branched out into Asia, notably China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand, South Korea and Japan with a mix of cross-generational appeal and French chic. Our first Repetto fragrance line was launched in 2013 and a floral scent was added in 2015. Despite this brand’s success with footwear, handbags and high-end accessories, fragrance sales have been modest. A new scent, Dance with Repetto debuted in the first quarter of 2018.
 
Rochas— In May 2015, we acquired the Rochas brand from The Procter & Gamble Company. Founded by Marcel Rochas in 1925, the brand began as a fashion house and expanded into perfumery in the 1950s under Hélène Rochas’ direction. This transaction included all brand names and registered trademarks for Rochas (Femme, Madame, Eau de Rochas, etc.), mainly for fragrance, cosmetics and fashion.
 
This acquisition opened a new page in the Company’s history by integrating for the first time both fragrances and fashion, allowing us to apply a global approach to managing a fragrance brand with complete freedom in terms of creativity and aesthetic choices. At the same time, we enjoy a very high degree of visibility establishing a position of even greater preeminence for Rochas in the luxury goods universe. Rochas brand sales currently include approximately $2.5 million of royalties generated by the fashion and accessory business via its portfolio of license agreements. Our first new fragrance for Rochas, Mademoiselle Rochas, had a successful launch that began in the first quarter of 2017 in its traditional markets of France and Spain. In 2018, we continued the international rollout of Mademoiselle Rochas in additional markets, debuted flankers for Eau de Rochas and Mademoiselle Rochas and in late 2018, we launched our first new men’s line, Rochas Moustache. We also have a new men’s line under development for 2020.

S.T. Dupont— In June 1997, we signed an exclusive worldwide license agreement with S.T. Dupont for the creation, manufacture and distribution of S.T. Dupont fragrances. In 2011, the agreement was renewed through December 31, 2016, and in September 2016 was renewed again through December 31, 2019, without any material changes in terms and conditions. S.T. Dupont is a French luxury goods house founded in 1872, which is known for its fine writing instruments, lighters and leather goods. S.T. Dupont fragrances include: S.T. Dupont Classic, S.T. Dupont Essence Pure, S.T. Dupont Collection and Be Exceptional (launched in September 2018).
 
Van Cleef & Arpels— In May 2018, the Company renewed its license agreement for an additional six years with Van Cleef & Arpels for the creation, development, and distribution of fragrance products through December 2024. Our initial 12-year license agreement with Van Cleef & Arpels was signed in 2006.
 
Van Cleef & Arpels fragrances in current distribution include: First and Collection Extraordinaire. Sales of the Collection Extraordinaire line have experienced continued growth since its debut. We continue to annually introduce new additions to the Van Cleef & Arpels Collection Extraordinaire assortment.
 
Business Strategy 
 
Focus on prestige beauty brands. Prestige beauty brands are expected to contribute significantly to our growth. We focus on developing and launching quality fragrances utilizing internationally renowned brand names. By identifying and concentrating in the most receptive market segments and territories where our brands are known, and executing highly targeted launches that capture the essence of the brand, we have had a history of successful launches. Certain fashion designers and other licensors choose us as a partner, because our Company’s size enables us to work more closely with them in the product development process as well as our successful track record.
 
Grow portfolio brands through new product development and marketing. We grow through the creation of fragrance family extensions within the existing brands in our portfolio. Every year or two, we create a new family of fragrances for each brand in our portfolio. We frequently introduce seasonal and limited edition fragrances as well. With new introductions, we leverage our ability and experience to gauge trends in the market and further leverage the brand name into different product families in order to maximize sales and profit potential. We have had success in introducing new fragrance families (sub-brands, flanker brands or flankers) within our brand franchises. Furthermore, we promote the performance of our prestige fragrance operations through knowledge of the market, detailed analysis of the image and potential of each brand name, and a highly professional approach to international distribution channels.

Continue to add new brands to our portfolio, through new licenses or acquisitions. Prestige brands are the core of our business and we intend to add new prestige beauty brands to our portfolio. Over the past 25 years, we have built our portfolio of well-known prestige brands through acquisitions and new license agreements. We intend to further build on our success in prestige fragrances and pursue new licenses and acquire new brands to strengthen our position in the prestige beauty market. To that end, in 2017, we extended our Jimmy Choo license through December 31, 2031 and our Paul Smith license until December 2021. In 2018, we signed new license agreements with GUESS?, Inc., Graff and Lily Aldridge and extended our license with Van Cleef & Arpels. As of December 31, 2018, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $261 million, which we believe should assist us in entering new brand licenses or out-right acquisitions. We identify prestige brands that can be developed and marketed into a full and varied product families and, with our technical knowledge and practical experience gained over time, take licensed brand names through all phases of concept, development, manufacturing, marketing and distribution.
 
Expand existing portfolio into new categories. We selectively broaden our product offering beyond the fragrance category and offer other fragrance related products and personal care products under some of our existing brands. We believe such product offerings meet customer needs and further strengthen customer loyalty.
 
Continue to build global distribution footprint. Our business is a global business and we intend to continue to build our global distribution footprint. In order to adapt to changes in the environment and our business, in addition to our arrangements with third party distributors globally, we are operating distribution subsidiaries or divisions in the major markets of the United States, France, Italy and Spain for distribution of prestige fragrances. We may look into future joint arrangements or acquire distribution companies within other key markets to distribute certain of our prestige brands. While building a global distribution footprint is part of our long-term strategy, we may need to make certain decisions based on the short-term needs of the business. We believe that in certain markets, vertical integration of our distribution network may be one of the keys to future growth of our Company, and ownership of such distribution should enable us to better serve our customers’ needs in local markets and adapt more quickly as situations may determine.

Suppliers’ accounts for our European operations are primarily settled in euro and for our United States operations, suppliers’ accounts are primarily settled in U.S. dollars. For our European operations components for our prestige fragrances are purchased from many suppliers around the world and are primarily manufactured in France. For United States operations, components for our prestige fragrances are sourced from many suppliers around the world and are primarily manufactured in the United States.
 
Marketing and Distribution
 
Our products are distributed in over 100 countries around the world through a selective distribution network. For our international distribution, we either contract with independent distribution companies specializing in luxury goods or distribute prestige products through our distribution subsidiaries. In each country, we designate anywhere from one to three distributors on an exclusive basis for one or more of our name brands. We also distribute our products through a variety of duty free operators, such as airports and airlines and select vacation destinations.

As our business is a global one, we intend to continue to build our global distribution footprint. For distribution of brands within our European based operations we operate through our distribution subsidiaries or divisions in the major markets of the United States, France, Italy and Spain, in addition to our arrangements with third party distributors globally. Our third party distributors vary in size depending on the number of competing brands they represent. This extensive and diverse network together with our own distribution subsidiaries provides us with a significant presence in over 100 countries around the world.
 
Over 45% of our European based prestige fragrance net sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. We address certain financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments.  We primarily enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates. 
 
The business of our European operations has become increasingly seasonal due to the timing of shipments by our distribution subsidiaries and divisions to their customers, which are weighted to the second half of the year.
 
For our United States operations, we distribute product to retailers and distributors in the United States as well as internationally, including duty free and other travel-related retailers. We utilize our in-house sales team to reach our third party distributors and customers outside the United States. In addition, the business of our United States operations has become increasingly seasonal as shipments are weighted toward the second half of the year.
 
Competition
 
The market for prestige fragrance products is highly competitive and sensitive to changing preferences and demands. The prestige fragrance industry is highly concentrated around certain major players with resources far greater than ours. We compete with an original strategy, regular and methodical development of quality fragrances for a growing portfolio of internationally renowned brand names.
 Inventory
 
We purchase raw materials and component parts from suppliers based on internal estimates of anticipated need for finished goods, which enables us to meet production requirements for finished goods. We generally deliver product to customers within 72 hours of the receipt of their orders. Our business is not capital intensive, and it is important to note that we do not own manufacturing facilities. We act as a general contractor and source our needed components from our suppliers. These components are received at one of our distribution centers and then, based upon production needs, the components are sent to one of several third party fillers which manufacture the finished product for us and then deliver them to one of our distribution centers.

Product Liability
 
Our United States operations maintain product liability coverage in an amount of $10.0 million, and our European operations maintain product liability coverage in an amount of €23.0 million (approximately $26 million). Based upon our experience, we believe this coverage is adequate and covers substantially all of the exposure we may have with respect to our products. We have never been the subject of any material product liability claims. 
Government Regulation
 
A fragrance is defined as a “cosmetic” under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act. A fragrance must comply with the labeling requirements of this FDC Act as well as the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act and its regulations. Some of our color cosmetic products may contain menthol and are also classified as a “drug”. Under U.S. law, a product may be classified as both a cosmetic and a drug. Additional regulatory requirements for products which are “drugs” include additional labeling requirements, registration of the manufacturer and the semi-annual update of a drug list. In addition, various jurisdictions prohibit the use of certain ingredients in fragrances and cosmetics.
 
Our fragrances are subject to the approval of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms as a result of the use of specially denatured alcohol. So far we have not experienced any difficulties in obtaining the required approvals.
 
Our fragrance products that are manufactured or sold in Europe are subject to certain regulatory requirements of the European Union, such as Cosmetic Directive 76/768/CEE and Regulation number 1223/2009 on cosmetic products, but as of the date of this report, we have not experienced any material difficulties in complying with such requirements.
 
Trademarks
 
The market for our products depends to a significant extent upon the value associated with our trademarks and brand names. We have licenses or other rights to use, or own, the material trademark and brand name rights used in connection with the packaging, marketing and distribution of our major products both in the United States and in other countries where such products are principally sold. Therefore, trademark and brand name protection is important to our business. Although most of the brand names we license, use or own are registered in the United States and in certain foreign countries in which we operate, we may not be successful in asserting trademark or brand name protection. In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. The costs required to protect our trademarks and brand names may be substantial.
