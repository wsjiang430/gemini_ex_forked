Company Overview 
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel ribonucleic acid (RNA)-modulating drug candidates (designed to be eukaryotic ribosomal selective glycosides (ERSG)) that are formulated to treat rare and ultra-rare premature stop codon diseases. Premature stop codons are point mutations that disrupt the stability of the impacted messenger RNA (mRNA) and the protein synthesis from that mRNA. As a consequence, patients with premature stop codon diseases have reduced levels of, or no, protein from a gene whose product performs an essential function. This type of mutation accounts for some of the most severe phenotypes across genetic diseases. Nonsense mutations have been identified in over 1,800 rare and ultra-rare diseases.  Read-through therapeutic development is focused on increasing mRNA stability and enabling functional protein synthesis. As opposed to a typical gene therapy approach of targeting a single, unique mutation in a target disease, this small molecule strategy enables targeting an entire class of mutations across the rare disease landscape. Our small molecule approach has the potential to address a range of different premature stop codons in a single gene since our ERSG are targeted to the ribosomes. ELX-02, our lead investigational drug product candidate, is a small molecule designed to restore production of full-length functional proteins. ELX-02, is in the early stages of clinical development for systemic administration for cystic fibrosis and cystinosis. ELX-02 is an investigational drug that has not been approved by any global regulatory body. In addition, we recently announced a new program studying intravitreal administration of ERSG compounds for rare inherited retinal disorders with a focus on Usher Syndrome.  Our preclinical candidate pool consists of a library of 170 novel ERSG drug candidates identified based on read-through potential and cytoplasmic ribosomal selectivity.   
 From the outset, our research and development strategy targets rare or ultra-rare diseases where: a high unmet medical need exists, an identified nonsense mutation-bearing patient population is established, preclinical read-through can be established in predictive personalized medicine models, a definable path through Orphan Drug development, regulatory approval, patient access and commercialization is identifiable. We believe patient advocacy to be an important element of patient focused drug development and seek opportunities to collaborate with patient advocacy groups throughout the discovery and development process. Our current clinical focus for our lead investigational drug product candidate, ELX-02, is Cystic Fibrosis where we expect to complete our multiple ascending dose (“MAD”) study in the first half of 2019 and report top line results from our Phase 2 clinical trial in the second half of 2019. We have participated in the North American Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) CFTR Translational Read-through Workshop and are engaged with CFF on extending our Cystic Fibrosis clinical studies to the United States. In 2018, the European Cystic Fibrosis Society Clinical Trial Network assigned a “high priority” rating to our Phase 2 program.  We have recently initiated a new program studying inherited retinal disease and are conducting IND enabling studies for several ERSG compounds from our library. We entered into a multiyear partnership with the Foundation Fighting Blindness (FFB) to support the inherited retinal degenerative disease registry and educational programs. We presented as part of the FFB “Investing in Cures” 2019 meeting and believe that the ongoing R&D consultation and support provided by the FFB will accelerate our development programs that seek to support patients with ocular disease and high unmet medical need.   
 We intend to be the global leader in the application of the science of translational read-through and the associated pathway of nonsense mediated decay (NMD). We believe that expanding our expertise across these basic science areas of mRNA regulation, ribosomal function, and protein translation forms a solid foundation to support our discovery and development activities. Our ERSG compounds modulate the activity of the ribosome, a complex of RNAs and proteins, and therefore, a ribonucleoprotein, responsible for protein production, a process also known as translation. These novel small molecule ERSG compounds are designed to allow the ribosome to read-through a nonsense mutation in mRNA (which is transcribed from the DNA sequence), to restore the translation process to produce full-length, functional proteins and increase the amount of mRNA that would otherwise be degraded as part of a phenomenon called nonsense mediated mRNA decay. As our ERSG compounds target the general mechanism for protein production in the cell, we believe they have the potential to treat hundreds of genetic diseases where nonsense mutations have impaired gene function. Since nonsense mutations may occur at different positions within a given gene, a potential advantage of the small molecule ERSG approach is being able to use one molecule to address a range of mutations within a given disease state. Our subcutaneously injected ERSG molecules have the potential to be self-administered for systemic disease and to be active at most tissue locations across the body. 
 We believe that our library of related novel small molecules holds the potential to be disease-modifying therapies that may change the course of hundreds of genetic diseases and improve the lives of patients. Our early preclinical data in animal models of nonsense mutations suggests that drug product candidates from our read-through compound library may have potential beneficial effects for each of the following diseases: cystic fibrosis, cystinosis, a variety of inherited retinal diseases, mucopolysaccharidosis type 1, Duchenne muscular dystrophy and 
 1


Rett syndrome, and have demonstrated the potential for beneficial effects in multiple organs such as the brain, eye, kidney, muscles and others. Of the 170 novel compounds in the ERSG Library, approximately 30 compounds have been selected, based on read-through activity, for continued preclinical research and we anticipate additional compounds advancing toward IND filings. 
 Currently our lead program, ELX-02, is focused on development for cystic fibrosis and cystinosis patients with diagnosed nonsense mutations. Our clinical trial application (“CTA”) has been approved by the Federal Agency for Medicines and Health Products (the “FAMHP”) in Brussels and our IND submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) is open. Our Phase 2 program has been given a “high priority” ranking by the European Cystic Fibrosis Society Clinical Trial Network. We expect to initiate Phase 2 studies in cystic fibrosis and cystinosis following completion of our ongoing Phase 1b MAD study in the first half and to report top line Phase 2 data in the second half of 2019. 
 As part of our clinical program, we have completed a Phase 1 single ascending dose (“SAD”) study in a total of 60 healthy volunteers at sites in Israel (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02807961) and Belgium (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03292302). The results of the SAD study were published in the Journal of Clinical Pharmacology in January 2019. Our MAD study is being conducted in Belgium (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03309605). We have initiated the 6th cohort of the MAD study and expect to complete the final cohort in the U.S. in the first half of this year.
 In 2018, we initiated a new program studying inherited retinal disorders with a focus on Usher Syndrome by conducting pre-IND enabling studies on several compounds from our library. We expect to advance one or more compounds into development for intravitreal administration. 
 We believe there is a significant unmet medical need in the treatment of cystic fibrosis patients carrying nonsense mutations on one or both alleles of the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (“CFTR”) gene. Cystic fibrosis is the most prevalent genetic disease in the western world and there are no currently approved therapies that target the impairment associated with Class 1 CFTR mutations. We believe that nonsense mutations may impact a similar proportion of patients diagnosed with cystinosis. There are no currently approved therapeutics that target the nonsense mutation mediated impairment of cystinosin, the cystine-selective transport channel in the lysosomal membrane that is attributed as the cause for the accumulation of cystine in this disease state. Given the high proportion of pediatric patients in each of these rare orphan diseases we intend to apply for relevant Orphan Drug incentives in the US and Europe, including the Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher in the U.S. 
 Currently, the European Medicines Agency (the “EMA”) has designated ELX-02 as an orphan medicine for the treatment of cystic fibrosis and mucopolysaccharidosis type I (“MPS I”), and the FDA has granted orphan drug designation to ELX-02 for the treatment of cystinosis, MPS I, and Rett Syndrome. 
 We hold worldwide development and commercialization rights to ELX-02 and other novel compounds in our read-through library, for all indications, in all territories, under a license from the Technion Research and Development Foundation Ltd. (“TRDF”). Professor Timor Baasov, the inventor of our compounds, has served as our senior consultant since our incorporation. 
 Our Technology 
 Nonsense mutations, also known as premature termination or stop codons, are single point mutations within the DNA sequence which are either inherited or acquired that result in the premature termination of the translational process leading to truncated or absent proteins. Nonsense mutations are involved in a large number of genetic diseases such as cystic fibrosis, cystinosis, primary ciliary dyskinesia, advance polycystic kidney disease, and an estimated 300 inherited retinal diseases, including Usher Syndrome. According to the Human Gene Mutation Database (http://www.hgmd.cf.ac.uk/ac/index.php), nonsense mutations account for approximately twelve percent (12%) of patients with a given genetic disease. The disease phenotypes caused by nonsense mutations are frequently more severe than those caused by other kinds of mutations because these mutations often lead to a complete loss of protein production or function. In general, these diseases do not have specific therapies beyond symptomatic and palliative interventions. 
 In eukaryotic cells, the cytoplasmic ribosome is responsible for the production of proteins by a process called translation. As part of the translation process, the genetic information stored in DNA is transcribed to mRNA to specify the sequence of amino acids, the building blocks of protein, required to produce a functional product. The mRNA is decoded by a complex known as the ribosome in the cytoplasm of the cell. The ribosome slides along the 
 2


mRNA and matches three nucleotide stretches, referred to as a codon, with a corresponding aminoacyl transfer RNA (a-tRNA) which carry the correct amino acid to add onto the growing protein chain.
Normal translation termination in eukaryotic cells occurs when a natural (canonical) termination codon enters the ribosomal decoding region. The ribosome pauses at these special termination sequences, since there are no complementary a-tRNA for these codons. A complex of termination factors, including eRF1 and eRF3 will next bind to the ribosome and initiate the release of the newly synthesized protein.
 When a nonsense mutation occurs, a single DNA nucleotide is substituted for the typical version, changing a codon for an amino acid into a stop codon. For example, a tryptophan “TGG” codon may be changed to read “TGA” or “TAG”, either of which would result in a premature termination signal for the protein. While non-functional, truncated proteins can result from this type of mutation, more often the protein product is unstable and degraded. Since most genes have two copies (referred to as alleles) within the genome, a nonsense mutation on a single copy can be compensated if the other copy still codes for a healthy protein. However, when mutations occur on both alleles, disease may occur. The two mutations can be the same mutation (homozygous) or two different disease-causing mutations (heterozygous).  
 Cells have a system to detect nonsense mutation bearing mRNA copies and remove them from the cell. This process is called nonsense mediated mRNA decay. During the first round of translation the ribosome removes proteins that are found along the newly made mRNA at regions called exon-exon borders. These regions are remnants of a splicing process that occurs in the nucleus while the mRNA is being transcribed. If a stop codon is found by the ribosome during this first round of translation in a location before the last of these exon-exon junction protein complexes, the mRNA is targeted for degradation. Therefore, nonsense mutations result in a double hit for the gene, unstable mRNA and reduced functional protein (shown in Figure 1 below).    

Figure 1: Nonsense Mutations Cause Unstable mRNA and Reduced Functional Protein 
 
Read-through of nonsense mutations is a naturally occurring process that can be attributed to the redundancy “wobble” in the three-nucleotide codon structure. Native read-through occurs in up to 1% of instances in which a ribosome pauses at a stop codon. During read-through, either the typical healthy or a near-cognate substitute tRNA competes out the termination factor complex to enable the insertion of an amino acid and continuation of translation. By directly binding to the ribosome decoding region, ELX-02 enhances the likelihood of this process by increasing the probability of a tRNA to out-compete the termination complex. As read-through allows the ribosome to proceed with translation through the premature stop, a reduction in nonsense mediated decay and stabilization of the mRNA pool is an additional expected outcome of this process (shown in Figure 2 below). Indeed, ELX-02 is found to increase both the mRNA and functional protein across multiple nonsense mutations. Beyond ELX-02, multiple compounds within our ERSG library demonstrate results consistent with this mechanism of action.

We believe that the segment of cystic fibrosis, cystinosis, and inherited retinal disease patients with diagnosed nonsense mutations on one or both alleles represents a high unmet medical need as there are currently no approved therapeutics targeting the impairment caused by these mutations. There are existing in vitro assays, animal models and/or biomarker screens that have been demonstrated to be useful in assessing the potential therapeutic benefit of development compounds for these disease states. The design of clinical trials and the endpoints for measuring clinical benefit have been established for the currently approved therapeutics for these disorders. We believe these to be attractive development targets based on the potential use of these precedents to de-risk the program. 
 We believe that our library of related novel small molecules hold the potential to be disease-modifying therapies that may change the course of hundreds of genetic diseases and improve the lives of patients. Our early preclinical data in animal models of nonsense mutations suggest that drug product candidates from our read-through compound library may have potential beneficial effects for each of the following diseases: cystic fibrosis, cystinosis, a variety of inherited retinal disorders, mucopolysaccharidosis type 1, Duchenne muscular dystrophy and Rett syndrome, and have demonstrated the potential for beneficial effects in multiple organs such as the lung, eye, kidney, muscles and others. We believe that additional molecules from our ERSG library have the potential to demonstrate a sufficient activity profile to become drug product candidates and we are conducting ongoing preclinical evaluation of these molecules.
Current Data Indicating the Mechanism of Action of ELX-02 
 ELX-02 is a novel eukaryotic ribosomal selective glycoside (ERSG) with increased selectivity for the eukaryotic ribosome. Due to the markedly decreased affinity for the prokaryotic and mitochondrial ribosomes ERSG compounds have little of the antibiotic activity associated with aminoglycosides. Aminoglycosides, such as gentamicin, are potent antibiotics that bind with high affinity to the decoding site in the prokaryotic ribosome and inhibit protein translation in bacteria. The early observations of eukaryotic read-through activity were made in patients treated with aminoglycosides due to bacterial infections. In eukaryotic cells, aminoglycosides may induce a conformational change that reduces the codon-anticodon recognition, enhancing the ability of an a-tRNA to compete with the release factor complex for binding to the premature termination codon and increasing the probability that translational read-through of premature termination codons occurs. However, despite the promising clinical observations of read-through activity, aminoglycoside use as a read-through therapy is restricted since aminoglycosides may cause damage to the kidney and ear after prolonged administration. The effect of aminoglycosides on the hair cells of the ear and the proximal tubular cells of the kidney may be attributed, in part, to the inhibition of mitochondrial protein production in these cells.   Because ERSGs are selective for the eukaryotic cytoplasmic ribosome and have markedly decreased affinity for the mitochondrial ribosome, ERSGs are anticipated to show a safety and tolerability profile acceptable for chronic use. We believe that compounds with increased read-through activity and a reduced affinity for the mitochondrial ribosome may demonstrate an acceptable profile for chronic use. When compared in laboratory tests to gentamicin, a classic aminoglycoside, ELX-02 thus far has shown a 100-fold lower antibacterial activity and nine-fold higher read-through activity for nonsense mutations; this has been attributed to higher selectivity towards the cytoplasmic eukaryotic ribosome. We believe that the library of ERSG compounds has the potential to show improvements in read-through activity with a reduced potential for impairment of the mitochondrial ribosome may have an improved safety profile.

ERSGs with improved selectivity for the eukaryotic cytoplasmic ribosome are expected to demonstrate improved rates of full-length protein translation and a reduction in triggered nonsense mediated decay. By binding to the cytoplasmic ribosome and reducing ribosomal stalling, ERSGs are expected to demonstrate increases in mRNA and full-length protein production. Therefore, the Eloxx read-through activity screening program has used these endpoints to evaluate our compound library portfolio. 
 Using a well-characterized cell line harboring a nonsense mutation, Eloxx is evaluating its compound library for both read-through mediated protein restoration and stabilization of mRNA. While plasmid-based evaluations offer a convenient methodology to evaluate across disease related mutations, this approach is limited to demonstrating the potential for protein restoration alone. Therefore, Eloxx has focused on using our molecules to detect read-through of a native mutation, which is subject to nonsense mediated decay, in order to better model an actual disease setting. In this cell line, the protein of interest and its mRNA are significantly reduced. We evaluated a subset of our compounds in the cell by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), western blot protein analysis and for proper localization of the restored protein by immunofluorescence. Consistent with our overall hypothesis, we have found that molecules in our library significantly increase both the mRNA (dose-dependent increases of 30-fold over vehicle control) and protein of interest (increased normalized full-length protein 4.7-fold over vehicle control) as well as the proteins proper sub-cellular localization. In addition to supporting our overall mechanism of action hypothesis, these studies have enabled Eloxx to develop a robust (z’ factor = 0.88), high-throughput assay within this system to further evaluate compound-mediated read-through across our library.
 Our mechanism of action is further supported within disease-relevant model systems, further detailed below. In vitro models of cystinosis and CF demonstrate dose-dependent increases in target mRNA as well as significant increases in functional protein. Unlike previous read-through programs reported by other groups, ELX compounds have consistently demonstrated activity against both of these hallmark consequences of nonsense mutations. We believe this understanding of ELX compound activity has enabled our clinical development programs to move forward with confidence. 
 Cystic Fibrosis 
 Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most prevalent genetic disease in the western world and affects an estimated 70,000 to 100,000 patients worldwide, with the vast majority of affected individuals in the United States (“U.S.”), Canada, Europe and Australia. CF is the most common fatal inherited disease in Caucasians. The incidence of CF varies across the globe ranging between one in 3,500 births in the U.S. and one in 2,000 to 3,000 births in Europe, and Australia. 
 Approximately 13% of the CF patients carry a nonsense mutation on the CFTR gene. CF is a progressive disease caused by a deficiency in CFTR activity with insufficient ionic transconductance in the cell membrane, which, in turn, leads to the accumulation of thick mucus in vital organs, particularly the lungs, pancreas and gastrointestinal tract. As a result, CF patients experience respiratory infections, chronic lung inflammation, and poor absorption of nutrients as well as many other conditions, and, in most cases, progressive respiratory failure. Although the life expectancy of CF patients has improved, the median age of death in the U.S. in 2014 was only 29 years, with a vast majority of such deaths resulting from respiratory failure. 
 Cystic Fibrosis occurs at a rate of 1 in 2,500–6,000 newborns, depending on the region and ethnic origin. Patients with CF caused by nonsense mutations have some of the most severe forms of the disease and, other than palliative therapies, no treatment currently exists for them.  Mutations in the gene that encodes CFTR protein, which play a critical role in regulating the viscosity of the mucus layer that lines human organs, cause CF. The CFTR protein forms an ion channel that regulates the flow of ions in and out of the cells of vital organs such as the lungs, pancreas and gastrointestinal tract. We refer to this as ion flow. When CFTR protein expels the ions, osmosis draws water out of the cell and hydrates the cell surface. Through regulation of the location of the ions across the cell membrane, the amount of salts in the fluid both inside and outside the cell remains balanced. 
 In CF patients, the CFTR gene is defective, and as a result, CF patients lack the functional CFTR protein ion channel necessary to regulate ion flow. An altered ion concentration gradient between the inside and the outside of the cell reduces the amount of water molecules outside the cell, causing the accumulation of thick mucus on the epithelial surface as shown below in Figure 3. 
 5



Figure 3: Ion Flow in Normal CFTR Protein Compared to Mutant CFTR Protein 
 
The deficiency in CFTR protein activity in CF patients is particularly problematic in the lungs, where the build-up of thick mucus obstructs airflow and impairs proper immune response, which leads to chronic infection and persistent inflammation. In the pancreas and the gastrointestinal tract, the build-up of mucus prevents the release of digestive enzymes that help the body break down food and impairs the absorption of nutrients, resulting in poor growth and development. 
Inherited Retinal Diseases
 Inherited retinal disorders (also called inherited retinal dystrophies, or IRDs) are a group of rare eye disorders caused by inherited gene mutations which can result in vision loss or blindness. Some inherited retinal diseases, such as Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP), Usher Syndrome, or Choroideremia (CHM) are associated with a gradual loss of vision, eventually leading to complete blindness. In other conditions such as Leber’s Congenital Amaurosis (LCA), patients may be born with or experience vision loss in infancy or early childhood.
 A specific IRD, Usher Syndrome, is the most common genetic disorder involving hearing and vision abnormalities, and is the most common cause of deafness-blindness with visual impairment due to photoreceptor degeneration. Three types of Usher Syndrome have been identified based on genetic causes, severity of hearing loss and age of onset. USH1 patients are typically born with severe hearing loss and are diagnosed early in life with vision problems beginning at or before age of 10 years. USH2 patients are characterized by progressive hearing loss from birth, with onset of vision loss at adolescence and often are not diagnosed until their early 20s. In USH3, vision loss develops within the second decade of life. In most countries, USH1 accounts for one-third of all patients with USH2 accounting for about two-thirds of all USH patients. US Prevalence is estimated at approximately 6.2 thousand Type 1 and approximately 8.9 thousand Type 2 patients. It is estimated that there are over 4,000 patients in North America with nonsense forms of Usher Syndrome. Effective read-through has been demonstrated in vitro for USH2A (USH2), PCDH15 (USH1) and USH1C (USH1) NS mutations. USH2A nonsense variants are estimated to affect more than 2,500 patients in the US alone. There are four usher splice site variants, with the largest having over 70 exons, potentially limiting gene therapy development due to vector size limitations.
 
Another IRD, Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP), causes night blindness in adolescence and gradual visual field loss in adulthood (most patients are legally blind by age 40). RP can occur as a localized disorder with visual impairment only, or as part of a broader syndrome (e.g., Usher Syndrome). More than 50 different causative genes have been identified and the US incidence is estimated at approximately 67 thousand patients. Given this high genetic heterogeneity even in nonsense mediated disease (no single gene comprises more than 10% of nonsense RP cases), there is a significant need to identify broader cross-gene therapies.  Read-through proof of principle has been shown via in vitro models of USH2A RHO, MERTK, and RP2 nonsense mutation variants, with 5-20% rescue of protein function demonstrated. 
 In December 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Spark Therapeutics LuxturnaÒ as the first gene therapy for retinal dystrophy caused by mutations in the RPE65 gene and targeting approximately 1000-2,000 patients with confirmed biallelic RPE65 mutation-associated retinal dystrophy. While many gene therapies focus on specific inherited retinal diseases, many target genes share related ocular disease pathways suggesting a broader gene-agnostic approach may provide greater treatment opportunities. IRDs such as Usher Syndrome and

Retinitis Pigmentosa represents a favorable target for readthrough therapeutics given the high unmet need, the opportunity to target multiple nonsense mutations across a variety of genes, and offer potential treatment for patient subsets not addressed by gene therapy due to gene size or small patient subsets. 
 Cystinosis 
 Cystinosis is an ultra-rare autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease. Mutations in the CTNS gene (cystinosin), on the short arm of chromosome 17 (17p13), cause the primary defect in the disease. Cystinosin is a ubiquitous cystine-selective transport channel in the lysosomal membrane. Loss-of-function mutations prevent cystine efflux from the lysosome, causing massive accumulation of intra-lysosomal cystine in tissues throughout the body, and lead to apoptotic cell death, impaired physiology and end organ damage. 
 Affected children may appear fairly well until the age of 4-6 months, when progressive dysfunction and atrophy of the proximal renal tubule cause Fanconi syndrome and failure to thrive. By 10-12 years of age, dialysis or kidney transplantation is required to treat end-stage renal disease. Although the renal allograft is spared, lifespan is diminished by the inexorable dysfunction of other organs. 
 The most common nonsense mutation in the CTNS gene is W138X which has an overall incidence rate of 1 in every 62,500 live births in Quebec, Canada. 
 Current treatment includes cysteamine bitartrate (Cystagon® or Procysbi®). Cystagon was approved in the U.S. and Europe in 1994 and Procysbi was approved in the U.S. and Europe in 2013. Both therapies delay but do not cure the condition and despite treatment, patients eventually require dialysis and renal transplantation and experience significant morbidity in other organ systems. 
 
Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia
 
Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD) is a genetically heterogeneous disease which is predominantly inherited as an autosomal recessive disorder. PCD is associated with abnormal ciliary function resulting in impaired mucociliary clearance, recurrent /chronic upper and lower respiratory tract infection and male infertility. PCD prevalence is estimated to involve 1:20,000 individuals however, disease symptom variability and low familiarity with PCD likely leads to substantial patient under-diagnosis. PCD patient treatment largely focuses on airway clearance (devices and aerosolized therapies), infection control (anti-microbial therapy), and inflammation control (antibiotic therapy). There have been few randomized trials of PCD treatment to date. 
 More than 30 different genes have been identified to be causative for PCD with approximately 25% of identified gene mutations having nonsense mutations. Cell- based and in vitro studies of aminoglycoside-mediated readthrough in PCD nonsense mutations found positive read-through efficacy in several UGA associated stop codons. PCD is an attractive disease target given the high unmet medical need, positive preclinical read-through data, potential for treatment across multiple genes, high prevalence of nonsense mutations, and lack of disease modifying treatments.
 
Polycystic Kidney Disease 
 
Polycystic Kidney Disease (PKD) is a progressive genetic disorder causing the growth of cysts in the kidneys, reducing kidney function and ultimately leading to kidney failure or end stage renal disease (ESRD). It is found in all races and occurs equally in men and women. The autosomal dominant form of polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common genetic nephropathology accounting for 5%–8% of ESRD. Worldwide, ADPKD affects approximately 4 to 7 million individuals and accounts for 7-15% of patients on renal replacement therapy. In North America and Europe, ADPKD is responsible for 6-10% of ESRD cases. It’s estimated that one per 800-1000 population carries a mutation for this condition. 
 
Approximately 85-90% of patients with ADPKD have the ADPKD1 gene; most of the remaining patients have the ADPKD2 gene.  Estimates suggest over 30% of ADPKD1 mutations are nonsense variants and therefore represent a favorable target for readthrough therapeutics given the large patient population, substantial subset of nonsense mutations, disease severity and limited treatment options.

Other Nonsense Mediated Genetic Disorders
 
Muscular dystrophies are genetic disorders involving progressive muscle wasting and weakness. Duchenne muscular dystrophy (nmDMD) is the most common and one of the most severe types of muscular dystrophy with the average age of death for DMD patients in the mid-twenties. DMD occurs when a mutation in the dystrophin gene prevents the cell from making a functional dystrophin protein. Because the dystrophin gene is located on the X chromosome, DMD occurs almost exclusively in young boys. Genetic tests are available to determine if a patient’s DMD is caused by a nonsense mutation. Based on a publication from Prior, et al. (1995) in the American Journal of Human Genetics, it is estimated that a nonsense mutation is the cause of DMD in approximately 13% of patients. Treatments for DMD include Translarna™ (ataluren), approved in the European Union (“EU”) for the treatment of the underlying cause of nmDMD. EXONDYS 51® (eteplirsen) Injection is also approved in the US for the treatment of DMD patients with exon 51 skipping mutations.
 
Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is a chronic, progressive genetic disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme alpha-L-iduronidase (IDUA). Children with severe MPS I often die in the first decade of life due to respiratory failure, cardiac valvulopathy, and cardiorespiratory problems. The deficiency of the IDUA enzyme leads to the accumulation of a class of molecules called glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). The accumulation of GAGs causes disruption in the movement of molecules inside the cell and leads to the subsequent dysfunction of cells, tissues and organs. Globally, MPS I occurs in about 1 in every 100,000 births for the severe form and 1 in 500,000 for the attenuated form. About 70% of MPS I patients carry one of two nonsense mutations; Q70X and W402X. Estimates suggest that 50%- 80% of all MPS I patients present with the severe versus attenuated form of the disease. MPS I disease-specific treatments include enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).
 
Rett syndrome is a X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder that predominantly affects girls and has a worldwide incidence of 1 in every 10,000-15,000 female births. The condition generally follows normal development in the first 6-18 months of age, followed by a period of regression in language and motor skills including repetitive stereotyped hand movements. Rett Syndrome patients also have numerous comorbidities that are thought to contribute to a shortened lifespan. There is a high unmet medical need in Rett syndrome given no current treatment exists for the underlying cause of the disease. Loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding the transcriptional regulator methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (“Mecp2”) account for most cases of Rett syndrome. Nonsense mutations in the Mecp2 gene account for approximately 30% of Rett syndrome cases. The most prominent nonsense mutations found in Rett syndrome, R168X, R255X, R270X and R294X, are all caused by a change of arginine to the stop codon, UGA. 
 Status of Preclinical Programs 
 
We have completed a comprehensive series of preclinical studies to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacology of ELX-02. In addition, we have verified read-through activity of additional library molecules and identified a set of promising candidate molecules to evaluate across new indications. Finally, we have initiated our preclinical assessment of ELX compound activity in inherited retinal disease, validating read-though activity against several Usher Syndrome mutations and initiating ocular tolerability and IND-enabling studies.
 Safety and Pharmacokinetic Studies of ELX-02 
 A comprehensive toxicology program in accordance with the ICH guideline M3 (R2) was completed for ELX-02 to support clinical studies. 
 In definitive, 28-day, repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs, ELX-02 had little or no effect on body weight, food consumption, clinical signs of toxicity, ophthalmology, cardiovascular parameters, hematology or coagulation parameters. At dose levels higher than those intended for humans, ELX-02 has no cochlear toxicity as evidenced in anatomic and functional hearing studies in 28-day rat studies. We have recently completed 3-month toxicology studies in juvenile rats and in young dogs, as well as chronic toxicology studies in these 2 species for 6- and 9-months, respectively. These studies showed no mortality and no significant in-life toxicity. ELX-02 was not genotoxic in the core battery of in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity assays. Collectively, these results support the human lifetime use of ELX-02. As an aminoglycoside, ELX-02 has poor oral bioavailability but is 100% bioavailable following sub-cutaneous administration. Additionally, ELX-02 does not undergo metabolization and is excreted unchanged almost exclusively via the urine.

Pharmacology Studies of ELX-02 
 We have conducted a series of preliminary studies to demonstrate the primary pharmacodynamics of ELX-02 in several genetic disease indications. We have tested the translational read-through capabilities of ELX-02 in vitro and in vivo, in cells and in animal models of nonsense mutations. 
 We have shown the in vitro read-through activity of ELX-02 in an array of plasmids engineered to contain nonsense mutations of genetic diseases and in cell-based models of CF, cystinosis, Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, MPS 1, and Rett syndrome. 
 In CF, ELX-02 induced about 30% of wild type CFTR levels after 48 h in heterozygous G542/F508del human bronchial epithelial cells. In the G542X transgenic mouse, ELX-02 showed an approximate 5-fold increase in CFTR activity compared to control after twice weekly treatment for four weeks with 60 mg/kg.
 In order to evaluate read-through across a series of CF genotypes, we initiated a program to evaluate restoration of CFTR activity in patient-derived organoids. Organoids are a three-dimensional, multi-cellular in vitro system derived from stem cells isolated from rectal biopsies. When grown suspended in an extracellular matrix substrate, the cells adopt a polarized endothelial spheroid structure. CFTR protein localizes to the apical surface (the inner surface of the sphere) and is capable of driving chloride ions into the inner lumen. When an ion imbalance, relative to the ion concentration surrounding the organoid is present, water is driven into the inner lumen of the organoid as a means to equilibrate the concentration. This action results in the swelling of the organoid, a function measurable by high-content imaging. Similar to measuring CFTR conductivity in other systems, such as human bronchial epithelial cells, CFTR activity is stimulated in the organoid system with forskolin to produce cyclic adenosine monophosphate, a signaling molecule that stimulates CFTR channel activity. Organoids derived from nonsense mutation CF patients lack apparent swelling in this system due to their lack of functional CFTR. As a stem cell derived system, organoids are a renewable model permitting repeat testing from a single patient’s biopsy. Eloxx partners with the Hubrecht Organoid Technology (HUB), a not-for-profit organization founded out of the Hubrecht Institute, KNAW and University Medical Center Utrecht, The Netherlands to evaluate the nonsense-bearing CF patient organoids in its biobank. These studies demonstrate that across the most common CF causing nonsense mutations (G542X, W1282X, R553X, R1162X, R1066C and E60X) ELX-02 significantly increases CFTR function and CFTR mRNA in a dose dependent fashion. ELX-02 mediated CFTR function is observed in both homozygous and complex heterozygous nonsense bearing patient-derived organoids. ELX-02 is the first clinical development candidate molecule to demonstrate activity against these nonsense mutations in the organoid model system. Activity in the organoid swelling assay is dependent on both proper production and localization of functional CFTR protein; therefore, the activity observed with ELX-02 supports that the CFTR protein resulting from read-through of these mutations is both functional and localized to the correct cellular location. CFTR mRNA levels were monitored by NanoString which demonstrated that G542X and W1282X CF organoids have the expected reduction in CFTR mRNA resulting from nonsense mediate decay. ELX-02 increased CFTR mRNA dose-dependently to the range observed in healthy organoids. While approved CF therapies lack efficacy against this type of CF mutation, organoids with responsive mutations (e.g. G551D, F508del) demonstrate activity in the organoid swelling assay in a manner that correlates with clinical responsiveness in informative endpoints such as FEV1 and sweat chloride change. When considering the ELX-02 results with the correlation reports of other approved molecules in this assay, the response mediated by ELX-02 read-through meets or exceeds the activity necessary to significantly improve FEV1 and sweat chloride concentration.    
 In cystinosis, ELX-02 increased read-through of the CTNS W138X mutation by 30-fold in a cell-free plasmid assay system. In primary homozygous W138X fibroblasts, ELX-02 led to a dose-dependent increase in normalized CTNS mRNA levels, consistent with a decrease in nonsense mediated mRNA decay. Functional protein restoration was supported in primary fibroblasts by demonstrating a ELX-02 mediated reduction in cellular cystine levels to wild-type levels. When combined with the standard of care, cysteamine, ELX-02 reduction in cellular cystine levels was additive. These data support that ELX-02 has the potential to impact the primary etiology of this ultra-rare disease. 
 In inherited retinal diseases, a series of academic collaborations have shown that the candidate ELX compounds demonstrate dose-dependent increases in read-through of Usher Syndrome 2A and 1F mutations in a cellular plasmid-based reporter assay; they also show restoration of Usher 1C protein and harmonin. Upcoming studies will confirm these findings. Additionally, Eloxx is evaluating multiple ELX compounds for ocular tolerability, as measured by preservation of the electroretinogram and retinal histology, when delivered by 
 9


intravitreal injection in rabbits. These studies demonstrate ELX compounds to have a favorable tolerability profile in comparison to the reference aminoglycoside, gentamicin. These findings are consistent with our hypothesis that the improved specificity for the eukaryotic cytosolic ribosome over the mitochondrial ribosome will reduce off-target associated toxicities.  
 Ongoing Screening and IND Enabling Studies of Eloxx ERSG Library Compounds
 As part of his research to discover molecules that bind selectively to the eukaryotic ribosome Professor Timor Baasov evaluated over 170 compounds. These compounds are of several structural classes and many were tested for read through activity. A select group was further evaluated in 2018 against specific gene constructs designed to evaluate their potential utility in disease involving the presence of nonsense mutations. In addition to ELX-02, we currently have multiple compounds progressing in IND enabling studies based on data demonstrating positive activity on nonsense mutations in inherited retinal disorders and a favorable profile. We believe that one or more of these preclinical ERSG drug-candidates are potentially suitable for clinical development and we are continuing to conduct pre-IND studies to evaluate their potential.
Status of Clinical Programs 
 We have completed our Phase 1a study and have advanced our Phase 1b study. In support of our planned Phase 2 studies, we have advanced our global health authority interactions and manufacturing activities.
Phase 1 Clinical Studies
 We are completing a Phase 1 program in healthy volunteers that is designed to support studies of ELX-02 in patient populations in any indication caused by nonsense mutations and assess the safety of ELX-02. This initial phase of testing includes a small number of healthy volunteers. The studies assess the effects of ELX-02 on humans and measure bioavailability, excretion, safety and side effects, as well as the pharmacokinetics (what the body does to the drug) with increasing doses. Phase 1 studies include single ascending dose, or Phase 1a, and multiple ascending dose, or Phase 1b, studies. 
 The Phase 1a single ascending dose (“SAD”) study was completed in 2018 and the results were published in the Journal of Clinical Pharmacology in January 2019. The SAD study included five doses of ELX-02 ranging from 0.3 mg/kg to 7.5mg/kg in order to determine the pharmacokinetic profile and safety from single administration. The completed Phase 1a study enrolled healthy volunteers at Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Clinical Research Center (EL‐001 (NCT02807961)) and at SGS Life Sciences Services, Clinical Pharmacology Unit (EL‐006 (NCT03292302). ELX‐02 was shown to be generally well tolerated over the dose range of the SAD studies with no observations of renal toxicity. During the study observations of transient adverse events resulting from ELX-02 administration were mild with the exception of a single moderate auditory adverse effect of interest but of unclear physiological significance and without clinical impact. Overall the results were supportive of continued clinical development.        
 We plan to complete the ongoing Phase 1b multiple ascending dose (MAD) study in healthy volunteers in the first half of 2019. The study has been designed as a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, multiple dose escalating study in healthy male and female subjects. The study has been expanded to include additional cohorts to evaluate lower drug concentrations and/or administration schedule. To date, five cohorts of nine subjects each have been completed and have undergone DSMB review. The sixth cohort has been initiated in Belgium and we intend to complete the seventh, final cohort, at a study site in the U.S.. Subjects have been randomized to receive nine doses of ELX-02 or placebo at a ratio of 2:1 in each cohort. To date, the study has been conducted in Belgium after having undergone review and approval by the FAMHP in Belgium, and by the Institutional Review Board in August 2017 in Antwerp, Belgium. 
 Phase 2 Clinical Studies 
 In January 2018, we held a Pre-CTA regulatory meeting with the FAMHP and submitted the CTA for our Phase 2 study of cystic fibrosis in Belgium. The CTA has been reviewed and approved by FAMHP. Additionally, our Phase 2 program has been given a “high priority” ranking by the European Cystic Fibrosis Society Clinical Trial Network. We are on track to conduct our Phase 2 CF study focusing on patients bearing one or two alleles with the G542X nonsense mutation and report top line data in 2019. The study will enroll no more than 24 patients to 
 10


evaluate multiple doses of ELX-02 for the primary endpoint of safety and the secondary endpoints to include an assessment of sweat chloride and FEV1.
 
In 2018, Eloxx entered into a collaboration with Dr. Paul Goodyer at McGill University as part of the Genome Canada Genomic Applications Partnership Program (GAPP), to conduct clinical trials of ELX-02 for the treatment of cystinosis. During 2018, Eloxx submitted an IND to the FDA for the conduct of Phase 2 studies in cystinosis and the IND is now open. The Phase 2 program as discussed with the FDA will enroll no more than 6 patients to evaluate multiple doses of ELX-02 for the primary endpoint of safety and exploratory endpoints that will include white blood cell cystine levels. In support of the cystinosis program where many patients have impaired renal function, we have initiated a renal impairment safety study that will complete in the first half of 2019.
 Manufacturing Status
 
We have completed the manufacture of the clinical drug product to support our full Phase 2 clinical trial program. We have further identified a commercial manufacturer and are engaged in process development and scale up activities required to support Phase 3 clinical development.
Intellectual Property 
 Patent Portfolio 
 Our licensed and owned patent portfolio includes three families of patents and applications relating to our lead compound ELX-02 (formerly known as NB124) and over 40 other read-through inducing compounds.  Each of these families is described briefly below.
 With regard to ELX-02, our primary composition of matter coverage derives from a first family of patents and applications that we exclusively license through the Research and License Agreement with Technion Research and Development Foundation Ltd. (“TRDF”), dated August 29, 2013.  This family includes claims directed to ELX-02 and other read-through inducing compounds, as well as claims directed to pharmaceutical compositions of the disclosed compounds and methods of using the compounds and compositions to treat genetic disorders associated with premature stop codon mutations including cystic fibrosis, cystinosis, Duchenne’s muscular dystrophy, ataxia-telangiectasia, Hurler syndrome, hemophilia A and B, Usher Syndrome, and Tay-Sachs.  Patents that have issued or which may issue in the future from this family are currently expected to expire in 2031, not including any extensions of term for which we may be eligible that we may be granted.  As of December 31, 2018, this family included issued patents in the U.S., Europe, Canada, Hong Kong, and Japan, and pending applications in the U.S., Europe, Hong Kong, India, Israel and Japan.
 We own two additional families that may provide additional protection for specific uses or methods of manufacturing ELX-02 beyond the current expiration date of the primary composition of matter patents.  The first of these is directed to the use of ELX-02 and other read-through inducing compounds for the treatment of Rett Syndrome.  As of December 31, 2018, this family included pending applications in the U.S., Europe, Canada, Hong Kong, India, Israel and Japan. Any patents issuing from this family are currently expected to expire in 2035, not including any extensions of term for which we may be eligible that we may be granted.  The second is directed to methods for large-scale synthesis of ELX-02 and other read-through inducing compounds.  As of December 31, 2018, this family includes a pending PCT application and a pending application in India.  We currently plan to enter the national phase in the U.S. and other selected jurisdictions worldwide for this family in 2019.  Any patents issuing from these anticipated applications are currently expected to expire in 2038, not including any extensions of term for which we may be eligible that we may be granted.
 Our other three families of licensed and owned patents and applications are directed to additional read-through inducing compounds. The first of these is exclusively licensed under the Research and License Agreement with TRDF, and includes claims directed to ELX-03 (formerly known as NB84) and other compounds, as well as claims directed to pharmaceutical compositions and methods of treating genetic disorders including cystic fibrosis, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, ataxia-telangiectasia, Hurler syndrome, hemophilia A, hemophilia B, Usher Syndrome, and Tay-Sachs.  Patents that have issued or which may issue in the future from this family are currently expected to expire in 2027 and 2028, not including any extensions of term for which we may be eligible that we may be granted.  As of December 31, 2018, this family included issued patents in the U.S., Europe, Canada, India, Israel and Japan, and pending applications in the U.S. and Europe.
 11


The second and third of these families include claims directed to additional read-through inducing compounds and pharmaceutical compositions and uses thereof.  As of December 31, 2018, one of these families included pending applications in the U.S., Europe, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Hong Kong, India, Israel and Japan, while the other included a pending PCT application that we plan to use for national entry in the U.S. and other selected jurisdictions in 2019 or 2020.  Patents that may issue from these families are currently expected to expire in 2036 and 2038, respectively, not including any extensions of term for which we may be eligible that we may be granted.
 Patent Term Extension
 The term of a U.S. patent is 20 years from its earliest effective filing date, assuming all maintenance fees are paid, the patent has not been terminally disclaimed, and the patent has not been invalidated through administrative and/or court proceedings.  The term of foreign patents varies, but is generally also 20 years from the earliest effective filing date.  In certain instances, the term of U.S. and certain foreign patents may be extended.
 In the U.S., patent term may be extended in certain instances by patent term adjustment, or PTA, which compensates for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office (USPTO) during examination of the patent.  We have received PTA for one of our exclusively licensed patents relating to ELX-01 and other related read-through inducing compounds, extending the expiration date of that patent from 2027 to 2028.  However, we do not know whether any PTA will be granted for any of our future patents.
 For pharmaceutical products that have received FDA approval, the term of a U.S. patent covering the approved product, a method of manufacturing the approved product, or an approved method of use of the product may be extended under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act, in certain instances if specific statutory and regulatory requirements are satisfied.  The Hatch-Waxman Act provides for a patent term extension, or PTE, of up to five years as compensation for effective patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process.  PTE is only available for the first approval of a particular product, the total patent term including the restoration period must not exceed 14 years from the date of FDA approval, and only one patent may be extended for a particular regulatory review period.  In Europe, a similar mechanism exists for extending patent term up to five years through the grant of a Supplementary Protection Certificate (SPC) following EMEA approval.  Similar regulatory extensions are available or may be available in the future in other jurisdictions.  If and when ELX-02 or other of our read-through inducing compounds are approved by the FDA, EMEA, or other foreign regulatory authorities, we will apply for these and other patent term extensions on patents covering the approved products, methods of use, or methods of manufacture if the patents are eligible for such extension.  However, we cannot provide any assurance that such extensions will be granted for any of our currently issued or future patents.
 Trade Secrets and Know-How
 With respect to our synthetic-aminoglycosides-based technology platform, we primarily rely on trade secrets and know-how to protect the proprietary nature of our platform. However, trade secrets and know-how can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and contractors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data, know-how and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our consultants, contractors or collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. 
 License Agreements 
 Research and License Agreement with Technion Research and Development Foundation Ltd. 
 On August 29, 2013, we entered into a license agreement with TRDF, which was further amended and addended to reflect, inter alia, the assignment of patents and extension of research periods, with respect to certain technology relating to aminoglycosides and the redesign of aminoglycosides for the treatment of human genetic 
 12


diseases caused by premature stop mutations and further results of the research of the technology, in order to develop and commercialize products based on such technology. The license agreement provides us with an exclusive, worldwide, non-transferrable license, with a right to grant sublicenses, and royalty-bearing licenses to the TRDF inventions, TRDF patent rights, TRDF’s interest in the joint inventions and joint patent rights, and certain materials and research results owned by TRDF, solely with respect to products in the field of prevention, diagnosis or treatment of any human disease or condition therefor. In return for the license we will pay TRDF (i) milestone payments with respect to each licensed product upon the achievement of certain pre-defined goals by us or one of our sublicensees as follows: $100,000 upon first dosing of a patient in Phase II clinical study; $1,000,000 upon first dosing of a patient in pivotal study; $1,000,000 upon first filing on a new drug application (NDA); (ii) certain royalties in the low- to mid- single-digit percentage of all net sales (subject to change in the case of (a) sublicensing to a big pharmaceutical or biotechnology company, or (b) payment of royalties to third parties, or (c) commercialization by a third party of an authorized generic to a licensed product); and (iii) a low- to mid- double-digit percentage of any non-royalty sublicense income. In addition to the milestone payments, we undertook to annually fund the research activities under the license, currently in the estimated annual amount of $0.1 million per year. The license agreement further provides TRDF with an additional pre-emptive right, in force until the first exit event, to invest an amount equal to up to 5% of the amount contemplated to be raised in a proposed investment. TRDF is also entitled, until the closing of an exit event, to appoint an observer to the board under certain restrictions such as confidentiality or conflict of interest. Furthermore, we will reimburse TRDF for all patent filing expenses as of the effective date of the license agreement and for past patent filing expenses in the amount of several hundred thousand New Israeli Shekels upon the occurrence of certain conditions. 
 Under the license agreement, TRDF reserved the right, for itself, the Technion and other not-for-profit research organizations to utilize the technology solely for educational purposes. Furthermore, Professor Bassov, the principal investigator, had ongoing research programs involving covered compounds (as defined in the agreement) that are being funded by the National Institute of Health in the U.S., or the NIH, under sub-awards from the University of Alabama and the University of Michigan and it is possible that such research programs will overlap with the research conducted according to the terms of the agreement. In the case of any such overlap, the work product of such research will be subject to the terms and conditions of such sub-awards, including certain obligations under 35 U.S.C. §§ 200-212 or 37 C.F.R. § 401 et seq. in the case of any TRDF inventions that are also “subject invention” as defined in 35 U.S.C. § 201. 
 The license agreement shall continue in full force and effect on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis until the expiration of all payment obligations for any such licensed product as described above. Upon the expiration, we will have a fully-paid up, worldwide non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable license (with the right to grant sublicenses) to use certain materials and the research results, solely with respect to products in the field of prevention, diagnosis or treatment of any human disease or condition. 
 Manufacturing 
 ELX-02 is manufactured under current Good Manufacturing Practice (“cGMP”) conditions and is formulated as a sterile frozen liquid or lyophilized powder in glass vials. ELX-02 is administered by parenteral subcutaneous (SC) injection after appropriate dilution or reconstitution, as required.
 We do not own or operate manufacturing or distribution facilities for the production of clinical quantities of ELX-02 or for our other preclinical product candidates. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture, packaging, labeling and distribution of clinical supplies of ELX-02 as well as any other candidate that we may develop. 
 We engage separate manufacturers for drug substance and drug product. We have a relationship with a manufacturer that is capable of providing fill and finish services for our clinical product at the current scale. To support later clinical trials, transfer of the manufacturing and release to a manufacturer with higher lot scale capacity will be needed for our clinical product. 
 All of our current drug candidates are organic compounds of low molecular weight. We have selected our lead compounds not only on the basis of their potential efficacy and safety but also for their ease of synthesis and reasonable cost of their starting materials. ELX-02 is manufactured in reliable and reproducible synthetic processes. We currently rely on a single third-party manufacturing source for the production of a key raw material, produced by bacterial fermentation. We do not currently have any agreements with third-party manufacturers for the long-term 
 13


commercial supply of ELX-02 in connection with regulatory approval of ELX-02 or for the fermentation-derived starting material, although we may seek to establish such arrangements in the future. 
 We currently obtain clinical supplies of ELX-02 from third-party manufacturers pursuant to agreements that include specific supply timelines and volume expectations. If a manufacturer should become unavailable to us for any reason, we would seek to obtain supply from another manufacturer engaged by us for the applicable product or service. In the event that we were unable to procure the applicable supply from a currently qualified manufacturer, we believe that there are a number of potential replacements for each of our outsourced services, however we would likely experience delays in our ability to supply ELX-02 in advancing our clinical trials while we identify and qualify replacement suppliers. 
 Government Regulation 
 Drug Development and Approval in the United States 
 The preclinical studies and clinical testing, manufacture, labeling, storage, record keeping, advertising, promotion, export, and marketing, among other things, of our product candidates are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the U.S., the EU and other territories. In the U.S., pharmaceutical products are regulated by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”) and other laws, including, in the case of biologics, the Public Health Service Act. Failure to comply with FDA requirements, both before and after product approval, may subject us and/or our partners, contract manufacturers, and suppliers to administrative or judicial sanctions, including FDA refusal to approve applications, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, fines and/or criminal prosecution. 
 The process for obtaining regulatory approval to market a medicine is expensive, often takes many years, and can vary substantially based on the type, complexity, and novelty of the product candidates involved. The steps required before a drug may be approved for marketing of an indication in the U.S. generally include: 
  
(a) | preclinical laboratory tests and animal tests;
----+-----------------------------------------------


(b) | submission to the FDA of an IND application for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may commence;
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(c) | adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for its intended use;
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(d) | submission to the FDA of a NDA;
----+--------------------------------


(e) | FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing and clinical study sites identified in the NDA; and
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(f) | FDA review and approval of the NDA.
----+------------------------------------

 Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as toxicological and pharmacological animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product candidates. Preclinical safety tests intended for submission to FDA must be conducted in compliance with FDA’s current Good Laboratory Practice (“cGLP”) regulations and the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal Welfare Act. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND application that must become effective before human clinical trials may be commenced. The IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA before that time raises concerns about the drug candidate or the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND. The IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can proceed. We cannot assure you that submission of an IND will result in FDA authorization to commence clinical trials or that once commenced, other concerns will not arise. FDA may stop the clinical trials by placing them on “clinical hold” because of concerns about the safety of the product being tested, or for other reasons. 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to healthy volunteers or to patients, under the supervision of qualified principal investigators. The conduct of clinical trials is subject to extensive regulation, including compliance with the FDA’s bioresearch monitoring regulations and current Good Clinical Practice (“cGCP”) requirements, which establish standards for conducting, recording data from, and reporting the results of clinical trials, and are intended to assure that the data and reported results are credible and accurate, and that the rights, safety, and well-being of study participants are protected. 
 Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with protocols that detail the objectives of the study, the criteria for determining subject eligibility, the dosing plan, patient monitoring requirements, timely reporting of 
 14


adverse events, and other elements necessary to ensure patient safety, and any efficacy criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to FDA as part of the IND; further, each clinical study at each clinical site must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, prior to the recruitment of subjects. The IRB’s role is to protect the rights and welfare of human subjects involved in clinical studies by evaluating, among other things, the potential risks and benefits to subjects, processes for obtaining informed consent, monitoring of data to ensure subject safety, and provisions to protect the subjects’ privacy. Foreign studies conducted under an IND application must meet the same requirements that apply to studies being conducted in the U.S. Data from a foreign study not conducted under an IND may be submitted in support of a NDA if the study was conducted in accordance with cGCP and FDA is able to validate the data. 
 Clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap, and different trials may be initiated with the same drug candidate within the same phase of development in similar or differing patient populations. Phase I studies may be conducted in a limited number of patients but are usually conducted in healthy volunteer subjects. The drug is usually tested for safety and, as appropriate, for absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Phase II usually involves studies in a larger, but still limited patient population to evaluate preliminarily the efficacy of the drug candidate for specific, targeted indications; to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage; and to identify possible short-term adverse effects and safety risks. Phase III trials are undertaken to gather additional information to evaluate the product’s overall risk-benefit profile, and to provide a basis for physician labeling. Phase III trials evaluate clinical efficacy of a specific endpoint and test further for safety within an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. Phase I, Phase II or Phase III testing might not be completed successfully within any specific time period, if at all, with respect to any of our product candidates. Results from one trial are not necessarily predictive of results from later trials. Furthermore, the FDA, sponsor or IRB may suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. 
 We must register each controlled clinical trial, other than Phase I trials, on a website administered by the NIH (http://clinicaltrials.gov). Registration must occur not later than 21 days after the first patient is enrolled, and the submission must include descriptive information (e.g., a summary in lay terms of the study design, type and desired outcome), recruitment information (e.g., target number of participants and whether healthy volunteers are accepted), location and contact information, and other administrative data (e.g., FDA identification numbers). Within one year of a trial’s completion, information about the trial including characteristics of the patient sample, primary and secondary outcomes, trial results written in lay and technical terms, and the full trial protocol must be submitted to the ClinicalTrials.gov databank. The results information is posted to the website unless the drug has not yet been approved, in which case the NIH posts the information shortly after approval. A NDA, and certain other submissions to the FDA, require certification of compliance with these clinical trials database requirements. There are proposals to expand these registration requirements to additional studies. 
 The results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with other detailed information, including information on the manufacture and composition of the product and proposed labeling for the product, are submitted to the FDA as part of a NDA requesting approval to market the product candidate for a proposed indication. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, as amended, the fees payable to the FDA for reviewing a NDA, as well as annual fees for commercial manufacturing establishments and for approved products, can be substantial. The NDA review fee alone can exceed $2.45 million subject to certain limited deferrals, waivers and reductions that may be available to a qualifying NDA sponsor. Each NDA submitted to the FDA for approval is typically reviewed for administrative completeness and reviewability within sixty days following submission of the application. If the FDA finds the NDA sufficiently complete, the FDA will “file” the NDA, thus triggering a full review of the application. The FDA may refuse to file any NDA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission. Current FDA performance goals provide for action on an application within 12 months of submission. The FDA, however, may not approve a drug within these established timeline goals and its review clock for a particular NDA is subject to change from time to time because the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. We may encounter difficulties or unanticipated costs in our efforts to secure necessary FDA approvals, which could delay or preclude us from marketing our products.  As part of its review, the FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee composed of outside experts review, for evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The advisory committee process may cause delays in the approval timeline. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully, particularly after negative recommendations or limitations, when making drug approval decisions.
 15


Further, the outcome of the review, even if generally favorable, may not be an actual approval but instead a “complete response letter” communicating the FDA’s decision not to approve the application at that time, outlining the deficiencies in the NDA that need to be addressed in order to be eligible for approval, and identifying what information and/or data (including additional preclinical or clinical data) is required before the application can be approved. Even if such additional information and data are submitted, the FDA may decide that the NDA still does not meet the standards for approval. Data from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we do. 
 The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and each may take years to complete. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all.
 The FDA typically will inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with cGCP before approving a NDA. The FDA also will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the product is manufactured before the NDA is approved to assure compliance with cGMP. The FDA will not approve the product unless cGCP and cGMP compliance is satisfactory. The FDA may also take into account results of inspections performed by certain counterpart foreign regulatory agencies in assessing compliance with cGCP or cGMP. The FDA has entered into international agreements with foreign agencies, including the EMA, in order to facilitate this type of information sharing. If the FDA determines the application, clinical sites, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. 
 The FDA may deny approval of a NDA if applicable statutory or regulatory criteria are not satisfied, or may require additional testing or information, which can delay the approval process. FDA approval of any application may include many delays or never be granted. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that a NDA does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If a product is approved, the approval will impose limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed, may require that warning statements be included in the product labeling, and may require that additional studies be conducted following approval as a condition of the approval. The FDA may limit the indications for use, approve narrow labeling relegating a drug to second- line or later-line use, add limitations of use to the labeling or place other conditions on approvals, which could restrict the marketing of an approved product. Further, FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. FDA also may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing or dispensing in the form of a Risk Evaluation Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”) to ensure the safe use of the drug, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In determining whether a REMS is necessary, the FDA must consider the size of the population likely to use the drug, the seriousness of the disease or condition to be treated, the expected benefit of the drug, the duration of treatment, the seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the drug is a new molecular entity. A REMS may be required to include various elements, such as a medication guide or patient package insert, a communication plan to educate health care providers of the drug’s risks, limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the drug, or other measures that the FDA deems necessary to assure the safe use of the drug. To market an approved product for other indicated uses, or to make certain manufacturing or other changes, requires FDA review and approval of a NDA Supplement or new NDA, which may themselves necessitate further clinical testing, and the payment of applicable review fees. Further post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of a product may be required. In addition, new government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates under development. 
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003 (“PREA”), NDAs or supplements to NDAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is determined by the FDA to be safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers, to a qualifying NDA sponsor. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. As the FDA has not issued regulations applying PREA to orphan-designated indications, submission of a pediatric assessment is not presently required for an application to market a product for an orphan-designated indication. However, PREA compliance may be required if approval is sought for other indications for which the drug has not received orphan designation.

Post-approval Requirements 
 After FDA approval of a product is obtained, we will be required to comply with a number of post-approval requirements, including, among other things, establishment registration and product listing, record-keeping requirements, reporting certain adverse reactions and production problems to the FDA, providing updated safety and efficacy information, and complying with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling. As a condition of approval of a NDA, the FDA may require the applicant to conduct additional clinical trials or other post-market testing and surveillance to further monitor and assess the drug’s safety and efficacy. 
 The FDA regulates strictly the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of drug products that are placed on the market. Although physicians may prescribe a drug for off-label uses, manufacturers may only promote for the approved indications and in accordance with the approved labeling. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses and any other false or misleading promotion. Failure to comply with the laws and regulations governing advertising and promotion can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, warning and untitled letters from the FDA, requests for corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil penalties or criminal prosecution. 
 In addition, the distribution of approved prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act (“PDMA”), which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Similarly, the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (“DSCSA”) regulates the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical drugs, requiring passage of a pedigree to track and trace each prescription drug at the saleable unit level through the distribution system. The DSCSA also imposes obligations on drug manufacturers related to suspect product identification/removal, verification, dealing only with authorized trading partners, and other elements. The DSCSA will be effective incrementally over a 10-year period, with serialization of prescription drug products distributed in the U.S. effective November 27, 2017 for drug manufacturers. The PDMA, DSCSA, and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution. 
 Also, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMP after approval. The FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP, which imposes certain procedural and recordkeeping requirements. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of process and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. 
 We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and any future commercial quantities of our product candidates. Future FDA inspections may identify compliance issues at our facilities or at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution or require substantial resources to correct. In addition, discovery of problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable requirements may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA, including withdrawal or recall of the product from the market or other voluntary, FDA-initiated or judicial action that could delay or prohibit further marketing. 
 Once approval is granted, FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if issues bearing on the product’s safety or efficacy are discovered. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data or other information may also require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. New government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established that could delay or prevent FDA approval of our products under development or negatively impact the marketing of any future approved products. 
 Orphan Drug Designation 
 We have received orphan drug designation from the FDA for ELX-02 for the treatment of MPS I for the treatment of Rett syndrome, and for the treatment of cystinosis. The FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a “rare disease or condition,” which is defined as a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the U.S. a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the U.S. for that drug. Orphan drug designation must be requested before 
 17


submitting an application for marketing approval. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. Orphan drug designation can provide opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and FDA user-fee benefits. In addition, if a product which has an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity. Competitors may receive approval of different drugs or biologics for the indications for which the orphan product has exclusivity. 
 Rare Pediatric Disease Designation and Priority Review Voucher 
 Some orphan drugs may also qualify for designation as a “rare pediatric disease” under Section 529 of the FDCA. Section 529 is similar to the Orphan Drug Act, as both require that the “rare disease or condition” affect fewer than 200,000 persons in the U.S. In the Advancing Hope Act of 2016, Section 529 was changed so that the “rare pediatric disease” must also meet the additional criteria of being a serious or life-threatening disease in which the serious or life-threatening manifestations primarily affect individuals aged from birth to 18 years, including age groups often called neonates, infants, children, and adolescents. Under Section 529 of the FDCA, FDA will award priority review vouchers to sponsors of rare pediatric disease product applications that meet these criteria. Under this program, a sponsor who receives an approval for a drug or biologic for a “rare pediatric disease” may qualify for a voucher that can be redeemed to receive a priority review of a subsequent marketing application for a different product. 
Hatch-Waxman Regulatory Exclusivity 
 Market and data exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications for competing products. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent data exclusivity within the U.S. to the first applicant to gain approval of a NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety. During the exclusivity period, the FDA generally may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”) or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company that references the previously approved drug. An ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. 
 For some applications that do not qualify for five-year exclusivity, the FDCA provides a shorter three-year period of market exclusivity. Three-year exclusivity applies to a NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA or 505(b)(2) NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant, are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages, strengths or dosage forms of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and, as a general matter, does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for generic versions of the original, unmodified drug product. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. 
 Pediatric Exclusivity 
 Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent market exclusivity in the U.S. and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of market protection to the term of any existing Orange Book-listed patents or regulatory exclusivity, including the non-patent exclusivity periods described above. This six-month exclusivity may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study or studies in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study or studies. 
Regulation Outside the United States 
 In order to market any product outside of the U.S., we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of any future approved products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in 
 18


those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. 
 Regulation in the European Union 
 We have obtained an orphan medicinal product designation from the European Commission, following an evaluation by the EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products, for ELX-02 for the treatment of MPS I and for the treatment of cystic fibrosis. The European Commission can grant orphan medicinal product designation to products for which the sponsor can establish that it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of (1) a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in 10,000 people in the EU, or (2) a life threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the EU and that without incentives it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the EU would generate a sufficient return to justify the necessary investment. In addition, the sponsor must establish that there is no other satisfactory method approved in the EU of diagnosing, preventing or treating the condition, or if such a method exists, the proposed orphan drug will be of significant benefit to patients. Orphan drug designation is not a marketing authorization. It is a designation that provides a number of benefits, including fee reductions, regulatory assistance, and the possibility to apply for a centralized EU marketing authorization, as well as 10 years of market exclusivity following a marketing authorization. During this market exclusivity period, neither the European Medicines Agency, nor the European Commission nor the Member States can accept an application or grant a marketing authorization for a “similar medicinal product.” A ‘similar medicinal product’ is defined as a medicinal product containing a similar active substance or substances as contained in an authorized orphan medicinal product, and which is intended for the same therapeutic indication. The market exclusivity period for the authorized therapeutic indication may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the orphan designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. In addition, a competing similar medicinal product may in limited circumstances be authorized prior to the expiration of the market exclusivity period, including if it is shown to be safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to our product. Our product can lose orphan designation, and the related benefits, prior to us obtaining a marketing authorization if it is demonstrated that the orphan designation criteria are no longer met. 
 Overview of Application Process 
 To obtain regulatory approval of a drug under the EU’s regulatory systems and authorization procedures, an applicant may submit a Marketing Authorization Application (“MAA”) under a centralized, decentralized, or national procedure. The centralized procedure is compulsory for certain medicinal products, including orphan medicinal products, like ELX-02 and medicinal products produced by certain biotechnological processes, and optional for certain other innovative products. The centralized procedure enables applicants to obtain a marketing authorization that is valid in all EU member states based on a single application. Under the centralized procedure, the EMA’s Committee for Human Medicinal Products (“CHMP”), is required to adopt an opinion on a valid application within 210 days, excluding clock stops, during which additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions. More specifically, on day 120 of the procedure, once the CHMP has received the preliminary assessment reports and opinions from the rapporteur and co-rapporteur, the CHMP prepares a list of potential outstanding issues, referred to as “other concerns” or “major objections.” These are sent to the applicant together with CHMP’s recommendation. The CHMP can make one of two recommendations: (1) the marketing authorization could be granted provided that satisfactory answers are given to the “other concerns” and/or “major objections” identified and that all conditions outlined in the list of outstanding issues are implemented and complied with; or (2) the product is not approvable since there are “major objections.” 
 Applicants have three months from the date of receiving the potential outstanding issues to respond to the CHMP, and can request a three-month extension if necessary. The granting of a marketing authorization will depend on the recommendations and potential major objections identified by the CHMP as well as the ability of the applicant to adequately respond to these findings. An accelerated assessment can be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of major public health interest, in particular from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. In this circumstance, the EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days. After the adoption of the CHMP opinion, a decision on the MAA must be adopted by the European Commission, after consulting the EU member states, which in total should be completed in 67 days. 
 19


An applicant for an MAA may request a re-examination in the event of a negative opinion, in connection with which CHMP appoints new rapporteurs. Within 60 days of receipt of the negative opinion, the applicant must submit a document explaining the basis for its request for re-examination. The CHMP has 60 days to consider the applicant’s request for re-examination. The applicant may request an oral explanation before the CHMP, which is routinely granted, following which CHMP will adopt a final opinion. The final opinion, whether positive or negative, is published by the CHMP shortly following the CHMP meeting at which the oral explanation takes place. 
 Conditional Marketing Authorizations 
 In specific circumstances, EU legislation enables applicants to obtain a marketing authorization on a conditional basis prior to obtaining the comprehensive clinical data required for an application for a full marketing authorization. Such conditional approvals may be granted for products designated as orphan medicinal products, if (1) the risk-benefit balance of the product is positive, (2) it is likely that the applicant will be in a position to provide the required comprehensive clinical trial data, (3) the product fulfills unmet medical needs, and (4) the benefit to public health of the immediate availability on the market of the medicinal product concerned outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. A conditional marketing authorization may contain specific obligations to be fulfilled by the marketing authorization holder, including obligations with respect to the completion of ongoing or new studies, and with respect to the collection of pharmacovigilance data. Conditional marketing authorizations are valid for one year, and may be renewed annually, if the risk-benefit balance remains positive, and after an assessment of the need for additional or modified conditions and/or specific obligations. The timelines for the centralized procedure described above also apply with respect to the review by the CHMP of applications for a conditional marketing authorization. The granting of a conditional marketing authorization will depend on the applicant’s ability to fulfill the conditions imposed within the agreed upon deadline. 
Variations to Conditional Marketing Authorizations 
 After the granting of a conditional marketing authorization, the marketing authorization holder may submit an application to vary the conditional marketing authorization under a variation procedure. In the case of the introduction of an additional therapeutic indication, the timeframe for the variation procedure for the initial assessment of the dossier is generally 90 days (plus up to 20 days for validation). 
 In the framework of a variation application assessment procedure, however, the EMA may send one or more requests for supplementary information to the marketing authorization holder, requiring that additional information be provided by the marketing authorization holder to support its variation application. Such supplementary requests will be sent together with a timetable stating the date by when the marketing authorization holder must submit the requested data and, where appropriate, the extended evaluation period to be applied to such variation procedure. The 90-day variation procedure may be suspended for up to three months for the marketing authorization holder to submit its responses to such supplementary requests. The marketing authorization holder will be notified of the outcome of the CHMP’s assessment of the variation procedure within 15 days from the adoption of the CHMP opinion. If unfavorable, the CHMP opinion may be subject to a re-examination procedure upon the marketing authorization holder’s request. This may imply an additional minimum two-month procedure. If the CHMP opinion is favorable, the European Commission will vary the marketing authorization to introduce the additional therapeutic indication within approximately two months from the receipt of the final CHMP opinion. 
 Additional Requirements and Considerations 
 Prior to obtaining a marketing authorization in the EU, applicants have to demonstrate compliance with all measures included in an EMA-approved Pediatric Investigation Plan (“PIP”), covering all subsets of the pediatric population, unless the EMA has granted (1) a product-specific waiver, (2) a class waiver, or (3) a deferral for one or more of the measures included in the PIP. In the case of orphan medicinal products, completion of an approved PIP can result in an extension of the aforementioned market exclusivity period from ten to twelve years. 
 In the EU, independently generated data submitted as part of a full marketing authorization application dossier are protected by regulatory data protection (‘data exclusivity’) for a period of eight years from the granting of a marketing authorization for a ‘reference product’. This means that for a period of eight years, competent authorities may not accept marketing authorization applications that rely on the independently generated data in the marketing authorization dossier of the reference product. Generic medicinal products that rely on the independently generated data of the reference product may not be placed on the market for 10 years from the granting of the initial marketing authorization for the reference medicinal product. These periods of data exclusivity and market exclusivity do not prevent other companies from obtaining a marketing authorization based on their own independently generated data. 
 20


Were we able to obtain a marketing authorization for ELX-02 for any indication in the EU, we would be required to comply with a range of requirements applicable to the manufacturing, marketing, promotion and sale of medicinal products. We must, for example, comply with the EU’s stringent pharmacovigilance or safety reporting rules, pursuant to which post-authorization studies and additional monitoring obligations can be imposed. Other requirements relate to, for example, the manufacturing of products and active pharmaceutical ingredients in accordance with good manufacturing practice standards. Competent authorities of EU member states may conduct inspections to verify our compliance with applicable requirements, and we will have to continue to expend time, money and effort to remain compliant. Non-compliance with EU requirements regarding safety monitoring or pharmacovigilance, and with requirements related to the development of products for the pediatric population, can also result in significant financial penalties in the EU Similarly, failure to comply with the EU’s requirements regarding the protection of individual personal data can also lead to significant penalties and sanctions. Individual EU member states may also impose various sanctions and penalties in case we do not comply with locally applicable requirements. 
 Off-label promotion of medicinal products is prohibited in the EU. The applicable laws at the EU level and in the individual EU member states also prohibit the direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription-only medicinal products. Violations of the rules governing the promotion of medicinal products in the EU could be penalized by administrative measures, fines and imprisonment. These laws may further limit or restrict our promotional activities with health care professionals. In addition, legislation adopted at the EU level and by individual EU member states require that promotional materials and advertising in relation to medicinal products comply with the product’s Summary of Product Characteristics (“SmPC”), as approved by the competent authorities. The SmPC is the document that provides information to physicians concerning the safe and effective use of the medicinal product. Promotion of indications not covered by the SmPC is specifically prohibited. 
 The EMA is responsible for coordinating inspections to verify compliance with the principles of GCP, cGMP, GLP, and good pharmacovigilance practice (“GVP”). These inspections are also intended to verify compliance with other aspects of the supervision of authorized medicinal products in use in the EU. The EMA coordinates any inspection requested by the CHMP in connection with the assessment of MAAs. Inspections may be routine or triggered by issues arising during the assessment of the dossier or by other information, such as previous inspection experience. Inspections usually are requested during the initial review of an MAA but could arise post-authorization. 
 Inspectors are drawn from member states of the EU and the European Economic Area. Following an inspection, the inspectors provide a written inspection report to the inspected site or applicant and provide an opportunity for response. Some inspection reports require follow-up and may result in additional adverse consequences due to critical or major findings. The inspectors and the CHMP will comment on any response from an inspected site or applicant and may monitor future compliance with any proposed corrective action plan. 
 Possible consequences of critical and major findings resulting from GCP inspections include rejection of clinical trial data, causing significant delays in obtaining final marketing authorization, or other direct action by national regulatory authorities. 
 Early Access Programs 
 Many jurisdictions around the world allow the supply of unauthorized medicinal products in the context of strictly regulated and exceptional early access programs, and some countries may provide reimbursement for drugs provided in the context of such programs. In the EU, the legal basis for early access programs, also referred to as named-patient and compassionate use programs, is set out in the EU legislation regulating the authorization, manufacture, distribution and marketing of medicinal products. Detailed regulatory requirements applicable to early access programs have been adopted and implemented by EU member states in their national laws. The promotion, advertising and marketing of unauthorized medicinal products is generally prohibited, and authorization for early access programs must generally be obtained from national competent authorities, which might not grant such authorization. Obtaining authorization for an early access program in one country does not ensure that authorization will be obtained in another country. U.S. law permits “expanded access” (also known as compassionate use and treatment use) for certain patients with serious diseases who have no comparable alternative treatment options. To provide expanded access, sponsors must submit detailed regulatory information to the FDA. FDA authorization depends on several different factors, including whether expanded access will interfere with related clinical trials or drug development. In addition, the Right to Try Act was signed into law in the U.S. on May 30, 2018, and allows certain eligible patients to have access to certain eligible investigational drugs outside of clinical trials if the patient’s licensed treating physician certifies that the patient has exhausted FDA-approved treatment options and cannot participate in a clinical trial of the investigational drug. Sponsors may not promote products as safe or effective for expanded-access or right to try uses.

Pharmaceutical Pricing and Reimbursement 
 The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of pharmaceuticals have been a focus of this effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. For example, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 expanded Medicare coverage for drug purchases by the elderly and changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products. Cost reduction initiatives and other provisions of this law may decrease the coverage and reimbursement rate that we may receive for any products approved in the U.S. Likewise, healthcare reform measures under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, referred to together as the Affordable Care Act, contain provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products by increasing the minimum level of Medicaid rebates payable by manufacturers of brand-name drugs from 15.1% to 23.1%, effective 2011, extending the Medicaid rebate to Medicaid managed care plans, changing the Medicaid rebate rates for line extensions or new formulations of oral solid dosage form, mandating discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries, and imposing a non-deductible annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell “branded prescription drugs,” effective 2011, expanding the types of entities eligible for the “Section 340B discounts” for outpatient drugs, requiring manufacturers to participate in a coverage gap discount program, under which they must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable branded drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D and creating a process for approval of biologic therapies that are similar or identical to approved biologics. There are numerous steps required to implement the Affordable Care Act, and implementation remains ongoing. Congress also has enacted, and may continue to seek, legislative changes that alter, delay, or eliminate some of its provisions. On February 1, 2016, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services released a long-awaited new rule, the Medicaid Program Covered Outpatient Drug Final Rule, effective April 1, 2016, implementing various provisions of the Affordable Care Act related to “covered outpatient drugs,” including revising the calculation of “average manufacturer price” and addressing other issues relating to Medicaid price reporting and reimbursement. These and other changes contribute to the uncertainty of the ongoing implementation and impact of the Affordable Care Act; they also underscore the potential for additional reform going forward. Certain provisions of enacted or proposed legislative changes may negatively impact coverage and reimbursement of healthcare items and services. 
 Increasing pricing pressure continues from managed care organizations, government agencies and programs, particularly for new and innovative therapies, that could negatively affect the company’s sales and profit margins for any product candidate for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale. In the U.S., these include practices of managed care groups, federal and state exchanges, and institutional and governmental purchasers. Changes to the health care system enacted as part of health care reform in the U.S., as well as increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of Medicare, Medicaid, and private sector beneficiaries, could negatively impact the company’s sales and profit margins. Such pressures may also increase the risk of litigation or investigations by the government regarding pricing calculations. There has also been recent negative publicity and Congressional scrutiny around pharmaceutical drug pricing in the U.S. These dynamics may give rise to negative reactions to pricing decisions for products for which we may receive regulatory approval in the future, possibly limiting our ability to generate revenue and attain profitability. Moreover, the pharmaceutical industry will likely face greater regulation and political and legal action in the future. In this healthcare regulatory climate, there may be significant delays in and impediments to obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs. Any regulatory approval of our products is limited to specific diseases and indications for which our products have been deemed safe and effective by the FDA. Coverage by federal healthcare programs may be more limited than the purposes for which the drug is approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities’ coverage of the same products. In the U.S. and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the extent to which the costs of the products will be covered and reimbursed by third-party payors, including government healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, private health insurers and other organizations. Obtaining reimbursement for orphan drugs may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices typically associated with drugs directed at smaller populations of patients. In addition, third-party payors are likely to impose strict requirements for reimbursement in the use of a higher priced drug. Net prices for products may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of products from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the U.S. 
 22


The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA approved products for a particular indication. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products. Our product candidates may not be considered cost-effective. In the future, we may need to conduct direct head-to-head studies to demonstrate clinical superiority and cost-effectiveness. Our product candidates may not be considered clinically superior and cost-effective to competitor products. 
 The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and other third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, there is an increasing emphasis on managed care in the U.S. that may negatively impact pharmaceutical pricing. 
 In some countries, particularly the countries of the EU, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing and reimbursement negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product. In addition, there can be considerable pressure by governments and other stakeholders on prices and reimbursement levels, including as part of cost containment measures. In some countries, governments can set conditions that must be satisfied for prices to be set at a certain value. Political, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing and reimbursement negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various EU member states, and parallel distribution (arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced member states), can further reduce prices. In some countries we may be required to conduct a clinical trial or other studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of our product candidate to other available therapies in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. 
 Freedom of Information Requests 
 We are also subject, in the U.S. and many other countries, to various regulatory schemes that require disclosure of clinical trial data or allow access to our data via freedom of information requests. We have been and may, from time to time, be notified by regulators, such as the EMA or the competent authorities of EU member states or FDA that they have received a freedom of information request for documents that they hold relating to our company, including information related to our product candidates. 
Fraud and Abuse Laws 
 Any present or future arrangements with third-party payors, healthcare providers and professionals and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may restrict certain marketing and contracting practices. These laws include, and are not limited to, anti-kickback and false claims statutes. 
 Both the federal Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), and the UK Bribery Act of 2010 (“Bribery Act”), are broad in scope and will require companies to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect the transactions of the company and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. The FCPA prohibits the offering, promising, giving, or authorizing others to give anything of value, either directly or indirectly, to a non-U.S. government official in order to improperly influence any act or decision, secure any other improper advantage, or obtain or retain business. Under the Bribery Act, companies which carry on a business or part of a business in the United Kingdom may be held liable for bribes given, offered or promised to any person, including non-UK government officials and private persons, by employees and persons associated with the company in order to obtain or retain business or a business advantage for the company. 
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, or order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under federal and state healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. This statute has been broadly interpreted to apply to manufacturer arrangements with prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers, among others. Although a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors exist to protect certain common activities from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors for this statute are narrow, and practices that involve 
 23


compensation intended to induce prescriptions, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. Our practices may not always meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection. Further, the Affordable Care Act amended the intent requirement of the federal anti-kickback and criminal health care fraud statutes. This amendment provides that a person or entity no longer needs to have knowledge of these statutes or specific intent to violate them. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act. Several other countries, including the United Kingdom, have enacted similar anti-kickback, fraud and abuse laws and regulations. 
 The federal False Claims Act imposes civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Several pharmaceutical and health care companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the free product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of these companies’ marketing of a product for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses. Potential liability under the federal False Claims Act includes mandatory treble damages and significant per claim penalties, currently set at $5,500 to $11,000 per false claim. The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback statute and False Claims Act, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs; furthermore, in several states, these statutes and regulations apply regardless of the payor. Sanctions under these federal and state laws may include civil monetary penalties, exclusion of a manufacturer’s product from reimbursement under government programs, debarment, criminal fines, and imprisonment. 
 The Affordable Care Act included a provision requiring certain providers and suppliers of items and services to Federal Health Care Programs to report and return overpayments within sixty days after they are “identified,” or the Overpayment Statute. In February 2016, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) released long-awaited regulatory guidance (in the form of a final rule) to Medicare Part A and Part B providers and suppliers regarding how to comply with the Overpayment Statute. CMS had previously released a final rule addressing overpayments involving Medicare Part C and Part D providers in May 2014. Although Medicare Part A/B/C/D providers and suppliers have faced federal False Claims Act liability since 2010 for failures to comply with the Overpayment Statute, these final rules interpreting the Overpayment Statute provide guidance to providers and suppliers regarding how to comply appropriately with applicable obligations, and guidance to government regulators and enforcement authorities regarding monitoring and prosecuting suspected violations. This final rule is not directly applicable to manufacturers, but may impact their customers and potential customers who are Medicare providers and suppliers. 
 The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, enacted as part of the Affordable Care Act, and its implementing regulations, require manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report to the Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments and other transfers of value made to covered recipients, such as physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as physician ownership and investment interests. Payments made to physicians and certain research institutions for clinical trials are included within the ambit of this law. Pharmaceutical manufacturers are required to report and disclose payments and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members during the preceding calendar year. Manufacturers were required to make these first reports for information collected in 2013 by March 31, 2014. Such information is publicly available from the Secretary of Health and Human Services in a searchable format, with data collected in each calendar year published the following June. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to $150,000 per year (and up to $1.0 million per year for “knowing failures”) for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests not reported in an annual submission. If not preempted by this federal law, several states currently require pharmaceutical companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical products and to report gifts and payments to individual physicians in those states. Depending on the state, legislation may prohibit various other marketing related activities, or require the posting of information relating to clinical studies and their outcomes. In addition, certain states, such as California, Nevada, Connecticut and Massachusetts, require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs or marketing codes and several other states are considering similar proposals. Manufacturers that fail to comply with these state laws can face civil penalties.

Statutory requirements to disclose publicly payments made to healthcare professionals and healthcare organizations have also been enacted in certain EU member states. In addition, self-regulatory bodies of the pharmaceuticals industry, such as the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA”) have published codes of conduct to which its members have agreed to abide by, that require the public disclosure of payments made to healthcare professionals and healthcare organizations. 
 The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, imposes criminal liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and for knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. HIPAA also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information, and imposes criminal and civil liability for violations of these obligations. Recently, the U.S. federal government criminally prosecuted an employee of a pharmaceutical company for an alleged violation of the privacy requirements under HIPAA. Furthermore, certain privacy laws and genetic testing laws may apply directly to our operations and/or those of our collaborators and may impose restrictions on our use and dissemination of individuals’ health information. 
 The foregoing discussion should be read in conjunction with the information appearing under “Risk Factors—Our relationships with customers, healthcare providers and professionals and third-party payors are or will be subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, transparency and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings” which contains important information regarding some of the risks to our business arising as a result of fraud and abuse laws. 
 Competition 
 Our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. New therapies and treatments based on innovative discoveries emerge frequently. 
 Our potential competitors are public and private companies, pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies who may be engaged in targeting the same biological processes that our compounds are designed to impact and who may be developing products for the same indications as our investigational drug candidates. Potential competitors could also include academic institutions, government agencies, other public and private research organizations and charitable venture philanthropic organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and/or establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization. 
 Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial resources, technical resources, expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials. As a result, our competitors may commercialize products more rapidly or effectively than we do, which would affect our competitive position, the likelihood that our drug candidates, if approved, would achieve and maintain market acceptance and our ability to generate meaningful revenues from our products. 
 Our commercial opportunities could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer side effects, are more convenient or are more affordable than any products that we develop. The key competitive factors affecting the success of ELX-02 and our other product candidates are their impact on the targeted diseases, superiority over competing products, long-term safety, convenience, price and the availability of coverage and reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. 
 Several companies are involved in researching and developing molecules targeting suppression of nonsense mutations and enhancement of translational read-through. However, we believe that ELX-02 is the only drug candidate in clinical development designed to treat nonsense mutations in CFTR the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis and cystinosis, our lead indications. Additional competition to ELX-02 may arise from other programs that do not target a specific CFTR mutation class but work via other mechanisms.
