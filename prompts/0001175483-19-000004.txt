Item 1. Business.
Overview
Drive Shack Inc., which we refer to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, together with its subsidiaries, as Drive Shack Inc. the Company, we and us, is a leading owner and operator of golf-related leisure and entertainment businesses. The Company conducts its business through three segments: Entertainment Golf venues, Traditional Golf properties and corporate. The Company was formed in 2002 and its common stock is traded on the NYSE under the symbol as DS.

• | Entertainment Golf | Drive Shack

Drive Shack is an entertainment company that combines golf, competition, dining and fun. Drive Shack plans to open a chain of next-generation dining and entertainment golf venues across the United States and internationally, with each venue featuring multiple stories of hitting suites where friends, family, co-workers or complete strangers may compete in technologically-enhanced golf games. Consumers who are seeking a good time, but not looking to participate in the game, are able to spectate, watch television and engage in other leisure activities from one of Drive Shack’s restaurant or lounge areas. Drive Shack opened its inaugural venue in Orlando, Florida on April 7, 2018.

• | Traditional Golf | American Golf

American Golf is one of the largest owners and operators of golf properties in the United States. As of December 31, 2018, we owned, leased or managed 66 properties across 11 states. American Golf and its dedicated employees are focused on delivering lasting experiences for our customers, including our more than 45,000 members, who played over 3.7 million rounds at our properties during 2018. 
American Golf was acquired by the Company in December 2013, when the Company restructured an existing mezzanine debt investment related to NGP Realty Sub, L.P. and American Golf Corporation, which we refer to together, as American Golf. As part of the restructuring, the Company acquired the equity of American Golf’s indirect parent, AGC Mezzanine Pledge LLC.
Our operations are organized into three principal categories: (1) Public Properties, (2) Private Properties and (3) Managed Properties.
Public Properties.   Our 41 leased or owned public properties generate revenues principally through daily green fees, golf cart rentals and food, beverage and merchandise sales.  Amenities at these properties generally include practice facilities and pro shops with food and beverage facilities.  In some cases, our public properties have small clubhouses with banquet facilities. In addition, The Players Club is a monthly membership program offered at most of our public properties, with membership benefits ranging from daily range access to ability to participate in golf clinics, in return for a monthly membership fee.
Private Properties.   Our eight leased or owned private properties are open to members only and generate revenues principally through initiation fees, membership dues, food, beverage and merchandise sales, and guest fees. Amenities at these courses typically include practice facilities, full service clubhouses with a pro shop, locker room facilities and multiple food and beverage outlets, including grills, restaurants and banquet facilities. 
Managed Properties. Our 17 managed properties are properties that American Golf manages pursuant to a management agreement with the owner of each property.  American Golf utilizes its decades of experience to provide sophisticated, full-scale golf course operations expertise to municipal and private owners. We recognize revenue from each of these properties in an amount equal to its management fee. In accordance with the new revenue standard (see Note 3 in Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for additional information), certain operating costs incurred by us at the managed properties and the reimbursements of those operating costs by the owner of the managed property are now recognized in operating expenses and revenue from golf operations, respectively. The reimbursements are equal to the reimbursed operating costs and therefore this change will have no net impact to the Company’s operating income (loss).

Developments in 2018
Entertainment Golf - Opened Inaugural Venue, Announced Additional Venues 
In April 2018, the Company opened its first entertainment golf venue, a three-story, innovative driving range and entertainment and dining venue in Orlando, Florida.
The Company continued development of three additional venues in Richmond, Virginia; Raleigh, North Carolina and West Palm Beach, Florida with planned openings in 2019.
The Company announced plans to develop two additional venues in New York, New York and New Orleans, Louisiana.
Traditional Golf - Property Updates
In September 2017, Hurricane Irma caused significant damage to a Traditional Golf property in Florida, including damage to trees, bunkers and other landscaping. The three golf courses at this property were closed immediately and reopened prior to December 31, 2017. The property is insured for property damage and business interruption losses related to such events, subject to deductibles and policy limits. The Company has incurred $5.5 million in property repair costs related to Hurricane Irma of which $1.3 million was incurred in 2018. The Company was reimbursed $2.0 million and $3.0 million by the insurer in 2017 and 2018, respectively. 
During 2018, the Company exited three leased properties and one managed property and converted one leased property to a managed property. See Note 5 in Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for additional information. 
In July 2018, the Company sold a private golf property in Georgia for a sale price of $3.5 million resulting in net proceeds of $3.2 million after adjusting for liabilities assumed by the buyer, primarily related to prepaid dues. In December 2018, the Company sold an additional 12 golf properties for net proceeds of $73.5 million. The sale included: one public and seven private golf properties in California, public golf properties in Georgia and Tennessee, and private golf properties in Oregon and Idaho. The proceeds from the sale plus cash on hand were used to prepay a $102.0 million term loan secured by mortgages on the Company's golf properties. The Company entered into management agreements with the buyers of six of the private golf properties in California and the private golf properties in Oregon and Idaho to continue to manage the properties following the sales.

Corporate - Additions to the Management Team 
In November 2018, the Company added new members to the management team. Kenneth A. May and David M. Hammarley joined the Company as Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, respectively. Mr. May is a proven innovator and operator in the entertainment golf business, and Mr. Hammarley has diverse financial leadership experience in the hospitality industry. 
Policies with Respect to Certain Other Activities 
Subject to the approval of our board of directors, we have the authority to offer our common stock or other equity or debt securities to raise cash financing, in exchange for property and to repurchase or otherwise reacquire our shares or any other securities and may engage in such activities in the future. We also may make loans to, or provide guarantees of certain obligations of, our subsidiaries. We may engage in the purchase and sale of investments. Our officers and directors may change any of these policies and any investment guidelines without a vote of our stockholders. Our board of directors has the authority, without stockholder approval (subject in certain cases to NYSE shareholder approval requirements), to issue additional common stock or preferred stock in any manner and on such terms and for such consideration it deems appropriate, including in exchange for cash or property. 
Competition
We operate in a highly competitive industry, and compete primarily on the basis of reputation, location and the perceived value of our properties and facilities. Our ability to compete with other golf and dining and entertainment facilities directly affects our ability to succeed. 
In addition, we are subject to significant competition in seeking investments to enhance our business. We compete with other companies, including real estate, golf, leisure and dining and entertainment companies and private equity firms. Some of our competitors have greater resources than we possess, or have superior access to capital or various types of financing than are available to us, and we may not be able to compete successfully for investments to enhance our business or provide attractive investments returns relative to our competitors. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify opportunities or complete transactions on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or that we will actually realize any targeted benefits from acquisitions, investments or alliances intended to enhance our business.
We also compete for discretionary leisure and entertainment spending with other types of recreational and entertainment facilities, including entertainment retail and restaurants. Some of these establishments exist in multiple locations, and we may also face competition in the future from new or expanded entertainment retail concepts that are similar to ours.
For more information about the competition we face generally and in our Entertainment and Traditional Golf businesses specifically, see Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Competition in the industry in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.”
Seasonality
Traditional Golf is subject to seasonal fluctuations caused by significant reductions in golf activities as well as revenue in the first and fourth quarters of each year, due to shorter days and colder temperatures.  Consequently, a significantly larger portion of our revenue from our Traditional Golf operations is earned in the second and third quarters of our fiscal year. In addition, severe weather patterns can also negatively impact our results of operations.
Government Regulation of Our Business 
Our properties and operations are subject to a number of environmental laws. As a result, we may be required to incur costs to comply with the requirements of these laws, such as those relating to water resources, discharges to air, water and land, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste and the cleanup of properties affected by regulated materials. Under these and other environmental requirements, we may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical releases from currently owned, formerly owned or operated facilities.
Environmental laws typically impose cleanup responsibility and liability on a property owner without regard to whether the property owner knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants. We may use certain substances and generate certain wastes that may be deemed hazardous or toxic under such laws, and from time to time have incurred, and in the future may incur, costs related to cleaning up contamination resulting from historic uses by us or by previous owners of certain of our current or former properties or our treatment, storage or disposal of wastes at facilities owned by others. Our facilities are also subject to risks associated with 
3

mold, asbestos and other indoor building contaminants. The costs of investigation, remediation or removal of regulated materials may be substantial, and the presence of those substances, or the failure to remediate a property properly, may impair our ability to use, transfer or obtain financing for our property. We may be required to incur costs to remediate potential environmental hazards, mitigate environmental risks in the future, or comply with other environmental laws and regulations.
In addition, in order to build, improve, upgrade or expand some of our facilities, we may be subject to environmental review under the National Environmental Policy Act and, for projects in California, the California Environmental Quality Act. Both acts require that a specified government agency study any proposal for potential environmental impacts and include in its analysis various alternatives. Any improvement proposal may not be approved or may be approved with modifications that substantially increase the cost or decrease the desirability of implementing the project.
We are also subject to regulation by the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration and similar health and safety laws in other jurisdictions. These regulations impact a number of aspects of operations, including golf course maintenance and food handling and preparation.
The ownership and operation of our facilities subjects us to federal, state and local laws regulating zoning, land development, land use, building design and construction, and other real estate-related laws and regulations.
Our facilities and operations are subject to the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended by the ADA Amendments Act of 2008, which we refer to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as the ADA. The ADA generally requires that we remove architectural barriers when readily achievable so that our facilities are made accessible to people with disabilities. In addition, the ADA Amendments Act of 2008, included additional compliance requirements for golf facilities and recreational areas. Noncompliance could result in imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants. Federal legislation or regulations may further amend the ADA to impose more stringent requirements with which we would have to comply.
We are also subject to various local, state and federal laws, regulations and administrative practices affecting our business. For instance, we must comply with provisions regulating equal employment, wage and hour practices and licensing requirements and regulations for the sale of food and alcoholic beverages.
Taxation 
On February 23, 2017, the Company revoked its election to be treated as a real estate investment trust, or a REIT, effective January 1, 2017. The Company operated in a manner intended to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes through December 31, 2016. Since January 1, 2017, we have generally been subject to federal and state income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates, and distributions to stockholders declared on or after January 1, 2017 are not deductible by us in computing our taxable income. Any such corporate tax liability could be substantial, including due to certain deferred cancellation of indebtedness income. Although we have net operating loss carryforwards that may be available to reduce our taxable income for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes and thereby reduce such tax liability, a portion of such carryforwards may be limited in its use due to certain provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, which we refer to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as the Code. Therefore, no assurances can be given that those losses will remain usable or will not become subject to limitations (including the "ownership change" provisions under Section 382 of the Code). In particular, if the Company has undergone or were to undergo an “ownership change” for purposes of Section 382 of the Code, the Company could incur materially greater tax liability than if the Company had not undergone such an ownership change. For additional information, see Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Tax Status and the 1940 Act.”
On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which we refer to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as the Tax Act was signed into law. The Tax Act significantly revises the U.S. corporate income tax regime by, among other things, lowering corporate income tax rates and eliminating the alternative minimum tax, or the AMT for corporate taxpayers. The Company accounted for the effects of the Tax Act for the year ended December 31, 2017 which relates to the re-measure of deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the reduction in the corporate income tax rate and has booked a non-recurring income tax receivable in the amount of $0.6 million due to refundable AMT credits. See Note 14 in Part II, Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for additional information.
