Item 1. Business
Overview
 Waitr Holdings Inc. (together with its wholly-owned subsidiaries, the “Company,” “Waitr,” “we,” “our” or “us”) operates an online food ordering and delivery platform, powered by its team of delivery drivers
. Waitr’s differentiated business model is the three-sided marketplace (restaurants, drivers and diners), enabled by its purpose-built platform. The Company’s strategy is to bring delivery and carryout infrastructure to underserved populations of restaurants and diners and establish market leadership positions in the markets in which it operates. At December 31, 2018, Waitr operated in small and medium sized markets in the Southeastern United States, spanning more than 250 cities across 10 states. On January 17, 2019, Waitr acquired BiteSquad.com, LLC (“Bite Squad”), an online food ordering and delivery platform, which operates a three-sided marketplace consistent with Waitr’s business model, expanding Waitr’s scale and footprint across the United States to more than 600 cities.
 Waitr’s business has been built with a restaurant-first philosophy by providing a differentiated and brand additive service to its Restaurant Partners (which the Company defines as a restaurant that has executed a definitive agreement to join the Waitr platform). Waitr’s platform enables local restaurants to increase sales, provides diners with a great expe
rience and provides its drivers with a steady schedule and predictable income. The Company’s business is driven by the Waitr mobile phone application (the “Waitr App”) and the Waitr website (together, the “Waitr Platform”). Waitr has designed its offering to help local restaurants grow and succeed with features including deep and seamless integration, full restaurant menus with food photos, trained and uniformed drivers, ongoing local market support and flexible pricing plans. Effective January 17, 2019, in connection with the acquisition of Bite Squad, the Company’s business is also driven by the Bite Squad mobile phone application (the “Bite Squad App”) and the Bite Squad website (together, the “Bite Squad Platform”).  
 For diners, Waitr optimizes the journey from restaurant and food discovery through delivery, while providing superior restaurant selection and a great customer experience. Waitr provides diners an easy-to-use, intuitive platform that makes ordering carryout or delivery simple from any network-connected device. Waitr provides superior selection of restaurants in its markets, resulting in strong consumer interest. With Waitr’s intuitive interface and professional photos of nearly every menu item, Waitr allows diners to search and discover new local restaurants beyond the “menu drawer” and take the fear out of trying something new. Waitr’s simplifying and tech-enabled features, including favorites, swipe and buy, diner profiles, recent orders, group ordering, saved payment tokens and real-time delivery status updates, promote higher order frequency and diner retention.
 Company drivers are brand ambassadors for Waitr and an extension of its Restaurant Partners’ brands and the primary point of contact with Waitr’s diners. As a result, Waitr invests significant resources in its drivers, including background checks, in-person interviews, training, uniforms, peer reviews and scheduled working hours. This allows Waitr to better manage a consistent delivery experience for both restaurants and diners, provides drivers with steady income and predictable hours and ensures efficient utilization of the driver workforce. At March 1, 2019, Waitr (including Bite Squad) had approximately 21,000 delivery drivers.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
 
The Company generates revenue primarily when diners place an order on its platforms. Under the Waitr Platform, Waitr engages a third-party payment processor to collect the total amount of the order from the diner, who must use a credit or debit card to pay for their meal, and remits the proceeds, less Waitr’s fee, the diner fee and any gratuity amount, to the Restaurant Partner on a daily basis. Because Waitr is acting as an agent of the Restaurant Partner in the transaction, Waitr recognizes as revenue only its fees (which are assessed as a percentage of the total food sales and related sales taxes, exclusive of diner fees and gratuities for delivery orders) and diner fees. Gratuities are not included in revenue because they are passed through to delivery drivers. Waitr also generates revenue from setup and integration fees collected from Restaurant Partners to onboard them onto the Waitr Platform (these are recognized on a straight-line basis over the anticipated period of benefit, currently determined to be two years) and subscription fees from Restaurant Partners that opt to pay a monthly fee in lieu of an upfront setup and integration fee. Revenue also includes, to a significantly lesser extent, grocery delivery fees (since the launch of this service in select markets in March 2017), and fees for restaurant marketing and data services.
 Similar to Waitr, Bite Squad also engages a third-party payment processor to collect the total amount of the order from the diner, who must use a credit or debit card to pay for their meal. Bite Squad, however, collects the entire transaction amount from the payment processor, which includes food, beverages, catering supplies, delivery and other fees, sales taxes and gratuities, retains the portion of the receipts representing its fees (determined as a percentage commission on the food price of the order processed via the Bite Squad Platform plus the diner fee charged to the diner), gratuities and sales taxes and distributes the remainder to the restaurant. Bite Squad recognizes as revenue only its fees received from restaurants and diners. Gratuities, sales taxes, and food costs are not included in revenue because they are passed through to employees, tax authorities, and restaurants, respectively.
 Waitr generally presents relevant restaurants on its application in order of proximity to the diner and does not allow restaurants to pay to promote themselves within the Waitr Platform. Bite Squad generally presents relevant restaurants on its application in order of proximity to the diner, but does allow restaurants to promote themselves within the Bite Squad Platform by contributing towards diner fees to make the overall transaction less expensive for the diner, with the savings being passed-through to the diners as a lower fee.
 Key Business Metrics
 For a description of the Company’s key business metrics, including Active Diners, Orders and Gross Food Sales, see Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) in this Form10-K.
The Waitr Solution
 Waitr has created a differentiated software platform purpose-built to serve restaurants, drivers and diners. Waitr’s business has been built with a focus on quality through providing a differentiated and brand-additive service to restaurants, which in turn benefits its diners by providing superior restaurant selection and a great customer experience. The acquisition of Bite Squad added a similar software platform to the Company (together with the Waitr Platform, the “Platforms”) and expanded Waitr’s scale and footprint across the United States.

Business Strategy
 The Company has historically grown its business by increasing the number of quality restaurants available on the Waitr Platform, which has facilitated growth in diners and orders, and intends to continue to do so on both Platforms. The Company intends to pursue the following growth strategies to grow the Platforms:
 Increase sales through further penetration of its existing markets
 We believe that our markets are at an early stage of growth, when measured by market penetration, and we plan to continue marketing and actively building our brands in existing markets by improving our offerings, technology platform depth and customer service.
 Continue expansion into new markets, development of new products and services and invest in new technology
 We have identified a substantial number of market opportunities surrounding or adjacent to our current geographic footprint as well as new market opportunities outside of our current footprint. We intend to continue to expand into new cities and geographies and plan to continue to enter and expand upon our product offerings across our marketplace. We contemplate expanding or rolling out additional product offerings, such as grocery, alcohol (where permitted) and dry goods delivery, all of which will continue to enhance the experience of users of the Platforms.
 Deliver an excellent diner experience
 We believe that by tailoring experiences on our Platforms to the nuances of local or regional markets, we can further improve the user experience and drive growth for our restaurants. We plan to continue investing in our direct sales teams and to add more restaurants and restaurant variety to the Platforms, and as a result, we expect to see an increase in diners and orders. A significant opportunity exists to expand existing diner spend, add new diners, and further establish and deepen leadership positions within our current markets.

Leverage relationship with our restaurants
 We intend to utilize our existing relationships with diverse and high-quality restaurants to grow within our current markets as well as aid in our expansion into new markets. 
Pursue Strategic Acquisitions
 We intend to selectively evaluate and pursue expansion opportunities in existing and new markets in both core and adjacent categories through strategic acquisitions.
 Identify and Launch Markets
 Our market strategy is predicated on leveraging best practices from the launch of prior markets. Our “playbook” is continuously refined and includes strategies around onboarding new restaurants, deploying adequate resources to new markets, sales and marketing and ongoing business development.
Identifying New Markets
 We currently operate in approximately 31 states across the United States with plans to expand into new markets in the future. We identify market opportunities based on several criteria, including proximity to our current market footprint and major interstate connectivity between our current and potential markets, which allows us to leverage our brands.
Launching New Markets
 Waitr’s market launch process occurs over four phases; pre-launch, then phases one, two and three:
 Pre-Launch: During pre-launch, Waitr identifies markets and key Restaurant Partners. When Waitr begins operations in a new market, Waitr first signs up new restaurants with in-person sales calls. Waitr’s emphasis is on signing the key influencers in a market and leveraging its relationships with multi-location partners and national and regional chains.
 Phase One: Waitr measures the progress of a new market mainly by the number of orders per day it generates. During phase one, Waitr is building awareness in the community and growing its mobile application installation base, experiencing rapid growth in restaurants and users.
 Phase Two: During phase two of market launch, Waitr experiences rapid growth in diner engagement and continues onboarding restaurants. Waitr becomes viral and word of mouth increases restaurant, diner and driver interest.
 Phase Three: Finally, in phase three, Waitr reaches sustained profitability and is optimizing operations. Waitr scales its in-market operations and support teams to handle increased order volumes, which drives margin increases.
Challenges
 The Company faces several key challenges in continuing to grow its business and maintaining profitability, including the following:
 
 
• | long-term growth depends on the Company’s ability to continue to expand its marketplace of restaurants and diners in a cost-effective manner;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the ability to realize the benefits of acquired businesses depends on the successful integration of the operations of the acquired businesses with those of the Company; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | while the Company’s primary competition remains the traditional offline options including paper menus and telephoning in to restaurants for delivery or takeout, new competitors could emerge in the online food ordering and delivery industry and existing competitors could gain traction in the Company’s markets. The continuing trend toward consolidation in the online and mobile app ordering and delivery industry may result in larger companies with greater financial resources and other competitive advantages than Waitr’s and could impact the Company’s growth rates and ability to maintain profitability.

Marketing
 The Waitr Platform has become an important extension of restaurant branding. Most of its marketing efforts to date have been through co-branding with restaurants and generating word-of-mouth adoption. Restaurants promote Waitr as a feature for their diners through in restaurant advertising such as door stickers, table tents and push cards in their carryout orders.
 Waitr’s remaining sales and marketing initiatives are paid marketing, which includes: digital media, influencer sponsorships, traditional ads, and public relations. Waitr also reaches new diners through early adopters, who enjoyed the Waitr experience, and who recommend the Waitr Platform to friends and family. Waitr also leverages its partnerships to expand geographic reach. 
 The Bite Squad Platform will be an important extension of the Company’s restaurant branding, with similar marketing efforts as the Waitr Platform.  
 Sales
 Waitr’s sales team is focused on signing restaurants across its current and target markets. When launching a market, Waitr deploys a sales launch team to the new market to begin recruiting a diverse set of notable and popular restaurants to the Waitr Platform. By focusing Waitr’s sales efforts on recruiting top restaurants and showing them the value of the Waitr Platform, restaurants promote themselves on the Waitr Platform to their diners. This increase in diners helps to drive more sales and ultimately more restaurants to the platform. After launch, Waitr continues the sales efforts with an in-market brand ambassador and business development representative, while also conducting sales initiatives at the regional and corporate level with key partners and larger national accounts. Waitr has historically used a “hub-and-spoke” strategy when opening new markets, which enables it to build momentum through word-of-mouth among both Restaurant Partners and diners. After opening new markets, Waitr representatives continue to work with its Restaurant Partners to increase overall order volume and ensure a high level of quality control across the Waitr Platform. Waitr’s sales team also leverages the success of the Waitr Platform to build new partnerships with important restaurant influencers in the communities Waitr serves.
Products and Services
 Restaurant Products and Services
 Waitr provides restaurants with a high level of service with deep technology integration, a high-growth, enhanced marketing platform, trained employee drivers, and customer support all at very attractive and aligned pricing.
 Pricing Plans.  Historically, Waitr has offered restaurants two pricing plans: (1) an upfront setup and integration fee and lower fee rate and (2) no upfront setup and integration fee with a higher fee rate. Given the value created by Waitr’s initial setup process and the lower fee rate, the majority of our Restaurant Partners have elected the upfront setup and integration fee and lower fee rate option.
 Restaurant Onboarding. Waitr offers restaurants a streamlined onboarding process that features direct menu management, high quality professional photography and high levels of customer service from its market level representatives. 
 Product Features.  Waitr provides restaurants with the ability to offer promotions and daily specials, optimize orders through real time analytics and manage restaurant menus. The Waitr Platform includes a dedicated mobile application for its Restaurant Partners called “Managr.” The Managr toolkit simplifies and aggregates restaurant order and delivery tasks onto a central in-app controller and provides flexibility to edit menus based on inventory or promotions, all through user-friendly hardware that receives orders on-site and integrates them seamlessly into existing kitchen flow.
 Customer Support.  Waitr also provides its Restaurant Partners with in-market team support to ensure quality diner and restaurant service to both parties.
 Delivery.  Waitr provides an ordering and delivery platform for its Restaurant Partners through a network of trained and uniformed drivers to address the growing demand for delivery services.

Diner Products and Services
 Properties.   For diners, the Platforms serve as a personalized service that provides discovery, convenience and transparency. Our Platforms feature food ordering and delivery, group ordering capabilities and the ability to create favorites for recurring orders.
 Features.   The Platforms simplify the online restaurant delivery process to a few steps that include setting location, specifying delivery or takeout, selecting and customizing menu items and tracking orders until delivery or pickup. Diners can easily view their favorite restaurants and past orders. Further, the Waitr Platform offers diners the option to start or join group orders, providing them with an easy method to split the cost of large orders.
 Restaurant Selection and Customization. The restaurants on the Platforms offer a wide breadth of cuisines, price points and local favorites in each market. Waitr creates a personalized experience for diners, where they can tailor their orders to several layers of customization: getting what they want, when they want it. 
Driver Products and Services
 The majority of our drivers are employees, which allows us to provide a more consistent and professional experience. Employing drivers allows for more robust training and allows for more control over behaviors to help improve restaurant and diner experience, including mandatory branded uniforms and equipment, the ability to manage shift schedules to balance supply and demand, and regular performance management feedback. This is key to optimizing our delivery network so we can consistently meet and exceed the restaurant and diner expectation of being on-time. We conduct background checks and in-person interviews with all potential drivers. Drivers have flexible schedules and are paid on a weekly basis, and they keep 100% of gratuities.
Customers
 As of December 31, 2018, Waitr had approximately 8,500 Restaurant Partners and served approximately 989,000 Active Diners. On January 17, 2019, Waitr completed the acquisition of Bite Squad, adding more than 11,800 restaurants and approximately 988,000 Active Diners. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, none of Waitr’s Restaurant Partners or Active Diners accounted for 1% or more of the Company’s revenues. 
Competition
 The Company’s primary competition remains traditional offline options, including paper menus and telephoning in to restaurants for delivery or takeout. Management believes the Company’s competition falls into the following categories:

• | Traditional offline processes, including phone orders, paper menus distributed by restaurants, local advertising and the yellow pages;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Local delivery services that typically do not employ mobile or internet technology to power their service (for example, taking orders by phone only); and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Other online delivery platforms.
--+---------------------------------

 The principal competitive factors in the Company’s markets include scale, cost, delivery network, technology, convenience, customer service and integration. Management believes the Company competes favorably based on these factors for restaurants, consumers and drivers.
 Seasonality and Holidays
 Our business tends to follow restaurant closure and diner behavior patterns. In many of Waitr’s markets, Waitr generally experiences a relative increase in diner activity from September to May and a relative decrease in diner activity from June to August due to school summer breaks and other vacation periods. In addition, restaurants tend to close on certain holidays, including Thanksgiving and Christmas Eve-Day, in Waitr’s key markets. Further, diner activity may be impacted by unusually cold, rainy, or warm weather. Cold and rain typically drive increases in order volume, while unusually warm or sunny weather typically drives decreases in orders. Consequently, Waitr’s results between quarters, or between periods that include prolonged periods of unusually cold, warm, inclement, or otherwise unexpected weather, may vary.

Technology & Intellectual Property
 The Waitr Platform uses scalable software to provide a consistent and robust user experience as user adoption increases. The internally developed platform is purpose-built to streamline online ordering and delivery for consumers and restaurants. Waitr’s Platform is 100% hosted in the cloud. Cloud hosting assists Waitr with addressing potential capacity constraints that Waitr may face as it grows its core applications and provides a level of redundancy, fault tolerance and cost-effectiveness. Waitr also hosts its Driver Managr and call center applications on the cloud. Waitr’s Platform offers simplicity, ease of use, rich customer data, and online menu integrations. Continued scaling of the Waitr Platform is expected to lead to a more consistent and robust user experience. Rich customer data and online menu integrations are also expected to result in higher average order value and increased incremental orders.
 Waitr protects its intellectual property through a combination of trademarks, trade dress, domain name registrations, trade secrets, patents, and copyrights.
 As of December 31, 2018, Waitr had registered trademarks covering “Waitr,” the bowtie design and logo and the stylistic designs associated with its brand. Waitr has also filed other trademark applications in the United States and may pursue additional trademark registrations to the extent management believes it will benefit its business and be cost-effective.
 As of December 31, 2018, Waitr filed two patent applications in the United States, which seek to cover proprietary inventions relating to its products and services. Waitr may pursue further patents to the extent that management believes it will benefit Waitr’s business and be cost-effective.

Corporate History
 Originally formed on December 5, 2013 as a Louisiana corporation, Waitr Incorporated began operations in 2014 as a restaurant platform for online food ordering and delivery services, and grew quickly, connecting restaurants, diners and delivery drivers in various markets. Landcadia Holdings, Inc. was a special purpose acquisition company whose business was to effect a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase reorganization or similar business combination. It was incorporated in Delaware on November 19, 2008 as Leucadia Development Corporation and changed its name to Landcadia Holdings, Inc. on September 15, 2015.
 On November 15, 2018 (the “Closing Date”), Waitr Holdings Inc. (formerly known as Landcadia Holdings, Inc.), a Delaware corporation, completed the acquisition of Waitr Incorporated, pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of May 16, 2018 (the “ Landcadia Merger Agreement”), by and among the Company, Waitr Inc. (f/k/a Landcadia Merger Sub, Inc.), a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of the Company (“Merger Sub”), and Waitr Incorporated. The transactions contemplated by the Landcadia Merger Agreement are referred to herein as the “Landcadia Business Combination.” Upon the consummation of the Landcadia Business Combination, Waitr Incorporated merged with and into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub surviving the merger in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law as a wholly-owned, indirect subsidiary of the Company. In connection with the closing of the Landcadia Business Combination (the “Closing”), the Company changed its name from Landcadia Holdings, Inc. to Waitr Holdings Inc.
 Prior to the consummation of the Landcadia Business Combination, the common equity of the Company was traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market (the “Nasdaq”) under the symbol “LCA”. Effective November 16, 2018, the Company’s common equity began trading on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “WTRH”. One of the primary purposes of the Landcadia Business Combination was to provide a platform for Waitr Incorporated to gain access to the U.S. public markets.

On January 17, 2019, Waitr completed the acquisition of Bite Squad, a Minnesota limited liability company, pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of December 11, 2018 (the “Bite Squad Merger Agreement”), by and among the Company, Bite Squad and Wingtip Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The transactions contemplated by the Bite Squad Merger Agreement are referred to herein as the “Bite Squad Merger.” Upon consummation of the Bite Squad Merger, Wingtip Merger Sub, Inc. merged with and into Bite Squad, with Bite Squad surviving the merger in accordance with the Minnesota Revised Uniform Limited Liability Act as a wholly-owned, indirect subsidiary of the Company. Founded in 2012 and based in Minneapolis, Bite Squad operates a three-sided marketplace, consistent with Waitr’s business model, through the Bite Squad Platform.
Basis of Presentation
 
The Landcadia Business Combination was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”). Under this method of accounting, Landcadia Holdings, Inc. has been treated as the “acquired” company for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly, for accounting purposes, the Landcadia Business Combination was treated as the equivalent of Waitr Incorporated issuing stock for the net assets of Landcadia Holdings, Inc., accompanied by a recapitalization. The net assets of Landcadia Holdings, Inc. were stated at historical cost, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded. Reported amounts from operations included herein prior to the Landcadia Business Combination are those of Waitr Incorporated. The shares and earnings per share available to holders of the Company’s common stock, prior to the Landcadia Business Combination, have been retroactively restated as shares reflecting the exchange ratio established in the Landcadia Business Combination.
 
The Bite Squad Merger was considered a business combination, in accordance with GAAP, and will be accounted for using the acquisition method. Under the acquisition method of accounting, total purchase consideration is allocated to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities based on their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. Any excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of the assets less liabilities acquired will be recorded as goodwill. The results of operations of Bite Squad will be included in our consolidated financial statements beginning on the acquisition date, January 17, 2019.
