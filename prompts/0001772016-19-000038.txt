Our Company
We are a leader in the global convenient nutrition category, aiming to enhance the lives of our consumers by providing them with highly nutritious, great-tasting products they can enjoy throughout the day. Our primary brands, Premier Protein, Dymatize and PowerBar, target a broad range of consumers and compete in all major product forms, including RTD protein shakes, powders and nutrition bars. Our products are distributed across a diverse network of channels including club, food, drug and mass (“FDM”), eCommerce, specialty and convenience. Our vision is to create a healthier world where everyone actively seeks and has access to great-tasting nutrition. Our commitment to consumers is to strive to make highly effective products that deliver best-in-class nutritionals and superior taste. 
We have organically grown our net sales from $713.2 million in our year ended September 30, 2017 to $854.4 million in our year ended September 30, 2019. Over the same period, net income grew from $35.2 million in our year ended September 30, 2017 to $123.1 million in our year ended September 30, 2019. 
Our History
BellRing Brands, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Delaware on March 20, 2019 in connection with our IPO. Upon completion of a series of transactions in connection with the IPO (the “formation transactions”), BellRing Brands, LLC became the holder of Post’s Active Nutrition business, which, effective as of Post’s quarter ended June 30, 2015, and until the completion of our IPO, had been comprised of Premier Nutrition, Dymatize and the PowerBar brand and also included Active Nutrition International, which manufactures and sells products of Post’s Active Nutrition business in certain international markets.
In its year ended September 30, 2013, Post acquired Premier Nutrition, which, at the time, was a marketer and distributor of high quality protein shakes and nutrition bars under the Premier Protein brand and nutritional supplements under the Joint Juice brand. Premier Nutrition, Inc. was founded in 1997, and Joint Juice, Inc. was founded in 1999. In 2011, Joint Juice, Inc. acquired the Premier Protein brand and related assets from Premier Nutrition, Inc. via a corporate restructuring, and the resulting entity assumed the name Premier Nutrition Corporation. Premier Nutrition’s products are primarily manufactured under co-manufacturing agreements at various third party facilities located in the U.S. and Europe, with the exception of a portion of Premier Nutrition’s nutrition bars manufactured at our Voerde, Germany facility. Effective September 30, 2019, Premier Nutrition converted to a limited liability company and changed its corporate name to Premier Nutrition Company, LLC.
In its year ended September 30, 2014, Post acquired Dymatize, which, at the time, was a manufacturer and marketer of high-quality protein powders and nutritional supplements under the Dymatize brand and nutrition bars under the Supreme Protein brand. Dymatize was founded in 1994 and purchased the Supreme Protein brand in 2012. At the time of the Post acquisition, Dymatize products were manufactured by Dymatize at its manufacturing facility in Farmers Branch, Texas and by various co-manufacturers. By the end of its year ended September 30, 2015, Dymatize transferred all production to third parties under co-manufacturing agreements and ceased in-house production. In its year ended September 30, 2017, Dymatize sold its manufacturing facility. 
In its year ended September 30, 2015, Post acquired the PowerBar and Musashi brands, Active Nutrition International and 
3

manufacturing facilities in Boise, Idaho and Voerde, Germany. The PowerBar brand was founded in 1986. In its year ended September 30, 2015, Post sold the Musashi brand. In that same year, Post also ceased all production at, and thereafter sold, the Boise manufacturing facility. All PowerBar products are currently manufactured under co-manufacturing agreements at various third party facilities located in the U.S. and Europe, with the exception of a portion of the brand’s nutrition bar and gel products, which continue to be manufactured at our Voerde, Germany facility.
Our Organizational Structure
In connection with our IPO, we completed a series of formation transactions. As a result of these formation transactions:

• | Premier Nutrition, Dymatize, Supreme Protein, LLC and Active Nutrition International, the entities that formerly comprised the Active Nutrition business of Post, became direct or indirect subsidiaries of BellRing Brands, LLC (formerly Dymatize Holdings, LLC).


• | BellRing Brands, Inc. became a holding company, and has no material assets other than its ownership of non-voting common units of BellRing Brands, LLC (“BellRing Brands, LLC units”).


• | The members of BellRing Brands, LLC consist of Post and BellRing Brands, Inc. As of November 22, 2019, Post owns 71.2% of the economic interests in BellRing Brands, LLC, and BellRing Brands, Inc. (and, indirectly, the holders of our Class A Common Stock) owns 28.8% of the economic interests in BellRing Brands, LLC.


• | Post holds one share of BellRing Brands, Inc. Class B common stock, $0.01 par value per share (the “Class B Common Stock”). For so long as Post or its affiliates (other than us) directly own more than 50% of BellRing Brands, LLC units, the share of Class B Common Stock represents 67% and the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock represent 33%, respectively, of the combined voting power of the common stock of BellRing Brands, Inc. By virtue of its ownership of the Class B Common Stock, Post controls BellRing Brands, Inc.


• | BellRing Brands, Inc. holds the voting membership unit of BellRing Brands, LLC (which represents the power to appoint and remove the members of the board of managers of BellRing Brands, LLC (the “Board of Managers”) and no economic interest in BellRing Brands, LLC) and BellRing Brands, Inc. appointed the members of the BellRing Brands, LLC Board of Managers, and therefore, controls BellRing Brands, LLC.


• | The financial results of BellRing Brands, LLC and its subsidiaries are consolidated with BellRing Brands, Inc., and a portion of the consolidated net income (loss) and net assets are allocated to the noncontrolling interest to reflect the entitlement of Post to a portion of the consolidated net income (loss) and consolidated net assets.

See Note 14 within “Notes to Combined Financial Statements” included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for more information about the above-mentioned transactions as well as the IPO and formation transactions.
Our Industry 
We operate in the global convenient nutrition category, a rapidly-growing and on-trend category within the food and beverage industry. The United States (the “U.S.”) is our primary market and is the largest and most developed market in the world for our category. We believe the U.S. convenient nutrition category can be broken down into four key consumer need states as defined by our management: everyday nutrition, adult nutrition, sports nutrition and weight management. 
While we believe most brands in the convenient nutrition category are positioned to appeal to consumers primarily in one need state, Premier Protein has developed brand equities and product value propositions to appeal to a broad range of consumer need states. We primarily compete in the everyday nutrition and sports nutrition consumer need states, but also appeal to the adult nutrition and weight management consumer need states. We define everyday nutrition as nutritious products that can be consumed throughout the day as part of a healthy lifestyle. Our Dymatize and PowerBar brands are focused primarily on sports nutrition, which we define as consumers looking to supplement sports endurance and body building needs. 
Brand Overview 
Our portfolio consists of our primary brands, Premier Protein, Dymatize and PowerBar, and two secondary brands, Joint Juice and Supreme Protein. Together our brands cover the major product forms in the convenient nutrition category and appeal to a broad range of consumer need states. Our net sales by brand for our year ended September 30, 2019 were as follows: Premier Protein, 80%; Dymatize, 13%; PowerBar, 5%; and other, 2%.
Three product forms have accounted for the majority of our net sales over the last three fiscal years. In our year ended September 30, 2019, RTD protein shakes and other RTDs were 78% of our net sales, powders were 14% of our net sales and nutrition bars were 7% of our net sales. In our year ended September 30, 2018, RTD protein shakes and other RTDs were 74% of our net sales, powders were 14% of our net sales and nutrition bars were 11% of our net sales. In our year ended September 30, 2017, RTD protein shakes and other RTDs were 66% of our net sales, powders were 16% of our net sales and nutrition bars were 16% of our net sales.

Premier Protein 
Our largest brand, Premier Protein, is a leading mainstream, lifestyle brand. Premier Protein’s product portfolio consists of RTD protein shakes, refreshing protein beverages, nutrition bars and protein powders. Premier Protein’s flagship 11 ounce RTD protein shakes contain 30 grams of protein with only one gram of sugar and 160 calories. They are gluten-and soy-free, low fat and fortified with 24 vitamins and minerals. Our RTD protein shakes are formulated to deliver great-tasting, leading protein levels while maintaining one of the leanest nutritional profiles in the category (as measured by sugar and calorie content). The product profile appeals to consumers across age ranges in all four need states. 
Premier Protein has accelerated efforts to expand its portfolio of high protein products across new product forms. The brand expanded into protein powders and refreshing protein beverages and launched a new nutrition bar line in our year ended September 30, 2019. Premier Protein’s powder portfolio consists of 100% whey protein products that contain 30 grams of protein and three grams of sugar. In refreshing protein beverages, Premier Protein launched a Clear 20 gram protein drink with 90 calories and 0 grams of sugar. Our Premier Protein Clear beverages are positioned as thirst quenching, functional products that deliver to consumers refreshing protein beverages with no sugar. Refreshing protein beverages is an emerging space in the convenient nutrition category. 
As of September 30, 2019, Premier Protein’s portfolio includes a nutrition bar offering 30 grams of protein and three grams of fiber with no artificial sweeteners. The nutrition bars deliver high protein, great-tasting portable nutrition. We also expanded the portfolio in our year ended September 30, 2019 to deliver a new indulgent 20 gram protein nutrition bar with superior taste and texture to appeal to more mainstream consumers. 
Internationally, Premier Protein can be found in major Canadian retailers and recently has expanded its high protein offerings into Europe. Premier Protein also is sold in the club channel in Mexico, Japan and Korea. 
Dymatize 
Our Dymatize brand is a market leader targeting fitness enthusiasts who value the brand for its science-based product development and athletic performance focus. The brand’s portfolio includes an assortment of sports nutrition products, including primarily protein powders as well as protein bars and nutritional supplements (such as pre-workout and amino acids). 
The majority of Dymatize’s sales are generated through protein powders. Our protein powder portfolio consists of three primary products: ISO100 made with hydrolyzed 100% Whey Protein Isolate, Elite 100% Whey Protein and Super Mass Gainer. ISO100, the brand’s flagship product, has a global reach with sales in more than 50 countries. 
In addition to powders, Dymatize offers a suite of products to meet the needs of athletes, including pre-workout and post-workout recovery products. Dymatize also offers a line of competitively-priced products formulated for the mainstream athlete that are sold in FDM channels.
PowerBar 
Our PowerBar brand targets a range of consumers from committed athletes to active individuals. The brand delivers nutrient dense products to fuel consumers with ambitious, athletic lifestyles. PowerBar’s product portfolio ranges from protein and energy snacks for fitness enthusiasts to highly functional and technical energy products for competitive athletes’ in-game usage. 
 PowerBar is positioned as a high-quality brand internationally and has a notable presence in Western Europe. The brand also has recently expanded into eCommerce as well as the FDM channels to drive incremental scale. In North America, the PowerBar product portfolio has been optimized to focus on its most successful product offering, the PowerBar Protein Plus 20 gram protein bar that is gluten-free and a good source of fiber. The PowerBar Protein Plus line can be found in food, drug and convenience stores. 
Other Brands 
In addition to our primary brands, our portfolio includes the Joint Juice and Supreme Protein brands. Joint Juice is a line of great-tasting joint support liquid supplements for baby boomers with active lifestyles. Supreme Protein is a line of multi-layered, indulgent protein bars targeted towards consumers seeking a nutritious, protein-enriched snack. 
Our Customers 
We sell our products domestically and in more than fifty countries globally. In the U.S., which represented 86% of our net sales in our year ended September 30, 2019, we utilize a direct sales force in multiple channels, including club, FDM, convenience, specialty and eCommerce. We also sell through a broker network for customers in the convenience, grocery and mass channels, and through distributors for the specialty channel. 
In international markets, which represented 14% of our net sales in our year ended September 30, 2019, we sell our products through a combination of direct sales to retailers and to third party distributors. We utilize a direct sales force in key markets in 
5

the European Union (the “E.U.”) and the U.K. for multiple channels, including FDM, convenience, specialty and eCommerce. We also sell through distributors in the specialty channel. 
Our largest customers, Costco and Walmart and its affiliates (which includes Sam’s Club), accounted for approximately 70% of our net sales in our year ended September 30, 2019. 
Sales and Marketing 
We maintain a dedicated multi-faceted and consumer-driven marketing strategy for each of our primary brands, tailoring initiatives to each brand’s target audience. Each of our brands maintains a presence across all major social media platforms. 
Premier Protein. Premier Protein’s marketing strategy is aimed at accelerating the brand’s positioning as a lifestyle brand for mainstream consumers. Premier Protein’s marketing initiatives are focused on increasing awareness to drive product trial and adoption as well as expanding household penetration among this group of consumers. As part of its marketing strategy, Premier Protein leverages its fans’ enthusiasm for the brand to spread the word of our products. The brand utilizes an influencer marketing program called “Premier Shakers” that leverages micro-influencers, content creators and top-tier influencers to generate further awareness of Premier Protein. 
Dymatize. Dymatize’s marketing strategy is focused on retailer-specific programs, online and specialty print media and social media. Social media is a high-touch medium that resonates with Dymatize’s core fitness-focused consumers. Dymatize maintains a presence across all major social media platforms. The brand also utilizes a social media influencer model, “Team Dymatize,” engaging with athletes. This team promotes product usage via personal social media channels to drive awareness for the brand among its target demographic. 
PowerBar. Similar to Dymatize, PowerBar’s marketing efforts include retailer programs, online and specialty print media and social media as well as traditional sports marketing through events and activations to reach not only its core sports enthusiast consumers but also active lifestyle consumers. The brand’s social media content strategy is supported by seasonal cross-channel marketing and influencer campaigns. Sponsorships of sports events drive product trial. PowerBar’s key initiatives are focused on the European market, showcasing its range of offerings. 
Research and Development 
We continue to improve and expand our product offerings with new flavors, ingredients and packaging options. We leverage our dedicated innovation team, supplemented by leading design firms, product development companies, third party flavor houses and consultants. 
Supply Chain 
We primarily engage contract manufacturers and third party logistics firms to manufacture and distribute our products. We own a manufacturing operation in Voerde, Germany that supplies nutrition bars and gels primarily for the E.U. and the U.K. 
Sourcing. Raw materials used in our business consist of ingredients and packaging materials purchased from local, regional and international suppliers. Our principal ingredients include milk-based, whey-based and soy-based proteins and protein blends. Our primary packaging materials include aseptic foil and plastic lined cardboard cartons, aseptic plastic bottles, plastic jars and lids, flexible film, cartons and corrugate. We purchase our ingredients in accordance with rigorous standards to assure food quality and safety. These ingredients are generally available in adequate quantities from multiple suppliers. We actively manage the cost and quality of key ingredients by visiting with major suppliers to negotiate contract commitments and assure quality processes and standards during production. 
Manufacturing. We primarily engage third party contract manufacturers in North America and the E.U. to produce our finished goods. We receive products from our contract manufacturers, which include all packaging and ingredients used, for an agreed-upon tolling charge for each item produced as well other minor costs. We also own a nutrition bar and gel-filling line plant in Voerde, Germany that supplies some of the products for our PowerBar, Premier Protein and Dymatize brands. 
We regularly monitor the capacity and performance of our contract manufacturing partners and qualify new suppliers as needed. In order to secure supply of most of our RTD protein shakes, our relationships with these third parties are subject to minimum volume commitments, whereby these third party contract manufacturers have committed to produce, and we have committed to purchase, a minimum quantity of product. Given the growth profile of our primary products, we continuously plan for incremental capacity and review additional strategic alternatives to support our business. 
From three separate and geographically diverse manufacturing locations, our largest contract manufacturer provided approximately 81% of our Premier Protein RTD shake supply for our year ended September 30, 2019. Under the terms of a manufacturing agreement with the manufacturer, Premier Nutrition is required to purchase a minimum annual order volume of RTD protein shakes and has the right (but not the obligation) to order quantities in excess of a monthly minimum amount provided the manufacturer has the capacity and the ability to produce such additional quantities. In addition, under the terms of the 
6

manufacturing agreement, the manufacturer has committed to produce an annual minimum volume of RTD protein shakes. The manufacturing agreement also contains detailed provisions regarding the product specifications and quality standards for the products to be manufactured and packaged by the manufacturer, the tolling charges for each item produced (and certain other costs) to be paid by Premier Nutrition (and related payment terms), shipping and storage obligations, the rights of a party in the event the other party does not comply with its obligations under the manufacturing agreement and other customary contractual terms and conditions. The manufacturing agreement expires on December 31, 2022.
We regularly evaluate our contract manufacturing arrangements to ensure the cost-effective manufacturing of our products. We select our manufacturing partners based on expertise, quality, cost and location. Our quality assurance team frequently monitors manufacturing partners to ensure our partners meet our rigorous processing and quality standards, detailed in our Quality Expectations Manual, including requirements for third party certification of Good Manufacturing Practices. Our owned production plant in Voerde, Germany is additionally certified to one of the international Food Safety Standards (ISO/FSSC 22.000, IFS or BRC), and OHSAS 18001 (Health and Safety). 
Distribution. In North America, our products typically are shipped directly from our contract manufacturing partners to a network of third party warehouses. Products are distributed from third party warehouses to customer distribution centers or retail stores or are exported to international customers. Occasionally, we ship products directly from our contract manufacturers to our customers’ distribution centers. 
We maintain two third party warehouse locations in Germany, both of which receive products from our production facility located in Voerde, Germany or directly from our contract manufacturers. Our branded products are distributed from the main third party warehouses to customer distribution centers or retail stores or are exported to international customers. 
Competition 
We compete with other brands in the convenient nutrition category and with many nutritional food and beverage players. We have numerous competitors of varying sizes, including manufacturers of other branded food and beverage products, as well as manufacturers of private label products. Competition in our industry is based on product quality, taste, functional benefits, convenience, brand loyalty and positioning, product variety, product packaging, shelf space, price, promotional efforts and ingredients. We expect the industry to remain competitive in the future and believe that we are well-positioned to compete effectively with respect to each of these factors. 
Seasonality 
We have experienced in the past, and expect to continue to experience, seasonal fluctuations in our sales and earnings before interest and taxes (“EBIT”) margins because of consumer spending patterns and timing of promotional activity. Historically, our first quarter of the fiscal year is seasonally low for net sales for all brands driven by a slowdown of consumption of our products during the holiday season and during colder weather, which impacts outdoor activities. However, sales typically increase throughout the remainder of the fiscal year as a result of promotional activity at key retailers as well as organic growth of the business. Seasonal fluctuations in our sales and EBIT margins may not be the same in the future as they have historically.
Working Capital 
A description of our working capital practices is included in Part II, Item 7 of this report under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources.”
Capital Expenditures 
During our year ended September 30, 2019, our aggregate capital expenditures were $3.2 million. We have modest capital expenditures due to the asset-light nature of our business model. 
Trademarks and Intellectual Property 
We own a number of trademarks that are critical to the success of our business. Our key trademarks include Premier Protein®, Dymatize®, PowerBar®, ISO.100®, Joint Juice® and Supreme Protein®, and we have submitted an application for the trademark BellRing Brands. Our owned trademarks are, in most cases, protected through registration in the U.S. or Germany, as well as in many other countries where the related brands or products are sold. We also own, or have applications pending, for several patents in the U.S. and other countries. While our patent portfolio as a whole is material to our business, no one patent or group of related patents is material to our business. In addition, we have copyrights, proprietary trade secrets, technology, know-how processes and other intellectual property rights that are not registered. 
We rely on a combination of trademark law, copyright law, trade secrets, non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements and provisions in agreements and other measures to establish and protect our proprietary rights to our products, packaging, processes and intellectual property.

Governmental Regulation, Safety and Environmental Matters 
Along with our contract manufacturers, distributors and ingredient and packaging suppliers, we are subject to regulation by federal, state and local governmental entities and agencies in the U.S., as well as similar regulations in Canada, Mexico, Europe and other international locations, including food safety laws, labor and employment laws, laws governing advertising, privacy laws, consumer protection regulations, worker health and safety regulations, environmental laws and regulations and other laws and regulations. 
Our products are regulated in the U.S. either as food or dietary supplements, which internationally may be regulated as pharmaceuticals or other health food categories. As a producer and distributor of goods for human consumption, we must comply with stringent production, storage, recordkeeping, distribution, labeling and marketing standards established by the Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (the “USDA”), the Federal Trade Commission and individual states within the U.S. We also must comply with standards established by similar regulatory agencies in Canada, Mexico, the E.U. and elsewhere. In addition, some of our products are produced and marketed under contract as part of special certification programs such as organic, kosher or non-GMO, and must comply with the strict standards of federal, state and third party certifying organizations. Products that do not meet regulatory or third party standards may be considered adulterated or misbranded and subject to withdrawal or recall. Additionally, following the adoption of the Food Safety Modernization Act, the FDA is implementing additional regulations focused on the prevention of food contamination, more frequent inspection of high-risk facilities, increased record-keeping and improved traceability of food. 
Our manufacturing facility in Germany is subject to certain safety regulations, including the German Occupational Safety and Health Regulation. These regulations require us to comply with certain manufacturing safety standards to protect our employees from accidents. Additionally, some of the food commodities on which our business relies are subject to governmental agricultural programs (e.g., subsidies and import/export regulations), which have substantial effects on the prices and supplies of these commodities. In addition, we are subject to various federal, state and foreign laws and regulations regarding data privacy, including the E.U.’s General Data Protection Regulation and Privacy Shield, which apply to certain aspects of our business and deal with the collection and use of personal information obtained from data subjects of the E.U. Our business also is subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations with respect to environmental matters, including air quality, wastewater and storm water management, waste handling and disposal and other regulations intended to protect public health and the environment. In the U.S., the laws and regulations include the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the California Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act (“Proposition 65”), among others. Internationally, our operations, including our manufacturing facility in Germany, are subject to local and national regulations similar to those applicable to us in the U.S. We have made, and will continue to make, expenditures to ensure compliance with environmental regulations. 
Employees 
We have approximately 400 employees as of November 1, 2019. Of these employees, approximately 200 are in the U.S., approximately 175 are in Germany and approximately 10 are in other countries.

Emerging Growth Company Status 
As a company with less than $1.07 billion in gross revenue during our last fiscal year, we qualify as an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). We will continue to be an emerging growth company until the earliest to occur of: 

• | the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our IPO;


• | the last day of the fiscal year in which we have more than $1.07 billion in annual gross revenue;


• | the last day of the fiscal year in which we are deemed to be a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700.0 million as of the prior March 31 and we have been publicly reporting for at least 12 months; or


• | the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period.

For so long as we remain an emerging growth company, we are permitted and currently intend to rely on various provisions 
9

of the JOBS Act that contain exceptions from disclosure and other requirements that otherwise are applicable to companies that conduct initial public offerings and file periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). These JOBS Act provisions: 

• | permit us to include less than five years of selected financial data in this report;


• | permit us to include reduced disclosure regarding our executive compensation in our SEC filings as a public company;


• | provide an exemption from the independent public accountant attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;


• | provide an exemption from compliance with any new requirements adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to our auditor’s report in which the auditor would be required to provide additional information about the audit and our financial statements; and


• | provide an exemption from the requirement to hold non-binding stockholder advisory votes on executive compensation and on golden parachute arrangements not previously approved.

We have elected to take advantage of certain of the reduced disclosure obligations in this report, and we may elect to take advantage of other reduced reporting requirements in future filings. As a result, the information that we provide to our stockholders may be different than they might receive from other public reporting companies in which they hold equity interests. 
The JOBS Act also permits an emerging growth company such as us to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards applicable to public companies. This provision of the JOBS Act allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to not take advantage of the extended transition period, which means that the financial statements included in this report, as well as financial statements we file in the future, will be subject to all new or revised financial accounting standards generally applicable to public companies. Our election not to take advantage of the extended transition period is irrevocable.
