ITEM 1. | BUSINESS.
------------+----------

Overview
 
We are a boutique advisory firm, based in Boston, Massachusetts. Our team of experts, including entrepreneurs, angel investors, industry specialists and digital marketing professionals work with companies at all stages to provide assistance with capital raising, strategy, technology consulting and marketing.
 
We sometimes take equity stakes in promising technology start-ups. We play an active role in growing these companies by providing strategic advice, technology consulting, and help with capital raising. 
 
In those cases where we take an equity stake in an early-stage company for which we consult, we do not always record the investment as an asset on our books. Our policy is to record the investment, based on the value of our services rendered, only in instances where the early-stage company begins generating revenues. If the early-stage company is unable to generate revenues by the time we file our periodic reports, we do not consider our consulting services as revenue to our company.
 
One such company that we own equity in, as a result of our consulting services, is NetCapital Systems LLC (“Netcapital”). This company owns a Title III JOBS Act funding portal, and as of today is one of only a few dozen FINRA approved crowdfunding portals allowed to list securities in startup companies to non-accredited investors, via the Internet. We continue to consult for Netcapital (see https://netcapital.com) and have invested in additional early-stage companies that we met through Netcapital by providing our consulting services. 
 
In addition to the consulting we provide to Netcapital, we provide consulting services to some of our clients that utilize the Netcapital website to raise money from non-accredited and accredited investors. We believe we have been successful in providing advice and digital marketing services to our clients, who are allowed to advertise their fund raising, in conjunction with advertising provisions contained in the JOBS Act. During fiscal 2019, many high-tech firms have become our clients, including Braidy Industries, Inc., Phoenix PharmaLabs Inc, Vantem Global, LLC, Advanced Aesthetic Technologies, Inc., Ocean Renewable Power Company, Inc. and Centerline Biomedical. These companies have contributed to our growth this fiscal year and we expect that several of our current customers will continue to be a source of revenue generation in fiscal 2020.
 
Furthermore, we owned 12% of a company, KingsCrowd LLC, that recently raised the maximum amount it was seeking, $106,699, on the NetCapital portal. KingsCrowd was founded with the vision that everyone should have access to institutional grade research and analytics tools that enable informed startup investment decisions, regardless of investment experience.
 
We also consulted for Zelgor, a mobile phone game company, which builds massive multiplayer online social games on top of the real world map. It combines elements of classic arcade games and GPS technology, and ValueSetters currently owns 5% of Zelgor, which recently raised additional capital through the Netcapital platform. See http://www.zelgor.com.
 
Our limited operating history and the uncertain nature of our future operations and the markets we address or intend to address make prediction of our future results of operations difficult. 
 
Development of Business
 
We were incorporated in the State of Utah in April 1984 under our previous name, DBS Investments, Inc. A change of control of our company occurred in December 2003 and we changed our name to Valuesetters, Inc., when we, in conjunction with a plan of reorganization, merged with Valuesetters L.L.C., an Arizona limited liability corporation.
 
When the operations of Valuesetters failed to generate enough revenue to sustain its business, we terminated operations and looked to invest in another business. In order to take advantage of the increasing game activities on the Internet, on November 23, 2010, we signed a contract to purchase all the assets of NetGames.com, a company that owned several websites and operated a small Internet-based chess game known as Chess.net. In conjunction with the purchase of this website, Vaxstar LLC became the largest owner of our company. Vaxstar LLC also provided a working capital facility to the Company and is our senior secured lender.
 
As noted above, in 2014, we began our consulting business, and we now own a portion of several companies as a result of our consulting work. Many of these businesses operate solely on the Internet and many use the Internet to raise capital. We believe the value of our ownership interests in several of these companies may be significant. However, over the past several years, we reduced our book value of these investments to zero, based upon asset impairment guidelines, and once an asset has been designated as impaired, it cannot be recorded at its market value.
 
In addition to the equity stakes we have earned, our consulting business has generated the bulk of our revenues in fiscal 2019.

Competition
 
We compete with a number of public and private companies, which provide consulting services, electronic commerce and/or Internet games. Most of our competitors have significant financial resources and occupy entrenched positions in the market with name-brand recognition. We also face challenges from new Internet sites that aim to attract subscribers who seek to play interactive games and obtain ratings and status for superior playing skills. Such companies may be able to attract significantly more subscribers because of new marketing ideas and new game concepts.
 
The barriers to entry into most Internet markets are relatively low, making them accessible to a large number of entities and individuals. We believe the principal competitive factors in our industry that create certain barriers to entry include but are not limited to reputation, technology, financial stability and resources, proven track record of successful operations, critical mass, and independent oversight and transparency of business practices. While these barriers will limit those able to enter or compete effectively in the market, it is likely that new competitors as well as laws and regulations of governmental authority will be established in the future, in addition to our known current competitors.
 
Increased competition from current and future competitors may in the future materially adversely affect our business, revenues, operating results and financial condition.
 
Industry Regulation
 
We are subject, both directly and indirectly, to various laws and regulations relating to our business. If any of the laws are amended, compliance could become more expensive and directly affect our income. We intend to comply with such laws, but new restrictions may arise that could materially adversely affect our Company.
Research and Development
 
We do not currently have a budget specifically allocated for research and development purposes.
 
Employees
 
As of July 31, 2019, we had four full-time employees.
 
We consider our corporate secretary, Mr. Avi Liss, to be an independent board member. Mr. Liss is an attorney with his own legal practice, and advises us on a non-compensated basis. We do not pay him a salary and we do not consider him an employee.
Corporate Information
 
We maintain a corporate website with the address http://www.valuesetters.com/ and our chess game maintains a website with the address http://www.chess.net/.
