ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview 
 
Enservco Corporation (“Enservco”) and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively referred to as the “Company”, “we” or “us”) provides various services to the domestic onshore oil and natural gas industry. These services include frac water heating, hot oiling and acidizing (well enhancement services) and water transfer services. The Company owns and operates a fleet of more than 450 specialized trucks, trailers, frac tanks and other well-site related equipment and serves customers in several major domestic oil and gas fields including the DJ Basin/Niobrara area in Colorado, the Bakken area in North Dakota, the Marcellus and Utica Shale area in Pennsylvania and Ohio, the Jonah Field, Green River and Powder River Basins in Wyoming, the Eagle Ford Shale in Texas, and the Stack and Scoop plays in the Anadarko Basin in Oklahoma.
 
Enservco was originally incorporated as Aspen Exploration Corporation under Delaware law on February 28, 1980 for the primary purpose of acquiring, exploring and developing oil and natural gas and other mineral properties. During the first half of 2009, Aspen disposed of its oil and natural gas producing assets and as a result was no longer engaged in active business operations. On June 24, 2010, Aspen entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization with Dillco Fluid Service, Inc. (“Dillco”) which set forth the terms by which Dillco became a wholly owned subsidiary of Aspen on July 27, 2010. On December 30, 2010, Aspen changed its name to “Enservco Corporation.” 
 
The Company’s executive (or corporate) offices are located at 999 18th Street, Suite 1925N, Denver, CO 80202. Our telephone number is (303) 333-3678, and our facsimile number is (720) 974-3417. Our website is www.enservco.com.

Certain former members of Adler are also parties to the Agreement. Adler is a provider of frac water heating and hot oiling services, whose assets consist primarily of vehicles and equipment, with a complementary base of customers in several oil and gas producing basins where the Company operates.
  
Overview of Business Operations
 
Enservco primarily conducts its business operations through its principal operating subsidiaries (Heat Waves, HWWM, and Adler), which provide oil field services to the domestic onshore oil and natural gas industry. These services include frac water heating, hot oiling, pressure testing, acidizing, water transfer, bacteria and scale treatment, freshwater and saltwater hauling, fluid disposal, frac tank rental, well site construction and other general oil field services. As described in the table above, certain assets utilized by Heat Waves, HWWM, and Adler in their business operations are owned by other subsidiary entities. The Company currently operates in the following geographic regions: 

● | Rocky Mountain Region, including eastern Colorado and southern Wyoming (D-J Basin and Niobrara formations), central Wyoming (Powder River and Green River Basins), northwestern New Mexico (San Juan Basin), and western North Dakota and eastern Montana (Bakken area). The Rocky Mountain Region operations are deployed from Heat Waves’ and Adler's operations centers in Killdeer, ND, Williston, ND; Rock Springs, WY, Douglas, WY, and, Platteville, CO.

Historically, the Company focused its growth strategy on strategic acquisitions of operating companies and expansion of services through capital investment consisting of the acquisition and fabrication of property and equipment. That strategy also included expanding into new geographical territories as well as expanding the services it provides. These strategies are exemplified by these activities: 
 

(1) | From 2014 through 2016, the Company spent approximately $33.7 million for the acquisition and fabrication of additional frac water heating, hot oiling, and acidizing equipment; and during 2018, acquired the outstanding membership interests of Adler Hot Oil Services, LLC, a provider of frac water heating and hot oiling services, for a gross aggregate purchase price of approximately $12.5 million.
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | To expand its footprint, in early 2010 Heat Waves began providing services in the Marcellus Shale natural gas field in southwestern Pennsylvania and West Virginia, and in September 2011 Heat Waves extended its services into the D-J Basin / Niobrara formation and the Bakken formation through opening new operation centers in southern Wyoming and western North Dakota, respectively. In late 2012 the Company expanded its operations, through its Pennsylvania operation center, into the Utica Shale formation in eastern Ohio. Also, in early 2015 the Company expanded its operations into the Eagle Ford formation through opening a new operations center in southern Texas. In early 2019, the Company expanded operations in the Powder River Basin by opening a new operations center in Douglas, Wyoming.
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(3) | To expand its services, in January 2016, Enservco acquired various water transfer assets for approximately $4.3 million in order to provide water transfer services to its customers in all of its operating areas. 


(4) | During 2018, we acquired Adler Hot Oil Service, LLC in order to expand our market share in the Bakken formation, DJ Basin, and Marcellus/Utica shale formation.
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
During 2018, relatively stable commodity prices and rig activity in North America resulted in modest increases in production and completion activities by our customers, which led to generally stronger demand for our services. While demand and pricing for the services we provide remain below levels we experienced before the industry downturn that began in the last half of 2014, we believe current activity levels will support continued modest improvement in both metrics. The Company has reacted to increases in demand by allocating resources to our most active customers and basins, as we focus on increasing utilization levels and optimizing the deployment of our equipment and workforce, and maintaining a high service quality and safety record. The recent market recovery has also allowed us to compete on the basis of the quality and breadth of our service offerings, as our customers focus on optimization in production. As of March 15, 2019, we had approximately $35.2 million outstanding and $1.6 million available under our revolving credit facility. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for further information.
 
Operating Entities
 
As noted above, Enservco conducts its business operations and holds assets primarily through its subsidiary entities. The following describes the operations and assets of Enservco’s operating subsidiaries. 
 
Heat Waves. Heat Waves provides a range of well stimulation/maintenance services to a diverse group of independent and major oil and natural gas companies. The primary services provided are intended to: 

(1) | Assist in the fracturing of formations for newly drilled oil and natural gas wells; and
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | Help maintain and enhance the production of existing wells throughout their productive life.
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
These services consist of frac water heating, hot oiling and acidizing. Heat Waves also provides some water hauling and well site construction services. Heat Waves’ operations are currently in the major oil and natural gas areas in Colorado, Montana, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas, West Virginia, and Wyoming.
 
HWWM. HWWM provides water transfer services and equipment rental to customers in the oil and natural gas industry. Water transfer entails using high and low volume pumps, lay flat hose, aluminum pipe and manifolds to move fresh and/or recycled water from a water source such as a well, pond, lake, river, stream, or water storage facility to frac tanks at drilling locations to be used in connection with well completion activities. 
 
Adler. Adler provides frac water heating, hot oiling, and ancillary services to major oil and natural gas companies in Colorado, North Dakota, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. Adler was established as a Delaware Limited Liability Company on September 25, 2013.

Areas of Operations
 
The following map shows the primary areas in which the Company currently operates.

Business Segments
 
Enservco, through its operating subsidiaries, provides a range of services to owners and operators of oil and natural gas wells in the following business segments. 
 
Well Enhancement Services

The Company’s well enhancement services consist of frac water heating, acidizing, hot oiling services, and pressure testing. These services are provided primarily by Heat Waves and Adler which, as of December 31, 2018 utilized a fleet of 246 custom designed trucks and other related equipment. Heat Waves’ operations are currently in northwestern Oklahoma, Texas panhandle, Wyoming (Niobrara), Colorado (D-J Basin), southwestern Pennsylvania/northwestern West Virginia (Marcellus Shale), eastern Ohio (Utica Shale), western North Dakota and eastern Montana (Bakken formation), and southern Texas (Eagle Ford Shale). Well enhancement services accounted for approximately 91% and 94% of the Company’s total revenues for fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
 
Frac Water Heating – Frac Water Heating is the process of heating water used in connection with the fracturing process of completing a well. Fracturing services are intended to enhance the production from crude oil and natural gas wells through the creation of conductive flowpaths to enable the hydrocarbons to reach the wellbore where the natural flow has been restricted by underground formations. The fracturing process consists of pumping a fluid slurry, which largely consists of fresh water and a proppant into a well at sufficient pressure to fracture (i.e. create conductive flowpaths) the formation. To ensure these solutions are properly mixed and can flow freely, during certain parts of the year the water frequently needs to be heated to a sufficient temperature as determined by the well owner/operator. As of December 31, 2018, Heat Waves and Adler owned and operated a fleet of 80 frac heaters designed to heat large amounts of water. 
 
Acidizing - Acidizing entails pumping large volumes of specially formulated acids and/or chemicals into a well to dissolve materials blocking the flow of the crude oil or natural gas. The acid is pumped into the well under pressure. Acidizing is most often used to increase permeability throughout the formation, clean up formation damage near the wellbore caused by drilling, and to remove buildup of materials restricting the flow of crude oil and gas through perforations in the well casing. For most customers, Heat Waves supplies the acid solution and also pumps that solution into a given well. As of December 31, 2018, Heat Waves owned and operated a fleet of 7 acidizing units, each of which consist of a specially designed acid pump truck and an acid transport trailer.
 
Hot Oil Services – Hot oil services involve the circulation of a heated fluid, typically oil, to dissolve, melt, or dislodge paraffin or other hydrocarbon deposits from the tubing of a producing well. Paraffin deposits build up over time from normal production operations, although the rate at which this paraffin builds up depends on the chemical character of the crude oil or natural gas being produced. These services are performed by circulating and heating oil from a well through a hot oil truck and then pumping it down the casing and back up the tubing to remove the deposits. As of December 31, 2018, Heat Waves and Adler owned and operated a fleet of 73 Hot Oiling units. Based on customer needs and seasonal conditions, these vehicles are deployed among the service regions as necessary in seeking to maximize their productive time.
 
Hot oil servicing also includes the heating of oil storage tanks. The heating of storage tanks is done (i) to eliminate frozen water and other soluble waste in the tank for which the operator’s revenue is reduced at the refinery; and (ii) because heated oil flows more efficiently from the tanks to transports taking oil to the refineries in colder weather.
 


 9



Pressure Testing – Pressure testing consists of pumping fluids into new or existing wells or other components of the well system such as flow lines to detect leaks. Hot oil trucks and pressure trucks are used to perform this service.
 
Water Transfer Services
 
 Water Transfer Services – Water transfer entails using high and low volume pumps, lay flat hose, aluminum pipe and manifolds to move fresh and/or recycled water from a water source such as a pond, lake, river, stream, or storage facility to frac tanks at drilling locations to be used in connection with fracking activities. Water transfer differs from water hauling in that water transfer is typically used in connection with well completion activities and involves moving water via pumps, hoses and pipes whereas water hauling involves moving water via bobtail trucks or water transports for either service or completion work. Water transfer services accounted for approximately 9% and 6% of the Company’s total revenues for fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively.
 
Ownership of Company Assets 
 
The Company owns various equipment and other assets to provide its services and products. Substantially all of the equipment and personal property assets owned by these entities are subject to security interests from the company's Loan and Security Agreement with its bank lender.
 
Historically, as supply and demand require, the Company has leased additional trucks and equipment from time to time. These leases are generally for periods of less than one year, and therefore are treated as operating leases for accounting purposes, and the rent expense associated with these leases is reported ratably over the term of the lease. 
 
Competitive Business Conditions
 
We face intense competition in our operations. Competition is influenced by factors such as price, capacity, the quality/safety-record/availability of equipment and work crews, and the reputation and experience of the service provider. The Company believes that an important competitive factor in establishing and maintaining long-term customer relationships is having an experienced, skilled, and well-trained work force that is responsive to our customers’ needs. Although we believe customers consider all of these factors, price is often the primary factor in determining which service provider is awarded work.
 
The demand for our services fluctuates primarily in relation to the domestic commodity price (or anticipated price) of oil and natural gas which, in turn, is largely driven by the domestic and worldwide supply of, and demand for, oil and natural gas, political events, as well as speculation within the financial markets. Demand and prices are often volatile and difficult to predict and depend on events that are not within our control. Generally, as supply of oil and natural gas decreases and demand increases, service and maintenance requirements increase as oil and natural gas producers drill new wells and attempt to maximize the productivity of their existing wells to take advantage of the higher priced environment. Conversely, as the supply of commodities increase and demand and crude oil and natural gas prices fall, oil and gas producers drill fewer wells and scale back or suspend service and maintenance work. 
 
 10



The Company’s competition primarily consists of small and large regional or local contractors. The Company attempts to differentiate itself from its competition in large part through its range, availability, and quality of services it has the capability to provide. The Company invests a significant amount of capital into purchasing, developing, and maintaining a fleet of trucks and other equipment that are critical to the services it provides. Further, the Company concentrates on providing services to a diverse group of major and independent oil and natural gas companies in a number of geographical areas. We believe we have been successful using this business model and believe it will enable us to grow our business in the event the oil and gas industry has continuing need for the type of service we provide. 
Dependence on One or a Few Major Customers
 
The Company serves numerous major and independent oil and natural gas companies that are active in our core areas of operations. 
 
As of December 31, 2018, no single customer comprised more than 10% of the Company’s accounts receivable balance. Revenues from one customer represented approximately 10% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018. 
 
While the Company believes its equipment could be redeployed in the current market environment if it lost any material customers, such loss could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business until the equipment is redeployed. We believe that the market for the Company’s services is sufficiently diversified that it is not dependent on any single customer or a few major customers. Further, the Company believes that if our customers shift production from any of the geographies in which we operate, we could effectively re-deploy our equipment into other geographies.
 
Seasonality

A significant portion of the Company’s operations is impacted by seasonal factors, particularly with regard to its frac water heating and hot oiling services. In 2018, approximately 70% of revenue was earned during the first and fourth fiscal quarters. In regard to frac water heating, because customers rely on Heat Waves to heat large amounts of water for use in fracturing formations, demand for this service is much greater in the colder months. Similarly, hot oiling services are in higher demand during the colder months when they are needed for maintenance of existing wells and to heat oil storage tanks.
 
Acidizing and pressure testing are performed throughout the year with higher revenues typically during non-winter months.
 
We believe water transfer services are not seasonal. However, our water transfer services depend upon the level of drilling, well completion, and production activities.
 
Raw Materials

             The Company purchases a wide variety of raw materials, parts, and components that are made by other manufacturers and suppliers for our use. The Company is not dependent on any single source of supply for those parts, supplies or materials. However, there are a limited number of vendors for propane and certain acids and chemicals. The Company utilizes a limited number of suppliers and service providers available to fabricate and/or construct the trucks and equipment used in its hot oiling, frac water heating, and acid related services.
 
 11



Patents, Trademarks, Licenses, Franchises, Concessions, Royalty Agreements or Labor Contracts
 
As is the situation with all companies in the frac water heating service business, we rely on certain procedures and practices in performing our services. In 2016, we were issued our first patent relating to an aspect of the frac water heating process. We have other patent applications pending regarding other procedures used in our process of heating frac water. Further, Adler has been issued three United States patents and one Canadian patent and has two United States patents pending related to aspects of the frac water heating process. We are aware that one unrelated company has been awarded four patents related, in part, to a process for heating of frac water. For a further discussion of this, see Item 3 – Litigation, below. 
 Government Regulation
The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to a variety of government regulations ranging from environmental to Occupational Safety and Health Act ("OSHA") to the Department of Transportation. Our operations are also subject to stringent federal, state and local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to health and safety or the protection of the environment. These federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment, wildlife protection, historic preservation, and health and safety are extensive and changing. The trend in environmental legislation and regulation is generally toward stricter standards, and we expect that this trend will continue as governmental agencies issue and amend existing regulations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations as they currently exist or may be amended in the future may result in the assessment of substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties, as well as the issuance of injunctions limiting or prohibiting activities. Adherence with these regulatory requirements increases our cost of doing business and consequently affects our profitability. The Company does not believe that it is in material violation of any regulations that would have a significant negative impact on the Company’s operations. 
 
Through the routine course of providing services, the Company handles and stores bulk quantities of hazardous materials. If leaks or spills of hazardous materials handled, transported or stored by us occur, the Company may be responsible under applicable environmental laws for costs of remediating any damage to the surface or sub-surface (including aquifers). 
 
 12



The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), also known as “Superfund,” and comparable state statutes impose strict, joint and several liability on owners and operators of sites and on persons who disposed of or arranged for the disposal of “hazardous substances” found at such sites. It is not uncommon for the government to file claims requiring cleanup actions, demands for reimbursement for government-incurred cleanup costs, or natural resource damages, or for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances released into the environment. The Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, or RCRA, and comparable state statutes govern the disposal of “solid waste” and “hazardous waste” and authorize the imposition of substantial fines and penalties for noncompliance, as well as requirements for corrective actions. Although CERCLA currently excludes petroleum from its definition of “hazardous substance,” state laws affecting our operations may impose clean-up liability relating to petroleum and petroleum-related products. In addition, although RCRA classifies certain oil field wastes as “non-hazardous,” such exploration and production wastes could be reclassified as hazardous wastes thereby making such wastes subject to more stringent handling and disposal requirements. CERCLA, RCRA and comparable state statutes can impose liability for clean-up of sites and disposal of substances found on drilling and production sites long after operations on such sites have been completed. Other statutes relating to the storage and handling of pollutants include the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, or OPA, which requires certain owners and operators of facilities that store or otherwise handle oil to prepare and implement spill response plans relating to the potential discharge of oil into surface waters. The OPA contains numerous requirements relating to prevention of, reporting of, and response to oil spills into waters of the United States. State laws mandate oil cleanup programs with respect to contaminated soil. A failure to comply with OPA’s requirements or inadequate cooperation during a spill response action may subject a responsible party to civil or criminal enforcement actions.
 
In the course of the Company’s operations, it does not typically generate materials that are considered “hazardous substances.” One exception, however, would be spills that occur prior to well treatment materials being circulated down hole. For example, if the Company spills acid on a roadway as a result of a vehicle accident in the course of providing well enhancement/stimulation services, or if a tank with acid leaks prior to down hole circulation, the spilled material may be considered a “hazardous substance.” In this respect, the Company may occasionally be considered to “generate” materials that are regulated as hazardous substances and, as a result, may incur CERCLA liability for cleanup costs. Also, claims may be filed for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other pollutants.
 
The Clean Water Act (the “CWA”), and comparable state statutes, impose restrictions and controls on the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of oil and other substances, into waters of the United States. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) or an analogous state agency. The CWA regulates storm water run-off from oil and natural gas facilities and requires a storm water discharge permit for certain activities. Such a permit requires the regulated facility to monitor and sample storm water run-off from its operations. The CWA and regulations implemented thereunder also prohibit discharges of dredged and fill material in wetlands and other waters of the United States unless authorized by an appropriately issued permit. The CWA and comparable state statutes provide for civil, criminal and administrative penalties for unauthorized discharges of oil and other pollutants and impose liability on parties responsible for those discharges for the costs of cleaning up any environmental damage caused by the release and for natural resource damages resulting from the release.
The Safe Drinking Water Act (the “SDWA”), and the Underground Injection Control (“UIC”) program promulgated thereunder, regulate the drilling and operation of subsurface injection wells, such as the disposal wells owned and operated by the Company. The EPA directly administers the UIC program in some states and in others the responsibility for the program has been delegated to the state. The program requires that a permit be obtained before drilling a disposal well. Violation of these regulations and/or contamination of groundwater by oil and natural gas drilling, production, and related operations may result in fines, penalties, and remediation costs, among other sanctions and liabilities under the SWDA and state laws. In addition, third party claims may be filed by landowners and other parties claiming damages for alternative water supplies, property damages, and bodily injury.
 
 13



Regulations in the states in which the Company owns and operates water injection wells (Oklahoma) require us to obtain a permit to operate each of our disposal wells. The applicable regulatory agency may suspend or modify one of our permits if the Company’s well operations are likely to result in pollution of freshwater, substantial violation of permit conditions or applicable rules, or if the well leaks into the environment. 
 
The Federal Energy Policy Act of 2005 amended the SDWA to exclude hydraulic fracturing from the definition of “underground injection” under certain circumstances. However, the repeal of this exclusion has been advocated by certain advocacy organizations and others in the public. The EPA at the request of Congress conducted a national study examining the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources and issued a final assessment report in December 2016, which concluded that hydraulic fracturing activities can impact drinking water resources under some circumstances and identifies factors that influence these impacts.
 
We incur, and expect to continue to incur, capital and operating costs to comply with the environmental laws and regulations described herein. The technical requirements of these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly complex, stringent and expensive to implement. 
 
If new federal or state laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted, such legal requirements could result in delays, eliminate certain drilling and injection activities, make it more difficult or costly for our customers to perform fracturing and increase their and our costs of compliance and doing business. It is also possible that drilling and injection operations utilizing our services could adversely affect the environment, which could result in a requirement to perform investigations or clean-ups or in the incurrence of other unexpected material costs or liabilities.
 
Significant studies and research have been devoted to climate change and global warming, and climate change has developed into a major political issue in the United States and globally. Certain research suggests that greenhouse gas emissions contribute to climate change and pose a threat to the environment. Recent scientific research and political debate has focused in part on carbon dioxide and methane incidental to oil and natural gas exploration and production. Many state governments have enacted legislation directed at controlling greenhouse gas emissions, and future state and federal legislation and regulation could impose additional restrictions or requirements in connection with our operations and favor use of alternative energy sources, which could increase operating costs and decrease demand for oil products. As such, our business could be materially adversely affected by domestic and international legislation targeted at controlling climate change.
 
We are also subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, including OSHA, and comparable state laws, whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of the federal Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act and comparable state statutes require that information be maintained concerning hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens.
 
Because our trucks travel over public highways to get to customers’ wells, the Company is subject to the regulations of the Department of Transportation. These regulations are very comprehensive and cover a wide variety of subjects from the maintenance and operation of vehicles to driver qualifications to safety. Violations of these regulations can result in penalties ranging from monetary fines to a restriction on the use of the vehicles. Under regulations effective July 1, 2010, an uncured violation of regulations could result in a shutdown of all of the vehicles of Heat Waves, Adler, or HWWM. The Company does not believe it is in violation of Department of Transportation regulations at this time that would result in a shutdown of vehicles.
 
 14



Some states and certain municipalities have regulated, or are considering regulating hydraulic fracturing (“fracking”) which, if accomplished, could impact certain of our operations. While the Company does not believe that existing regulations and contemplated actions to limit or prohibit fracking have impacted its activities to date, there can be no assurance that these actions, if taken on a wider scale, may not adversely impact the Company’s business operations and revenues. 
 
Employees
 
As of February 28, 2019, the Company employed 231 full time employees. Of these employees, 149 are employed by Heat Waves, 29 by Adler, 36 by HWWM, and 17 are employed by Enservco. From time to time, the Company may hire contractors to perform work.
