ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
History and Development of Business
 
GEX Management, Inc. was originally formed in 2004 as Group Excellence Management, LLC. d/b/a MyEasyHQ. In March of 2016, it was converted from a limited liability company into a C corporation and changed its name to GEX Management, Inc. in April of 2016. GEX Management obtained its license to operate as a Professional Employer Organization (PEO), and established GEX Staffing, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of GEX Management, in March 2017 in order to begin distinguishing its staffing and PEO operations.
 
Carl Dorvil founded Group Excellence, LLC, a tutoring and mentoring company, from his dorm room at Southern Methodist University in 2004. Group Excellence provided tutoring and mentoring services to students with the goal of inspiring young persons to pursue high personal and academic achievement. The company quickly grew to more than six hundred employees. In 2011, Group Excellence was on Inc. 500’s annual list of the 500 fastest growing private companies in the United States.
 
In response to rapid growth, Mr. Dorvil developed GEX Management to facilitate the back-office functions of his company. GEX Management provided Group Excellence, LLC with human resources, IT, accounting/bookkeeping, social media, payroll, and conducted a majority of the overall operations of the company. Mr. Dorvil sold Group Excellence, LLC in 2011 but maintained ownership of GEX Management, which continued as a Professional Services Company providing back office support to the tutoring company, as well as third-party clients. In 2016 GEX Management revised its business model to provide staffing and back-office services to a wide variety of industries in order to expand the Company’s footprint, thereby building on the previous 12-year history of exceptional client service. On February 23, 2018, the US Secretary of Commerce, Wilbur Ross, mentioned at the “African American Leaders in the White House: Education, Business and Policy” that Dorvil was “the youngest African American CEO ever to take a company public in U.S. history.”
 
Over the last few years, GEX Management experienced tremendous growth in sales and customer pipeline - staffing business grew by over 1600%+ from 2016 to 2017 with the firm being named among the “fastest growing public companies in the North Texas region” by the Dallas Morning News, while also significantly expanding its client footprints across multiple staffing, business consulting and PEO opportunities.
 
Under the current management, GEX Management has set strategic goals in 2019 to expand further into areas of higher margin and growth business categories particularly in the space of IT and Management Consulting as well as identify synergistic opportunities in healthcare sector to deliver significant cost rationalization, benefits and integrated staffing solutions to clients and customers alike. In February 2019, GEX Management was invited to be a Preferred Supplier for one of the largest Managed Service Providers to Fortune 100 Companies in the Enterprise Technology Consulting and Staffing solutions space which has resulted in a significant business development opportunity that is expected to result in a strong revenue pipeline for 2019 and beyond. Additionally, GEX executed a strategic staffing agreement with a leading Ohio based Healthcare group to deliver staffing, HR management, payroll processing and benefit administration services to the client’s healthcare and clinical practice centers in the mid-west region. Management expects these and other potential organic and inorganic growth opportunities to help the firm achieve strong revenue growth while also help move towards profitability by targeting higher margin, lower cost business models and relying on less expensive debt instruments to help reduce the burden across the firm’s capital structure while maximizing efficient use of operating capital.

Business Strategy
 
Our objective is to become a leading business management services company, and to continuously expand our client base. We seek to achieve this objective by continuing to implement our business strategy, which includes the primary elements enumerated below.
Marketing and Sales
 
Our comprehensive marketing efforts are fluid, adaptive, and results-driven. They comprise both traditional and non- traditional channels including print collateral, website, video, PowerPoint presentations, digital ads, social media posts and press releases. We likewise employ a small sales team. We strategically target small and mid-sized businesses that require the services we provide. Previously, a significant amount of corporate revenue has been derived through client referrals and management’s personal relationships. Our 2019 plan is to continue to leverage these important relationships while expanding our brand reach by means of integrated marketing campaigns, more timely, informative, and effectual messaging, and greater collaboration between marketing and sales in order to increase both client and sales growth.
Industry and Competitors
 
The PEO and Staffing industry is highly fragmented, resulting in robust competition. Competition affects our success in both the market segments we currently serve, as well as the new market segments we may enter in the future. We compete with several large business service companies, as well as PEOs and Administrative Service Organizations (“ASO”) that provide identical services to those GEX Management provides; some offer additional services. The financial and marketing resources of some of our competitors exceed those of GEX Management. Businesses primarily select a service provider based on price point/value, innovative/flexible product offerings, and quality of customer service.
Environmental Concerns
 
As a professional services company, federal, state or local laws that regulate the discharge of materials into the environment do not impact us.
