Item 1. Description of Business
Overview

We are a music technology company, that offers a suite of products and services that monetize and monitor music for artists, labels, performing rights organizations, publishers, writers, radio stations, venues, restaurants, bars, and other stakeholders in music. 
 
Our parent company, VNUE, Inc., was incorporated as a Nevada corporation on April 4, 2006. On May 29, 2015, VNUE, Inc. (formerly Tierra Grande Resources Inc.) (“we”, “us” or “Our”), acquired VNUE, Inc., a company incorporated pursuant to the laws of the State of Washington (“VNUE Washington” or “VNUE”), resulting in VNUE becoming our wholly owned subsidiary and the holders of VNUE controlling our outstanding shares. 
 
The acquisition of VNUE Washington was treated as a reverse acquisition, with VNUE Washington deemed the accounting acquirer of the company, and our publicly traded parent entity (formerly Tierra Grande Resources, Inc.) deemed the accounting acquiree under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with Section 805-10-55 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. 
 
The Company conducted a reverse stock split of the Company’s common stock at a ratio 1 for 10 of each share issued and outstanding on the effective date of April 15, 2017. The reverse was effective as to the market on August 7, 2017. All historical reported share amounts within have been adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split.
 
In 2017 we acquired our rights to the DiscLive entertainment assets and Set.fm™ technology, and in 2018 we acquired the SoundStr™ technology. We continue to develop these technologies. 
 
Presentation of Information

As used in this annual report, the terms “we”, “us”, “our” and the “Company” mean VNUE, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless the context requires otherwise. The term “VNUE” or “VNUE Washington” refers to our wholly owned operating subsidiary, VNUE, Inc. 
 
All dollar amounts in this annual report refer to US dollars unless otherwise indicated. 
 
Overview of our Current Business 
 
The live music and entertainment space is constantly searching for new monetization outlets. Music licensing and royalties are particular “hot button” issues in the industry. We believe that we have developed solutions that create new revenue streams, and simultaneously helps to protect the rights of the creators and will help ensure they are properly compensated. This befits not only artist, labels, publishers and live venues but the fans as well.
 
Through VNUE, Inc., our wholly owned subsidiary, we now carry on business as a live entertainment music technology company that offers a suite of products and services which monetize and monitor music for artists, labels, performing rights organizations, publishers, writers, radio stations, venues, restaurants, bars, and other stakeholders in music. Our two main product lines are: 
 
 
· | Set.fm™ / DiscLive Network™ - Our consumer app platform that allows fans to purchase the concert they just experienced instantly on their mobile device, and “instant” physical collectible products are recorded and sold at shows and online through the company’s exclusive partner DiscLive Network™, the 15-year pioneer in “instant live” recording. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Soundstr™ - Our technology which is a comprehensive music identification and rights management Cloud platform that, when fully deployed, can accurately track and audit public performances of music, creating a more transparent ecosystem for general music licensing and associated royalty payments, and will help to ensure the correct stakeholders are paid through the use of our “big data” collection.


While Set.fm™ and Soundstr™ are proprietary marks of the Company, DiscLive and its related marks and names are not owned by the Company and are owned or utilized by RockHose Live Media Productions, Inc. The Company has not filed any formal trademark applications relating to Set.fm™ with the United States US Patent and Trademark Office but has been using these marks openly since 2017 and claims common law rights to them.

We are a relatively new company. Our wholly owned VNUE subsidiary, only recently commenced operations in calendar year 2015 and we have undertaken mainly organizational activities and software application development. Our independent auditors have raised substantial doubts as to our ability to continue as a going concern without significant additional financing. Accordingly, for the foreseeable future, we will continue to be dependent on additional debt and equity financing in order to maintain our operations and continue with our development activities.
 
Acquisitions will be pursued where the Directors consider that there is clear value through the addition of expertise, customers, monetization potential or geographic footprint.
 
Our principal offices are located at 104 W. 29th Street, 11th Floor, New York, NY 10001. Our telephone number is 833-WE-R-LIVE. 
 
The History of VNUE
 
VNUE was founded in August of 2013 by Matthew Carona and Louis Mann with the vision of creating a collective network of connected venues that empower and assist bands, artists, and entertainers to monetize their performance (audio & video) in the venue using mobile technologies.
 
In 2014, VNUE acquired Lively LLC a Seattle based music technology company and direct-to-fan mobile platform that brings artists, fans and brands together by capturing the live performance. In 2016, Zach Bair, CEO, took control of VNUE, and his team determined that the Lively IP, although valuable, had not been developed to the point where it could be deployed with major recording artist clients, and the decision was made to build and/or acquire other technologies which would help the company realize its goals. Bair and his team set out to immediately reset the company’s direction.
 
DiscLive™ Exclusive License 
 
On July 10, 2017, we, through our wholly owned VNUE subsidiary, entered into a Licensing Agreement with RockHouse Live Media Productions, Inc., DBA “DiscLive” or “DiscLive Network” (“DiscLive”) (DiscLive and related marks indicated herein are marks utilized by DiscLive and the Company disclaims rights to those names or marks) to formalize the terms of the Strategic Alliance entered into by the Company with DiscLive on July 21, 2016. This agreement provides VNUE with an exclusive license from DiscLive, for a period of three years unless earlier terminated under the Agreement, for the use of all its assets, including but not limited to the DiscLive brand, website (including eCommerce platform), intellectual property, inventory, equipment, trade secrets and anything related to its business of “instant live” recording. Under the terms of the Agreement, DiscLive granted the Company a worldwide exclusive license for the foregoing rights. In exchange for the license, DiscLive will receive a license fee equal to five percent (5%) of any sales derived from the sale and use of the products and services. DiscLive is controlled by our Chief Executive Officer.
Set.fm™ Acquisition
 
On October 16, 2017, the Company entered into an agreement with PledgeMusic, Inc., whereby the Company acquired the assets of the digital live music distribution platform Set.fm™ from PledgeMusic (See Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements herein). Set.fm™ allows us to record and sell live shows directly to fans’ mobile devices, uploading simultaneously with the artist’s performance, similar to the “instant live” physical distribution of DiscLive. The platform, which also features an innovative and easy-to-use DIY studio app, already boasts thousands of artists and tens of thousands of fans using it. VNUE has conducted updates, and intends to continually update, the Set.fm™ platform, to update and improve it, and has leveraged the platform for major label music clients and will continue to roll out additional functionality.
Soundstr™ Acquisition
 
On April 23, 2018, the Company entered into an agreement with MusicPlay Analytics, LLC (d/b/a Soundstr) (“Soundstr”) whereby the Company acquired the assets of Soundstr, a technology that aims to help businesses pay fairer music license fees based on actual music usage (see Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements herein). 
 
The Company intends to continually update the above technologies, funds and resources permitting.

Markets and Opportunity
 
Our business has two “end users” or revenue sources: 
 
 
· | the “consumer” side of the business, where we leverage our team’s expertise in recording live shows and releasing experiential content to fans immediately afterward (the “instant live” model), which consists of DiscLive, and Set.fm™, and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | the emerging market of Music Recognition Technology (MRT), which is a B2B model whereby we identify music being played in bars, restaurants, other businesses, and radio stations, and tracing that music back to the original songwriters so that we can ensure the correct stakeholders are being paid. This is the Soundstr cloud and hardware technology. Eventually we envision of this functionality being merged together.


The following sections are broken up accordingly.
 
Set.fm™ & DiscLive™: “Instant Live Recording and Experiential Products”
 
DiscLive and set.fm™ provide fans with “instant” experiential content, so that they may walk out of a concert and take home their experience. The concert never ends with DiscLive and Set.fm™. With the increase in digital media (and related piracy issues), music concerts and related media and merchandising and events (e.g. post concert shows etc.) are becoming the primary driver in music revenues today. 
How Instant Live Recording Works? 
 
Teams follow tours and record major artists and release high quality products instantly via the set.fm™ mobile app and DiscLive physical products (online and onsite), capturing the emotion of the moment and translating that to sales. Set.fm™ also offers “indie” artists a free “Set.fm Studio” app to record themselves and sell their music on our platform. DiscLive is the pioneer, and VNUE CEO helmed that company since 2004, as well as EMI/Capitol Records version (2009-2012), called “Abbey Road Live”. Thousands of shows have been recorded all over the world and tens of thousands of products sold. Major artist clients (past and current) include Rob Thomas, Peter Frampton, King’s X, Bad Company, Slash, Seether, Devo, Blondie, and many others.
Size of the Instant Live Recording Market
 
According to Statistica, the global music business is currently valued at $51.5 billion. Within that market, live music revenue is projected to be over $31 billion by 2022, according to Pricewaterhouse Coopers. With sufficient capital that will be deployed into sales, marketing and branding resources, we believe that we can capture between $50-$100 million annually within three years with our experiential products.
Instant Live Recording

Revenue Model
 
Based on our team’s 14+ years of operations (through DiscLive, Abbey Road Live when aligned with EMI, and Set.fm), thousands of shows recorded around the world, and data collection available to us, we believe that the average sales conversion is 15%, with product prices averaging $25. This means that at a show of 1000 people attending, based on previous statistics, 150 of those people would purchase one of our products. With just ten tours of 20 tour dates each, and an audience of only 2500 per show, revenue potential is $1.875 million. With our upcoming 2019 Rob Thomas tour, we are estimating revenues of $1 million for just that one tour. We also market our products worldwide through our e-Commerce websites and through effective use of social networks. No assurance can be made that past results will be indicative of future results however, and a number of economic and technological factors could adversely affect our consumer spending habits. 
Growth Potential for Instant Live Recording
 
This is a model that is scaled through the use of technology, software and hardware that we have specifically assembled to address our proprietary business practices which have been honed over the years, staffed with readily available contract personnel that we train specifically for our model. This does not age out. It is very much the “Ray Kroc” model, translated to music services, where the processes are repeatable, and we have an unbeatable product and service line. Since the business is primarily built on relationships, our ability to scale is only limited by access to capital. Scaling the opportunity is as simple as accessing the capital to acquire the equipment and contract labor to cover more tours.

Barriers to Entry & Obsolescence
 
We do not believe that our instant live recording business has any direct competitors at this time, and there are no known competitors to the Set.fm immediate distribution platform. Currently, fans merely take poor quality videos and audio recordings and just spread them (without obtaining intellectual property rights) on whatever social media they use. We believe, however, that our team has the time-tested trust of the music industry and proprietary processes and trade secrets developed over a decade that create substantial barriers to entry. Management has found that other companies have tried to enter the space in different formats but none have the industry trust, business processes and trade secrets that the Company has developed. We believe that because our focus is on creating experiential content, delivered instantly, in the manner in which the fan wants it (particularly digitally), our user base will continue to grow with repeat users. As the industry evolves, so will the manner in which concert-goers consume their content, and VNUE management believes that continued R&D and marketing is necessary to stay a step ahead.
 
Unlike a typical startup, Set.fm and DiscLive is a real product offering with measurable results, recognized brands, and a leadership team with deep domain experience, execution, and relationships. 
 
Soundstr™ 
 
VNUE acquired the Soundstr technology in mid-2018. Soundstr™ is a patent-pending hardware/cloud-based Music Recognition Technology (MRT) platform that some have compared to the app “Shazam,” but which is focused on businesses such as radio stations, bars, restaurants, and other real-world scenarios that involve the public performance of music.
How Soundstr Works; PROs?
 
Anywhere that music is played in a public setting, such as radio stations, bars, restaurants, etc., it must be licensed by law. Royalties are required to be paid to the creators (songwriters, publishers) or rights holders when that music played in a public domain. Organizations called “Performing Rights Organizations,” a.k.a. PROs, are responsible for assessing and collecting royalties. Unfortunately, there has previously been no technology to accurately track and audit exactly what music is being played, and consequently licensees have to agree to “blanket” agreements, which are usually expensive, and whereby any music that a PRO is responsible for would be licensed, if it is theoretically played. The problem with this scenario is that due to the lack of tracking technology, there is inherent inaccuracy in which stakeholders (usually writers and artists) are paid, and further to that, in some cases, only a fraction of that PRO’s catalog may actually be played. Additionally, these businesses venues are so significant in number and yet so spread out in terms of location that this becomes extremely difficult to monitor let alone collect and enforce. This creates a massive market shortfall and discrepancy of licensing fees that would otherwise be generated from these businesses. 
 
Soundstr™ has been created to address this, streamline it, and eliminate errors in royalty allocation. Soundstr™ listens to music, records it, and uploads it to the Cloud, where it is processed for identification via artificial intelligence (AI) and other means. Once the music is identified, several industry-leading databases are accessed to assemble deep metadata, and further processing is accomplished to build our own deep, authoritative database so that VNUE can create an accurate audit record of what has actually been played, and help to ensure the correct stakeholders are paid - while at the same time encouraging unlicensed venues to become licensed, and through the use of data, giving businesses the ability to negotiate more competitive licensing fees. Eventually, our system will support direct licensing. This creates a win for everyone involved - writers, publishers, artists, PROs, venues, and the other stakeholders.
 
Size of the Soundstr™ Market
 
Based on FCC data, as of 2019 there are 15,330 radio stations in the USA, and over 44,000 worldwide (CIA, 2010). According to Statistica, there are over 700,000 bars, taverns and restaurants in the US, and millions globally. Between the combined segments there is more than $500 million potential in recurring revenue per year. There are even more opportunities in various other verticals.
 
Soundstr™ Revenue Model
 
Soundstr™ is a subscription model whereby radio stations and other businesses would “sign up” and subscribe for a monthly, annual or other fee. This product line is currently is about 80% complete, with our hardware already 100% complete). Further development is required for additional automation. Each location will be charged an installation fee and a monthly automated subscription charge. In addition to the subscription amount, we will also charge a percentage of the net savings from being able to reduce the licensing fees radio stations pay to PROs. For bars, restaurants, and other similar “brick and mortar” businesses we will likely charge a monthly fee, or it will be offered for free due to advertising revenue which will offset the monthly cost of the unit. Soundstr™ also has a built-in “beacon” technology to allow VNUE to push the aforementioned targeted advertising using geo-centric mobile applications. That revenue offsets the cost to the business owner and adds additional revenue to VNUE’s profit center.

Growth Potential for Soundstr™ 
 
Initially Soundstr™ will be rolled out to radio (we already have one contract), and then to brick and mortar establishments. This is because there is more opportunity to scale quickly in radio, with large consolidated radio groups having single decision makers, rather than thousands upon thousands of individual business owners. For radio stations and other “professional” clients, VNUE will install the Soundstr devices and provide fee-based services. We plan to roll out Soundstr™ as a self-installed item for brick and mortar establishments, which will be fulfilled via Amazon, allowing for greater scale and lower cost. Currently there are 450 Soundstr™ devices already built in China awaiting import pending funding. Our plan is to have those devices into the country and deployed within 12 months, during which time our goal will be to raise additional funds to manufacture 10,000 more units. At that scale, each unit is $21 each. The 450 units will get us to approximately $1.21 million in revenue deployed almost exclusively in radio stations. The deployment and roll out of additional units is dependent upon funding. Assuming we are able to build and deploy 10,000 units, revenues will hit $36 million annually, not taking into account additional revenues from anticipated reduction in fees charged to clients by the PROs. It will take approximately $8-10 million to get us to $36 million in revenue. Our manufacturer has advised us that it is capable of manufacturing 10,000-20,000 units per month. Over time we hope to have both radio stations as well as other brick and mortar establishments and venues. This product also provides potential growth due to advertisement, sales of data etc. We believe that the data we will be collecting could potentially be one of the strongest revenue drivers.
Barriers to Entry & Obsolescence
 
Currently the PROs “attempt” to fill the void only in part, by employing statistical data and guesswork which, we believe leaves no room for independents or new media. Accordingly, we are not aware of any direct competitors. This market, we believe, is “white hot” however, and we believe will quickly become competitive. There is a great deal of interest in MRT, and some smaller startups in Europe have deployed technology to track DJ music (electronic), which is only a small subset of what we are able to capture (live, recorded, DJ, karaoke, radio, etc.). 
 
We have patent-pending technology, USPTO Application US 2017/0316089, “System and Method for Capturing, Archiving and Controlling Content in a Performance Venue,” which creates a significant barrier to entry, and we expect to file more IP protection as we are funded. Another barrier to entry is the executive team, which has considerable success in the domain, as well as deep relationships. Because the system is predominantly Cloud-based, with software that evolves, we intend to continue maintain and update the software so as to remain relevant and effective. Our hardware is tablet based with some customized casing and components, and as technology continues to improve, our hardware will evolve as well, but will remain backward compatible. Additionally, as additional barriers to entry, we anticipate building open-architecture rack-mounted units, software plug-ins to compliment professional recording software and track internet radio, and in fact, we expect to combine Soundstr technology into Set.fm, so we can identify music we are recording on-the-fly and eventually enable “instant” and seamless licensing. This new technology be protected through additional patent filings.
 
License Agreement with Universal Music Corp.
 
On November 2, 2015, we entered into a License Agreement with Universal Music Corp. (“Universal”). The License Agreement is effective September 8, 2015, and had a term of Two (2) Years from the Effective Date. Under the terms of the License Agreement, Universal is granting to VNUE a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sub-licensable license to create and distribute content using certain Universal compositions, more specified in the Grant of Right’s section of the License Agreement. This agreement has since expired.
Key Business Strengths
 
Management believes that the key factors or features of our business that will contribute to VNUE’s success are:
 
Expertise and experience in “Instant Live” Content Production and Distribution - VNUE’s team members have been involved in the business of instant live content since 2003. VNUE’s CEO pioneered this concept and commercialized it with the original DiscLive in 2004, and has continued over the years to develop the processes and methodologies used to gain trust and a competitive advantage in the music business. Due to this lengthy history, and trust by major labels, management companies, and related parties, VNUE should remain in position of strength in terms of this model, and plans to continue to develop the model and introduce new innovative and immersive software features to fans.

Intellectual Property - VNUE has pending patents for our Soundstr™ technology, and expects to file more related patents around the Soundstr™ platform, as well as Set.fm™. 
 
The Company has not filed any formal trademark applications relating to Set.fm™ or Soundstr™ with the United States US Patent and Trademark Office but has been using these marks openly since approximately fall 2017 and spring 2018 respectively, although both marks had been in use well before our acquisition of the assets. 
 
We have patent-pending technology, USPTO Application US 2017/0316089, “System and Method for Capturing, Archiving and Controlling Content in a Performance Venue” which relates to our Soundstr™ technology. 
 
Employees
 
We currently have two full-time and seven part-time employees. We also currently engage independent contractors in the areas of accounting, legal and auditing services, corporate finance, as well as marketing and business development. The remuneration paid to our officers and directors will be more completely described elsewhere our audited financial statements. We expect to double the number of employees over the next 12-month period. We do and will continue to outsource contract employment as needed.
Reports to Security Holders 
 
We are subject to the reporting and other requirements of the Exchange Act and we intend to furnish our shareholders annual reports containing financial statements audited by our independent registered public accounting firm and to make available quarterly reports containing unaudited financial statements for each of the first three quarters of each year. We file Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Current Reports on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission in order to meet our timely and continuous disclosure requirements. We may also file additional documents with the Commission if they become necessary in the course of our company’s operations.
 
The public may read and copy any materials that we file with the SEC at the SEC’s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, D.C. 20549. The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC maintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. The address of that site is www.sec.gov.
 
Patents, Trademarks, Franchises, Royalty Agreements or Labor Contracts
 
As stated above we have patents pending for our Soundstr™ technology, and expect to file more patents and trademarks around technology we are developing or have already developed, or plan to develop, funds permitting. We will continue to assess the need for any copyright, trademark or patent applications on an ongoing basis.
Research and Development
 
We spent $12,369 on research and development activities during the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily related to the development of our proprietary software and we anticipate that we will incur additional costs on research and development over the next 12 months. Our planned expenditures on our operations are summarized under the section of this annual report entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Position and Results of Operations”.
