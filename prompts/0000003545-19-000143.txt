Overview
Alico is an agribusiness with a legacy of achievement and innovation in citrus and conservation. The Company owns approximately 111,000 acres of land in eight Florida counties (Charlotte, Collier, DeSoto, Glades, Hardee, Hendry, Highlands and Polk) including approximately 90,000 acres of mineral rights. Our principal lines of business are citrus groves and conservation. 
Alico is one of the largest citrus producers in the United States of America.
Alico, Inc. operates two divisions: Alico Citrus, a citrus producer, and Water Resources and Other Operations, a leading water storage and environmental services division.
The Company manages its land based upon its primary usage and reviews its performance based upon two primary classifications - Alico Citrus and Water Resources and Other Operations. Other Operations includes a lease for grazing rights, hunting leases, a lease to a third party of an aggregate mine and leases of oil extraction rights to third parties, farm lease revenue and rental income for office space. Alico presents its financial results and the related discussion based upon its two business segments: (i) Alico Citrus and (ii) Water Resources and Other Operations.
Recent Developments
Alico 2.0 Modernization Program
On November 16, 2017, we announced the Alico 2.0 Modernization Program (“Alico 2.0”). This program was intended to transform three legacy businesses (Alico, Orange Co., and Silver Nip) into a single efficient enterprise, Alico Citrus, so we would remain one of the leaders in the U.S. citrus industry. This initiative was to explore every aspect of Alico’s citrus and ranch operations, including corporate and operational cost structures, grove costs, purchasing and procurement, non-performing and under-performing assets, professional fees, and human resources efficiency.
Under this program, Alico expected to reduce its operating costs. Alico has executed on the efficiencies identified and has improved margins through better purchasing, more precise application of selected fertilizers and chemicals, outsourcing work such as harvesting, hauling, and certain caretaking tasks, and by streamlining grove management. We have also deployed a more efficient labor model that is consistent and uniform for field staffing and grove operations and is aligned with the geographical footprint of the citrus groves. This effort has helped to transition us to a high-quality, low-cost producer of citrus now and for future years to come.
In combination with these efforts, the Company worked to maintain operational efficiencies and deploy its resources to solidify the Company's position as a leader in the recovering citrus industry.
Under Alico 2.0, we also decided to divest assets that generated low rates of return and shut down parts of our operations that were not profitable. As a result of Alico 2.0, Alico has generated cash of approximately $57,800,000 through September 30, 2019 from asset sales. This has been facilitated through (i) the sale of its nursery in Gainesville, Florida, (ii) the sale of certain 
underperforming groves, (ii) the sale of its breeding herd, (iv) the sale of certain parcels of land on its Ranch, (v) the sale of certain trailers related to our logistics division, and (vi) the sale of certain real estate assets that were not strategic to our business plan.
In January 2018, the Company sold its breeding herd and leased grazing rights on the Ranch to a third party operator. However, the Company continues to own the property and continues to conduct its long-term dispersed water program and wildlife management programs. 
Alico 2.0 also included an enhanced program to plant more citrus trees. The Company planted over 400,000 trees in both the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 to help position the Company for future production growth.
Tender Offer
On September 5, 2018, the Board of Directors approved and Alico announced the commencement of an issuer offer (the “Tender Offer”) to purchase up to $19,999,990 in value of shares of its common stock at a purchase price of $34.00 per share. On October 3, 2018, upon the terms and subject to the conditions described in the Offer to Purchase dated September 5, 2018, Alico repurchased an aggregate of 752,234 shares at a price of $34.00 per share aggregating $25,575,956. These shares represented approximately 9.2% of the total number of shares of the Company’s common stock issued and outstanding as of October 2, 2018. Included in the 752,234 shares were 163,999 shares that the Company elected to purchase pursuant to its right to purchase up to an additional 2% of its outstanding shares of common stock. 734 Investors, LLC, (“734 Investors”) Alico’s largest stockholder from 2013 until November 12, 2019, participated in the Tender Offer by selling a small percentage of its holdings of the Company’s common stock. Members of neither the management team nor the Board of Directors sold any shares directly to the Tender Offer.
Termination Proceedings against Mr. Remy W. Trafelet
On November 19, 2018, Alico, with unanimous approval of the members of the Board of Directors, other than Remy W. Trafelet, notified Mr. Trafelet, who was at the time the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer and a member of the Board of Directors, that it intended to consider terminating his employment for “cause” pursuant to the terms of his employment agreement with the Company and option agreements entered into under the Company's Stock Incentive Plan of 2015 (collectively, the “Compensation Documents”). On November 28, 2018, the parties in the Florida Litigation (as defined below) stipulated to an order which provided, among other things, that pending the resolution of the Delaware Litigation (as defined below), the Board of Directors would not take any action out of the routine day-to-day operations conducted in the ordinary course of business, including removing any corporate officers or directors from positions held as of November 27, 2018.
As described in “Note 16. Commitments and Contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the parties to the Florida Litigation entered into the Alico Settlement Agreement wherein the parties agreed to promptly dismiss all claims in the Florida Litigation, including those related to the termination proceedings against Mr. Trafelet, and Mr. Trafelet agreed to voluntarily resign as President and Chief Executive Officer and a member of the Company’s Board of Directors, effective upon the execution of the Alico Settlement Agreement.
As contemplated by the Alico Settlement Agreement, on February 11, 2019, the Company entered into the Consulting Agreement with Mr. Trafelet and 3584, Inc. (the "Consultant"). Pursuant to the Consulting Agreement, Mr. Trafelet agreed to make himself available to provide consulting services to the Company through the Consultant for up to 24 months. In exchange for the consulting services, the Consultant is receiving an annual consulting fee of $400,000. If the Company terminates the consulting period (other than in certain specified circumstances), the Company will continue to pay the consulting fees described in the immediately preceding sentence through the balance of the 24-month term.
In addition, as contemplated by the Alico Settlement Agreement, the Company entered into the Registration Rights Agreement with Mr. Trafelet, relating to the Registrable Securities. The Registration Rights Agreement required the Company to, among other things and subject to the terms and conditions thereof, use reasonable best efforts to file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-3 covering the resale of the Registrable Securities. On October 10, 2019, Mr. Trafelet executed a waiver whereby he waived the S-3 Registration Rights but maintained all other rights arising under the Registration Rights Agreement and all rights arising under Section 14 of the Alico Settlement Agreement. 
Management and Board Changes
On April 11, 2019, the Board of Directors announced the appointment of Mr. John E. Kiernan as President and Chief Executive Officer and Mr. Richard Rallo as Chief Financial Officer, both effective July 1, 2019. Additionally, Mr. Benjamin D. Fishman, the Company’s current Interim President, agreed to resign from this position effective July 1, 2019. In addition, on April 11, 2019, Mr. Henry A. Slack, the current Executive Chairman of the Board, informed the Board that he agreed to step down as Executive 
Chairman of the Board, effective July 1, 2019. Mr. Slack’s decision to step down as Executive Chairman of the Board was not the result of any disagreement with the Company on any matter relating to the Company’s operations, policies or practices. Mr. Slack will remain a member of the Board of Directors. The Board appointed Mr. Benjamin D. Fishman, the Company’s current Interim President, to the role of non-employee Executive Chairman of the Board, effective July 1, 2019.
On April 29, 2019, the Board of Directors appointed Mr. Toby K. Purse as a member of the Board of Directors, to serve until the 2020 annual meeting of the Company’s shareholders or until his earlier death, resignation, or removal in accordance with the Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company. The Board of Directors has affirmatively determined that Mr. Purse qualifies as an independent director under the rules of the Nasdaq Stock Exchange and as defined under applicable law. Mr. Purse has also been appointed to serve as a member of the audit committee of the Board of Directors.
Federal Relief Program
The Company is eligible for Hurricane Irma federal relief programs for block grants that are being administered through the State of Florida. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 and for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019, the Company received approximately $15,597,000 under the Florida Citrus Recovery Block Grant (“CRBG”) program. This represents the Part 1 and a portion of the Part 2 reimbursement under the three-part program. Subsequent to fiscal year end 2019, the Company received additional proceeds of approximately $4,136,000 under the Florida CRBG program. This represents another portion of the Part 2 reimbursement under the three-part program. The timing and amount to be received under the remaining portion of the Part 2 and the Part 3 of the program, if any, has not been finalized.
Distribution of Shares by 734 Investors
On November 14, 2019, 734 Investors filed a Form 4 and an amendment to Schedule 13D with the SEC disclosing that on November 12, 2019, it distributed all of its shares of Company common stock previously held by it, consisting of 3,173,405 shares, on a pro rata basis, to its members. Prior to such distribution, 734 Investors was the Company’s largest shareholder.
The Land We Manage
We regularly review our land holdings to determine the best use of each parcel based upon our management expertise. Our total return profile is a combination of operating income potential and long-term appreciation. Land holdings not meeting our total return criteria are considered surplus to our operations and will be sold or exchanged for land considered to be more compatible with our business objectives and total return profile. 
Our land holdings and the operating activities in which we engage are categorized in the following table:

 | Gross Acreage | Operating Activities
Alico Citrus | | | 
Citrus Groves | 45,151 | | Citrus Cultivation 
Citrus Nursery | 22 | | Citrus Tree Development 
 | 45,173 | | 
Water Resources and Other Operations | | 
Ranch | 64,782 | | Leasing and Conservation
Other Land | 1,446 | | Mining Lease and Office 
 | 66,228 | | 
Total | 111,401 | | 

Alico Citrus
We own and manage citrus land in DeSoto, Polk, Collier, Hendry, Charlotte, Highlands, and Hardee Counties and engage in the cultivation of citrus trees to produce citrus for delivery to the fresh and processed citrus markets. Alico citrus groves total approximately 45,173 gross acres or 40.5% of our land holdings.

Our citrus acreage is detailed in the following table:

 | Net Plantable | | | 
 | Producing | Developing | Fallow | Total Plantable | Support & Other | Gross
DeSoto County | 15,180 | | 1,096 | | 482 | | 16,758 | 4,650 | 21,408
Polk County | 4,545 | | — | | — | | 4,545 | 2,228 | 6,773 
Collier County | 4,261 | | — | | — | | 4,261 | 2,905 | 7,166 
Hendry County | 3,546 | | 57 | | 175 | | 3,778 | 1,707 | 5,485 
Charlotte County | 1,729 | | — | | 138 | | 1,867 | 676 | 2,543 
Highlands County | 1,063 | | — | | — | | 1,063 | 161 | 1,224 
Hardee County | 403 | | — | | — | | 403 | 171 | 574 
Total | 30,727 | | 1,153 | | 795 | | 32,675 | 12,498 | 45,173

Of the 45,173 gross acres of citrus land we own and manage, approximately 12,498 acres are classified as support and other acreage. Support and other acreage includes acres used for roads, barns, water detention, water retention and drainage ditches integral to the cultivation of citrus trees, but which are not capable of directly producing fruit. In addition, we own a small citrus tree nursery and utilize the trees produced in our own operations. The 32,675 remaining acres are classified as net plantable acres. Net plantable acres are those that are capable of directly producing fruit. These include acres that are currently producing, acres that are developing (acres that are planted with trees too young to commercially produce fruit) and acres that are fallow.
Our Alico Citrus business segment cultivates citrus trees to produce citrus for delivery to the processed and fresh citrus markets. Our sales to the processed market were approximately 95.0%, 93.7% and 91.7% of Alico Citrus revenues for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We produce Early and Mid-Season varieties, primarily Hamlin oranges, as well as a Valencia variety for the processed market. We deliver our fruit to the processors in boxes which each contains approximately 90 pounds of oranges. Because the processors convert the majority of the citrus crop into orange juice, they generally do not buy their citrus on a per box basis, but rather on a pound solids basis, which is the measure of the soluble solids (sugars and acids) contained in one box of citrus fruit. We produced approximately 46,727,000, 26,513,000 and 42,611,000 pound solids for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, from boxes delivered to processing plants of approximately 7,904,000, 4,702,000 and 7,259,000, respectively. As previously indicated, the falloff in fiscal year 2018 was mostly attributable to the impact of Hurricane Irma.
The average pound solids per box was 5.91, 5.64 and 5.87 for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
We generally use multi-year contracts with citrus processors that include pricing structures based on a minimum (“floor”) price with a price increase (“rise”) based on market conditions. Therefore, if pricing in the market is favorable relative to our floor price, we benefit from the incremental difference between the floor and the final market price.
Our citrus produced for the processed citrus market in fiscal year 2019-2020 under our largest agreement is subject to minimum floor price ranging from $2.05 to $2.15 per pound solid and rise price from $2.50 to $2.65 per pound solid. Under this agreement, if the market price is below the floor prices or exceeds the rise prices, then 50% of the shortfall or excess will be deducted from the floor price or added to the rise price. Under our next largest agreement, our citrus produced is subject to a minimum floor price of $2.60 per pound solid and rise price of $3.00 per pound solid. We believe that other markets are available for our citrus products; however, new arrangements may be less favorable than our current contracts.
Our sales to the fresh citrus market constituted approximately 3.0%, 2.6% and 4.6% of our Alico Citrus revenues for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We produce numerous varieties for the fresh fruit market including grapefruit, navel and other fresh varieties. Generally, our fresh fruit is sold to packing houses by the box and the packing houses are responsible for the harvest and haul of these boxes. We produced approximately 210,000, 125,000 and 328,000 fresh fruit boxes for each of the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 
Revenues from our Alico Citrus operations were approximately 97.4%, 96.1% and 95.1% of our total operating revenues for each of the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Water Resources and Other Operations
We own and manage land in Collier, Glades, and Hendry Counties and are engaged in land leasing for recreational and grazing purposes, conservation, and mining activities. Our Water Resources and Other Operations land holdings total 66,228 gross acres, or 59.5% of our total acreage.
Our Water Resources and Other Operations acreage is detailed in the following table as of September 30, 2019:

 | Acreage
Hendry County | 61,680 
Glades County | 526 
Collier County | 4,022 
Total | 66,228 

In January 2018, the Company sold its breeding herd and leased grazing rights on the Ranch to a third party operator. The Company continues to own the property and conduct its long-term dispersed water program and wildlife management programs. As part of the sales transaction, the Company expensed all cattle inventory costs that were accumulated at the date of sale.
In fiscal year 2017, our cattle operation was engaged in the production of beef cattle in Hendry and Collier Counties. The breeding herd consisted of approximately 8,700 cows and bulls. We primarily sold our calves to feed yards and yearling grazing operations in the United States. We also sold cattle through local livestock auction markets and to contract cattle buyers in the United States. These buyers provided ready markets for our cattle. Revenues from Water Resources and Other Operations were approximately 2.6%, 3.9% and 4.9% of total operating revenues for each of the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Our Strategy
Our core business strategy is to maximize stockholder value through continuously improving the return on our invested capital, either by holding and managing our existing land through skilled agricultural production, leasing, or other opportunistic means of monetization, disposing of under productive land or business units and acquiring new land or operations with appreciation potential.
Our objectives are to produce the highest quality agricultural products, create innovative land uses, opportunistically acquire and convert undervalued assets, sell under-productive land and other assets not meeting our total return profile, generate recurring and sustainable profit with the appropriate balance of risk and reward, and exceed the expectations of stockholders, customers, clients and partners.
Our strategy is based on best management practices of our agricultural operations and the environmental and conservation stewardship of our land and natural resources. We manage our land in a sustainable manner and evaluate the effect of changing land uses while considering new opportunities. Our commitment to environmental stewardship is fundamental to the Company’s core beliefs.
Seasonal Nature of Business
As with any agribusiness enterprise, our agribusiness operations and revenues are predominantly seasonal in nature. The following table illustrates the seasonality of our agribusiness revenues:

 | Fiscal Year 
 | Q1 | Q2 | Q3 | Q4 
 | Ending 12/31 | Ending 3/31 | Ending 6/30 | Ending 9/30
 | Oct | Nov | Dec | Jan | Feb | Mar | Apr | May | Jun | Jul | Aug | Sept

Significant Customers
Revenue from Tropicana represented approximately 89%, 87% and 86% of our consolidated revenue for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The revenue in fiscal year 2019 from Tropicana was generated primarily from two separate contracts. This revenue was generated from the sale of our citrus product in the processed market. No other single customer provided more than 10% of our consolidated revenue in fiscal year 2019, 2018 or 2017.
Competition 
The orange and specialty citrus markets are intensely competitive, but no single producer has any significant market power over any market segments, as is consistent with the production of most agricultural commodities. Citrus is grown domestically in several states including Florida, California, Arizona and Texas, as well as foreign countries, most notably Brazil. Competition is impacted by several factors including quality, production, demand, brand recognition, market prices, weather, disease, export/import restrictions and foreign currency exchange rates.
Environmental Regulations 
Our operations are subject to various federal, state and local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment. Management believes we are in compliance with all such rules including permitting and reporting requirements. Historically, compliance with environmental regulations has not had a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
Management monitors environmental legislation and requirements and makes every effort to remain in compliance with such regulations. In addition, we require lessees of our property to comply with environmental regulations as a condition of leasing. 
Employees 
As of September 30, 2019, we had 235 full-time employees. Our employees work in the following divisions: 

Alico Citrus | 214
Water Resources and Other Operations | 0 
Corporate, General, Administrative and Other | 21 
Total employees | 235

None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that our relations with our employees are good.
Capital Resources and Raw Materials 
Management believes that the Company will be able to meet its working capital requirements for at least the next 12 months, and over the long term, through internally generated funds, cash flows from operations, the sale of under-productive land and other assets, our existing lines of credit and access to capital markets. The Company has commitments that provide for lines of revolving credit that are available for our general and corporate use. 
Raw materials needed to cultivate the various crops grown by the Company consist primarily of fertilizers, herbicides, insecticides and fuel and are readily available from local suppliers.
