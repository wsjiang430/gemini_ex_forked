Item 1. Business
Overview
 
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of a therapeutic agent for the treatment of alcohol use disorder (“AUD”) using our lead investigational new drug product, AD04, a selective serotonin-3 antagonist (i.e., a “5-HT3 antagonist”). The active ingredient in AD04 is ondansetron, which is also the active ingredient in Zofran®, an approved drug for treating nausea and emesis. AUD is characterized by an urge to consume alcohol and an inability to control the levels of consumption. We intend to commence a Phase 3 clinical trial using AD04 for the potential treatment of AUD in subjects with certain target genotypes. We believe our approach is unique in that it targets the serotonin system and individualizes the treatment of AUD, through the use of genetic screening. We have created an investigational companion diagnostic biomarker test for the genetic screening of patients with certain biomarkers that, as reported in the American Journal of Psychiatry (Johnson, et. al. 2011 & 2013), we believe will benefit from treatment with AD04. Our strategy is to integrate the pre-treatment genetic screening into AD04’s label to create a patient-specific treatment in one integrated therapeutic offering. Our goal is to develop a genetically targeted, effective and safe product candidate to treat AUD in genotype positive patients that does not require abstinence as part of the treatment.
 
We have a worldwide, exclusive license from the University of Virginia Patent Foundation (d.b.a the Licensing & Venture Group) (“UVA LVG”), which is the licensing arm of the University of Virginia, to commercialize our investigational drug candidate, AD04, subject to Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approval of the product, based upon three separate patents and patent application families, with patents issued in over 40 jurisdictions, including three issued patents in the U.S. Our investigational agent has been used in several investigator-sponsored trials and we possess or have rights to use toxicology, pharmacokinetic and other preclinical and clinical data that supports our Phase 3 clinical trial. Our therapeutic agent was the product candidate used in a University of Virginia investigator sponsored Phase 2b clinical trial of 283 patients. In this Phase 2b clinical trial, ultra-low dose ondansetron, the active pharmaceutical agent in AD04, showed a statistically significant difference between ondansetron and placebo for both the primary endpoint and secondary endpoint, which were reduction in severity of drinking measured in drinks per drinking day (1.71 drinks/drinking day; p=0.0042), and reduction in frequency of drinking measured in days of abstinence/no drinking (11.56%; p=0.0352), respectively. Additionally, and importantly, the Phase 2b results showed a significant decrease in the percentage of heavy drinking days (11.08%; p=0.0445) with a “heavy drinking day” defined as a day with four (4) or more alcoholic drinks for women or five (5) or more alcoholic drinks for men consumed in the same day.
 
The active pharmaceutical agent in AD04, our lead investigational new drug product, is ondansetron (the active ingredient in Zofran®), which was granted FDA approval in 1991 for nausea and vomiting post-operatively and after chemotherapy or radiation treatment and is now commercially available in generic form. In studies of Zofran® conducted as part of its FDA review process, ondansetron was given acutely at dosages up to almost 100 times the dosage expected to be formulated in AD04 with the highest doses of Zofran® given intravenously (“i.v.”), which results in approximately 160% the exposure level as oral dosing. Even at high doses given i.v. the studies found that ondansetron is well-tolerated and results in few adverse side effects at the currently marketed doses, which reach more than 80 times the exposure levels of the AD04 dose and are given i.v. The formulation dosage of ondansetron used in our drug candidate (and expected to be used by us in our Phase 3 clinical trials) has the potential advantage that it contains a much lower concentration of ondansetron than the generic formulation/dosage that has been used in prior clinical trials, is dosed orally, and is available with use of a companion diagnostic biomarker. Our development plan for AD04 is designed to demonstrate both the efficacy of AD04 in the genetically targeted population and the safety of ondansetron when administered chronically at the AD04 dosage. However, to the best of our knowledge, no comprehensive clinical study has been performed to date that has evaluated the safety profile of ondansetron at any dosage for long-term use (6 months or greater) at any dosage as anticipated in our Phase 3 clinical trial.
 
According to the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (the “NIAAA”) and the Journal of the American Medical Association (“JAMA”), in the United States alone, approximately 35 million people each year have AUD (such number is based upon the 2012 data provided in Grant et. al. the JAMA 2015 publication and has been adjusted to reflect a compound annual growth rate of 1.13%, which is the growth rate reported by U.S. Census Bureau for the general adult population from 2012-2017), resulting in significant health, social and financial costs with excessive alcohol use being the third leading cause of preventable death and is responsible for 31% of driving fatalities in the United States (NIAAA Alcohol Facts & Statistics). AUD contributes to over 200 different diseases and 10% of children live with a person that has an alcohol problem. According to the American Society of Clinical Oncologists, 5-6% of new cancers and cancer deaths globally are directly attributable to alcohol. The Centers for Disease Control (the “CDC”) has reported that AUD costs the U.S. economy about $250 billion annually, with heavy drinking accounting for greater than 75% of the social and health related costs. Despite this, according to the article in the JAMA 2015 publication, only 7.7% of patients (i.e., approximately 2.7 million people) with AUD are estimated to have been treated in any way and only 3.6% by a physician (i.e., approximately 1.3 million people). In addition, according to the JAMA 2017 publication, the problem in the United States appears to be growing with almost a 50% increase in AUD prevalence between 2002 and 2013.

AUD is characterized by an urge to consume alcohol and an inability to control the levels of consumption. Until the publication of the fifth revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders in 2013 (the “DSM-5”), AUD was broken into “alcohol dependence” and “alcohol abuse”. More broadly, overdrinking due to the inability to moderate drinking is called alcohol addiction and is often called “alcoholism”, sometimes pejoratively.
 
Since ondansetron is already manufactured for generic sale, the active ingredient for AD04 is readily available from several manufacturers, and we have contracted with a U.S. manufacturer to acquire ondansetron at a cost expected to be under $0.01 per dose. Clinical trial material (“CTM”) has already been manufactured for the initial Phase 3 trial. The CTM has demonstrated good stability after four years with the stability studies to date. We have entered into a Secrecy and Supply Agreement on December 1, 2011 with Cambrex Charles City, Inc. (“Cambrex”) for the supply of the active ingredient for AD04. The agreement has an initial term of eight (8) years and may be terminated by either party upon a material breach that is not cured within sixty (60) days of receipt of written notice or certain bankruptcy events. Cambrex has the right to terminate the agreement if we do not cure a payment failure within thirty (30) days of notice thereof and we have the right to terminate the agreement if a regulatory authority prohibits or restricts manufacture and sale of the active ingredient in a way that would have an adverse effect on the sale price or volume of the product. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement with Cambrex, Cambrex cannot decline a purchase order of 50kg of product or less and we are required to purchase 66.67% of our requirements of the active ingredient sold in the United States and the European Union from Cambrex for a period of five (5) years from submission of our NDA.
 
We have also developed the manufacturing process at a third-party vendor to produce tablets at what we expect will serve for commercial scale production, also at a cost expected to be less than $0.01 per dose. A proprietary packaging process has been developed, which appears to extend the stability of the drug product. Packaging costs are expected to be less than $0.05 per dose. We do not have a written commitment for supply of either the tablets or the packaging and believe that alternative suppliers are available to whom we can transfer the processes that have been developed.
 
Methods for the companion diagnostic genetic test have been developed as a blood test, and we established the test with a U.S. third-party vendor capable of supporting a Phase 3 clinical trial. Additionally, we have built validation and possible approval of the companion diagnostic into the Phase 3 program, including that we plan to store blood samples for all patients in the event additional genetic testing is required by regulatory authorities. Methods are intended to be transferred to third-party vendors in Europe for conduct of the planned initial Phase 3 trial.
 
Ultimately, we plan to explore the development of AD04 in other addiction-related indications (e.g., opioid use disorder, other drug addictions, obesity, smoking cessation, eating disorders and anxiety) and to build out our product portfolio with the intent that product portfolio expansions will be focused on promising addiction therapies. Our vision is to create the world’s leading addiction related pharmaceutical company.
 
Disease Targets and Markets
 
Limitations of Current AUD Therapies
 
Today the most common treatments for AUD are directed at achieving abstinence and typical treatments include psychological and social interventions. Most therapies actually require abstinence prior to initiating therapy. Abstinence requires dramatic lifestyle changes often with serious work and social consequences. Frequently, patients cannot attend family and social events in order to ensure compliance with abstinence, and patients often must suffer from the stigma of having been labelled an alcoholic. Significant side effects of current pharmacologic therapies include mental side effects such as psychiatric disorders and depressive symptoms and physical side effects such as nausea, dizziness, vomiting, abdominal pain, arthritis and joint fitness. In fact, according to peer reviewed studies referenced in The Sober Truth: Debunking the Bad Science Behind 12-Step Programs and the Rehab Industry, L. Dodes and Z. Dodes, 2014 by Dr. Lance Dodes, the former Director of the substance abuse treatment unit of Harvard’s McLean Hospital, 90% or more of patients that use current therapy solutions, such as Alcoholics Anonymous, do not achieve long-term abstinence.
 
There are four drugs approved by the FDA and marketed in the United States for the treatment of alcohol addiction, Antabuse® (disulfram) Vivitrol® (naltrexone), Revia® (naltrexone) and Campral® (acomprosate) and one drug, Selincro® (nalmefene) is marketed outside of the United States. All of the approved drugs, other than Selincro®, require abstinence prior to commencing treatment with the drug, and all five drugs are known to have significant side effects.
 
Antabuse® was approved for the treatment of alcohol dependence more than 50 years ago, making it the oldest such drug on the market. It works by interfering with the body’s ability to process alcohol. Its method of action and purpose is to cause patients that drink alcohol while taking Antabuse® to experience numerous and extremely unpleasant adverse effects, including, among others, flushing, nausea, and palpitations, with the goal that patients will continue the medication but refrain from drinking in order to avoid these effects.

Naltrexone, which can be taken as a once-daily pill (Revia®) or in an approved once-monthly injectable form (Vivitrol®) that requires a doctor to administer is often associated with gastrointestinal complaints and has been reported to cause liver damage when given at certain high doses. As a result, it carries an FDA boxed warning, a special emphasized warning, for this side effect.
 
Campral®, taken by mouth three times daily, acts on chemical messenger systems in the brain.
 
Selincro® has not been approved for sale in the United States.
 
Our Proposed Solution
 
Our goal with AD04 is to develop an effective and safe product to treat AUD that does not require abstinence as part of the treatment and does not have the negative side effects of the current drugs on the market. Our product candidate, AD04, is designed for genotype positive patients who desire to control their drinking but cannot or do not want to completely abstain from drinking. By removing the difficulties associated with abstinence and the side effects associated with the other current products on the market, we believe that we may be able to remove barriers to patient adoption that inhibit adoption of current therapies and can attract a greater portion of the many millions of patients with AUD that remain untreated. Unlike other therapies, our investigational product, AD04, uses a novel mode of action for treating AUD that involves genetic screening with a companion diagnostic genetic test prior to treatment and is designed to reduce cravings for alcohol to effectively curb alcohol intake, without the requirement of abstinence prior to or during treatment. Our product candidate is intended to be easy to use since it is administered orally, currently on a twice daily basis and with a once-a-day tablet planned as part of the product’s life cycle management. To date, clinical testing of AD04 has shown it to have a positive safety and tolerability profile with side effects similar to placebo.
 
The companion diagnostic genetic test to be used to identify patients that are most likely to benefit from treatment with AD04 may potentially enhance the likelihood of a successful outcome for those undergoing treatment. Additionally, it may provide doctors with the opportunity to have a non-threatening conversation about alcohol with their patients and may provide the patient an acceptable path to help them determine if they might be a candidate for help with their alcohol use. If the test results are positive, they would have a science based rationale for their treatment, which reduces some of the stigma patients might otherwise endure, and allows them to be treated in the confidence of their doctor, potentially with a simple, oral tablet.
 
Strengths and Competitive Advantages
 
Large Market Opportunity for an Effective Solution
 
In the United States alone, approximately 35 million people each year have AUD. Based on data from the Phase 2b trial of AD04 and our analysis of publicly available genetic databases, we preliminarily estimate that about one in three patients with AUD in the U.S. will have the genetic markers to indicate possible treatment with AD04. At this time, we are not aware of any oral pharmaceutical treatment approved in the U.S. that addresses the needs of patients who desire to control their drinking but cannot or do not want to abstain from drinking. The current abstinence-based treatments have limitations. The limited side effects expected for our investigational new drug, based on clinical data so far, are also believed to be an important factor in the expected rapid uptake of AD04 in the market. Our approach, if approved by FDA, may allow for social drinking to continue and is aimed at reducing the dangerous, heavy drinking. This would allow patients to live the life they want without the stigma associated with complete abstention and currently endured by those seeking help for their excessive drinking. Assuming that one-third of AUD patients are genotype positive for treatment with AD04 and a $235 price for a one month supply of the drug (assumed pricing based on an average of prices published by Blue Cross Blue Shield in June 2017 for tier-3 oral, on-patent, chronic maintenance drugs, discounted by 16.6%, to reflect the average difference between retail and wholesale pricing for branded drugs as reported by drugs.com), the total potential market for AD04 would be approximately $36 billion in the United States alone.
 
Beyond the United States, alcohol consumption worldwide is a serious health issue. The 2014 Global Status Report on Alcohol and Health published by the World Health Organization (the “WHO”) states that 5.9% of all deaths (about 3.3 million per year) and 5.1% of disease worldwide are attributable to alcohol consumption. Europe consumes over 25% of the total alcohol consumed worldwide despite only having 14.7% of the world’s population. The WHO estimates that about 55 million people in Europe have AUD and, within Europe, Eastern Europe has a particularly acute problem with Russia estimated to have about 21 million people with AUD. The WHO further estimates that 17.4% of adult Russians and 31% of adult Russian males have AUD, and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development data indicates that 30% of all deaths in Russia are alcohol related as reported by Quartz Media.

Companion Genetic Bio-Marker Aimed at Identifying Patients Most Likely to Respond To Treatment, Potentially Results in Increased Use of AD04
 
We believe our drug is unique in that it is designed to reduce heavy drinking in individuals with certain genotypes. We are pursuing a strategy that aims to integrate pre-treatment screening with the companion diagnostic genetic test into the drug label, essentially combining the test and treatment into one integrated therapeutic offering that has combined intellectual property protections. This companion diagnostic testing approach may be a useful genetic screening tool to predict those most likely to respond to the drug and to have minimal side effects. Based on the clinical experience to date and publicly available databases, we believe the genetic prevalence of genotype positive people is about 33% of the population in the United States and that the prevalence in Scandinavia and in certain areas of Central and Eastern Europe may be greater than 50%. The FDA has agreed that the Phase 3 trials of AD04 can proceed only enrolling patients that are genotype positive, which greatly reduces, the cost, time and risk relative to a trial that also enrolled patients that are genotype negative for treatment with AD04. Our plan to conduct our first Phase 3 trial in geographic areas with expected higher prevalence of genotype positive patients should further reduce the cost, time and risk to achieve Phase 3 results. The FDA has indicated that any approval based on a trial only in genotype positive patients would result in labeling restricted to treating genotype positive patients.
 
We believe that the companion diagnostic genetic test enables physicians to more easily have an initial conversation with their patients about alcohol use and, for the patient, provides a less threatening and obtrusive first step toward treatment because the conversation will include the topic of genetic testing and not be solely about behavior. Patients that then test positive against the AD04 genetic panel would be expected to be more likely to then receive a prescription for AD04 (based on an external quantitative market study of 156 primary care physicians and psychiatrists that was conducted by Ipsos-Insight LLC, who we commissioned, and that concluded a majority of genetically targeted patients currently receiving pharmacologic treatment would be switched to a drug with the characteristics expected for AD04).
 
Prior Work of Universities and our Ability to Leverage Relationships Creates Cost Efficiencies
 
We have a worldwide, exclusive license to intellectual property developed at the University of Virginia by a member of our board of directors, Dr. Bankole A. Johnson, who was Chairman of the Department of Psychiatry & Neurobehavioral Sciences at the University of Virginia (and prior to that the Chief of the Division of Alcohol and Drug Addiction at the University of Texas) and is now Chair, Department of Psychiatry and Director of the Brain Science Research Consortium Unit at the University of Maryland. Dr. Johnson has spent almost three decades researching the underlying subject matter. Significant portions of the supporting research were also funded under grants from the National Institute of Health to the University of Virginia and the University of Texas.
 
By leveraging the prior work of universities and their researchers, including their pre-clinical studies and accumulated data, we believe we have developed a significant drug development opportunity. Because of the licensing approach taken to secure intellectual property, including, without limitation, patents and rights to clinical trial data, and our collaborations with the University of Virginia, we have not had to incur the significant costs that would normally be required to develop therapeutic treatments to the point of being ready to commence a Phase 3 clinical trial, which often amount to tens of millions of dollars or more. In fact, based upon current information, and depending on what the regulatory authorities may require to secure marketing authorization, we estimate that we will require approximately $7.5 million for the initial Phase 3 clinical trial (not including company overhead) and an additional $30 million of additional capital to complete our second Phase 3 program (which includes $20 million for a confirmatory Phase 3 trial and any necessary Phase 1 clinical trials and other development expenses and does not include the additional cost of a possible third Phase 3 clinical trial) as currently contemplated in order to achieve regulatory approval for the use of AD04 to treat AUD in the United States and Europe. We intend to use approximately $3.0 million of the proceeds from our initial public offering consummated in July 2018 and subsequent warrant exercises to fund a portion of the initial Phase 3 clinical trial, leaving $4.5 million needed to from future financings to complete our initial Phase 3 clinical trial.
 
The NIAAA has provided and continues to provide technical assistance and advice to us, and we intend to apply for an NIAAA Research Resource Award, which if granted would provide financial support for our Phase 3 clinical trial. Although there can be no assurance that we will be selected by the NIAAA to receive funding, since we are not aware of any pharmaceutical company planning Phase 3 pivotal trials to serve as a basis for marketing approval for products for the treatment of AUD, we believe AD04 would be a competitive candidate.

Known, Well-Tested Agent Has Shown Favorable Results in Non-AUD Uses
 
Ondansetron, the principal active pharmaceutical agent in AD04 has been approved by the FDA to treat nausea and vomiting but is administered at much higher doses than we intend to use and has shown limited side effects even at the higher dosages currently on the market. However, it has not been approved in our anticipated dosage or for our anticipated uses and treatment period. Consequently, we expect to submit a new drug application, pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, for U.S. marketing authorization. Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act allows the FDA to rely, for approval of an NDA, on data not developed by the applicant. Such an NDA contains full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness, but where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. Such applications permit approval of applications other than those for duplicate products and permits reliance for such approvals on literature or an FDA finding of safety and/or effectiveness for an approved drug product. A Phase 2b University of Virginia investigator sponsored clinical trial of AD04 for the treatment of AUD showed promising results and no overt safety concerns (there were no statistically significant serious adverse events reported). Not only did the trial show no statistically significant, serious adverse side effects, but both of the pre-specified endpoints, reduction in severity of drinking measured in drinks per day of drinking day and reduction in frequency of drinking measured in days of abstinence, were met with statistical significance as shown in the graph below:
Phase 2b Clinical Trial Results– Analysis of Primary and Secondary Efficacy Endpoints for Target Genotypes
 
A 12-week, randomized, two-center, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-arm (four cell) clinical trial of oral ondansetron (n=283) conducted by University of Virginia
 
Our Substantial Proprietary Estate and Protection from Competition
 
We currently hold a worldwide, exclusive license to three (3) patent families that provide us with the ability to exclude potential competitors from practicing the claimed inventions, such as the use of ondansetron to treat any of the four (4) specified genotypes for AUD. Our licensed patent estate is expected to provide us patent protection through 2032 plus possible extensions. Ondansetron, the active ingredient in AD04, has never been approved in a low dosage near the AD04 dose of 0.33mg per tablet, and we believe our licensed patents will protect AD04 from any competitor that attempts to bring to market an ondansetron dose at or near the AD04 dose for treatment of patients having one or more of the four target genotypes.
 
We believe use of the currently marketed doses “off-label” will not be significant due to (i) the lack of demonstrated efficacy at currently marketed doses, (ii) potential safety concerns if the currently marketed doses are used chronically as is expected to be necessary for treating AUD, and (iii) cutting the smallest currently marketed dose into the 12 pieces that would be necessary to achieve the AD04 dose is deemed by us to be impractical and likely to result in inaccurate dosing.

Experienced Leadership
 
Our management, advisors and board of directors have extensive experience in pharmaceutical development, the clinical trial and regulatory approval processes, drug commercialization, financing capital-intensive projects, and developing new markets for pharmaceutical agents. Members of our team have previously worked in senior management and senior officer positions, or led significant research initiatives at Clinical Data, Inc., Adenosine Therapeutics, and the University of Virginia in a broad range of therapeutic areas. Our management and board members have particular expertise in the science and development of addiction related drugs and bringing new drugs to the market.
Our Strategy
 
We develop pharmaceutical treatments for addictions and addictive disorders. The focus of our business strategy is to advance AD04, our lead investigational drug candidate, toward regulatory approval for alcohol addiction in the United States, the European Union, and then eventually other territories. We subsequently plan to develop label expansions into other indications (e.g., opioid use disorder, other drug addictions, obesity, smoking cessation, eating disorders and anxiety).
 
Our goals in executing this strategy are to keep capital requirements to a minimum, expedite product development, gain access to clinical research and manufacturing expertise that will advance product development, approval and eventual market uptake of our product, and rely on a well-defined and carefully executed intellectual property strategy in order to position AD04 with long-term, defensible, competitive advantages. Execution of this strategy may include seeking grant funding and funding from partners and collaborators when available on terms we believe to be favorable to us.
 
Our near-term strategy includes:
 

● | Obtaining regulatory approval for our lead product in the United States and Europe. We intend to commence Phase 3 clinical trials for the treatment of AUD. The first Phase 3 trial is planned for conduct in Scandinavia and Central and Eastern Europe, where the genetic prevalence of the target genotypes appears to be higher. If our initial Phase 3 clinical trial is successful we expect to conduct a second, and possibly a third, Phase 3 clinical trial in the same areas but with additional clinical sites in the United States and Western Europe.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Prosecuting and expanding our intellectual property and product portfolio. We have acquired rights to a promising drug candidate and made a significant investment in the development of our licensed patent portfolio to protect our technologies and programs, and we intend to continue to do so. We have obtained exclusive rights to three different patent families directed to therapeutic methods related to our AD04 platform. These families include 3 issued U.S. patents, and at least one foreign equivalent patent covering AD04 issued in over 40 national jurisdictions, including most of Europe and Eurasia. Divisional and continuation applications to expand the coverage have also been filed in certain jurisdictions. We intend that product portfolio expansions will be focused on promising addiction therapies and/or late-stage clinical assets.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Evaluating the additional use of our product candidate in other indications. In addition to alcohol addiction, we plan to conduct exploratory work to investigate using AD04 as a potential treatment for opioid use disorder, gambling addiction, smoking cessation, obesity, and other addiction related disorders in which 5-HT3 antagonism may have a treatment effect. We believe we will be able to undertake this initial exploratory effort with minimal additional cash cost to our company through the use of academic partnerships, grants, human laboratory studies and/or non-clinical studies. We believe that, due to its hypothesized mechanism of action (i.e., the modulation of the serotonin system in patients that are genetically targeted based on the apparent sensitivity to such modulation, where the modulation appears to reduce cravings), AD04 has the potential to be used for the treatment of such other addictive disorders. To date, we have not discussed these potential uses with the FDA or any other regulatory bodies.

● | Maximizing commercial opportunity for our technology. AD04 targets large markets with significant unmet medical need. We intend to develop an extended release, once-a-day formulation of AD04 to enhance compliance and market appeal.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Managing our business with efficiency and discipline. We believe we have efficiently utilized our capital and human resources to develop and acquire our product candidate and programs, and create a broad intellectual property portfolio. We operate cross-functionally and are led by an experienced management team with backgrounds in developing product candidates. We use project management techniques to assist us in making disciplined strategic program decisions and to attempt to limit the risk profile of our product pipeline.

The clinical development plan for AD04 can be described as a two-stage development strategy in which we expend limited resources to achieve the significant value inflection point of Phase 3 data in our primary indication of AUD. With a successful trial and the risk reduction associated with that success, we would then be ready to conduct the final trials to seek approval in the U.S. and Europe as shown below:
 
AD04 — Two-Stage Clinical Development Strategy — Conduct the Phase 3 clinical trials sequentially
 

* Even if the 1st Phase 3 trial is not accepted by the FDA due to the study not being well-powered for the FDA’s currently stated end point, we still expect that the EMA will require only one additional trial. In this case, however, a 3rd trial might be required by the FDA (i.e., three Phase 3 trials in total). If two additional trials are required for FDA approval after an initial Phase 3 trial conducted in the EMA, we would expect to run the 2nd and 3rd trials in parallel (i.e., at the same time) so as not to increase the expected time to approval. The 1st Phase 3 trial is expected to require $7.5 million of direct expenses. The 2nd Phase 3 trial is expected to require $20 million in direct expenses, and up to $10 million in additional other development expenses is expected to be required. A possible 3rd Phase 3 trial would be expected to require an additional $20 million in clinical trial related expenditures.

After approval, we plan to execute a two-stage commercialization plan. With psychiatrists and addiction specialists treating a majority of the current AUD patients today and with psychiatrists most likely to be familiar with the mechanism of action of AD04, we believe that a relatively small psychiatry-targeted, specialty sales force could successfully sell AD04 into the market. This plan creates the opportunity for us to develop into a commercial enterprise with an initial niche-market sales force at a relatively low cost for market entry. It also expands the universe of potential acquirers of our company or AD04 to smaller and mid-size pharmaceutical companies. Once success is shown in the niche market and the thought leaders and early adopters are prescribing AD04, market adoption risk will have been greatly reduced and we would expect to be able to sell or partner with a large pharmaceutical partner to develop AD04 as a blockbuster product. This commercialization plan is shown below:
 
AD04 — Two-Stage Commercialization Strategy — Initial launch with a specialty sales force to build the market, then partner or sell to a large pharmaceutical partner to capture market share and optimize the market
 

Ondansetron History and Foundation for Treating AUD
 
Ondansetron is a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist. Preclinical and pharmacobehavioral studies suggest that blockade of serotonin-3 receptors will influence the dopamine reward system activated by alcohol, decreasing dopamine release and attenuating craving for alcohol (Dawes, MA et al., 2005b; Johnson, BA et al., 2002; Lovinger, DM, 1999a). Early clinical studies found that the efficacy of ondansetron is limited to certain subgroups of the alcohol-dependent population and suggested the differential effect could be predicted based on age of onset of alcoholism, an indistinct concept likely confounded by genetic, regional and ethnic differences (Johnson, BA et al., 2000; Kranzler, HR et al., 2003). Recent research suggests the variable effect may be predictable based on molecular mechanism of ondansetron action and individual subject genotype of key genes in the serotonin system (Enoch, MA et al., 2010; Johnson, BA et al., 2011; Kenna, GA et al., 2009).
 
We are pursuing development of ondansetron in the alcohol-dependent population. Clinical studies will initially focus on the use of a low dose, oral tablet (0.33 mg administered twice daily) to reduce alcohol consumption in subjects with genotypes that have been correlated with a responsive to treatment with ondansetron.
 
Ondansetron was first approved by the FDA in 1991 as a solution for injection. Subsequent approvals were obtained for oral tablets in dosage forms and an oral solution. It is marketed as Zofran® and is also available in generic formulations, and it has been used widely for the approved indications – prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with certain cancer chemotherapies and radiotherapies and for the prevention of postoperative nausea or vomiting — at adult doses of 8–24 mg/day with manageable side effects.
 
Ondansetron has been administered to dogs‚ rats‚ and mice as part of a preclinical toxicology program which included single-dose acute‚ repeated-dose studies. Ondansetron was not mutagenic in the standard battery of microbial tests for mutagenicity and no carcinogenic effects were seen in 2-year studies in rats and mice with oral ondansetron doses up to 10 and 30 mg/kg/day, respectively. In studies of rats and rabbits there was no evidence of reproductive toxicity seen on fertility, early embryonic development, perinatal/postnatal development or fetal development of the F2 generation. Based on these studies, as well as over 20 years of human use in clinical trials and the post-marketing environment, ondansetron is considered to be a well-tolerated drug with a generally mild safety profile.
 
Ondansetron, by blocking the 5-HT3 receptor, is known to affect dopaminergic signaling in the brain; and the scientific rational for use of a 5-HT3 antagonist in the treatment of alcohol dependence is well established (Johnson, BA, 2004). Briefly, studies suggest that: the rewarding effects of alcohol involve activation of the 5-HT3 receptors leading to release of dopamine within the mesolimbic system of the brain (McBride, WJ et al., 2004). Thus, by blocking activation of the 5-HT3 receptor, ondansetron may reduce the ethanol-stimulated release of dopamine leading to reduced feelings of pleasure or reward and consequently, reduced consumption (Carboni, E et al., 1989; Costall, B et al., 1987; Hagan, RM et al., 1990; Imperato, A and Angelucci, L, 1989; Lovinger, DM, 1999b; McBride, WJ et al., 2004; Minabe, Y et al., 1991; Rasmussen, K et al., 1991; Wozniak, KM et al., 1990; Yoshimoto, K et al., 1996).

Preclinical studies have demonstrated that alcohol stimulates the release of both serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine or 5-HT) and dopamine within the cortio-mesolimbic system (Campbell, AD et al., 1996; Campbell, AD and McBride, WJ, 1995; Di Chiara, G and Imperato, A, 1988; Imperato, A and Angelucci, L, 1989; Yoshimoto, K et al., 1992; Yoshimoto, K et al., 1996; Zazpe, A et al., 1994). Other studies have shown that alcohol potentiates the effects of 5-HT at the 5-HT3 receptor, leading to augmented release of dopamine, and that ondansetron and the selective antagonists of the 5-HT3 receptor inhibit dopaminergic firing and release of dopamine in response to alcohol and serotonin (Costall, B et al., 1987; Lovinger, DM, 1991; Minabe, Y et al., 1991; Rasmussen, K et al., 1991; Yoshimoto, K et al., 1996; Zazpe, A et al., 1994; Zhou, Q et al., 1998). Finally, numerous in vivo studies in rats and mice have shown that ondansetron and other selective antagonist of the 5-HT3 receptor reduce volitional intake of alcohol in models selectively bred for alcohol preference (Fadda, F et al., 1991; Hodge, CW et al., 1993; McBride, WJ and Li, TK, 1998; Meert, TF, 1993; Tomkins, DM et al., 1995).
 
The aforementioned nonclinical studies have shown that 5-HT3 and dopamine interactions in the cortico-mesolimbic system appear to mediate many of the reinforcing effects of alcohol. Collectively the available nonclinical studies suggest that, by inhibiting the 5-HT3 receptor and reducing the release of dopamine in the cortico-mesolimbic area, ondansetron can interfere with the dopamine reward system activated by alcohol and lead to reduced alcohol intake (Barnes, NM and Sharp, T, 1999; Dawes, MA et al., 2005b; Johnson, BA et al., 1993; Johnson, BA and Cowen, PJ, 1993; Lovinger, DM, 1991, 1999a; Swift, RM et al., 1996; Tomkins, DM et al., 1995).
 
Five clinical studies have been conducted that demonstrate ondansetron is a promising treatment for alcohol-dependent individuals (Johnson, BA et al., 2011; Johnson, BA et al., 2000; Kenna, GA et al., 2009; Kranzler, HR et al., 2003; Sellers, EM et al., 1994). Several important findings in these studies guide the design of future clinical studies, including:
 

(1) | Ondansetron’s efficacy in alcohol-dependent individuals is associated optimally with a small dose of the compound (0.25-0.33 mg twice daily), a dose that is <1/10 of the dose used for adults for the currently approved indications.
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | In clinical studies in over 600 subjects, ondansetron was well-tolerated and safe, with a mild side-effect profile when administered to currently drinking alcohol-dependent individuals. Overall, the types of adverse events reported during multi-week clinical studies in alcohol dependence appear similar to those outlined in the package insert for the approved indications and to those reported in the literature for treatment in chronic liver disease, chronic fatigue syndrome and schizophrenia.
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(3) | The extent of benefit with ondansetron treatment varies among different subtypes of alcohol-dependent subjects. Prior studies found that ondansetron benefited subjects with early-onset alcoholism (EOA) but not late-onset alcoholism (LOA). The pharmacological reason for this was not known, but it was presumed that the differential effect was due to a higher degree of serotonergic dysfunction in EOA (Johnson, BA et al., 2000; Kranzler, HR et al., 2003).

The below table summarizes the five clinical studies demonstrating ondansetron is a promising treatment for alcohol-dependent individuals
 

Study type (Reference) | Number of Subjects | Dosing (Duration) | Summary Results 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Phase 2 (Sellers, EM et al., Clinical Efficacy of the 5-HT3 Antagonist Ondansetron in Alcohol Abuse and Dependence, Alcohol Clin Exp Res, 18 (1994) 879-885.) | 71 | 0.25 mg, 2 mg, and placebo b.i.d. (6 weeks) | The 0.25 mg dose showed a near significant effect in reducing severity of drinking measured in DDD (p=0.06) while the 2 mg dose was similar to placebo. 
Phase 2 (Johnson, BA et al., Ondansetron for Reduction of Drinking among Biologically Predisposed Alcoholic Patients: A Randomized Controlled Trial, JAMA, 284 (2000) 963-971) | 321 | 1, 4, and 16 ug/kg b.i.d. (11 weeks) | Ondansetron treatment at doses of 1, 4, and 16 µg/kg bid resulted in significant reductions in DDD in EOA subjects, but only the 4 µg/kg dose showed such a reduction in frequency of drinking measured in PDA and the maximal effect was shown at the µg/kg does. Only the 4 µg/kg bid showed significant improvements in PDA in the LOA group.
Phase 2 (Kranzler, HR et al., A within-Group Design of Nontreatment Seeking 5-HTTLPR Genotyped Alcohol-Dependent Subjects Receiving Ondansetron and Sertraline, Alcohol Clin Exp Res, 33 (2009) 315-323) | 40 | 4 ug/kg bid for 8 weeks | EOA subjects showed significant improvement over LOA subjects in DDD. 
Phase 2 (Kenna, GA et al., Pharmacogenetic Approach at the Serotonin Transporter Gene as a Method of Reducing the Severity of Alcohol Drinking, Am J Psychiatry, 168 (2011) 265-275) | 21 | .5 mg/day for 3 weeks | LL genotype subject showed significant improvement in DDD.

Additional detail with respect to four of the clinical studies referenced in the chart above is provided below with the fifth being the Phase 2b clinical trial upon which we are basing the development of AD04 and which is described more fully in the following section titled “Phase 2b Investigator Initiated Clinical Trial of AD04 for Alcohol Use Disorder Conducted by the University of Virginia.”
 
A Dose-Ranging, Placebo-Controlled, 6-Week Study of Ondansetron in Alcoholic-Dependent Subjects
 
In 1994, Sellers et al. reported on the effects of administration of 0.25 mg bid ondansetron (N=23), 2 mg bid ondansetron (N=25), or placebo (N=23) for 6 weeks in alcohol-dependent males (Sellers, EM et al., 1994). Endpoints included change in drinks per drinking day (“DDD”) and proportion of responders, where a responder was defined as a subject with a Reliable Change score > 1.96, representing an improvement of at least 2 standard deviations. The Reliable Change score was calculated as the difference between pre- and post-test DDD divided by the standard error. Analyses were conducted comparing pre-treatment with the Week 6 visit, representing the end-of-study medication administration, and pre-treatment with the Week 7 visit, after completion of a 1-week follow-up period.
 
In the 71 subjects who completed the study, the on-treatment changes in DDD were approximately -1.9 (0.25 mg bid), -1.2 (2 mg bid), and -1.3 (placebo), with neither ondansetron effect being statistically different from the placebo effect. The corresponding changes from pre-treatment to Week 7 (after 6 weeks of treatment and a 1-week follow-up) were approximately -2.7 (0.25 mg bid), -1.1 (2 mg bid), and -1.6 (placebo), with the difference between low-dose ondansetron and placebo approaching statistical significance (p=0.06). By Week 6, nearly twice as many subjects on low-dose ondansetron compared with those on either high-dose ondansetron or placebo showed significant improvement according to the Reliable Change score. Lower baseline drinking and higher level of education were significant predictors of reduction in drinking while on treatment.
 
A Dose-Ranging, Placebo-Controlled, 11-Week Study of Ondansetron in Alcoholic-Dependent Subjects
 
In 2000, Johnson et al. reported on the co-administration of weekly cognitive behavioral therapy and either placebo or ondansetron at doses of 1, 4, and 16 µg/kg bid for 11 weeks (after a 1-week, single-blind, placebo lead-in) in 321 alcohol-dependent subjects (Johnson, BA et al., 2000). Endpoints included drinks per day, DDD, percentage of days abstinent (“PDA”), total days abstinent, and plasma carbohydrate deficient transferrin (CDT) level, an objective measure of drinking. Analyses were conducted comparing each dose group with placebo, with drinking response variables analyzed as means of data collected from Weeks 3 through 12.
 
The table below sets forth treatment results. Ondansetron treatment at doses of 1, 4, and 16 µg/kg bid resulted in statistically significant reductions in DDD and drinks per day compared with placebo for EOA (age of onset ≤25 years). The maximum clinical effect was observed at the middle dose (4 µg/kg bid), though the differences between doses were not statistically significant. At 4 µg/kg bid (but not at 1 or 16 µg/kg bid), significant improvements in days and PDA were also achieved. LOA (age of onset ≥26 years) did not benefit from ondansetron treatment at any dose studied.
 
Treatment Effect Size in EOA Subjects and Statistical Comparison to Placebo Effect
 

Variable | 1 µg/kg bid | 4 µg/kg bid | 16 µg/kg bid 
--------------------+---------------+---------------+--------------
Drinks/drinking day | 0.25 (p≤0.05) | 0.41 (p≤0.01) | 0.23 (p≤0.05)
Drinks/day | 0.26 (p≤0.05) | 0.37 (p≤0.01) | 0.22 (p≤0.05)
Days abstinent (%) | 0.13 (ns) | 0.26 (p≤0.01) | 0.17(ns) 
Days abstinent | 0.06 (ns) | 0.24 (p≤0.05) | 0.18(ns) 

 
The findings in this study support the earlier evidence that the dose-response effect of ondansetron in reduction of alcohol consumption is not linear. Of the doses used in this study, only 4 µg/kg (0.28 mg for a 70 kg person) bid exhibited clinically and statistically meaningful improvements in all efficacy endpoints. This study also suggested that ondansetron may be an appropriate therapy for EOA, but not LOA.

An Open-Label, 8-Week Study Comparing Ondansetron Effect in Early-Onset and Late-Onset Alcoholic Subjects
 
In 2003, Kranzler et al. reported on the co-administration of weekly cognitive behavioral therapy and ondansetron at 4 µg/kg bid for 8 weeks to 40 alcohol-dependent subjects (Kranzler, HR et al., 2003). The subjects were evenly divided between early-onset alcoholism (EOA; age of onset of the disorder <25 years) and late-onset alcoholism (LOA; age of onset of the disorder ≥25 years). Endpoints included drinks per day, DDD, PDA, Drinker Inventory of Consequences (DrInC) score, and percentage of heavy-drinking days, where heavy drinking was defined as ≥5 drinks in a day for a male subject or ≥4 drinks in a day for a female subject. Analyses were conducted comparing pre-treatment with 8-week values within onset category (EOA or LOA) and comparing treatment effects between categories.
 
The table below sets forth treatment results. All efficacy parameters improved significantly on treatment in both groups. EOA subjects reported significantly greater improvements in drinks per day, DDD, and DrInC score than LOA subjects. These findings, as noted earlier by Johnson et al., suggest that ondansetron shows promise for treatment of EOA by improving drinking outcomes.

A 3-Period Study of Ondansetron Effect and Sertraline Effect in Subgroups of Alcoholics Constructed Based on Genotypes of the Serotonin Transporter Gene
 
In 2009, Kenna et al. reported on a placebo-controlled cross-over study in which 21 alcohol-dependent subjects received 0.5 mg/day ondansetron or 200 mg/day sertraline for 3 weeks, placebo for 3 weeks and the alternative active medication for 3 weeks (Kenna, GA et al., 2009). An alcohol self-administration experiment was conducted at the end of each treatment period. The primary endpoint was DDD during the final week of each treatment period.
 
During the first 3-week treatment period, ondansetron-treated subjects carrying L/L genotype (n = 3), compared to the L/S and S/S carriers (n = 4), had a significantly fewer DDD (3.66 vs. 8.40, p = 0.02). Within L/S and S/S group, there was no significant effect of ondansetron. A pronounced order effect confounded analyses after the third 3-week treatment period.
 
Our clinical development program is designed to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of ondansetron in the alcohol-dependent population in low dosages for long periods of time, while targeting genotypes that have been shown to benefit from ondansetron treatment. Ultimately, this development program aims to establish a scientific link between the biology of alcohol addiction and the therapeutic mechanism of ondansetron action, permitting genetically-based prediction of ondansetron effectiveness.
 
Phase 2b Investigator Initiated Clinical Trial of AD04 for Alcohol Use Disorder Conducted by the University of Virginia
 
In various studies, it has been shown that alcohol dependent individuals with the LL genotype of the 5’-HTT and the TT genotype in the 3’-UTR LL and TT genotype have lower B-CIT neuronal binding to 5-HTT. It is hypothesized that individuals with the LL or TT genotype, 5-HTT gene expression is suppressed by increased alcohol consumption, and therefore, ondansetron, which causes 5-HTT gene expression would have the greatest effect upon individuals that possess both the LL genotype of the 5’-HTT and the TT genotype in the 3’-UTR. A subsequent Phase 2b study (N = 283), conducted by the University of Virginia for which we have acquired rights to the data, showed that a prospectively identified subgroup of alcohol-dependent individuals with these specific polymorphisms of the serotonin transporter protein responded therapeutically to ondansetron administration (Johnson, BA et al., 2011). Further analysis of this same data set against 18 additional polymorphisms located on the genes for the A and B subunits of the serotonin 5-HT3 receptor revealed polymorphisms that were also associated with a therapeutic response to ondansetron. Collectively, the genotypes from the two aforementioned analyses comprise the genotypes selected for testing in Phase 3 trials for AD04. The Phase 3 studies will test ondansetron’s efficacy compared with placebo based on its ability to decrease the frequency and amount of heavy drinking among alcohol dependent individuals with the selected genotypes.

Study Design
 
The Phase 2b clinical trial conducted by the University of Virginia was a 283-patient, 12-week, randomized, two-center, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study. Following a 1 week placebo run in (single-blind), alcohol-dependent subjects were randomized to receive either 4 µg/kg ondansetron or placebo, orally, twice daily (double-blind) for 11 additional weeks. In addition to study treatment, all subjects received weekly, standardized, manual-driven, cognitive behavioral therapy.
 
Eligible subjects were classified to one of twelve groups described by the 2×2 x 3 factorial combinations and randomized to placebo or ondansetron (4 mcg/kg twice daily [b.i.d.]) using a computed blocks randomization procedure that balances the twelve treatment groups on drinks/day ≤ 7.99 vs ≥8.00), age of onset (early vs. late), and genotype (LL, SS, SL).
 
Genotyping and analysis of the study subjects for the SNP rs1042173 (TT, TG or GG) in the 3´-UTR of the 5-SLC6A4 gene that codes for the serotonin transporter was performed following randomization but prior to database lock. Genotyping and analysis of the study subjects for SNPs located on genes that govern expression of the 5-HT3A and 5-HT3B subunits of the 5-HT3 receptor was performed after database lock.
 
During treatment, subjects were evaluated weekly at the study center for efficacy, safety, and tolerability. Alcohol consumption was collected via the self-reported Timeline Follow-Back (TLFB) method (Sobell and Sobell, Psychosocial & Biochem. Meth., 1992).
 
Efficacy measures were based on self-reported drinking outcomes with drinks per drinking day (“DDD”), with a standard drink equal to 14 grams of alcohol, and the percentage of days abstinent (“PDA”) being the pre-specified efficacy end points. Withdrawal symptoms, social functioning, and motivation to use alcohol were assessed using standard questionnaires and scales. Subject safety was monitored through periodic electrocardiograms (EKGs), physical exams, safety laboratories and collection of adverse events, concomitant medications, and vital signs. Additionally, a post hoc analysis was conducted using the endpoint of percentage of heavy drinking days (“PDHD”), which is the number of days of heavy drinking days in a month as a percentage of days in the month, because it is widely recognized as a clinically meaningful endpoint and is expected to be an end point in a pivotal/Phase 3 trials. The PDHD end point requires that each day be determined to be a heavy drinking day (i.e., a day in which a female drinks 4 or more drinks or a male drinks 5 or more drinks) or not, making each day binary and requiring an increased sample size to ensure statistical power. Therefore, the goal of the PDHD analysis was to determine if the was a trend toward and effect with PDHD without necessary achieving statistical significance.
 
The study objectives were to evaluate the safety of AD04 and to test the hypotheses that: (i) ondansetron will have a greater effect of reducing the severity of alcohol drinking and of increasing the percentage of days abstinent among alcohol-dependent subjects with the LL genotype as compared with S carriers (SS or SL) of the 5´-HTTLPR; and (ii) ondansetron’s therapeutic effect will be greatest among alcohol-dependent subjects who possess both the LL genotype of the 5´-HTTLPR and the TT genotype of rs1042173 in the 3´-UTR of the 5´-HTT. After completion of the study, a planned additional analysis of the correlation between genotype and drinking outcomes was conducted considering 18 SNPs located on the 5-HT3A and 5-HT3B subunit genes that were selected based on their minor allele frequency (≥ 0.05) in different ethnic populations, to obtain uniform physical coverage of the two genes, and on results from previous genetic association studies. This latter analysis identified three SNPs as having an apparent beneficial effect.
 
The primary analytic procedure used mixed-effects linear regression models and a sensitivity analysis using repeated measures models.
 
Additionally, based on the expectation that subjects with the LL and LL/TT variants of the SLC6A4 gene would respond to ondansetron treatment while others do not, the possibility that SNPs in the 5-HT3A and 5-HT3B subunits of the 5-HT3AB receptor complex may also influence the response to ondansetron was planned as a post hoc analysis. The possible role of SNPs on the HTR3A and HTR3B genes in the response to ondansetron is logical since the 5-HT3A receptor subunit is the primary target for ondansetron’s actions, and the 5-HT3B receptor subunit may be associated with the availability and externalization of the 5-HT3AB receptor complex. Thus, alterations in post-synaptic receptors, such as the 5-HT3AB receptor complex, could have a large impact on signal transduction along post-synaptic neurons. For these analyses, a total of 18 SNPs on the genes for the 5-HT3A and 5-HT3B subunits were examined. SNPs were selected based on their minor allele frequency (≥ 0.05) in different ethnic populations, to obtain uniform physical coverage of the two genes, and on results from previous genetic association studies.
 
Summary Results — Safety:
 
Overall, 95% of the subjects in the ondansetron group and 96% in the placebo group reported a treatment-emergent AE (TEAE) during the study. TEAEs occurred most frequently in the SOCs of gastrointestinal disorders (ondansetron 65%, placebo 61%), metabolism and nutritional disorders (38%, 43%), and nervous system disorders (60%, 58%). The incidence of TEAEs by preferred term was similar between the ondansetron and placebo groups. TEAEs that occurred at a frequency ≥ 5% in the ondansetron group compared with the placebo group included constipation (32%, 21%), fatigue (39%, 25%), and dizziness (21%, 12%). There was one death during the study; Subject #218 committed suicide on Study Day 40. The event was considered not related to study drug. Treatment-emergent SAEs were reported in 3 (2.1%) ondansetron-treated subjects and 6 (3.8%) placebo-treated subjects. No SAE was considered related to study drug, and detoxification was the only SAE that was reported for more than 1 subject (2 ondansetron subjects). No clinically meaningful changes in clinical laboratory results, vital sign measurements, ECGs or physical examinations were observed for subjects during the course of the study.

Summary Results — Primary Analysis of Efficacy of LL and LL/TT
 
Analysis of the LL genotype of the 5´-HTTLPR as compared to the non-LL genotypes showed a significant reduction in DDD and PDA (Johnson, et.al, Am. Jrnl. Psych., 2011). However, the demonstrated effect of the LL/TT vs. other patients was more pronounced, and carriers of LL/TT genotype who received ondansetron showed a greater reduction in drinking compared to LL/TT on placebo. Carriers of the LL/TT genotype who received ondansetron showed a greater reduction in DDD compared to: 1) LL/TT carriers who received placebo (difference of 2.05 drinks/drinking day; 95% CI, -3.72 to -0.39; p=0.0158), 2) LL/Gx carriers who received ondansetron (difference of 2.29 drinks/drinking day; 95% CI, -3.99 to -0.72; p=0.0048), and 3) all other genotypes who received ondansetron treatment (difference of 2.58 drinks/drinking day; 95% CI, -3.94 to 1.22; p<0.0001); and a greater PDA compared with: 1) the LL/TT genotype group treated with placebo (mean difference=12.38%; 95% CI= -1.57 to 26.33; p= 0.0819), 2) LL/Gx carriers treated with ondansetron (mean difference=15.14%; 95% CI= 1.41 to 28.87; p= 0.0307), and 3) all other genotypes treated with ondansetron (difference= 16.82%; 95% CI= 6.15 to 27.48; p=0.0020). The post hoc analysis of the PDHD endpoint show that ondansetron treatment of subjects with the LL/TT genotype was associated with a larger (but not statistically significant) reduction in PDHD compared to changes in PDHD in subjects with all other genotypes who received treatment with ondansetron (mean difference= -8.49%; 95% CI= 20.34 to 3.367; p= 0.1601). Similar trends (i.e., augmented reductions in PDHD) were observed for the LL/TT group treated with ondansetron versus the LL/Gx genotype group treated with ondansetron and versus the LL/TT group treated with placebo (mean difference=-2.54% 95% CI= 17.74 to 12.66, p=0.7431; and mean difference= 5.72% 95% CI= 21.20 to 9.75, p=0.4684; respectively).
 
Identification of Modulators of the 5-HT3 Receptor and Selection of the Phase 3 Genetic Panel for AD04
 
As stated above, a total of 18 SNPs on the genes for the 5-HT3A and 5-HT3B subunits were examined with SNPs selected based on frequency and on results from previous genetic association studies.
 
These analyses identified 3 SNPs (three in the gene for the 5-HT3A subunit and one in the gene for the 5-HT3B subunit) that were significantly associated with a positive response to ondansetron based on reductions in DDD and PDA. Thus, the genotype profile targeted for Phase 3 development is defined as those subjects who carry the LL/TT genotype and/or one of three 5-HT3 SNPs of interest (i.e., rs1150226-AG and rs1176713-GG in the gene that encodes the 5-HT3A receptor subunit and rs17614942-AC in the gene that encodes the 5-HT3B receptor subunit). The hypothesis that subjects who are carriers of the genotype panel targeted for study in Phase 3 (“P3-genotype”, with such patients “genotype positive” or “marker positive”) preferentially respond to treatment with ondansetron compared to subjects who do not carry any of the genotypes targeted for study in Phase 3 were assessed using the drinking endpoints of DDD, PDA, and PDHD.
 
Carriers of the P3-genotype who received ondansetron showed a greater reduction in DDD compared to P3-genotype carriers who received placebo (difference of 1.71 drinks/drinking day; 95% CI= -2.88 to -0.54; p=0.0042), and compared to subjects treated with ondansetron who were not carriers of the P3-genotype (All Other-OND; difference of 2.05 drinks/drinking day; 95% CI= -3.11 to -1.00, p=0.0001). In contrast, no difference was observed between non-P3-genotypes who received ondansetron (All Other-OND) versus non-P3-genotypes who received placebo (All Other-Placebo; difference of 0.40 drinks/drinking day; 95% CI= -0.43 to 1.23; p=0.3445). The mean baseline DDD for all subjects was 9.5 drinks/drinking day. Carriers of the P3-genotype who received ondansetron (P3-OND) had a greater increase in PDA compared to P3-genotype carriers who received placebo (P3-Placebo; difference of 11.56%; 95% CI= 0.80 to 22.31; p=0.0352) and compared to non-P3-genotype carriers who received ondansetron (All Other-OND; difference of 11.52%; 95% CI= 1.76 to 21.28; p=0.0208). In contrast, no differences were observed for the PDA endpoint between non-P3-genotypes treated with ondansetron versus non P3-genotypes treated with placebo (All Other-OND versus All Other-Placebo; difference of -0.96%; 95% CI= -8.61 to 6.69; p=0.8055). The mean baseline PDA for all subjects was 17%.

As stated, above, the study was not powered to achieve statistical significance against the binary-by-day end point of PDHD, however, carriers of the P3-genotype who received ondansetron (P3-OND) showed a significantly greater reduction in PDHD compared to P3-genotype carriers who received placebo (P3-Placebo; difference of -11.08%; 95% CI= -21.90 to 0.27; p=0.0445), and compared to non-P3-genotype carriers who received ondansetron (All Other-OND; difference of -10.35%; 95% CI= -20.11 to -0.58; p=0.0378). In contrast, no difference was observed between non-P3-genotypes who received ondansetron (All Other-OND) versus non-P3-genotypes who received Placebo (All Other-Placebo; difference of 2.88%; 95% CI= -4.80 to 10.56; p=0.4625).

Definition of Heavy Drinking Day
 
As stated above, for the PDHD post hoc analysis of the Phase 2b clinical trial data, a heavy drinking day was defined as a day when a female drank 4 or more drinks in a day, with a drink being defined as containing 14 grams of alcohol, or when a man drank 5 or more drinks in a day, which was the definition the FDA indicated to us was required. It is also currently the definition of “high-risk drinking” in Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2015-2020 (U.S. Departments of HHS and Agriculture), the NIAAA’s definition of “binge drinking”, and has historically been the definition for a heavy drinking day (Neal, D., & Carey, K., 2007). The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) defines heavy drinking “as drinking 5 or more alcoholic drinks on the same occasion.” Subsequent to our analysis of the Phase 2b data and agreement with the FDA on the definition of a heavy drinking day as 4/5 or more drinks in a day for females/males, the FDA published a draft guidance, in which it states, “Those drinking 4 plus/5 plus [drinks for females and males, respectively] even on occasion have significantly higher risks (10 to 20 percent) of meeting criteria for AUD.” The FDA’s draft guidance then states that the NIAAA defines a heavy drinking day as more than 3 drinks in a day for a woman and more than 4 drinks in a day for a man, which is currently only part of the NIAAA’s definition for “low-risk drinking”, and which is very similar but not necessarily identical to what the FDA indicated to us was required and the criteria we used when generating our study report on the Phase 2b. So, it is unclear which definition of a heavy drinking day the FDA will accept at this time. However, under this different definition of a heavy drinking day as more than 3/4 for females/males, the Phase 2b trial data support the effect of AD04 on reducing heavy drinking and showed a greater reduction in PDHD compared to P3-genotype carriers who received placebo (P3-Placebo; difference of -10.24%; 95% CI= -21.18 to 0.70; p=0.0665), and compared to non-P3-genotype carriers who received ondansetron (All Other-OND; difference of -11.65%; 95% CI= -21.54 to -1.77; p=0.0209). In contrast, no difference was observed between non-P3-genotypes who received ondansetron (All Other-OND) versus non-P3-genotypes who received Placebo (All Other-Placebo; difference of 4.09%; 95% CI= -3.70 to 11.88; p=0.3033). We do not expect a small change to the definition of a heavy drinking day to dramatically change our plans or probability of success. We intend to discuss the definition of a heavy drinking day with the FDA and EMA prior to our relevant submissions.
Planned Phase 3 Clinical Program
 
The FDA has indicated that we can proceed with a single-arm, two-cell Phase 3 clinical trial design for the testing of AD04 as a treatment for AUD in patients that are genotype positive when tested against the AD04 genetic panel using our companion diagnostic test (i.e., a negative genetic test result will be an exclusion criterion). The initial Phase 3 trial is planned to be conducted in 294 patients in Scandinavia and Central and Eastern Europe where the prevalence of genotype positive people appears to be higher than in the U.S. and Western Europe. The primary analysis is expected to use the primary endpoints previously accepted by the European Medicines Authority (“EMA”) with the reduction from baseline of heavy drinking and reduction from baseline in total alcohol consumed being the co-primary endpoints, and an alternative analysis is expected to be conducted for filing in the United States using the FDA specified endpoint of reduction in percentage of patients with heavy drinking during the efficacy observation period as compared to placebo (FDA Feb. 2015 Draft Guidance Alcoholism: Developing Drugs for Treatment Guidance for Industry ) and which the FDA has indicated will be acceptable. Under this guidance, the FDA appears to now define a heavy drinking as more than three drinks in a day for a woman and more than four drinks in a day for a man, which is a reduction from the prior definition. We intend to seek clarification from the FDA on the definition of a heavy drinking day prior to our submission to them and do not believe a minor change to the definition of a heavy drinking day will be material to our plans. To conduct this initial trial, we plan to file a Clinical Trial Authorization (“CTA”) with the EMA and not file with the FDA since the trial is intended to be run exclusively in Europe. We have placed our investigational new drug (“IND”) application with the FDA on inactive status, which is a voluntary decision that reflects our strategic decision not to pursue clinical trials in the United States at this time. If we should choose to conduct clinical trials in the future in the United States, we will be required to reactivate our IND in the United States prior to commencing any such clinical trials.
 
If the initial Phase 3 trial is successful, we intend to consult with the FDA and EMA, and assuming agreement from the agencies, conduct a second Phase 3 clinical trial in a broader geography that includes the United States. The trial design is expected to be the same as the first Phase 3 trial but is expected to include 580 patients in order provide increased exposure data to demonstrate the safety and tolerability of AD04 and increase the statistical power of the study. Depending on the results of the initial Phase 3 trial, which will not be fully powered for the FDA endpoint, it is also possible that the FDA may require a third Phase 3 trial. If a third Phase 3 trial is required, we would expect to conduct it in parallel with the second Phase 3 trial with a goal of not delaying approval of AD04, though this would require additional funds and investment in the clinical trials.
 
We have had a joint meeting with the Center for Drug Evaluation and Review (“CDER”) and the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (“CDRH”), the two divisions of the FDA responsible for drug approvals and test approvals, respectively. At the meeting the divisions agreed that clinical validation of our companion diagnostic test for AD04 will be evaluated by CDER and the technical validation of our companion diagnostic will be evaluated by CDRH. We already developed the methods for the companion diagnostic as a blood test and established the test with a U.S. third-party vendor capable of supporting a Phase 3 clinical trial, and have built validation and possible approval of the companion diagnostic into the Phase 3 program, including that we plan to store blood samples for all patients in the event additional genetic testing is required by regulatory authorities.
 
We do not plan to test AD04 in pediatric patients as part of our next Phase 3 trial. The FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data in pediatric subjects. We intend to apply for such a waiver, and the FDA has currently indicated it will grant a waiver for initial approval of AD04 for AUD.

In parallel with the second Phase 3 trial, we expect to conduct any standard Phase 1 studies required by the regulatory agencies. Studies that have been discussed with the FDA as potentially being required might assess food effects, potentiation of the central nervous system effects of alcohol, and pharmacodynamic impact of certain cytochrome P450 enzyme variants.

Additionally, the UVA LVG License grants rights to data and know-how developed by the University of Virginia related to AD04, including, without limitation, to the data from the Phase 2b study described above.
 
As consideration for the rights granted in the license agreement, we are obligated to pay UVA LVG yearly license fees and milestone payments, and a royalty based on net sales of products covered by the patent-related rights set forth above. More specifically, upon commencement of the license we issued to UVA LVG Class A Units (which was equal to four percent (4%) of our equity on the date of issuance) as a license issue. We are obligated to pay UVA LVG (i) annual minimum royalties of $40,000 commencing in 2017; (ii) a $20,000 milestone payments upon dosing the first patient under a Phase 3 human clinical trial of a licensed product, $155,000 upon the earlier of the completion of a Phase 3 trial of a licensed product or the partnering of the licensed or sale of our company, $275,000 upon acceptance of an NDA by the FDA, and $1,000,000 upon approval for sale of AD04 in the U.S., Europe or Japan; and (iii) royalties equal to a 2% and 1% of net sales of licensed products in countries in which a valid patent exists or does not exist, respectively, with royalties paid quarterly. In the event of a sublicense to a third party, we are obligated to pay royalties to UVA LVG equal to a percentage of what we would have been required to pay to UVA LVG had we sold the products under sublicense ourselves. In addition, we are required to pay to UVA LVG 15% of any sublicensing income. The license agreement, as amended on December 14, 2017 and further amended on December 18, 2019 sets forth specific milestones completion deadlines including initiate a Phase 3 clinical trial as defined by 21 C.F.R. §312.21(c) by December 31, 2019, using commercially reasonable efforts to submit an NDA by December 31, 2024 and commence commercialization of an FDA approved product by December 31, 2025. The license agreement may be terminated by UVA LVG upon sixty (60) days written notice if we breach our obligations thereunder, including failing to make any milestone, the most immediate being initiating Phase 3 clinical trials by December 31, 2019, or failing to use commercially reasonable efforts to submit an NDA or commence commercialization within the date specified above, failing to make other required payments, or the failure to exercise diligence to bring licensed products to market. In the event of a termination, we will be obligated to pay all amounts that accrued prior to such termination. The license agreement also contains other customary clauses and terms as are common in similar agreements between industry and academia, including agreements to indemnify UVA LVG for any liabilities arising out of or related to the licensee’s exercise of its rights under the license agreement, making the license grant subject to the Bayh-Dole Act (35 U.S.C. 200 et seq.), the reservation of the licensor of the right to use the licensed intellectual property rights for its internal, non-commercial purposes, limitations/disclaimers of various warranties and representations, reporting and record-keeping requirements, and licensee liability insurance requirements.
 
The term of the license continues until the expiration, abandonment or invalidation of the licensed patents, and following any such expiration, abandonment or invalidation will continue in perpetuity on a royalty-free, fully-paid basis.
 
The UVA LVG currently has a policy under which up to 35% of the payments made to the UVA LVG under a license may be distributed to inventor of the licensed technology, therefor the Chairman of the Board in his capacity as inventor of the patents licensed by us from the UVA LVG may be eligible to receive such payments from the UVA LVG.

Protection from Generic Competition
 
Since our inception, we have focused on taking action primarily through the filing of patents geared toward ensuring AD04 will have market exclusivity for at least 10 years after it is launched with particular focus on the U.S. and Europe. Ondansetron, the active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”) of AD04 was granted FDA approval as Zofran® for the treatment of post-operative and post-chemotherapy nausea and emesis in January 1991 and is now commercially available in generic form at doses from more than 12 times the AD04 dose to over 70 times the AD04 dose with the highest doses being administered intravenously (“i.v.”), which provides almost twice the drug exposure levels as oral dosing. With generic ondansetron available, the following threats have been addressed: (i) the potential use of currently available ondansetron products (i.e., Zofran®) “off-label”, and (ii) the potential manufacturing and launching of a generic version AD04 by a competitor.
 
Limited Threat of “Off-label” Use of Zofran®
 
The lowest doses of Zofran® tablets (and its generic equivalents) on the market are a 4 mg and 8 mg tablet as compared to AD04, which is currently formulated as a 0.33 mg tablet (12.2 times less than the 4 mg tablet). Thus, in order for a patient to use tablets already on the market and get the AD04 dose, a patient would have to cut the 4 mg tablet into 12 parts (or the 8 mg tablet into 24 parts), which we do not believe is reasonably possible; and, even with precise sectioning into 12 pieces, the dose may still not be accurate because tablets at the Zofran® dose have not been manufactured to ensure uniformity of distribution of the active ingredient across the tablet. Therefore, we believe that the risk of a large number of patients attempting to cut the currently marketed tablet to achieve the AD04 dose to be extremely low.
 
Since we do not believe that Zofran® tablets can be used as a substitute for AD04, the main question related to the potential for off-label use of the current products for treating addictions then becomes whether doctors and patients will believe it is possible to use the currently available, higher doses of ondansetron to treat addictions, including AUD. We believe doctors are extremely unlikely to prescribe currently available high dose versions of ondansetron and that any such prescribing that dose will likely be limited and immaterial to the sales of AD04 for two reasons — (1) we believe the high doses are unlikely to be efficacious as a treatment for AUD, and (2) we believe the high doses would likely raise significant safety concerns.
 

1. | Lack of Efficacy. The high doses of ondansetron found in Zofran® have been tested in clinical trials for treating AUD and have not shown efficacy against AUD (Sellers, et. al. 1994). At best, existing trial results do not suggest that the high Zofran®-level doses of ondansetron currently on the market and approved for nausea and emesis will be effective.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Safety Concerns. While high-dose ondansetron is safe and tolerable at the doses on the market if administered acutely (i.e., dosed for a few hours i.v. or a few days orally) as is done for post-operative and post-chemotherapy nausea and emesis, the drug is known to have cardiovascular side effects at higher doses, and results from clinical studies suggest that high doses of ondansetron may affect the electrical activity of the heart. In fact, the FDA withdrew approval of the 32 mg i.v. Zofran® product that was previously on the market. As part of the FDA’s on-going safety review of currently available ondansetron doses, the FDA has stated that: “Ondansetron at currently marketed levels may increase the risk of developing prolongation of the QT interval of the electrocardiogram, which can lead to an abnormal or potentially fatal heart rhythm.” There are also several recent lawsuits claiming that Zofran® used for off label for morning sickness causes birth defects. Thus, if the currently available high-dose ondansetron was used chronically as would be needed for treating addiction there could potentially be significant safety concerns without additional clinical studies related to the chronic dosing of currently available ondansetron. At the lower dose of ondansetron in AD04, our product is almost as low as one one-hundredth of the dose of i.v. ondansetron that was removed from the market. The FDA has stated that we can commence chronic dosing of patients with AD04 without any further safety or non-clinical studies.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Therefore, we do not expect physicians to prescribe current ondansetron doses for currently unapproved use for treating AUD because there is no evidence those doses would work for treating AUD and there may be safety concerns associated with the chronic administration of currently available doses.
 
There is also a liquid, pediatric formulation of Zofran® on the market. It is offered in a 50 mL bottle that is available for a little over $100 online and would provide a 2-month supply of AD04 if dosed at the 0.4 mL required to achieve the 0.33 mg AD04 dose. Our risk assessment is that, though it would be possible to use the liquid formulation for administering a dose of ondansetron equivalent to AD04, it is not expected to be a practice that would materially impact the sales of AD04, and the risk from the liquid formulation is low for the following reasons:
 

1. | Compliance concerns. In the field of addiction, patient compliance is one of the biggest concerns for both the physicians and the patients themselves. A treatment not appropriately administered is a treatment that will not work. Oral tablets have been shown to have one of the highest compliance rates over other dosage forms. It is likely that both physicians and patients will demand the tablet in order to improve compliance and, thus, treatment success rates.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
17

 


2. | Inconvenient, complicated delivery. A major driver of compliance is the convenience of appropriately administering the drug. Appropriate delivery of the liquid formulation would require patients to measure each dose into a graduated dropper or syringe (administration of such a small amount (0.4 mL) by graduated cup would not be practical). Cleanup of the sticky product would be inconvenient as would transportation and storage, and an opened bottle would need to be used within 4 weeks (per UKPAR). Therefore, we expect that AD04’s convenient tablet would increase patient compliance relative to the liquid formulation. Bottle breakage and spillage will also be a concern.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Dosing Accuracy. Dosing accuracy is particularly important when using ondansetron to treat alcoholism due to the limitations of the therapeutic window and the cardiovascular side effects at high doses. With the liquid formulation, measuring the small (0.4 mL) dose will be difficult with great opportunity for misdosing even if a graduated syringe is used. In real-world practice, many patients would use other methods such as estimated pouring into cups and drinking directly from the bottle. Misdosing could significantly affect the safety and/or efficacy of the treatment.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | Lack of physician motivation to prescribe the liquid formulation. Given the known compliance advantages of oral tablets vs. liquid formulations, the heightened need for compliance in this particular patient population, and the concerns around dosing accuracy with a liquid formulation, we believe it is likely physicians would recognize the risk of prescribing the liquid formulation off-label and so be unwilling to prescribe it. For insured patients, any differential in co-payments would create little incentive to use the liquid formulation relative to the compliance and inconvenience problems.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5. | Lack of competitive marketing. Manufacturers of liquid ondansetron are not allowed to market for reduction in alcohol use disorder because reduction in alcohol use disorder is not an approved indication for their product. Furthermore, most generic companies do not have marketing efforts of any kind.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


6. | Litigation risk to large prescribers. If a large clinic (such as a rehabilitation clinic) prescribes or provides the liquid formulation off-label, the institution could be liable for inducing infringement of our licensed patents.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In summary, we do not expect off-label use of currently available ondansetron to meaningfully impact the sales of AD04.
 
Protection from a Competitor Launching a Generic Version of AD04.
 
We believe that we license the patent protection necessary to protect us against the launch by a competitor of a generic version of AD04. The label being sought for AD04 will be:
 
The use of AD04 (i.e., ondansetron) for the treatment of patients that are positive for the specified genetic markers.
 
The only use for the AD04 dose of ondansetron will be under this label.
 
Our licensed patents cover the following:
 
The use of AD04 (i.e., ondansetron) for the treatment of patients that are positive for the specified genetic markers.
 
We believe that any attempt by competitors to reformulate and market ondansetron at our intended dosage levels, while technically feasible, can be interpreted under current case law as inducement to infringe on our intellectual property rights, which should, accordingly, be actionable. Additionally, there will be no unpatented use for the AD04 dose of ondansetron. So, a competitor that sells a product containing the AD04 dose of ondansetron will indirectly infringe our licensed patents, which should, accordingly, be actionable.
 
A competitor could sell a dose equal to that of AD04 and avoid our licensed patents if they conduct a Phase 3 program using the AD04 dose to treat a different label indication, and achieved successful results and approval. We do not know of any clinical development programs of ondansetron underway at this time and so consider this risk to be negligible.

Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company
 
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”), and therefore we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various public company reporting requirements, including not being required to have our internal controls over financial reporting audited by our independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and any golden parachute payments. We may take advantage of these exemptions until we are no longer an “emerging growth company.” In addition, the JOBS Act provides that an “emerging growth company” can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under the JOBS Act. This election allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates. We will remain an “emerging growth company” until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year: (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering; (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion; or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeded $700.0 million as of the prior June 30th , and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” have the meaning associated with that term in the JOBS Act.

Governmental Regulation
 
Our business is subject to extensive laws and regulations, the most significant of which are summarized below.
 
FDA Approval Process
 
In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FDC Act”), and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. In the United States, pharmaceutical products used for the prevention, treatment, or cure of a disease or condition of a human being are subject to extensive regulation under the FDC Act. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution.
 
Pharmaceutical product development for a new product or certain changes to an approved product in the United States typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application (“IND”), which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product or disease.
 
19

 

Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including good laboratory practices. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted.
 
A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin. However, the FDA can impose a clinical hold after 30 days if it has safety or compliance-related concerns.
 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug or biologic to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with good clinical practice (“GCP”), an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of subjects and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators, and monitors; as well as (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. subjects and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
 
As noted, the FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The study protocol and informed consent information for subjects in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board (“IRB”), for approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, for safety or other concerns, or may impose other conditions.
 
Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug or biologic into healthy human subjects or patients, the product is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, early evidence of effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug or biologic for a particular indication, dosage tolerance, and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If preliminary evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug or biologic and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug or biologic.
 
After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The NDA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical, and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and control. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial. The submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, currently exceeding $2.5 million for fiscal year 2019 (although a waiver is possible in certain cases), and the manufacturer and/or sponsor under an approved new drug application are also subject to a program fee set at more than $309,000 for fiscal year 2019. These fees are typically increased annually.
 
The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs. Most such applications for standard review drug or biologic products are reviewed within ten to twelve months; most applications for priority review drugs or biologics are reviewed in six to eight months. The FDA can extend these reviews by three months. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission.
 
The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug or biologic products, or drug or biologic products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee — typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts — for review, evaluation, and a recommendation on questions raised by an application, including whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with current good manufacturing practice (“cGMP”) is satisfactory and the NDA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug or biologic is safe and effective in the indication studied.
 
After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter (“CRL”). In some cases, FDA may choose to extend the review time, in consultation with the sponsor. A CRL generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included.

An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug or biologic with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use (“ETASU”). ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the product’s safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. The FDA could also impose a boxed warning (sometimes referred to as a Black Box Warning) in the product label if it identifies a specific risk that requires particular attention. This imposition of a Black Box Warning limits certain types of promotions.
 
Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented.
 
Enacted in 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act (the “Cures Act”), in part, revises the drug and device review and approval processes at the FDA. The Cures Act, which was signed into law on December 13, 2016, among other things, requires the manufacturer of an investigational drug for a serious disease or condition to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy on evaluating and responding to requests for individual patient access to such investigational drug. This requirement applies on the later of 60 calendar days after the date of enactment of the Cures Act or the first initiation of a Phase 2 or Phase 3 trial of the investigational drug.
 
Post-Approval Requirements
 
Once an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs and biologics, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Drugs and biologics may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling.
 
Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following FDA approval of an NDA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, REMS, and special surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or the FDA may place other conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control, drug manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Drug and biologic manufacturers must list the product with the FDA, and they and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects manufacturing and other facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs and other requirements. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals, issue warning or other letters, suspend production activities, or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, or take other regulatory or enforcement action if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered. Significant expenses are required to correct deficiencies.
 
Companion diagnostics and complementary diagnostics
 
We believe that the success of our product candidates may depend, in part, on the development and commercialization of either a companion diagnostic or complementary diagnostic. Companion diagnostics and complementary diagnostics can identify patients who are most likely to benefit from a particular therapeutic product; identify patients likely to be at increased risk for serious side effects as a result of treatment with a particular therapeutic product; or monitor response to treatment with a particular therapeutic product for the purpose of adjusting treatment to achieve improved safety or effectiveness. Companion diagnostics and complementary diagnostics are regulated as medical devices by the FDA and, as such, require either clearance or approval prior to commercialization. The level of risk combined with available controls to mitigate risk determines whether a companion diagnostic device requires Premarket Approval Application, or PMA, approval or is cleared through the 510(k) premarket notification process. For a novel therapeutic product for which a companion diagnostic device is essential for the safe and effective use of the product, the companion diagnostic device should be developed and approved or 510(k)-cleared contemporaneously with the therapeutic. The use of the companion diagnostic device will be stipulated in the labeling of the therapeutic product. This is also true for a complementary diagnostic, although it is not a prerequisite for receiving the therapeutic. Currently, we intend to submit a 505(b)(2) new drug application to the FDA for AD04.  We have interacted primarily with the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, in consultation with the agency’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health.  At this time, the FDA has not stated that a new marketing application (e.g., a PMA, or an approval cleared through the 510(k) premarket notification process) will be required for the companion diagnostics to be used with the drug product, but this could change.  If the FDA requires a separate application for the diagnostic, this could potentially delay the approval of the new drug application for AD04, complicate the review process, or even lead to the rejection of the new drug application.
 
Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act
 
Under certain circumstances, an approved application may be eligible for three years of non-patent market exclusivity provided by the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The FDA might grant such exclusivity, (which would be separate from any patent protection to which an approved drug might be entitled) if the applicant conducted new clinical investigations (other than bioavailability studies) that are new and essential to the application’s approval. Among the types of exclusivity are those for a “new chemical entity” and those for a new formulation or indication for a previously-approved drug. If granted, marketing exclusivity for the types of products that include only drugs with innovative changes to previously-approved products using the same active ingredient, might prohibit the FDA from approving an application for a competitor product, such as an abbreviated new drug application or a 505(b)(2) NDA relying on the finding of safety and efficacy for three years. This three-year exclusivity, however, covers only the innovation associated with the original NDA. It does not prohibit the FDA from approving applications for drugs with the same active ingredient but without the new innovative change. These marketing exclusivity protections do not prohibit the FDA from approving a full NDA, even if it contains the innovative change. There is no guarantee that the FDA will grant such exclusivity and competitors can try to seek approval of competitive products, notwithstanding the exclusivity. However, if three years of exclusivity is afforded, it offers us one more barrier to competitor entry for a few years.
  21

 

505(b)(2) NDA
 
We intend to submit a 505(b)(2) NDA. A 505(b)(2) NDA provided by Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, allows the FDA to rely, for approval of an NDA, on data not developed by the applicant. Such an NDA, referred to as a 505(b)(2) application contains full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness, but where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. Such applications permit approval of applications other than those for duplicate products and permit reliance for such approvals on scientific literature or an FDA finding of safety and/or effectiveness for a previously approved drug product. While each application is different, these types of applications will typically require bridging studies (to support the change or modification from the listed drug) and could require clinical data to support the modification of the already-approved drug product.
 
In addition, a 505(b)(2) NDA requires the applicant to certify as to any patents that claim the drug for which a claim of patent infringement could be made. In certain cases, the applicant of the NDA with a patent certification must provide notice to the patent holder, which can lead to a patent infringement lawsuit, thereby delaying the FDA approval of the competitor product for up to 30 months, separate from any traditional patent infringement litigation delay. Similarly, if the competitor has its own market exclusivity, this can delay approval of the product. However, if a product obtains exclusivity or patent protection, it can delay entry of competitors for several years.
 
Pediatric Information
 
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (“PREA”), NDAs or supplements to NDAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. The FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data.
Fraud and Abuse and Other Healthcare Regulation
 
We are subject to various federal and state healthcare laws, including, but not limited to, anti-kickback laws. Penalties for violations of these healthcare laws include, but are not limited to, criminal, civil and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of operations.
 
Anti-Kickback Statute
 
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or paying any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, arranging for or recommending a good or service, or for the purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending, any good, facility, service or item for which payment may be made in whole or in part under federal healthcare programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry. The term “remuneration” expressly includes kickbacks, bribes, or rebates and also has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including for example, gifts, discounts, meals, entertainment, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payments, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market value.
 
There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain business arrangements from prosecution under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. These statutory exceptions and safe harbors set forth provisions that, if all their applicable requirements are met, will assure healthcare providers and other parties that they may not be prosecuted under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. The failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit precisely within one or more applicable statutory exceptions or safe harbors does not necessarily mean that it is per se illegal or that prosecution will be pursued. However, conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy all requirements of an applicable safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities and will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Additionally, the intent standard under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute was amended under the Affordable Care Act, to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. The Affordable Care Act provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act, which is discussed below.
 
Federal Civil False Claims Act
 
The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, persons or entities from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented a false or fraudulent claim to, or the knowing use of false statements to obtain payment from or approval by, the federal government. Suits filed under the federal civil False Claims Act, known as “qui tam” actions, can be brought by any individual on behalf of the government. These individuals, sometimes known as “relators” or, more commonly, as “whistleblowers”, may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. The number of filings of qui tam actions has increased significantly in recent years, causing more healthcare companies to have to defend a case brought under the federal civil False Claim Act. If an entity is determined to have violated the federal civil False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties for each separate false claim. Many comparable state laws are broader in scope and apply to all payors, and therefore, are not limited to only those claims submitted to the federal government.
 
22

 

Federal Physician Self-Referral Prohibition
 
We may also be subject to the federal physician self-referral prohibitions, commonly known as the Stark Law, which prohibits, among other things, physicians who have a financial relationship, including an investment, ownership or compensation relationship with an entity, from referring Medicare and Medicaid patients for designated health services (which include clinical laboratory services) to such entity, unless an exception applies. Similarly, entities may not bill Medicare, Medicaid or any other party for services furnished pursuant to a prohibited referral. Many states have their own self-referral laws as well, which in some cases apply to all third-party payors, not just Medicare and Medicaid.
Federal Civil Monetary Penalties Statute
 
The federal Civil Monetary Penalties Statute, among other things, imposes fines against any person or entity who is determined to have presented, or caused to be presented, claims to a federal healthcare program that the person knows, or should know, is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996
 
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”) created several new federal crimes, including healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
 
In addition, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), and their implementing regulations established uniform standards for certain covered entities, which are healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, as well as their business associates, governing the conduct of specified electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the security and privacy of protected health information. Among other things, HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.
 
The Federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act
 
The federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with certain exceptions, to report annually to CMS, information related to “payments or other transfers of value” provided to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, and to report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by physicians, as defined above, and their immediate family members. Failure to submit timely, accurately and completely the required information for all payments, transfers of value and ownership or investment interests may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year and up to an aggregate of $1.0 million per year for “knowing failures.”
State Law Equivalents
 
Many states have also adopted laws similar to each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may be broader in scope and apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, as well as laws that restrict our marketing activities with health care professionals and entities, and require us to track and report payments and other transfers of value, including consulting fees, provided to certain healthcare professionals and entities. Some states mandate implementation of compliance programs to ensure compliance with these laws. We also are subject to foreign fraud and abuse laws, which vary by country.

Healthcare Reform
 
In March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the “ACA”), which has the potential to substantially change healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impact the drug and medical device industries. The ACA will impact existing government healthcare programs and will result in the development of new programs. The ACA’s provisions of importance include, but are not limited to, a deductible 2.3% excise tax on any entity that manufactures or imports medical devices offered for sale in the Unites States, with limited exceptions, effective January 1, 2013.
 
In addition, the ACA and its implementing regulations, among other things, revised the methodology for calculation of rebates owed by manufacturers to the state and federal government for covered outpatient drugs and certain biologics, including AD04 or any future product candidates, under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, subjected manufacturers to new annual fees and taxes for certain branded prescription drugs, and provided incentives to programs that increase the federal government’s comparative effectiveness research.
 
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers up to 2% per fiscal year. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (the “ATRA”) which delayed for another two months the budget cuts mandated by these sequestration provisions of the Budget Control Act of 2011. In March 2013, the President signed an executive order implementing sequestration, and in April 2013, the 2% Medicare payment reductions went into effect. The ATRA also, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
 
In addition, Congress often uses the Medicare program for pay for legislation. For example, on April 16, 2015, President Obama signed into law the “Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015” (“MACRA”). MACRA repealed the Medicare sustainable growth rate formula that had been used to determine payment levels under the Medicare physician fee schedule (“PFS”), and established a new method to update payments for physicians and other providers paid under the PFS. Congress reduced Medicare payments for several categories of providers and made changes to Medicare policies to offset the cost of the bill. It is possible that future legislation and regulations may include Medicare payment reductions or policy changes that result in reduced payments, increased burdens or increased operating costs.
 
The full impact of the ACA, as well as other laws and reform measures that may be proposed and adopted in the future, remains uncertain, but may continue the downward pressure on medical device pricing, especially under the Medicare program, and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business operations. Efforts to significantly amend or repeal the ACA continue and if passed could have a significant impact on important aspects of our business including medical device and drug pricing, Medicare payment reductions or policy changes that result in reduced payments, or increased burdens or operating costs.
 
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
 
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of such foreign official in her or her official capacity or to secure any other improper advantage in order to obtain or retain business. In addition to the antibribery provisions, the FCPA also obligates “issuers,” companies whose securities are registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act or is required to file periodic and other reports with SEC under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act to comply with the FCPA’s record keeping and internal controls provisions; the accounting provisions require a listed company to maintain books and records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international affiliates, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls to assure management’s control authority, and responsibility over the company’s assets.

Export Controls and Economic Sanctions
 
Several U.S. statutes and regulations regulate the export from the United States of pharmaceutical products. Pursuant to the Export Administration Regulations, (“EAR”) the export (including re-exports and “deemed exports”) of commercial and “dual-use” products may require a license or be prohibited. A listing of the types of goods and services controlled for export by the EAR is on the Commerce Control List (“CCL”), which includes essentially all civilian science, technology, and engineering dual use items. For products listed on the CCL, a license will be required as a condition to export, unless an exclusion or license exception applies. Those items not explicitly included on the CCL are included in a broad category known as “EAR99.” Although a license may not generally be required for EAR99 designated items, a license will be required if the item will be shipped or otherwise transferred to a comprehensively embargoed country or for a potentially prohibited purpose.
 
The Commerce Department’s Office of Antiboycott Compliance and the Treasury Department’s Internal Revenue Service enforce anti-boycott compliance regulations that prohibit U.S. persons such as the Company from participating directly or indirectly with an economic boycott that is not recognized by the United States. The regulations include reporting requirements, prohibitions, and tax liabilities that may be incurred if the Company supports, even inadvertently, an economic boycott in which the U.S. does not participate.
 
Pursuant to the Trading With the Enemy Act, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, and other related statutes, regulations, and Executive Orders, the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions that prohibit or restrict certain activities with embargoed countries, sanctioned entities, and sanctioned individuals for particular foreign policy and national security reasons. The scope of the sanctions varies significantly, but may include comprehensive restrictions on imports, exports, investment, and facilitation of foreign transactions involving a sanctioned jurisdiction, entity or person, as well as non-sanctioned persons and entities acting on behalf of sanctioned jurisdictions, entities or people. OFAC’s programs also prohibit U.S. persons, such as the Company, from transacting with any person or entity that is deemed to be a Foreign Sanctions Evader (foreign individuals and entities determined to have violated, attempted to violate, conspired to violate, or caused a violation of U.S. sanctions).
 
Other U.S. government agencies, including the U.S. Department of State, may maintain regulations that impact the Company’s ability to export pharmaceutical products from the United States. These broad range of U.S. export control laws and regulations obligate U.S. businesses to develop, maintain, and enforce an adequate system of internal controls to ensure compliance with such laws and regulations.
 
Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company
 
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”), and therefore we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various public company reporting requirements, including not being required to have our internal controls over financial reporting audited by our independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and any golden parachute payments. We may take advantage of these exemptions until we are no longer an “emerging growth company.” In addition, the JOBS Act provides that an “emerging growth company” can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under the JOBS Act. This election allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates. We will remain an “emerging growth company” until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year: (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering; (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion; or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeded $700.0 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” have the meaning associated with that term in the JOBS Act.
