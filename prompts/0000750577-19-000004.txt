 ITEM 1.       BUSINESS
 ﻿
 ORGANIZATION AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 
 ﻿
 Hancock Whitney Corporation is a financial services company organized in 1984 as a bank holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended.  In 2002, the Company qualified as a financial holding company, giving it broader powers to engage in financial activities. In 2011, the Company completed the acquisition of Whitney Holding Corporation and its subsidiary bank, Whitney National Bank.  The merger represented the combination of two well-established Gulf South banks, Hancock Bank, founded in 1899, and Whitney Bank, founded in 1883.  Following the merger, the Company’s subsidiary banks operated as “Hancock Bank” in Mississippi, Alabama and Florida and as “Whitney Bank” in Louisiana and Texas.  On May 25, 2018, the Company consolidated its two iconic brands and now operates the financial holding company and the bank as Hancock Whitney Corporation and Hancock Whitney Bank, respectively. The Company’s decision to consolidate the brands highlights its respect for the legacy of two grand old banks.
 ﻿
 The Company, headquartered in Gulfport, Mississippi, provides a comprehensive network of full service financial choices through its bank subsidiary, Hancock Whitney Bank (the “Bank”), a Mississippi state bank and other nonbank affiliates. 
 ﻿
 At December 31, 2018, our balance sheet had grown to $28.2 billion, with loans totaling $20.0 billion and deposits totaling $23.2 billion, and we had 3,933 employees on a full time equivalent basis.    ﻿
 NATURE OF BUSINESS AND MARKETS 
 ﻿
 The Bank offers a broad range of traditional and online banking services to commercial, small business and retail customers, providing a variety of transaction and savings deposit products, treasury management services, secured and unsecured loan products (including revolving credit facilities), and letters of credit and similar financial guarantees.  The Bank also provides trust and investment management services to retirement plans, corporations and individuals. 
 ﻿
 We offer other services through bank and nonbank subsidiaries. Our nonbank subsidiary Hancock Whitney Investment Services, Inc. provides discount investment brokerage services, annuity and life insurance products and participates in select underwriting transactions, primarily for banking clients with which we have an existing relationship. Our bank subsidiaries Hancock Whitney Equipment Finance, LLC and Hancock Whitney Equipment Finance and Leasing, LLC, provide commercial finance products to middle market and corporate clients, including loans, leases and related structures. We also have several special purpose subsidiaries to facilitate investments in new market tax credit activities and others that operate and sell certain foreclosed assets. 
 ﻿
 We operate primarily in the Gulf South region comprised of southern Mississippi; southern and central Alabama; southern Louisiana; the northern, central, and panhandle regions of Florida; and the Houston, Texas area. We also operate a loan production office in Nashville, Tennessee and separate trust and investment management offices in Texas, New York and New Jersey.  
 ﻿
 Our operating strategy is to provide customers with the financial sophistication and range of products of a regional bank, while successfully retaining the commercial appeal and level of service of a community bank. Our size and scale enables us to attract and retain high quality employees, to whom we refer as associates, who are focused on executing this strategy. 
 ﻿
 Some of the most common forms of commerce along the Gulf Coast are energy and related services, petrochemical refining, military and government related activities, educational and medical complexes, transportation services and port facilities, tourism and gaming. 
 ﻿
 Our priority is to grow revenue in our existing markets with controlled expenses while providing five-star service through enhanced technology and processes that make banking simpler for our clients. We have and will continue to invest in promoting new and enhanced products that contribute to the goals of continuing to diversify our sources of revenue and increasing core deposit funding.  Our July 2018 acquisition of Capital One’s trust and asset management business expanded our existing trust operations, and provides

     opportunity to develop relationships for other private, wholesale and retail services. We will continue to evaluate future acquisition opportunities that have the potential to increase shareholder value, provided overall economic conditions and our capital levels support such a transaction.

 Loan Production, Underwriting Standards and Credit Review 
 ﻿
 The Bank’s primary lending focus is to provide commercial, consumer and real estate loans to consumers, small and middle market businesses, and corporate clients in the markets served by the Bank. We seek to provide quality loan products that are attractive to the borrower and profitable to the Bank. We look to build strong, profitable client relationships over time and maintain a strong presence and position of influence in the communities we serve. Through our relationship-based approach, we have developed a deep knowledge of our customers and the markets in which they operate. We continually work to ensure consistency of the lending processes across our banking footprint, to strengthen the underwriting criteria we employ to evaluate new loans and loan renewals, and to diversify our loan portfolio in terms of type, industry and geographical concentration. We believe that these measures position the Bank to meet the credit needs of businesses and consumers in the markets we serve while pursuing a balanced strategy of loan profitability, growth and credit quality. 
 ﻿
 The following describes the underwriting procedures of the lending function and presents our principal categories of loans. The results of our lending activities and the relative risk of the loan portfolio are discussed in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” 
 ﻿
 The Bank has a set of loan policies, underwriting standards and key underwriting functions designed to achieve a consistent lending and credit review approach. Our underwriting standards address the following criteria: 

· | collateral requirements;
--+-------------------------


· | guarantor requirements (including policies on financial statements, tax returns, and guarantees);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | requirements regarding appraisals and their review;
--+----------------------------------------------------


· | loan approval hierarchy;
--+-------------------------


· | standard consumer and small business credit scoring underwriting criteria (including credit score thresholds, maximum maturity and amortization, loan-to-value limits, global debt service coverage, and debt to income limits);
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | commercial real estate and commercial and industrial underwriting guidelines (including minimum debt service coverage ratio, maximum amortization, minimum equity requirements, maximum loan-to-value ratios);
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | lending limits; and
--+--------------------


· | credit approval authorities.
--+-----------------------------

  ﻿
 Additionally, our loan concentration policy sets limits and manages our exposures within specified concentration tolerances, including those to particular borrowers, foreign entities, industries, and property types for commercial real estate. This policy sets standards for portfolio risk management and reporting, the monitoring of large borrower concentration limits and systematic tracking of large commercial loans and our portfolio mix. We continually monitor our concentration of commercial real estate, health care and energy-related loans to ensure the mix is consistent with our risk tolerance. We define concentration as the total of funded and unfunded commitments as a percentage of total Bank capital (as defined for risk-based capital ratios). Portfolio segment concentrations (shown as a percentage of risk-based capital) as of December 31, 2018 are as follows:    ﻿
 Portfolio Segment Concentrations 

· | Commercial non-real estate — 480%
--+----------------------------------


· | Commercial real estate - owner occupied — 117%
--+-----------------------------------------------


· | Non-owner occupied commercial real estate — 115%
--+-------------------------------------------------


· | Residential mortgage — 140%
--+----------------------------


· | Consumer real estate secured — 84%
--+-----------------------------------


· | Consumer other — 66%

  ﻿
 Our underwriting process is structured to require oversight that is proportional to the size and complexity of the lending relationship. We delegate designated regional managers, relationship managers, and credit officers loan authority that can be utilized to approve credit commitments for a single borrowing relationship. The limit of delegated authority is based upon the experience, skill and training of the relationship manager or credit officer. Certain types and sizes of loans and relationships must be approved by either one of the Bank’s centralized underwriting units or by Regional or Senior Regional Commercial Credit Officers, either individually or jointly with either the Chief Credit Officer or Chief Credit Approval Officer, depending upon the overall size of the borrowing relationship. 
 ﻿
 Loans are underwritten in accordance with the underwriting standards and loan policies of the Bank. Loans are underwritten primarily on the basis of the borrower’s ability to make timely debt service payments, and secondarily on collateral value. Generally, real estate secured loans and mortgage loans are made when the borrower produces evidence of the ability to make timely debt service payments along with appropriate equity investment in the property. Appropriate and regulatory compliant third party valuations are required at the time of origination for real estate secured loans. 
 ﻿
 The following briefly describes the composition of our loan portfolio by segment:
 ﻿
 Commercial and industrial
 The Bank offers a variety of commercial loan services to a diversified customer base over a range of industries, including energy, wholesale and retail trade in various durable and nondurable products, manufacturing of such products, marine transportation and maritime construction, financial and professional services, healthcare services, and agricultural production. Commercial and industrial loans are made available to businesses for working capital (including financing of inventory and receivables), business expansion, to facilitate the acquisition of a business, and the purchase of equipment and machinery, including equipment leasing. 
 ﻿
 Commercial non-real estate loans may be secured by the assets being financed or other tangible or intangible business assets such as accounts receivable, inventory, ownership, enterprise value, or commodity interests, and may incorporate a personal or corporate guarantee; however, some short-term loans may be made on an unsecured basis, including a small portfolio of corporate credit cards, generally issued as a part of overall customer relationships.  Asset-based loans, such as accounts receivables and commodity interest secured loans, may have limits on borrowing that are based on the collateral values.  In the case of loans secured by accounts receivable, the availability of funds for the repayment of these loans may be substantially dependent on the ability of the borrower to collect amounts due from its customers. 
     Commercial real estate – owner occupied loans consist of commercial mortgages on properties where repayment is generally dependent on the cash flow from the ongoing operations and activities of the borrower.  Like commercial non-real estate, these loans are primarily made based on the identified cash flows of the borrower, but also have the added strength of the value of underlying real estate collateral.   
 ﻿

     Commercial real estate – income producing
 Commercial real estate – income producing loans consist of loans secured by commercial mortgages on properties where the loan is made to real estate developers or investors and repayment is dependent on the sale, refinance or income generated from the operation of the property.  Properties financed include retail, office, multifamily, senior housing, hotel/motel, skilled nursing facilities and other commercial properties.  
 ﻿
 Repayment of commercial real estate – income producing loans is generally dependent on the successful operation of the property securing the loan. Commercial real estate loans may be adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the general economy. The properties securing the commercial real estate – income producing portfolios are diverse in terms of type and geographic location. We monitor and evaluate these loans based on collateral, geography and risk grade criteria. This portfolio has experienced minimal losses in the last few years; however, past experience has shown that commercial real estate conditions can be volatile, so we actively monitor concentrations within this portfolio segment.  
 ﻿
 Construction and land development
 Construction and land development loans are made to facilitate the acquisition, development, improvement and construction of both commercial and residential-purpose properties.  Such loans are made to builders and investors where repayment is expected to be made from the sale, refinance or operation of the property or to businesses to be used in their business operations.  
 ﻿
 Acquisition and development loans are underwritten utilizing feasibility studies, independent appraisal reviews, sensitivity analysis of real estate absorption and lease rates, and financial analysis of the developers and property owners. Construction loans are generally based upon cost estimates, the amount of sponsor equity investment, and the projected value of the completed project. The Bank monitors the construction process to mitigate or identify risks as they arise. Construction loans often involve the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment largely dependent on the success of the ultimate project. Sources of repayment for these types of construction loans may be pre-committed permanent loans from approved long-term lenders, sales of developed property, or an interim loan commitment from the Bank until permanent financing is obtained. These loans are typically closely monitored by on-site inspections and are considered to have higher risks than other real estate loans due to their ultimate repayment being sensitive to interest rate changes, governmental regulation of real property, general economic conditions, and the availability of long-term financing to repay the construction loan in full. 
 ﻿
 Owner occupied loans for the development and improvement of real property to commercial customers to be used in their business operations are underwritten subject to normal commercial and industrial credit standards and are generally subject to project tracking processes, similar to those required for the non-owner occupied loans. 
 ﻿
 This portfolio also includes residential construction loans and loans secured by raw land not yet under development.
 ﻿
 Residential Mortgages
 Residential mortgages consist of closed-end loans secured by first liens on 1- 4 family residential properties. The portfolio includes both fixed and adjustable rate loans, although most longer-term, fixed-rate loans originated are sold in the secondary mortgage market.  The sale of fixed-rate mortgage loans allows the Bank to manage the interest rate risks related to such lending operations. 
 ﻿
 Consumer
 Consumer loans include second lien mortgage home loans, home equity lines of credit and nonresidential consumer purpose loans. Nonresidential consumer loans include both direct and indirect loans.   Direct nonresidential consumer loans are made to finance the purchase of personal property, including automobiles, recreational vehicles and boats, and for other personal purposes (secured and unsecured), and deposit account secured loans. Indirect nonresidential loans include automobile financing provided to the consumer through an agreement with automobile dealerships.  Consumer loans also include a small portfolio of credit card receivables issued on the basis of applications received through referrals from the Bank’s branches, online and other marketing efforts.     
 ﻿
 The Bank approves consumer loans based on income and financial information submitted by prospective borrowers as well as credit reports collected from various credit agencies. Financial stability and credit history of the borrower are the primary factors the Bank considers in granting such loans. The availability of collateral is also a factor considered in making such loans. Preference is also given to borrowers in the Bank’s primary market areas. 
 ﻿
 Securities Portfolio 
 ﻿
 The investment portfolio primarily consists of U.S. agency debt securities, U.S. agency mortgage-related securities and obligations of states and municipalities classified as either available for sale or held to maturity. We consider the available for sale portfolio as one of many sources of liquidity available to fund our operations. Investments are made in accordance with an investment policy approved by the Board Risk Committee.  Company policies generally limit investments to agency securities and municipal securities determined to be investment grade according to an internally generated score, which generally includes a rating of not less than “Baa” or its equivalent by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization.  The investment portfolio is tested monthly under multiple 

     
7

 
     stressed interest rate scenarios, the results of which are used to manage our interest rate risk position. The rate scenarios include regulatory and management agreed upon instantaneous and ramped rate movements that may be up to plus 500 basis points. The combined portfolio has a target effective duration of two to five and a half years.    ﻿
 A significant portion of the securities portfolio is used to secure certain deposits and other liabilities requiring collateralization. However, to maintain an adequate level of liquidity, we limit the percentage of securities that can be pledged in order to keep a portion of securities available for sale. The securities portfolio can also be pledged to increase our line of credit available at the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) of Dallas, although we have not had to do so historically. 
 ﻿
 The investments subcommittee of the asset/liability committee (ALCO) is responsible for the oversight, monitoring and management of the investment portfolio. The investments subcommittee is also responsible for the development of investment strategies for the consideration and approval of ALCO. Final authority and responsibility for all aspects of the conduct of investment activities rests with the Board Risk Committee, all in accordance with the overall guidance and limitations of the investment policy. See Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Enterprise Risk Management,” for further discussion. 
 ﻿
 Deposits 
 ﻿
 The Bank has several programs designed to attract deposit accounts from consumers and businesses at interest rates generally consistent with market conditions. Deposits are the most significant funding source for the Company’s interest-earning assets. Interest paid on deposits represents the largest component of our interest expense. Deposits are attracted principally from clients within our retail branch network through the offering of a broad array of deposit products to individuals and businesses, including noninterest-bearing demand deposit accounts, interest-bearing transaction accounts, savings accounts, money market deposit accounts, and time deposit accounts. Terms vary among deposit products with respect to commitment periods, minimum balances and applicable fees. Interest rates offered on interest-bearing deposits are determined based on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, (1) interest rates offered in local markets by competitors, (2) current and expected economic conditions, (3) anticipated future interest rates, (4) the expected amount and timing of funding needs, and (5) the availability and cost of alternative funding sources. Deposit flows are controlled primarily through pricing, and to a lesser extent, through promotional activities. Management believes that the rates that it offers on deposit accounts are generally competitive with other financial institutions in the Bank’s respective market areas. Client deposits are attractive sources of funding because of their stability and low relative cost. Deposits are regarded as an important part of the overall client relationship. 
 ﻿
 The Bank also holds deposits of public entities. The Bank’s strategy for acquiring public funds, as with any type of deposit, is determined by ALCO’s funding and liquidity subcommittee while pricing decisions are determined by ALCO’s deposit pricing subcommittee. Typically, many public fund deposits are allocated based upon the rate of interest offered and the ability of a bank to provide collateralization. The Bank can influence the level of its public fund deposits through pricing decisions. Public deposits typically require the pledging of collateral, most commonly marketable securities and Federal Home Loan Bank letters of credit. This is taken into account when determining the level of interest to be paid on public deposits. The pledging of collateral, monitoring and management reporting represents additional operational requirements for the Bank. Public fund deposits are more volatile than other core deposits because they tend to be price sensitive and have high balances. Public funds are only one of many possible sources of liquidity that the Bank has available to draw upon as part of its liquidity funding strategy as set by ALCO. 
 ﻿
 Brokered deposits of $1.23 billion at December 31, 2018 represent about 5% of total deposits. Brokered deposits are funds which the Bank obtains through deposit brokers who sell participations in a given bank deposit account or instrument to one or more investors. These brokered deposits are fully insured by the FDIC because they are participated out by the deposit broker in shares of $250,000 or less. These brokered deposit issuances were approved by ALCO as one component of its funding strategy to support ongoing asset growth until such time as customer deposit growth ultimately replaces the brokered deposits. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (“FDICIA”), the Bank may continue to accept brokered deposits as long as it is either “well-capitalized” or “adequately-capitalized.”
 ﻿
 Trust Services 
 ﻿
 The Bank, through its trust department, offers a full range of trust services on a fee basis. In its trust capacities, the Bank provides investment management services on an agency basis and acts as trustee for pension plans, profit sharing plans, corporate and municipal bond issues, living trusts, life insurance trusts and various other types of trusts created by or for individuals, businesses, and charitable and religious organizations. During 2018, the acquisition of a bank-managed high net worth individual and institutional investment management and trust business expanded the Bank’s existing trust operations.  As of December 31, 2018, the trust department of the Bank had approximately $23.6 billion of assets under administration compared to $15.5 billion as of December 31, 2017.  As of December 31, 2018, administered assets include investment management and investment advisory agency accounts totaling $5.3 billion, corporate trust accounts totaling $4.0 billion, and the remaining balances were personal, employee benefit, estate and other trust accounts.

 COMPETITION 
 ﻿
 The financial services industry is highly competitive in our market areas. The principal factors in the competition for deposits and loans are interest rates and fee structures associated with the various products offered. We also compete through the efficiency, quality and range of services and products we provide, as well as the convenience provided by an extensive network of customer access channels including local branch offices, ATMs, online and mobile banking, and telebanking centers. In attracting deposits and in our lending activities, we generally compete with other commercial banks, savings associations, credit unions, mortgage banking firms, consumer finance companies, securities brokerage firms, mutual funds and insurance companies, and other financial and non-financial institutions offering similar products.

 ﻿
 SUPERVISION AND REGULATION 
 ﻿
 Bank holding companies and banks are extensively regulated under federal and state law.  This discussion is a summary and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provisions described below and is not intended to be an exhaustive description of the statutes or regulations applicable to the Company or the Bank.
 ﻿
 Changes in laws and regulations may alter the structure, regulation and competitive relationships of financial institutions. In addition, bank regulatory agencies may issue enforcement actions, policy statements, interpretive letters and similar written guidance applicable to us or the Bank.  It cannot be predicted whether and in what form new laws and regulations, or interpretations thereof, may be adopted or the extent to which the business of the Company and the Bank may be affected thereby, but they may have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, and earnings.    ﻿
 Supervision, regulation, and examination of the Company, the Bank, and our respective subsidiaries by the appropriate regulatory agencies, as described herein, are intended primarily for the protection of consumers, bank depositors and the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) of the FDIC, and the U.S. banking and financial system, rather than holders of our capital stock.  
 ﻿
 Bank Holding Company Regulation 
 ﻿
 The Company is subject to extensive supervision and regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”) pursuant to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “Bank Holding Company Act”). We are required to file with the Federal Reserve periodic reports and such other information as the Federal Reserve may request.  Ongoing supervision is provided through regular examinations by the Federal Reserve and other means that allow the regulators to gauge management’s ability to identify, assess and control risk in all areas of operations in a safe and sound manner and to ensure compliance with laws and regulations. In addition to regulation by the Federal Reserve as a bank holding company, the Company is subject to regulation by the State of Mississippi under its general business corporation laws, and to supervision by the Mississippi Department of Consumer Finance (the “MDBCF”).  The Federal Reserve may also examine our non-bank subsidiaries. Various federal and state bodies regulate and supervise our brokerage, investment advisory, insurance agency and processing operations. These include, but are not limited to, the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, federal and state banking regulators and various state regulators of insurance and brokerage activities.    ﻿
 Violations of laws and regulations, or other unsafe and unsound practices, may result in regulatory agencies imposing fines or penalties, cease and desist orders, or taking other enforcement actions. Under certain circumstances, these agencies may enforce these remedies directly against officers, directors, employees and other parties participating in the affairs of a bank or bank holding company. Under federal and state laws and regulations pertaining to the safety and soundness of insured depository institutions, federal and state banking regulators have the authority to compel or restrict certain actions on our part if they determine that we have insufficient capital or other resources, or are otherwise operating in a manner that may be deemed to be inconsistent with safe and 

     
9

 
     sound banking practices. Under this authority, our bank regulators can require us or our subsidiaries to enter into informal or formal supervisory agreements, including board resolutions, memoranda of understanding, written agreements and consent or cease and desist orders, pursuant to which we would be required to take identified corrective actions to address cited concerns and to refrain from taking certain actions.
 ﻿
 If we become subject to and are unable to comply with the terms of any future regulatory actions or directives, supervisory agreements, or orders, then we could become subject to additional, heightened supervisory actions and orders, possibly including consent orders, prompt corrective action restrictions and/or other regulatory actions, including prohibitions on the payment of dividends on our common stock and preferred stock. If our regulators were to take such additional supervisory actions, then we could, among other things, become subject to significant restrictions on our ability to develop any new business, as well as restrictions on our existing business, and we could be required to raise additional capital, dispose of certain assets and liabilities within a prescribed period of time, or both. The terms of any such supervisory action could have a material negative effect on our business, reputation, operating flexibility, financial condition, and the value of our common stock and preferred stock.
 ﻿
 Activity Limitations.  The Company is registered with the Federal Reserve as a bank holding company and has elected to be treated as a financial holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act. Bank holding companies generally are limited to the business of banking, managing or controlling banks, and other activities that the Federal Reserve determines to be closely related to banking, or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. Bank holding companies are prohibited from acquiring or obtaining control of more than five percent (5%) of the outstanding voting interests of any company that engages in activities other than those activities permissible for bank holding companies. Examples of activities that the Federal Reserve has determined to be permissible are making, acquiring, brokering, or servicing loans; leasing personal property; providing certain investment or financial advice; performing certain data processing services; acting as agent or broker in selling credit life insurance and other insurance products in certain locations; and performing certain insurance underwriting activities. The Bank Holding Company Act does not place geographic limits on permissible non-banking activities of bank holding companies. Even with respect to permissible activities, however, the Federal Reserve has the power to order a holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any activity or its control of any subsidiary when the Federal Reserve has reasonable cause to believe that continuation of such activity or control of such subsidiary would pose a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of any bank subsidiary of that holding company. 
 ﻿
 As a financial holding company, we are permitted to engage directly or indirectly in a broader range of activities than those permitted for a bank holding company. Financial holding companies may also engage in activities that are considered to be financial in nature, as well as those incidental or complementary to financial activities.  We and the Bank must each remain “well-capitalized” and “well-managed” and the Bank must receive a Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”) rating of at least “Satisfactory” at its most recent examination in order for us to maintain our status as a financial holding company. If the Company or the Bank ceases to be “well capitalized” or “well managed” under applicable regulatory standards, or if the Bank receives a rating of less than satisfactory under the CRA, the Federal Reserve Board may, among other things, place limitations on our ability to conduct these broader financial activities or, if the deficiencies persist, require us to divest the banking subsidiary or the businesses engaged in activities permissible only for financial holding companies. 
 ﻿
 In addition, the Federal Reserve has the power to order a bank holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any nonbanking activity or terminate its ownership or control of any nonbank subsidiary, when it has reasonable cause to believe that continuation of such activity or such ownership or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness, or stability of any bank subsidiary of that bank holding company.  As further described below, each of the Company and the Bank is well-capitalized as of December 31, 2018, and the Bank has a rating of “Satisfactory” in its most recent CRA evaluation.
 Source of Strength Obligations.  A bank holding company is required to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary bank and to maintain resources adequate to support its bank. The term “source of financial strength” means the ability of a company, such as us, that directly or indirectly owns or controls an insured depository institution, such as the Bank, to provide financial assistance to such insured depository institution in the event of financial distress.  The appropriate federal banking agency for the depository institution (in the case of the Bank, this agency is the FDIC) may require reports from us to assess our ability to serve as a source of strength and to enforce compliance with the source of strength requirements by requiring us to provide financial assistance to the Bank in the event of financial distress.  If we were to enter bankruptcy or become subject to the orderly liquidation process established by the Dodd-Frank Act, any commitment by us to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of the Bank would be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee or the FDIC, as appropriate, and entitled to a priority of payment. In addition, the FDIC provides that any insured depository institution generally will be liable for any loss incurred by the FDIC in connection with the default of, or any assistance provided by the FDIC to, a commonly controlled insured depository institution. The Bank is an FDIC-insured depository institution and thus subject to these requirements.
 ﻿
 Acquisitions. The Bank Holding Company Act requires every bank holding company to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve or waiver of such prior approval before it (1) acquires ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank if, after such acquisition, such bank holding company will own or control more than five percent (5%) of the voting shares of such bank, (2) acquires all of the assets of a bank, or (3) merges with any other bank holding company. In reviewing a proposed covered 

     
10

 
     acquisition, among other factors, the Federal Reserve considers (1) the financial and managerial resources of the companies involved, including pro forma capital ratios; (2) the risk to the stability of the United States banking or financial system; (3) the convenience and needs of the communities to be served, including performance under the CRA; and (4) the effectiveness of the companies in combatting money laundering. The Federal Reserve also reviews any indebtedness to be incurred by a bank holding company in connection with a proposed acquisition to ensure that the bank holding company can service such indebtedness without adversely affecting its ability to serve as a source of strength to its bank subsidiaries.  Well capitalized and well managed bank holding companies are permitted to acquire control of banks in any state, subject to federal regulatory approval, without regard to whether such a transaction is prohibited by the laws of any state. However, a bank holding company may not, following an interstate acquisition, control more than 10% of nationwide insured deposits or 30% of deposits within any state in which the acquiring bank operates. States have the right to lower the 30% limit, although no states within the Company’s current market area have done so.  Federal banking regulators are also required to take into account compliance with the CRA in evaluating any proposal for interstate bank acquisitions.
 ﻿
 Change in Control. Federal law restricts the amount of voting stock of a bank holding company or a bank that a person may acquire without the prior approval of banking regulators. Under the federal Change in Bank Control Act and the regulations thereunder, a person or group must give advance notice to and obtain approval from the Federal Reserve before acquiring control of any bank holding company, such as the Company. The Change in Bank Control Act creates a rebuttable presumption of control if a member or group acquires a certain percentage or more of a bank holding company’s voting stock, or if one or more other control factors are present. As a result, a person or entity generally must provide prior notice to the Federal Reserve before acquiring the power to vote 10% or more of our outstanding common stock.  The overall effect of such laws is to make it more difficult to acquire a bank holding company by tender offer or similar means than it might be to acquire control of another type of corporation. Consequently, shareholders of the Company may be less likely to benefit from the rapid increases in stock prices that may result from tender offers or similar efforts to acquire control of other companies. Investors should be aware of these requirements when acquiring shares of our stock.

 Anti-tying rules. A bank holding company and its subsidiaries are prohibited from engaging in certain tying arrangements in connection with extensions of credit, leases or sales of property, or furnishing of services. 
 ﻿
 Volcker Rule. The Volcker Rule generally prohibits us and our subsidiaries from (i) engaging in proprietary trading for our own account, and (ii) acquiring or retaining an ownership interest in or sponsoring a “covered fund,” all subject to certain exceptions. The Volcker Rule also specifies certain limited activities in which we and our subsidiaries may continue to engage, and required us to implement a compliance program. On June 5, 2018, the federal banking agencies issued proposed changes to the Volcker Rule, along with a request for public comment.  The proposed changes are intended to simplify compliance with the Rule’s “proprietary trading” restrictions.    ﻿
 Capital Requirements 
 ﻿
 We are required under federal law to maintain certain minimum capital levels based on ratios of capital to total assets and capital to risk-weighted assets. The required capital ratios are minimums, and the federal banking agencies may determine that a banking organization, based on its size, complexity or risk profile, must maintain a higher level of capital in order to operate in a safe and sound manner. Risks such as concentration of credit risks and the risk arising from non-traditional activities, as well as the institution’s exposure to a decline in the economic value of its capital due to changes in interest rates, and an institution’s ability to manage those risks are important factors that are to be taken into account by the federal banking agencies in assessing an institution’s overall capital adequacy. The following is a brief description of the relevant provisions of these capital rules and their potential impact on our capital levels.
 ﻿
 The Company and the Bank are subject to the following risk-based capital ratios: a common equity Tier 1 ("CET1") risk-based capital ratio, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, which includes CET1 and additional Tier 1 capital, and a total capital ratio, which includes Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital.  CET1 is primarily comprised of the sum of common stock instruments and related surplus net of treasury stock, retained earnings, and certain qualifying minority interests, less certain adjustments and deductions, including with respect to goodwill, intangible assets, mortgage servicing assets and deferred tax assets subject to temporary timing differences. Additional Tier 1 capital is primarily comprised of noncumulative perpetual preferred stock, tier 1 minority interests and grandfathered trust preferred securities. Tier 2 capital consists of instruments disqualified from Tier 1 capital, including qualifying subordinated debt, other preferred stock and certain hybrid capital instruments, and a limited amount of loan loss reserves up to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets, subject to certain eligibility criteria. The capital rules also define the risk-weights assigned to assets and off-balance sheet items to determine the risk-weighted asset components of the risk-based capital rules, including, for example, certain “high volatility” commercial real estate, past due assets, structured securities and equity holdings. 
 ﻿


     
11

 
     The leverage capital ratio, which serves as a minimum capital standard, is the ratio of Tier 1 capital to quarterly average assets net of goodwill, certain other intangible assets, and certain required deduction items. The required minimum leverage ratio for all banks and bank holding companies is 4%.
 In addition, the capital rules require a capital conservation buffer of up to 2.5% above each of the minimum capital ratio requirements (CET1, Tier 1, and total risk-based capital), which is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress.  These buffer requirements must be met for a bank or bank holding company to be able to pay dividends, engage in share buybacks or make discretionary bonus payments to executive management without restriction. This capital conservation buffer is being phased in, and was 1.875% as of January 1, 2018 and is 2.5% effective January 1, 2019.  
 ﻿
 Failure to be well-capitalized or to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have an adverse material effect on our operations or financial condition. For example, only a well-capitalized depository institution may accept brokered deposits without prior regulatory approval. Failure to be well-capitalized or to meet minimum capital requirements could also result in restrictions on the Company’s or the Bank’s ability to pay dividends or otherwise distribute capital or to receive regulatory approval of applications or other restrictions on its growth. 
 ﻿
 The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (“FDICIA”), among other things, requires the federal bank regulatory agencies to take “prompt corrective action” regarding depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. FDICIA establishes five regulatory capital tiers: “well capitalized”, “adequately capitalized”, “undercapitalized”, “significantly undercapitalized”, and “critically undercapitalized”. A depository institution’s capital tier will depend upon how its capital levels compare to various relevant capital measures and certain other factors, as established by regulation. FDICIA generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution (including payment of a dividend) or paying any management fee to its holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized. The FDICIA imposes progressively more restrictive restraints on operations, management and capital distributions, depending on the category in which an institution is classified.  Undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to restrictions on borrowing from the Federal Reserve System. In addition, undercapitalized depository institutions may not accept brokered deposits absent a waiver from the FDIC, are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit capital restoration plans for regulatory approval. A depository institution's holding company must guarantee any required capital restoration plan, up to an amount equal to the lesser of 5 percent of the depository institution's assets at the time it becomes undercapitalized or the amount of the capital deficiency when the institution fails to comply with the plan.  Federal banking agencies may not accept a capital plan without determining, among other things, that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institution's capital. If a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized. All of the federal bank regulatory agencies have adopted regulations establishing relevant capital measures and relevant capital levels for federally insured depository institutions. The Bank was well capitalized at December 31, 2018, and brokered deposits are not restricted.
 ﻿
 To be well-capitalized, the Bank must maintain at least the following capital ratios:
 ﻿

· | 6.5% CET1 to risk-weighted assets;
--+-----------------------------------


· | 8.0% Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets;
--+---------------------------------------------


· | 10.0% Total capital to risk-weighted assets; and
--+-------------------------------------------------


· | 5.0% leverage ratio.
--+---------------------

  ﻿
 The Federal Reserve has not yet revised the well-capitalized standard for bank holding companies to reflect the higher capital requirements imposed under the current capital rules. For purposes of the Federal Reserve’s Regulation Y, including determining whether a bank holding company meets the requirements to be a financial holding company, bank holding companies, such as the Company, must maintain a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater and a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater to be well-capitalized. If the Federal Reserve were to apply the same or a very similar well-capitalized standard to bank holding companies as that applicable to the Bank, the Company’s capital ratios as of December 31, 2018 would exceed such revised well-capitalized standard. Also, the Federal Reserve may require bank holding companies, including the Company, to maintain capital ratios substantially in excess of mandated minimum levels, depending upon general economic conditions and a bank holding company’s particular condition, risk profile and growth plans.    ﻿
 The Company’s and the Bank’s regulatory capital ratios were above the applicable well-capitalized standards and met the then-applicable capital conservation buffer.   Based on current estimates, we believe that the Company and the Bank will continue to exceed all applicable well-capitalized regulatory capital requirements and the capital conservation buffer.  Risk-based capital ratios and the leverage capital ratio and at December 31, 2018, under currently applicable capital adequacy rules for the Company and the Bank were as follows:      ﻿

 *Applies to Bank 
 In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13, commonly referred to as CECL, to replace the current “incurred loss” methodology for financial assets measured at amortized cost, and change the approach for recognizing and recording credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities and purchased credit impaired financial assets. Under the incurred loss methodology, credit losses are recognized only when the losses are probable or have been incurred; under CECL, companies are required to recognize the full amount of expected credit losses for the lifetime of the financial assets, based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. This change will result in earlier recognition of credit losses that the Company deems expected but not yet probable. For SEC reporting companies with December 31 fiscal-year ends, such as the Company, CECL will become effective beginning with the first quarter of 2020. On December 21, 2018, the federal banking agencies issued a joint final rule to revise their regulatory capital rules to (i) address the upcoming implementation of CECL under GAAP; (ii) provide an optional three-year phase-in period for the day-one adverse regulatory capital effects that banking organizations are expected to experience upon adopting CECL; and (iii) require the use of CECL in stress tests beginning with the 2020 capital planning and stress testing cycle for certain banking organizations. 
 ﻿
 Payment of Dividends
 ﻿
 Hancock Whitney Corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from Hancock Whitney Bank and other subsidiaries.  Its primary source of cash, other than securities offerings, is dividends from the Bank. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, no dividends may be paid by an insured bank if the bank is in arrears in the payment of any insurance assessment due to the FDIC.  The payment of dividends by the Bank may also be affected by other regulatory requirements and policies, such as the maintenance of adequate capital. If, in the opinion of the applicable regulatory authority, a bank under its jurisdiction is engaged in, or is about to engage in, an unsafe or unsound practice (which, depending on the financial condition of the bank, could include the payment of dividends), such authority may require, after notice and hearing, that such bank cease and desist from such practice. The FDIC has formal and informal policies which provide that insured banks should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings.
 ﻿
 Under a Federal Reserve policy adopted in 2009, the board of directors of a bank holding company must consider certain factors to ensure that its dividend level is prudent relative to maintaining a strong financial position, and is not based on overly optimistic earnings scenarios, such as potential events that could affect its ability to pay, while still maintaining a strong financial position. As a general matter, the Federal Reserve has indicated that the board of directors of a bank holding company should consult with the Federal Reserve and eliminate, defer or significantly reduce the bank holding company’s dividends if: 
 ﻿

· | its net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | its prospective rate of earnings retention is not consistent with its capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition; or
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | it will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿
 Stress Testing 
 ﻿
 The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) introduced enhanced regulatory oversight by requiring annual, company-run stress tests of bank holding companies and banks, such as the Company and the Bank, that have more than $10 billion but less than $50 billion of consolidated assets.  These stress tests analyzed the potential impact of baseline, adverse, and severely adverse economic scenarios specified by the Federal Reserve for the Company and by the FDIC for the Bank.  The impact of these scenarios were measured against the consolidated earnings, balance sheet and capital of a bank holding company or depository institution over a designated planning horizon of nine quarters, taking into account the organization’s current condition, risks, exposures, strategies, and activities, and such factors as the regulators may request of a specific organization.   


     
13

 
     The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (the “Economic Growth Act”) signed into law in May 2018 scaled back certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act and provided other regulatory relief. Among the provisions of the Economic Growth Act that benefit the Company and Bank are that banking organizations having less than $100 billion in consolidated assets, such as the Company and the Bank, do not have to perform the company-run stress testing previously required by the Dodd-Frank Act. However, we continue to perform stress testing exercises as part of a prudent risk management process.  
 ﻿
 Bank Regulation 
 ﻿
 The operation of the Bank is subject to state and federal statutes applicable to state banks and the regulations of the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”). The operations of the Bank may also be subject to applicable Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) regulation to the extent state banks are granted parity with national banks. Such statutes and regulations relate to, among other things, required reserves, investments, loans, mergers and consolidations, issuances of securities, payments of dividends, establishment of branches, consumer protection and other aspects of the Bank’s operations. Violations of laws and regulations, or other unsafe and unsound practices, may result in these agencies imposing fines or penalties, cease and desist orders, or taking other enforcement actions.  Under certain circumstances, these agencies may enforce these remedies directly against officers, directors, employees and other parties participating in the affairs of a bank or bank holding company.
 ﻿
 Safety and Soundness. The Federal Deposit Insurance Act requires the federal prudential bank regulatory agencies, such as the FDIC, to prescribe, by regulation or guideline, operational and managerial standards for all insured depository institutions relating to: (1) internal controls; (2) information systems and audit systems; (3) loan documentation; (4) credit underwriting; (5) interest rate risk exposure; and (6) asset quality. The agencies also must prescribe standards for asset quality, earnings, and stock valuation, as well as standards for compensation, fees and benefits. The federal banking agencies have adopted regulations and Interagency Guidelines Establishing Standards for Safety and Soundness to implement these required standards. These guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards used to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. Under the regulations, if a regulator determines that a bank fails to meet any standards prescribed by the guidelines, the regulator may require the bank to submit an acceptable plan to achieve compliance, consistent with deadlines for the submission and review of such safety and soundness compliance plans.
 ﻿
 Examinations. The Bank is subject to regulation, reporting, and periodic examinations by the FDIC, the Mississippi Department of Banking and Consumer Finance (the “MDBCF”), and the CFPB. These regulatory authorities routinely examine the Bank’s reserves, loan and investment quality, consumer compliance, management policies, procedures and practices and other aspects of operations. The FDIC has adopted the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council’s (“FFIEC”) rating system and assigns each financial institution a confidential composite rating based on an evaluation and rating of six essential components of an institution’s financial condition and operations, including Capital Adequacy, Asset Quality, Management, Earnings, Liquidity and Sensitivity to Market Risk, as well as the quality of risk management practices.  
 ﻿
 Consumer Protection. The Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB, an independent regulatory authority housed within the Federal Reserve having centralized authority, including examination and enforcement authority, for consumer protection in the banking industry.  The CFPB has rule writing, examination, and enforcement authority with regard to the Bank’s (and the Company’s) compliance with a wide array of consumer financial protection laws, including the Truth in Lending Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the S.A.F.E. Mortgage Licensing Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act (except Sections 615(e) and 628), the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (sections 502 through 509 relating to privacy), among others. The CFPB has broad authority to enforce a prohibition on unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts and practice.  The Bank is subject to direct supervision and examination by the CFPB. The CFPB also may examine our other direct or indirect subsidiaries that offer consumer financial products or services. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act permits states to adopt consumer protection laws and regulations that are stricter than those regulations promulgated by the CFPB, and state attorneys general are permitted to enforce consumer protection rules adopted by the CFPB against certain institutions.
 ﻿
 Branching. The Dodd-Frank Act authorizes national and state banks to establish de novo branches in other states to the same extent a bank chartered in those states would be so permitted. 
 ﻿
 Deposit Insurance Assessments. The Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) of the FDIC insures the deposits of the Bank generally up to a maximum of $250,000 per depositor, per insured bank, for each account ownership category.  The FDIC charges insured depository institutions quarterly premiums to maintain the DIF.  Deposit insurance assessments are based on average total consolidated assets minus its average tangible equity.  For larger institutions, such as the Bank, the FDIC uses a performance score and a loss-severity score to calculate an initial assessment.   In calculating these scores, the FDIC uses a bank’s capital level and supervisory ratings (its “CAMELS ratings”) and certain financial measures to assess the institution’s ability to withstand asset-related stress and funding-related stress.  The FDIC has the ability to make discretionary adjustments to the total score based upon significant risk factors that are not adequately captured in the calculations.
 ﻿


     
14

 
     In March 2016, the FDIC adopted a final rule to increase the reserve ratio for the DIF to 1.35% of total insured deposits.  The rule imposed a surcharge of 4.5 basis points on the excess of the depository institution’s assessment base over $10 billion until the earlier of the quarter that the reserve ratio first reaches or exceeds 1.35% or December 31, 2018.  The DIF ratio rose to 1.36% and the third quarter of 2018 was the last period in which large banks were assessed the quarterly surcharge under this restoration plan. In addition, in 2018 the Bank was subject to quarterly assessments by the FDIC to pay interest on Financing Corporation ("FICO") bonds.
 ﻿
 Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC.  The Bank does not believe that it is taking or is subject to any action, condition or violation that could lead to termination of its deposit insurance.  In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act provides that, in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution, the claims of depositors of the institution, including the claims of the FDIC as subrogee of insured depositors, and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as a receiver, will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution, including those of the parent bank holding company.
 ﻿
 Insider Transactions. In addition to regulating capital, the FDIC has broad authority to prevent the development or continuance of unsafe or unsound banking practices. Pursuant to this authority, the FDIC has adopted regulations that restrict preferential loans and loan amounts to “affiliates” and “insiders” of banks, require banks to keep information on loans to major shareholders and executive officers and bar certain director and officer interlocks between financial institutions. 
 ﻿
 Mergers, Subsidiaries. The FDIC is also authorized to approve mergers, consolidations and assumption of deposit liability transactions between insured banks and between insured banks and uninsured banks or institutions to prevent capital or surplus diminution in such transactions where the resulting, continuing or assumed bank is an insured nonmember state bank. 
 ﻿
 Reserves. Although the Bank is not a member of the Federal Reserve, it is subject to Federal Reserve regulations that require the Bank to maintain reserves against transaction accounts (primarily checking accounts). These reserve requirements are subject to annual adjustment by the Federal Reserve.
 ﻿
 Anti-Money Laundering.  Under the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism (“USA PATRIOT”) Act of 2001, financial institutions are subject to prohibitions against specified financial transactions and account relationships as well as enhanced due diligence and “know your customer” standards in their dealings with foreign financial institutions and foreign customers. The USA PATRIOT Act requires financial institutions to establish anti-money laundering programs with minimum standards that include:
 ﻿

· | a system of internal policies, procedures, and controls to ensure ongoing compliance;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the designation of an individual responsible for coordinating and monitoring compliance;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | an ongoing employee training program;
--+--------------------------------------


· | an independent audit function to test the programs; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------


· | appropriate risk-based procedures for conducting ongoing customer due diligence.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿
 Bank regulators routinely examine institutions for compliance with these anti-money laundering obligations and recently have been active in imposing “cease and desist” and other regulatory orders and money penalty sanctions against institutions found to be in violation of these requirements.  In addition, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network has adopted new regulations that became effective on May 11, 2018, that require, subject to certain exclusions and exemptions, covered financial institutions to identify and verify the identity of beneficial owners of legal entity customers.
 ﻿
 Economic Sanctions. The Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) is responsible for helping to ensure that U.S. entities do not engage in transactions with certain prohibited parties, as defined by various Executive Orders and acts of Congress.  OFAC publishes, and routinely updates, lists of names of persons and organizations suspected of aiding, harboring or engaging in terrorist acts, including the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List.  If we find a name on any transaction, account or wire transfer that is on an OFAC list, we must undertake certain specified activities, which could include blocking or freezing the account or transaction requested, and we must notify the appropriate authorities.
 ﻿

     Concentrations in Lending.  During 2006, the federal bank regulatory agencies released guidance on “Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending” (the “Guidance”) and advised financial institutions of the risks posed by CRE lending concentrations. The Guidance requires that appropriate processes be in place to identify, monitor and control risks associated with real estate lending concentrations. Higher allowances for loan losses and capital levels may also be required. The Guidance is triggered when CRE loan concentrations exceed either:
 ﻿

· | Total reported loans for construction, land development, and other land of 100% or more of a bank’s total risk based capital; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Total reported loans secured by multifamily and nonfarm nonresidential properties and loans for construction, land development, and other land of 300% or more of a bank’s total risk based capital.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿
 The Guidance also applies when a bank has a sharp increase in CRE loans or has significant concentrations of CRE secured by a particular property type. 
 Community Reinvestment Act.  The Bank is subject to the provisions of the CRA, which imposes a continuing and affirmative obligation, consistent with their safe and sound operation, to help meet the credit needs of entire communities where the bank accepts deposits, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. The FDIC’s assessment of the Bank’s CRA record is made available to the public. Further, a less than satisfactory CRA rating will slow, if not preclude, expansion of banking activities and prevent a company from becoming or remaining a financial holding company. Federal CRA regulations require, among other things, that evidence of discrimination against applicants on a prohibited basis, and illegal or abusive lending practices be considered in the CRA evaluation. The Bank has a rating of “Satisfactory” in its most recent CRA evaluation.
 Consumer Regulation. Activities of the Bank are subject to a variety of statutes and regulations designed to protect consumers. These laws and regulations include, among numerous other things, provisions that:

· | limit the interest and other charges collected or contracted for by the Bank, including rules respecting the terms of credit cards and of debit card overdrafts;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | govern the Bank’s disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


· | require the Bank to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether it is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | prohibit the Bank from discriminating on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors when it makes decisions to extend credit;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | govern the manner in which the Bank may collect consumer debts; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


· | prohibit unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices in the provision of consumer financial products and services.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿
 Mortgage Rules. Pursuant to rules adopted by the CFPB, banks that make residential mortgage loans are required to make a good faith determination that a borrower has the ability to repay a mortgage loan prior to extending such credit, require that certain mortgage loans contain escrow payments, obtain new appraisals under certain circumstances, comply with integrated mortgage disclosure rules, and follow specific rules regarding the compensation of loan originators and the servicing of residential mortgage loans. 
 ﻿
 Risk-retention rules. Banks that sponsor the securitization of asset-backed securities are generally required to retain not less than 5% of the credit risk of any loan they securitize, except for residential mortgages that meet certain low-risk standards. 
 ﻿
 Transactions with affiliates. There are various restrictions that limit the ability of the Bank to finance, pay dividends or otherwise supply funds to the Company or other affiliates. In addition, banks are subject to certain restrictions under Section 23A and B of the Federal Reserve Act on certain transactions, including any extension of credit to its bank holding company or any of its other affiliates, on investments in the securities thereof, and on the taking of such securities as collateral for loans to any borrower. 
 ﻿
 Privacy, Credit Reporting and Cybersecurity. The Bank is subject to federal and state banking regulations that limit its ability to disclose non-public information about consumers to non-affiliated third parties and prescribe standards for the protection of consumer information. These limitations require us to periodically disclose our privacy policies to consumers and allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to a non-affiliated third party under certain circumstances.  Consumers also have the option to direct banks and other financial institutions not to share information about transactions and experiences with affiliated companies for the purpose of marketing products or services.  Banking institutions are required to implement a comprehensive information security program that includes administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information, as well as maintain procedures for notifying customers in the event of a security breach.  These security and privacy policies and procedures for the protection of confidential and personal information are in effect across our lines of business.  The Company has adopted and implemented our Comprehensive Information Security Policy to comply with these federal requirements.  
 ﻿


     
16

 
     The Bank uses credit bureau data in underwriting activities.  Use of such data is regulated under the Fair Credit Reporting Act and Regulation V on a uniform, nationwide basis, including credit reporting, prescreening, and sharing of information between affiliates and the use of credit data.  The Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, which amended the Fair Credit Reporting Act, permits states to enact identity theft laws that are not inconsistent with the conduct required by the provisions of that Act.
 ﻿
 Furthermore, the federal banking regulators regularly issue guidance regarding cybersecurity intended to enhance cyber risk management. A financial institution is expected to implement multiple lines of defense against cyber attacks and ensure that their risk management procedures address the risk posed by potential cyber threats.  A financial institution is further expected to maintain procedures to effectively respond to a cyber attack and resume operations following any such attack.  The Company has adopted and implemented an Information Security Program to comply with the regulatory cybersecurity guidance. 
 ﻿
 Debit Interchange Fees. Interchange fees are fees that merchants pay to credit card companies and card-issuing banks such as the Bank for processing electronic payment transactions on their behalf. The maximum permissible interchange fee that an issuer may receive for an electronic debit transaction is the sum of 21 cents per transaction and 5 basis points multiplied by the value of the transaction, subject to an upward adjustment of 1 cent if an issuer certifies that it has implemented policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve the fraud-prevention standards set forth by the Federal Reserve. In addition, the legislation prohibits card issuers and networks from entering into arrangements requiring that debit card transactions be processed on a single network or only two affiliated networks, and allows merchants to determine transaction routing. 
 ﻿
 Nonbanking Subsidiaries 
 ﻿
 The Company’s nonbanking subsidiaries may also be subject to a variety of state and federal laws. For example, Hancock Whitney Investment Services, Inc. is subject to supervision and regulation by the SEC, Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the State of Mississippi.  
 ﻿
 Compensation
 ﻿
 In June 2010, the federal banking agencies issued joint guidance on executive compensation designed to help ensure that a banking organization’s incentive compensation policies do not encourage imprudent risk taking and are consistent with the safety and soundness of the organization. In addition, in June 2012, the Commission issued final rules to implement the Dodd-Frank Act’s requirement that the Commission direct the national securities exchanges to adopt certain listing standards related to the compensation committee of a company’s board of directors as well as its compensation advisers. 
 ﻿
 In 2016, the Federal Reserve, FDIC and SEC proposed rules that would, depending upon the assets of the institution, directly regulate incentive compensation arrangements and would require enhanced oversight and recordkeeping.  As of December 31, 2018, these rules had not been implemented.  We have undertaken efforts to ensure that our incentive compensation plans do not encourage inappropriate risks, consistent with three key principles—that incentive compensation arrangements should appropriately balance risk and financial rewards, be compatible with effective controls and risk management, and be supported by strong corporate governance.
 ﻿
 Accounting and Controls
 ﻿
 The Company is also required to file certain reports with, and otherwise comply with the rules and regulations of the SEC under federal securities laws.   For example, we are required to comply with various corporate governance and financial reporting requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as rules and regulations adopted by the SEC, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, and Nasdaq.  In particular, we are required to include management and independent registered public accounting firm reports on internal controls over financial reporting as part of our Annual Report on Form 10‑K in order to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.  We have evaluated our controls, including compliance with the SEC rules on internal controls.  The assessments of our financial reporting controls as of December 31, 2018 are included in this report under Item 9A. “Controls and Procedures.”  Our failure to comply with these internal control rules may materially adversely affect our reputation, ability to obtain the necessary certifications to financial statements, and the value of our securities.  
 ﻿
 Corporate Governance
 ﻿
 The Dodd-Frank Act addresses many investor protection, corporate governance, and executive compensation matters that will affect most U.S. publicly traded companies. The Dodd-Frank Act (1) grants shareholders of U.S. publicly traded companies an advisory vote on executive compensation; (2) enhances independence requirements for Compensation Committee members; and (3) requires companies listed on national securities exchanges to adopt incentive-based compensation clawback policies for executive officers.

     Effect of Governmental Monetary and Fiscal Policies 
 ﻿
 The difference between the interest rate paid on deposits and other borrowings and the interest rate received on loans and securities comprises most of a bank’s earnings. In order to mitigate the interest rate risk inherent in the industry, the banking business is becoming increasingly dependent on the generation of fee and service charge revenue. 
 ﻿
 The earnings and growth of a bank will be affected by both general economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policy of the U.S. government and its agencies, particularly the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve sets national monetary policy such as seeking to curb inflation and combat recession. This is accomplished by its open-market operations in U.S. government securities, adjustments in the amount of reserves that financial institutions are required to maintain and adjustments to the discount rates on borrowings and target rates for federal funds transactions. The actions of the Federal Reserve in these areas influence the growth of bank loans, investments and deposits and also affect interest rates on loans and deposits. The nature and timing of any future changes in monetary policies and their potential impact on the Company cannot be predicted.
