ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Our Company
Harbor Custom Development, Inc. is a real estate development company involved in all aspects of the land development cycle, including land acquisition, entitlements, development, construction of project infrastructure, single and multi-family vertical construction, marketing, and sales of various residential projects in Washington, California, Texas, and Florida. 
As a land developer and builder of apartments, single-family luxury homes, and townhomes, our business strategy is to acquire and develop land strategically based on an understanding of population growth patterns, entitlement restrictions and land use evaluation, infrastructure development, and geo-economic forces. We endeavor to acquire land with scenic views or convenient access to freeways and public transportation to develop and sell residential lots, new home communities, townhomes, and multi-story apartment properties within a 20- to 60-minute commute of some of the nation's fastest-growing metro employment corridors.
Our portfolio of land, lots, home plans, and entitled multi-family plats, coupled with low inventory of residential and multi-family housing in our principal geographic areas, provide an opportunity for us to increase revenue and overall market share. In addition to our single-family residential projects, we build and sell townhomes and apartments and have completed or substantially completed construction of several multi-family sites in Washington. (See Item 2. Properties.) 
In an effort to strategically manage the expanding needs of our corporate team, we signed a lease on October 5, 2021, for a new office space in Tacoma, Washington, and moved our headquarters in the second quarter of 2022. This office space is designed with a hybrid workforce in mind and takes into account employment trends that arose after the COVID-19 global pandemic, specifically the increase in hybrid or remote employees. 
For the years ended December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, our total revenues were $55.4 million and $72.4 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, our backlogs of fully executed contracts for the sale of developed residential lots and single-family homes were $8.4 million and $13.7 million, respectively. Our fee build backlogs as of December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, were $0.8 million and $10.0 million, respectively. 
It is customary for us to sign purchase and sale agreements containing a due diligence period which allows us time, usually between 60 and 120 days, to evaluate the acquisition. However, in many cases, the closing will not occur until the entitlement and permitting processes are complete which can further extend the due diligence period. At times, through our due diligence efforts, we find the property is not suitable for purchase due to economic forces, zoning issues, or other matters. If we determine that a property is not suitable for our desired purposes, we terminate the purchase and sale agreement. After termination within the due diligence period, our earnest money is returned to us.
We are a general contractor and construct single-family homes, townhomes, and apartments utilizing a base of employees in conjunction with third-party subcontractors. 
As of March 28, 2023, we own or control 23 communities in Washington, Texas, California, and Florida, containing approximately 2,700 lots in various stages of development.
Entitled Land, Developed Lot, and Home Sales
In 2022, we had two entitled land sales and sold 33 developed lots and 27 homes. The two entitled land sales represented 14% of total revenue in 2022. The 33 developed lot sales represented 17% of total revenue in 2022. Our 2022 home sales represented 52% of total revenue, and home selling prices ranged from $0.7 million to $1.7 million. 
In 2021, we had three entitled land sales and sold 157 developed lots and 30 homes. The three entitled land sales represented 29% of total revenue in 2021. The 157 developed lot sales represented 37% of total revenue in 2021. Our 2021 home sales represented 24% of total revenue and home selling prices ranged from $0.5 million to $0.8 million. 
Strategy
Our strategy is driven by the following:
Offer Diversified Product Portfolio from Single to Multi-family Communities
Our expertise allows for a diversified product strategy that enables us to better serve a wide range of buyers, adapt quickly to changing market conditions, and optimize performance and returns while strategically reducing portfolio risk. We are equipped to build to the surrounding communities' needs, including single-family homes, townhomes, and apartments. This flexible business model allows us to target a wide and diverse range of customers, from those looking at lower-income housing options through apartments to those seeking entry-level through luxury single-family homes. 
Provide Superior Quality and an Excellent Homeowner Experience
Our operating philosophy is to provide our homeowners a positive and memorable experience. We seek to maximize customer satisfaction by offering beautiful homes built with quality materials and exceptional craftsmanship, thoughtfully designed floor plans, and located within a 20- to 60-minute commute from major metropolitan areas. We engineer our homes for energy-efficiency, which reduces the homeowner’s environmental impact and energy costs. Our competitive edge in the selling process focuses on the home’s features, design, and premium locations with scenic views. Our goal is to not just build houses, but to create desirable communities through superior design, location, and execution. 
New homebuyers’ needs are met across multiple communities and price points by maintaining a substantial inventory of ready-to-build lots and designer home plans. From move-up buyers needing more space for their growing families or $1.5 million-plus luxury homes, our business model enables buyers to overcome inventory shortages and pricing challenges in high-growth metropolitan markets.
Provide Diverse Products for Multi-family Living with Superior Quality
The significant appreciation in rental rates over the past year, combined with relatively low inventory of rental housings in our target markets, have created a substantial opportunity to expand shareholder value utilizing the multi-family vertical space. In light of this opportunity, we began a strategic transition of our inventory into multi-family housing in 2021 with the understanding the active U.S. housing market over the past few years would eventually slow down. As the first three of our multi-family properties are now at or near substantial completion, we believe we are adequately poised to realize the benefits of this strategic transition. 
Our product-agnostic building model provides us the flexibility to accommodate the current rapidly changing market conditions and related risks. We are equipped to build to the surrounding communities’ needs, from, move-up and luxury homebuyers, or renters looking for an apartment to institutional investors searching for large tracts of entitled land, developed lots, or multi-family apartment projects. This flexible business model provides a competitive advantage and differentiates us from our peers.
Our inventory of entitled multi-family communities located 20-to-60 minutes from major metropolitan employment corridors, coupled with a low inventory of rental, move-up and luxury residential housing in our principal geographic areas, currently provide an opportunity to increase revenue and overall market share.
Focus on Efficient Operations
We strive to control costs through a disciplined planning process. Detailed budgets are prepared for all cost categories. Budgets are closely monitored throughout the building process as we continue to revisit and update the budget on an ongoing basis. Many components are provided by subcontractors and significant effort is expended to assure that scopes of work are complete and inclusive. Contract variances and change orders are closely scrutinized for appropriateness. At the sale and closing of each home in a project, the estimated and final margins are compared, and variances are identified and investigated to better control costs on future homes in the project. We believe our disciplined process of setting realistic budgets and expectations, monitoring, and evaluating them and making any necessary adjustments to correct deviations going forward enables us to prudently control our costs.
Strategic Partnerships/Cost Control
Our business model is flexible and facilitates partnering with companies that specialize in their local markets, including residential builders, general contractors, and land developers. By partnering with these specialists, our cost structure can be closely managed. Further, all internal shared services are centralized at our corporate office in Washington. Centralized functions include accounting, finance, operations, legal, human resources, information technology, transaction coordination, and permitting. Centralizing these essential functions keeps our infrastructure costs under tight control.
Our Markets
Our business strategy is focused on the acquisition of land for development purposes and the design, construction, and sale of residential lots, single-family homes, townhomes, and apartments in Washington, California, Florida, and Texas.
Our Products
We offer a diverse portfolio of finished lots, single-family homes and multi-family communities, including townhomes, and apartments. Being product-agnostic provides us great flexibility to maintain appropriate consumer product and price level diversification for our specific markets. We focus on underserved consumer groups for each of our locations while attempting to diversify as to not overly concentrate our land portfolio in any one area. Building at multiple price points enables us to quickly adjust to changing consumer and market demands. Buyer profiles are developed for each market, and our communities are designed with the specific needs of those buyers in mind.
Land Acquisition and Development Process
We execute an integrated business model to monetize land during three distinct stages of the development cycle. As a result, risks may be mitigated by providing multiple exit points for our real estate assets.
•Sale of Entitled Land – Property sold following the controlling jurisdiction’s approval of a permitted residential use or other use, as applicable.
•Sale of Developed Lots - Property sold after infrastructure is completed, including roads, sidewalks, and utilities.
•Sale of Completed Building Product – Property sold following the construction of a single-family home, townhome, or apartment.
We also provide services as fee build revenues to construct the required infrastructure so that houses can be developed on the lots.
Our acquisition process generally includes the following steps to reduce development and market cycle risk:
•review of the status of entitlements and other governmental processing, including title reviews;
•complete due diligence on the land parcel prior to committing to the acquisition;
•prepare detailed budgets for all cost categories;
•complete environmental reviews and third-party market studies; and
•evaluate economic feasibility within the context of the above strategies.
Before purchasing large land tracts, we often engage outside engineers and consultants to help review the proposed acquisition and assist with community and home design.
Home Building, Marketing, and Sales Process
Our philosophy is to develop beautiful and practical living spaces for the growing communities we serve. Our strategy is to acquire land with scenic views or convenient access to freeways and public transportation to develop and sell residential lots, new home communities, and multi-story apartment properties within a 20- to 60-minute commute of the nation’s fastest-growing metro employment corridors.
Since our founding in 2014, we are dedicated to building quality homes with thoughtful design. Our floorplans support the modern family’s lifestyle by providing flexible spaces, outdoor living, one-story homes, main-floor living with master bedroom suites on the first floor, and luxury finishes to appeal to universal design needs. Our homes are engineered for energy-efficiency to reduce impact on the environment and lower energy costs to our homebuyers.
Our multi-family construction often offers comparable finishes to a new construction home, featuring quartz countertops, stainless steel kitchen appliances, in-unit washer and dryer, and premium flooring. The floorplans are designed to support the communities we serve, including but not limited to, studios, one bedroom with one bath, two bedrooms with two baths, and a loft feature. Many communities offer recreational buildings for tenants to gather with neighbors, and entertain their families.
We utilize strategic partnerships with local real estate brokers and property management companies who specialize in their local markets. These partnerships keep our cost structure low while leveraging local market expertise. We sell our homes, land, and apartments through independent real estate brokers and sales representatives who assist potential buyers by providing them with basic floor plans, price information, development and construction timetables, and property tours. We 
rent our multi-family properties through property management companies who assist potential renters by providing them with floor plans, pricing information, tours of the apartments, and screening and processing applications.
Our marketing objective is to increase leads for potential homebuyers and tenants through strategic and dynamic marketing campaigns, including weekend and offsite signage, streaming and cable TV ads, printed collateral, public relations, and comprehensive digital marketing ads across various social media platforms and Google.
The home building revenues are recognized when home sales are finished, closed, and title and possession are transferred to the buyer. Our sales contracts typically require an earnest money deposit. Buyers are generally required to pay an additional deposit when they select options or upgrades for their homes. The amount of earnest money required varies between markets and communities but typically averages approximately 2.5% of the home’s total purchase price. Most of our sales contracts stipulate when homebuyers cancel their contracts with us, following a specified period of time, we have the right to retain their earnest money and option deposits. Our sales contracts may also include contingencies that permit homebuyers to cancel and receive a partial or full refund of their deposits if they cannot obtain mortgage financing at prevailing or specified interest rates within a specified time period or if they cannot sell an existing home. The length of time between the signing of a sales contract for a home and delivery of the house to the buyer varies depending on customer preferences, permit approval, and construction cycles.
Our multi-family communities are constructed to satisfy market demand for available rental housing, and construction is generally facilitated when financing is secured. We begin renting the units once we have acquired occupancy permits with the intention to sell the project during construction or upon complete build-out of the project and rental stabilization. 
Customer Relations, Quality Control, and Warranty Programs
We pay particular attention to the product design process and carefully consider the quality and choice of materials to reduce building deficiencies. The quality and workmanship of the subcontractors we employ are monitored with regular inspections and evaluations, seeking to ensure all standards are met.
We maintain quality control and customer service staff whose role includes providing a positive experience for each customer throughout the pre-sale, sale, building, closing, and post-closing periods. We also provide post-sale customer support. Our quality and service initiatives include providing purchasers with a comprehensive walk-through of their home or apartment prior to closing.
Warranty Programs
We provide each homeowner with product warranties covering workmanship and materials for one year from the time of closing and warranties covering structural systems for six years from the time of closing in connection with our general liability insurance policy. We believe our warranty program meets or exceeds terms customarily offered in the home building industry. The subcontractors who perform services also provide us with customary warranties on their workmanship.
Materials
When constructing our projects, we use various materials and components. The typical build time for our single-family homes is six to 12 months, and for our multi-family communities is 18 to 24 months, during which time materials are subject to price fluctuations. Such price fluctuations are caused by several factors, including seasonal variations in availability, international trade disputes and resulting tariffs, and increased demand for materials due to the improved market. The current state of the global supply chain and inflation has increased and may continue to increase our costs for certain materials, such as quartz slabs for countertops, finished hardware, lighting fixtures, appliances, and engineered hardwood used in residential flooring.
Our material suppliers are subcontractors that are licensed, bonded, and insured. Each subcontractor provides a bid for the materials and work required and is awarded a contract based on price, reputation, and ability to meet our time frames.
Our material suppliers provide us with credit terms for materials used in the construction of our projects. Credit terms typically range from a 30 to 60-day payment cycle following the delivery or installation of a product or service.
Seasonality
We experience seasonal variations in our quarterly operating results and capital requirements. We typically experience the highest new home order activity in the spring and summer, although this activity also highly depends on the number of 
active selling communities, the timing of new community openings, and other market factors. Since it typically takes six to 12 months to construct a new home, we generally deliver more homes in the second half of the year as spring and summer home orders convert to home deliveries. Because of this seasonality, home starts, construction costs, and related cash outflows have historically been highest in the second and third quarters, and the majority of cash receipts from home deliveries occur during the second half of the year. We expect this seasonal pattern to continue over the long-term, although it may be affected by volatility in the homebuilding industry.
While the leasing side of multi-family communities can experience some seasonality during the winter holiday months, the construction side typically doesn’t show seasonality patterns. The building process typically takes 18 to 24 months, depending on the size of the project, the site development scope, and other project or market factors.
Governmental Regulation and Environmental Matters
We are subject to numerous local, state, federal, and other statutes, ordinances, rules, and regulations concerning zoning, development, building design, construction, and similar matters which impose restrictive zoning and density requirements in order to limit the number of homes that can eventually be built within the boundaries of a particular area. Projects that are not entitled may be subject to periodic delays, changes in use, less intensive development, or elimination of development in certain specific areas due to government regulations. We may also be subject to periodic delays or may be precluded entirely from developing in certain communities due to building moratoriums or “slow-growth” or “no-growth” initiatives that could be implemented in the future. Local and state governments also have broad discretion regarding the imposition of development fees for projects in their jurisdiction. Projects for which we have received land use and development entitlements or approvals may still require a variety of other governmental approvals and permits during the development process and can also be impacted adversely by unforeseen health, safety, and welfare issues, which can further delay these projects or prevent their development.
We are also subject to a variety of local, state, federal, and other statutes, ordinances, rules, and regulations concerning the environment. The particular environmental laws which apply to any given construction site vary according to the site’s location, its environmental conditions, and the present and former uses of the site, as well as adjoining properties. Environmental laws and conditions may result in delays, may cause us to incur substantial compliance and other costs, and can prohibit or severely restrict building activity in environmentally sensitive regions or areas. From time to time, the Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) and similar federal or state agencies review builders’ compliance with environmental laws and may levy fines and penalties for failure to strictly comply with applicable environmental laws or impose additional requirements for future compliance as a result of past failures. Any such actions imposed on us may increase our costs. Environmental regulations can also have an adverse impact on the availability and price of certain raw materials such as lumber.
Under various environmental laws, current or former owners of real estate, as well as certain other categories of parties, may be required to investigate and remediate hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases and may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and remediation costs incurred by such parties in connection with the contamination. In addition, in cases where an endangered species is involved, environmental rules and regulations can result in the elimination of development in identified environmentally sensitive areas. To date, we have not experienced material loss related to an environmental matter.
Competition and Market Factors
We face competition in the homebuilding industry, which is characterized by relatively low barriers to entry. Homebuilders compete for, among other things, homebuying customers, desirable land parcels, financing, raw materials, and skilled labor. Increased competition may prevent us from acquiring attractive land parcels on which to build homes, apartments, townhomes, or deliver finished lots, make such acquisitions more expensive, hinder our market share expansion, or lead to pricing pressures that may adversely impact our margins and revenues. Competitors may independently develop land and construct housing units that are superior or substantially similar to our products and because they are or may be significantly larger, have a longer operating history, and have greater resources or lower cost of capital than us, may be able to compete more effectively in one or more of the markets in which we operate or plan to operate. We also compete with other homebuilders with longer-standing relationships with subcontractors and suppliers in the markets in which we operate or plan to operate.
Human Capital
As of March 28, 2023, we had 41 full-time employees; six of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. 
Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees, advisors, and consultants. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain, and reward personnel through the granting of equity-based compensation awards in order to increase shareholder value and the success of our business by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives.
