ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS.

THE COMPANY
Westwater Resources, Inc., originally incorporated in 1977, is an energy technology company focused on developing battery-grade natural graphite materials after its acquisition of Alabama Graphite in 2018. Alabama Graphite holds mineral rights to explore and potentially mine the Coosa Graphite Deposit. During 2022, AGP, a wholly owned subsidiary of Westwater Resources, continued construction activities related to Phase I of the Kellyton Graphite Plant. In April of 2022, Alabama Graphite completed the initial drilling stage of its exploration program to further investigate the size and extent of graphite mineral concentrations at the Coosa Graphite Deposit. The Coosa Graphite Deposit is located near Rockford Alabama at 32 ° 54’ 30” North and 86 ° 24’ 00” West. 
​
OUR STRATEGY
Our strategy is to increase shareholder value by advancing our battery-grade graphite business. The acquisition of Alabama Graphite in 2018 provides the Company with the opportunity to provide critical raw materials utilized by the growing market for electric automobiles, trucks and buses, consumer electronics, as well as grid-based storage devices. According to Benchmark Intelligence, in 2022, the global battery market demand for both natural and synthetic graphite was estimated at 517,997 tonnes per annum (or tpa) and demand is projected to increase at a compounded annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 17% over the next 10-year period.



Our goal for the graphite business is to develop a battery-graphite manufacturing business in Alabama that produces low-cost, high-quality, and high-margin graphite products for battery manufacturers. In 2020, we began operation of a pilot program, designed both to manufacture battery-grade graphite materials in quantities suitable for potential customer testing and to inform the DFS. Both the pilot program and DFS were completed during the fourth quarter of 2021, and construction activities on Phase I of the Kellyton Graphite Plant began in the fourth quarter of 2021. In response to increasing customer demand and market conditions, the Company has completed an optimization of the original DFS to increase the expected production for Phase I of the Kellyton Graphite Plant. As a result of this optimization, the Company now expects production capacity for Phase I of the Kellyton Graphite Plant of 16,000 mt per year, and expected CSPG production of 7,500 mt per year. The Company now estimates the total costs for Phase I construction to be approximately $271 million compared to the original estimate of $202 million. Further, the Company now expects to begin testing and commissioning of Phase I in late 2023, and first production to occur in the first half of 2024, subject to securing the additional funding to complete construction. Additionally, we expect to complete the Phase I optimization in the second half of 2024 to increase the expected production capacity of Phase I of the Kellyton Graphite Plant. For additional information regarding the Kellyton Graphite Plant see Item 2, Properties.
​
We continue to engage with potential customers across a number of markets including automotive companies and lithium-ion battery manufacturers. Based on the positive feedback we have received to date from our potential customers, we continue to provide new or additional samples utilizing our pilot program. We believe that the Inflation Reduction Act, which sets a minimum domestic content threshold for the percentage of the value of applicable critical minerals contained in the battery of the electric vehicles, is beneficial to the domestic graphite industry and will provide additional benefit to the Company as it continues to engage with potential customers. Since the passing of the Inflation Reduction Act in August 2022, the interest of potential customers has intensified as we move towards domestic production of battery-grade natural graphite materials.

Additionally, we hold mineral rights to 41,965 acres for future mining development. The graphite deposit at the Coosa Graphite Deposit is expected to serve as future feedstock for the Kellyton Graphite Plant and provide in-house quality assurance and quality control (“QA/QC”) for raw-material inputs. Subject to further exploration, its own definitive feasibility study, the availability of financing, and regulatory approvals, the Coosa Graphite Deposit and related mining operation is expected by the end of 2028. The Coosa Graphite Deposit also contains vanadium mineral concentrations, which the Company plans to explore and evaluate the technical feasibility of extracting and processing in the future. 

8



Currently, the Company is not including any potential benefit related to vanadium in its economic models or resource estimates.
Our project pipeline is prioritized with a goal of achieving sustainable battery-grade graphite production over time to take advantage of rising and/or high price environments for battery materials. We may adjust near-term and long-term business priorities in accordance with market conditions.
​
We believe our broad base of mining and processing expertise related to graphite, base and precious metals is one of our key competitive advantages. We also believe that Westwater possesses a unique combination of battery-materials knowledge and extensive project-execution experience, coupled with decades of capital markets expertise which makes our business a powerful presence in the new energy marketplace. We intend to advance the Company’s project towards production, while prudently managing our cash and liquidity position for financial flexibility.

For further information regarding this Technical Report Summary and the Coosa Graphite Deposit, refer to Item 2, Properties, below.

OVERVIEW OF THE BATTERY GRAPHITE INDUSTRY
Graphite is the name given to a common form of the element carbon. Occurring naturally as a mineral in deposits around the world, graphite is used in many industrial applications. These end uses take advantage of graphite’s natural characteristics, which include high lubricity, high resistance to corrosion, the ability to withstand high temperatures while remaining highly stable, and excellent conductivity of heat and electricity.
In recent years, graphite has become an essential component in the production of all types of electrical storage batteries. Graphite’s role will continue to be important as demand for these batteries increases and with the world’s growing electric vehicle and energy-storage needs. Natural battery-ready graphite products are derived from flake graphite that has been transformed through a series of specialty downstream processes into various battery graphite products. These processes include, but are not limited to:

● | Micronization (sizing)
--+-----------------------


● | Purification to battery-grade carbon with graphitic (Cg) content of ≥ 99.95%
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Spheroidization (shaping) and classification (sorting); and
--+------------------------------------------------------------


● | Surface treatment (carbon coating).
--+------------------------------------

Natural flake graphite is increasingly supplanting or supplementing the use of synthetic graphite in battery applications for cost and performance reasons. Through a series of sophisticated and precise processing steps, flake-

9



graphite concentrates are transformed into high-value end products for the battery industry. Coated spherical purified graphite is used as a graphite anode or anode active material in lithium-ion batteries.
The global battery market demand for natural graphite in 2022 was 221,636 tpa (Benchmark, 2022). The greatest share of this market is made up of four battery-market segments that require advanced battery-grade graphite products:

● | Lithium-Ion batteries — these are the most technologically advanced batteries used in everything from mobile phones and hand tools to laptop computers and electric vehicles, particularly because of the rechargeable nature of the batteries. Demand for lithium-ion batteries, related specifically to electric vehicles, accounted for 79% of natural graphite demand in 2022, and is projected to grow to 89% by 2032 (Benchmark, 2022).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Alkaline batteries — these are the most popular consumer batteries in the world, with a global market size of approximately $7.8 billion in 2021 and a projected CAGR of 4.9% from 2022 through 2028 (Fortune Business Insights, 2022).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Lead Acid batteries — these are the workhorse batteries used in automobiles, backup power supplies, and other energy-storage applications where weight is less important than capacity. The global lead acid battery market was estimated at approximately $83.1 billion in 2021 and a projected CAGR of 2.6% from 2022 through 2030 (Global Market Insights, 2022). 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Primary Lithium batteries — these are non-rechargeable, lightweight lithium-based batteries, and are typically used in flashlights, smoke detectors, and other small device applications where long life and lightweight matter most.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Graphite is a critical, non-substitutable constituent in these listed battery segments. According to Benchmark Intelligence, the need for graphite to support the battery market is expected to grow over the next decade. Total graphite demand is expected to reach 2,924,411 tpa in 2032, of which over 1,580,108 tpa are projected to be natural graphite.
Competition between natural and synthetic graphite is expected to continue in lithium-ion batteries with differentiation between the two based on price, performance, and availability. Common precursor materials in the production of synthetic graphite come from either petroleum needle coke, or coal needle coke. However, synthetic graphite and natural graphite blends are becoming popular choices for electric vehicle applications to optimize performance and cost by taking advantage of each graphite attribute, such as cycle life, energy density, and cost. Synthetic graphite consumption by anode manufacturers is expected to grow because of the concentration of the graphite industry in China; however, natural flake graphite demand is forecasted to grow at a higher rate because of natural graphite’s performance and cost efficiencies.
In addition, natural graphite flake and purification costs in China have increased due to environmental factors (hydrofluoric acid handling cost) and China has become one of the major importers of natural graphite flake, relying upon less expensive African sources. China also poses a geopolitical risk, particularly to the EU and U.S. regions.
Overall battery consumption is rising at an accelerated growth rate due to recent and robust developments in electric-automobile markets, personal electronic devices, electrical grid storage, and is an enabling technology for wind and solar power installation. The global shift towards low- and zero-emissions vehicles and power sources is expected to drive increasing demand for graphite-battery materials for the foreseeable future. Recent developments in this sector include:

● | The United Kingdom and France have announced a prohibition on the sale of gasoline- and diesel-powered vehicles by 2030 and 2040, respectively. Electric vehicles using battery storage are currently the only viable technology that can satisfy the demands for new cars required by these nations.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10




● | The states of New York and California have adopted regulations requiring all new vehicles sold in those states to be zero emissions by 2035. The requirements would apply to all new cars, pickup trucks, and SUVs. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Automobile companies are publicly announcing plans to transition to fully electric vehicles within the next 20 years. Many are developing and distributing electric-based technology to replace internal-combustion engines. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Battery manufacturers and major automobile companies have announced plans to develop 14 different battery manufacturing facilities in the United States with more development in the pipeline.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Governments around the world, including the United States, continue to incentivize electric vehicle ownership through subsidies and other incentives.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The installed base of wind and solar power electrical-generating systems is increasing every year. Grid battery storage is increasing system reliability, and as a result of these catalysts, and according to Roskill, the lithium-ion battery market is expected to grow at a CAGR of over 20%.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Currently, the primary source of battery-grade graphite is from China, presenting the global battery industry with significant risks, including supply chain management risks, economic risks, geopolitical risks, and environmental sustainability concerns. Also, critical domestic production is lacking in the United States. A Presidential Executive Order signed on September 30, 2020 includes graphite on a list of minerals critical to the safety and security of the United States. With limited current domestic natural graphite production of any kind, the United States is presently required to source most of its battery graphite from China. On February 24, 2021, the President signed another Executive Order that seeks to promote more resilient supply chains, to revitalize and rebuild domestic manufacturing capacity, and maintain America’s competitive edge in research and development. The 2021 Executive Order tasked the Secretary of Energy, as part of a larger study involving several branches of the United States government, to submit a report identifying risks to the supply chain for high-capacity batteries including those that power electric vehicles. On June 8, 2021, the White House released a response to the findings of this study in support of securing an end-to-end domestic supply chain for advanced batteries, including investment in domestic production and processing of critical minerals. Key recommendations in the June 8, 2021 release include, among other things, providing funding and financial incentives to encourage consumer adoption of electric vehicles, providing financing to support advanced battery production, and investing in the development of next-generation batteries.
On March 31, 2022, President Biden invoked the Defense Production Act to encourage the domestic production of critical materials, including graphite, for advanced batteries for electric vehicles and clean energy storage. On August 16, 2022, President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act (“IRA”). This legislation includes an investment of approximately $370 billion in climate programs. The IRA provides a 10% tax credit for the costs of producing certain critical minerals, including graphite and vanadium. This credit is eligible for direct pay and is also transferable to unrelated taxpayers. In addition, a key provision of the IRA that could indirectly benefit the Company is the Clean Vehicle credit. The IRA eliminates the previous limitation on the number of electric vehicles a manufacturer can sell before the Clean Vehicle credit is phased out or eliminated. Further, the IRA sets a minimum domestic content threshold for the percentage of the value of applicable critical minerals contained in the battery of the electric vehicles. Because Westwater intends to produce battery grade graphite for lithium-ion batteries to be used in electric vehicles in the United States, management believes the domestic content requirement could provide indirect future benefit to the Company.
The State of Alabama and local municipalities have entered into incentive agreements with the Company for the siting of the Company’s proposed graphite processing plant in Coosa County, Alabama. The incentive agreements provide certain tax credits and incentives under the Alabama Jobs Act in connection with the construction of the Kellyton Graphite Plant.
Westwater has developed graphite-purification technology and advanced product-development processes designed to meet the demands of potential customers for battery-grade graphite materials. Westwater is developing methodologies and constructing facilities intended to produce high-purity, battery-grade graphite products at its Kellyton Graphite Plant. These products are designed to serve all major battery sectors. In addition, we believe the processes we 

11



intend to use are environmentally sustainable and permittable in the United States, where a robust regulatory environment complements our core values to reliably deliver safe, well-made products to our customers.
Westwater has and will continue to support the efforts by the relevant United States governmental agencies, the State of Alabama and local municipalities to ensure that they remain aware of the importance of natural battery-grade graphite, its importance to the nation’s security, and how the Kellyton Graphite Plant and the Coosa Graphite Deposit fit into the critical minerals-equation.



COMPETITION
In the production and marketing of graphite, there are a number of producing entities globally, some of which are government controlled and several of which have significant capitalization. Approximately 75% of natural graphite global supply comes from China (Benchmark, 2022).
With respect to sales of graphite, the Company expects to compete primarily based on price. We intend to market graphite directly to users of the product. We are in direct competition with supplies available from various sources worldwide. We compete with multiple graphite exploration, development and production companies.


WESTWATER’S GRAPHITE BUSINESS
Kellyton Graphite Plant
On June 22, 2021, AGP entered into incentive agreements with the State of Alabama and local municipalities for the siting of the Kellyton Graphite Plant near Kellyton, Alabama. The incentive agreements provide certain tax credits and incentives under the Alabama Jobs Act in connection with the construction of the Kellyton Graphite Plant.
On July 23, 2021, AGP executed a land lease with the Lake Martin Area Industrial Development Authority, providing AGP rights to approximately 70 acres to construct and operate the Kellyton Graphite Plant. The lease has a term of 10 years, a nominal lease payment, and transfer of title to AGP at the end of the lease term. Further, the lease provides AGP the option to purchase the land for a nominal amount during the term of the lease. 
On October 13, 2021, AGP completed the purchase of two buildings that total approximately 90,000 sq. ft. to support the development of the Kellyton Graphite Plant.  The build out of one of these building was completed in April of 2022 and is being used for administrative offices and will include a laboratory space as well. The other building is being used for the control room, the maintenance shop, shipping and receiving and as warehousing space. Both buildings are adjacent to the Kellyton Graphite Plant. 
Westwater plans to develop the Kellyton Graphite Plant in two phases (Phases I and II). 
Phase I: Based upon the Company’s optimization plan, after testing and commissioning is completed, the Kellyton Graphite Plant is now expected to have capacity to produce approximately 16,000 mt per year of two products, ULTRA-CSPG™ and SPG Fines. After processing and purification, the plant is expected to have capacity to produce the two products in the following quantities:

● | ULTRA-CSPG™: 7,500 mt per year 
--+--------------------------------


● | SPG Fines:8,500 mt per year
--+----------------------------

​
Phase II: Upon completion of the Phase II expansion, the annual capacity of the Kellyton Graphite Plant is now expected to increase to approximately 86,500 mt of two products in the following quantities:

● | ULTRA-CSPG™: ­­40,500 mt per year 
--+-----------------------------------


● | SPG Fines: 46,000 mt per year
--+------------------------------

12



​
Construction activities for Phase I of the Kellyton Graphite Plant began in the fourth quarter of 2021 and will continue in 2023. The Company expects to begin testing and commissioning of Phase I in late 2023, and first production to occur in the first half of 2024, subject to securing the additional funding to complete construction. Additionally, we expect to complete the Phase I optimization in the second half of 2024 to increase the expected production capacity of Phase I of the Kellyton Graphite Plant. The Company intends to initiate a definitive feasibility study for Phase II upon, or before, the completion of Phase I.
​
Spheroidization, Purification and Post-Processing Activities
The Company will process natural graphite concentrate at the Kellyton Graphite Plant through a combination of sizing, shaping, spheroidization, and classification. Once completed, the purification is expected to be performed using a proprietary purification process that was developed and tested during our pilot program by Dorfner Anzaplan and other engineering consultants. The process uses a combination of technologies including a caustic bake, acid leach and thermal finishing, a process that allows for a smaller and more sustainable environmental footprint than that of a hydrofluoric acid leaching system as used by other graphite processing companies. Once the graphite is purified to a minimum graphite carbon content of 99.95%, we will then coat the SPG to manufacture the advanced graphite products we intend to sell. This unique application process developed by Westwater is the subject of a patent application that has been filed in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.
​
We currently purchase available graphite flake concentration from a qualified supplier to serve as plant feedstock for the Kellyton Graphite Plant while the Coosa Graphite Deposit is being evaluated, permitted, and developed for future mining operations. Development of a mine at the Coosa Graphite Deposit, expected by the end of 2028, is expected to serve as an in-house source of graphite feedstock and will provide in-house QA/QC for raw-material inputs. 
Coosa Graphite Deposit
Westwater acquired Alabama Graphite in 2018 as part of a strategic decision to refocus the Company to supply battery manufacturers with low-cost, high-quality, and high-margin graphite products. As part of that transaction, Westwater became the owner of mineral lease rights over the Coosa Graphite Deposit, located near Rockford, Alabama, 50 miles southeast of Birmingham. For further detail on the Coosa Graphite Deposit refer to Item 2, Properties, below.
Mining Method
The Coosa Graphite Deposit is expected to be mined by conventional small-scale open-pit mining methods.
Concentrate Plant
Mineralized material from the Coosa Graphite Deposit is projected to have an average grade of approximately 3.04% Cg, and is expected to contain impurities consisting of quartz, muscovite, iron oxides and calcite. Most of the impurities are present on the surfaces of the graphite flakes and can be easily removed during a metallurgical process known as flotation. Flotation processing maximizes the removal of these impurities while avoiding degradation of graphite flakes.
Further development work at the Coosa Graphite Deposit is expected to result in the design and construction of a milling and concentration plant.
Products and Business Development
The Company is working to develop products for potential major battery markets. Based on discussions with potential customers, Westwater will focus on the production of ULTRA-CSPG™ and SPG fines during Phase I of the Kellyton Graphite Plant and expects to evaluate the production of additional products in Phase II, subject to market demand and customer interest. 

13



The Company plans to focus on supply for several different battery types, including lithium-ion batteries, lead-acid batteries, alkaline batteries, and primary-lithium batteries. The Company has ongoing discussions with multiple potential customers, including battery manufacturers, and automobile manufacturers, with the goal of executing multi-year supply agreements. To date, the Company has executed Non-Disclosure Agreements with potential customers and has executed five letters of intent across multiple product lines, which are subject to customary conditions and quality and packaging specifications to be included in future definitive agreements. The Company has also entered into an agreement with a Tier 1 battery manufacturer for electric vehicles. Under the agreement, the parties will work together to ensure that the ULTRA-CSPG™ that is expected to be produced at the Kellyton Graphite Processing Plant can be used as a high-performance anode material for the customer’s batteries. Subject to those efforts, the parties expect to negotiate another agreement that will allow for the sale of potentially all graphite anode material from the Kellyton Graphite Processing Plant for those batteries.
Regulation
Graphite extraction and processing is regulated by the federal and state governments. Compliance with such regulations has a material effect on the economics of our operations and the timing of project development. Our primary regulatory costs have been, and are expected to relate to, obtaining licenses and operating permits from federal and state agencies before the commencement of production activities, as well as the cost for continuing compliance with licenses and permits once they have been issued. The current environmental and technical regulatory requirements for the graphite extraction and processing industry are well established. However, the regulatory process can make permitting difficult and timing unpredictable.
U.S. regulations pertaining to graphite extraction and processing may evolve in the U.S. However, at this time we do not anticipate any adverse impact from these regulations that would be unique to our operations.
Kellyton Graphite Plant
For construction and operations of the Kellyton Graphite Plant, the Company is required to obtain permits related to air emissions, water discharge, storm water drainage, and possibly other regulated waste. On January 31, 2022, Westwater announced that it had received its National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (“NPDES”) construction stormwater permit, which was required to commence site grading for the Kellyton Graphite Plant. The NPDES permit has been issued by the State of Alabama under NPDES to ensure Westwater’s construction efforts comply with the Federal Clean Water Act as it relates to regulated disturbances and any stormwater runoff from the Kellyton Graphite Plant site. 
In June 2022 and August 2022, the Company received its air permit and its State Indirect Discharge (“SID”) permit for the treatment of wastewater from the Alabama Department of Environmental Management, respectively.  Consequently, the Company has all necessary permits to complete the construction of Phase I of the Kellyton Graphite Plant.
 ​
Coosa Graphite Deposit
Graphite mining and processing in Alabama requires various permits, including those for any emissions to air, water, or other aspects of the environment. Permits may be required from the State of Alabama, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the Army Corps of Engineers, and other state and federal agencies. Specifically, to mine the Coosa Graphite Deposit, permits may be required in accordance with the Alabama Surface Mining Act of 1969, which is administered by the Alabama Department of Labor (“DoL”). DoL issues mining permits, ensures that mine sites are properly bonded for reclamation purposes, and makes periodic inspections. The Company is currently in the process of determining the requirements for posting surety or negotiable bonds related to the area to be disturbed. Future mining operations at the Coosa Graphite Deposit may be subject to the U.S. National Environmental Policy Act process, with potential review by various federal agencies that may include the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the Army Corp of Engineers, and others.
In Alabama, any surface or groundwater withdrawals are managed through the Alabama Water Use Reporting Program. The Alabama Water Resources Act and associated regulations establish the requirements for water withdrawals. 

14



The process begins with the submission of an application form called a “Declaration of Beneficial Use” and other required information to the Office of Water Resources (“OWR”) within the Alabama Department of Economic and Community Affairs. Once application information is reviewed and determined to be complete, OWR will issue a Certificate of Use (“COU”) that lists the applicant’s name and information concerning all registered surface and/or groundwater withdrawal points and their withdrawal information. Entities with a capacity to withdraw more than 100,000 gallons per day are required to register with OWR and obtain a COU. The COU certifies that proposed water use will not interfere with existing water use and is beneficial. The Company anticipates evaluating the future need for a COU during its development of a detailed mine plan.

Greenhouse gas emissions: Estimates are being quantified and are expected to be finalized through detailed design work. During the testing and commissioning of Phase I of the Kellyton Graphite Plant, Westwater expects to commence monitoring, measuring, and to begin continuous improvement efforts related to its greenhouse gas emissions. 
Air quality: Estimates are being quantified and are expected to be finalized in 2023. 

15



Energy consumption: Estimates are being quantified and are expected to be finalized in 2023.
Wastewater management: We expect that the Kellyton Graphite Plant will not have surface water connections to waters of the United States, nor are there any such jurisdictional waters of the United States at the Kellyton Graphite Plant.  In August 2022, the Company received its SID permit for the treatment of wastewater from the Alabama Department of Environmental Management.  Under the SID, the Company provides an agreed upon wastewater profile to be processed by the local wastewater treatment plant. The Company plans to pretreat the wastewater from the Kellyton Graphite Plant through recycling, neutralizing and filtering to ensure it meets the requirements under the SID.
Social Criteria and Actions
As part of our Kellyton Graphite Plant design and analysis we are evaluating community needs, with input from the local stakeholders, and our ability to support them – whether in education, infrastructure, or in other ways applicable to community needs. Through the Alabama Industrial Training (“AIDT”) program, the Company is eligible to receive a cash reimbursement for the design of a customized plan for the recruitment, screening, and training new employees. In addition to the cash reimbursement for training, AIDT offers in-kind services, which includes items such as assistance with a pre-employment selection system, maintenance assessments, safety assistance and training, and robotic and programable logic controller automation training. 
During 2022, Westwater held “townhall” meetings with the local community in Coosa County, Alabama, to maintain open and transparent communication as well as to hear and work to address any concerns of the community. In April, the Company held a groundbreaking ceremony that was attended by state and local government officials and business leaders. In addition, the Company participated in a community service project, in July, to help with general cleanup of a local school.  The Company also hosted a first responders luncheon in October that included a tour of the Kellyton Graphite Plant for over 100 first responders and local officials to show appreciation to those helping within the local community. 
Westwater has a strong history in social license. The Company spent eight years providing scholarships to family members of the Cebolleta and Juan Tafoya Land Grants in New Mexico, where we previously had operations. We have supported this scholarship effort over the years to ensure that young people are afforded an opportunity to attend colleges and universities. As a result of this work, students in Veterinary Medicine, Mining Engineering, Nursing, Pharmacology, Criminal Justice and Business Management have been able to further their education.

Governance Criteria and Factors
​
Board of Directors
The Company’s business and affairs are overseen by the Board pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law and the Company’s charter documents. Members of the Board are kept informed of the Company’s business through discussions with the President and Chief Executive Officer and key members of management, by reviewing materials provided to them and by participating in Board and Committee meetings. All members of the Board are elected annually by the stockholders.
Regular attendance at Board meetings and the Annual Meeting of Stockholders is expected of each director. Our Board held 10 meetings during 2022. All directors attended all meetings of the Board and applicable Committees held during the period that such director served in 2022. The independent directors met in executive session at several of the Board meetings held in 2022. All of the directors in office at the time attended the 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.

Board Leadership Structure
The Company’s governing documents allow the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer to be filled by the same or different individuals. This approach allows the Board flexibility to determine whether the two roles should be separate or combined based upon the Company’s needs and the Board’s assessment of the Company’s leadership from time to time. Currently, Terence J. Cryan serves as Executive Chairman and Frank Bakker serves as Chief Executive Officer. 
Safety and Sustainability Committee (previously the Health, Safety, and Environmental Committee)
We have a Safety and Sustainability Committee that reports directly to the entire Board of Directors of Westwater. The Safety and Sustainability Committee held two meetings in 2022. The Committee’s charter reads, in part:
The Committee’s primary purposes are to:

● | provide advice, counsel and recommendations to management on:
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


o | health, safety, loss prevention issues and operational security, and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


o | issues relating to sustainable development, environmental management and affairs, community relations, human rights, government relations and communications; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | health, safety, loss prevention issues and operational security ,and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | sustainable development, environmental management affairs, community relations, human rights, government relations and communications issues; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | management of risk related thereto.
--+------------------------------------

The Safety and Sustainability Committee has direct experience in managing ISO 14001 Environmental Management Systems (“EMS”). These systems are designed to provide for reliable performance in sustainable management of businesses. We are committed to the continual improvement of the EMS, according to compliance obligations, by following the principles and requirement of ISO 14001. After the completion of our Phase I DFS, management has designed ISO 14001 based management systems to facilitate and govern our environmental performance. This effort includes the establishment of a preliminary set of metrics for measuring that performance.
Audit Committee
We have a separately-designated Audit Committee composed solely of independent directors. The Audit Committee held four meetings in 2022.
The Audit Committee’s primary responsibilities are to:

● | assist the Board in discharging its responsibilities with respect to the accounting policies, internal controls and financial reporting of the Company;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | monitor compliance with applicable laws and regulations, standards and ethical business conduct, and the systems of internal controls;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | assist the Board in its oversight of the qualifications, independence and performance of the registered public accounting firm engaged to be the independent auditor of the Company; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | prepare the Audit Committee report required to be included in the Company’s proxy statements.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Compensation Committee
The Compensation Committee held three meetings and had several informal discussions in 2022. The Compensation Committee is responsible for assisting the Board in setting the compensation of the Company’s directors and executive officers and administering and implementing the Company’s incentive compensation plans and equity-based plans. 

18



Nominating and Governance Committee
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee held one meeting during 2022, and its duties and responsibilities are to:

● | recommend to the Board director nominees for the annual meeting of stockholders;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | identify and recommend candidates to fill vacancies occurring between annual stockholder meetings; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | oversee all aspects of corporate governance of the Company.
--+------------------------------------------------------------

The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board identifies director candidates based on input provided by a number of sources, including members of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, other directors, our stockholders, members of management and third parties. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee does not distinguish between nominees recommended by our stockholders and those recommended by other parties. Any stockholder recommendation must be sent to the Secretary of Westwater Resources, Inc. at 6950 S. Potomac Street, Suite 300, Centennial, Colorado 80112, and must include detailed background information regarding the suggested candidate that demonstrates how the individual meets the Board membership criteria discussed below. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee also has the authority to consult with or retain advisors or search firms to assist in the identification of qualified director candidates.
As part of the identification process, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee takes into account each candidate’s business and professional skills, experience serving in management or on the board of directors of companies similar to the Company, financial literacy, independence, personal integrity and judgment. In conducting this assessment, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will, in connection with its assessment and recommendation of candidates for director, consider diversity (including, but not limited to, gender, race, ethnicity, age, experience and skills) and such other factors as it deems appropriate given the then-current and anticipated future needs of the Board and the Company, and to maintain a balance of perspectives, qualifications, qualities and skills on the Board. The Board does not have a formal diversity policy for directors. However, the Board is committed to an inclusive membership. Although the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may seek candidates that have different qualities and experiences at different times in order to maximize the aggregate experience, qualities and strengths of the Board members, nominees for each election or appointment of directors will be evaluated using a substantially similar process. Incumbent directors who are being considered for re-nomination are re-evaluated both on their performance as directors and their continued ability to meet the required qualifications.
Board Diversity
Westwater’s Board of Directors is comprised of five directors, three of whom are independent, and currently has diverse gender representation. In 2021, Westwater was acknowledged by, and received an award from, BoardConnect by the Women’s Leadership Foundation for achieving gender balance on its Board of Directors. 
Covid-19
The COVID-19 pandemic has not had a significant impact on Westwater’s business activities. Prior to March 1, 2021, Westwater reduced utilization of its offices and instituted remote working arrangements to ensure that some employees were able to work remotely using systems that already were in place. On March 1, 2021, Westwater reopened its Centennial, Colorado corporate officers and allowed employees to return to the office to work together with appropriate health protocols in place. Westwater’s continued focus on the health and safety of employees, the safety of operations, and the safety of the communities in which our employees live and work remains paramount. To that end, Westwater has continued to restrict unnecessary travel, and ensured that employees are permitted to take time off due to illness or the illness of those around them without penalty.

Item 1, Description of Business. 
A plan and design for Phase II is in place at a pre-feasibility level (“PFS”). The future estimated costs to develop and expected production for each phase of the Kellyton Graphite Plant development is based on Westwater’s completed DFS, as optimized for Phase I, and the PFS for Phase II, also as optimized. The estimated economics for both Phase I and Phase II, assume that graphite concentrate will be purchased from a third-party rather than assuming any potential production from the Coosa Graphite Deposit.
Production Pilot Operations 
The Company completed its pilot program in 2021 and produced approximately 13 metric tonnes of battery-grade graphite products. During the pilot scale program, graphite concentrates were purified and converted into advanced battery-grade graphite products. The majority of the pilot program was performed at contracted laboratories. The purified material was manufactured into our three products, purified micronized graphite, coated spherical purified graphite and delaminated expanded graphite. The results of the pilot program were used to inform the results of the Company’s DFS, and to provide samples to potential customers. The Company continues to operate its pilot program to produce additional product samples for potential customers as needed.
Project Development Plan
Phase I: After testing and commissioning is completed, the Kellyton Graphite Plant is now expected to have production capacity of approximately 7,500 mt of ULTRA-CSPG™ and 8,500 mt of SPG fines, annually. Graphite concentrate feedstock is anticipated to be supplied from outside sources until at least 2028. 
Phase II: Upon completion of Phase II, the Company now expects to have annual production capacity of approximately 40,500 mt of ULTRA-CSPG™ and 46,000 mt of SPG fines. 
COOSA GRAPHITE DEPOSIT
Through its acquisition of Alabama Graphite, Westwater gained lease rights to a graphite exploration project at the Coosa Graphite Deposit. The deposit is situated in east-central Alabama, approximately 50 miles southeast of the city of Birmingham and approximately 30 miles west of Kellyton, Alabama. The Coosa Graphite Deposit is located near Rockford Alabama at 32 ° 54’ 30” North and 86 ° 24’ 00” West and is currently in the exploration stage.
General. The Coosa Graphite Deposit is situated in east-central Alabama, near the western end of Coosa County. The Coosa Graphite Deposit is located near the southwestern-most extent of the Alabama Graphite Belt.
The Property. The Coosa Graphite Deposit is comprised of a lease of privately-owned mineral rights from a single landowner covering an overall area of approximately 41,965 acres (approximately 65.6 square miles). The various property parcels that comprise the lease are contiguous with each other, except for a few small and isolated parcels that are situated in the far south part of the project area. The lease has a series of five-year terms (commencing August 1, 2012) that are not to exceed 70 years in total. Under the terms of the lease Alabama Graphite is required to make annual payments of $10,000 

30



for the original lease in order to maintain its property rights. Alabama Graphite is obligated to pay the owner of the mineral estate a net smelter return royalty of 2.00% for any production and sale of graphite, vanadium and other minerals derived from the leased lands. There is a further obligation to pay a 0.50% net smelter return royalty, not to exceed $150,000, and make payments of $100,000 at the time of completion of a “bankable feasibility study” and an additional $150,000 upon completion of “full permitting” of the leased property. These payments are payable to an unaffiliated third-party. The Company does not hold any surface rights in the project area.
Accessibility. Access to the Coosa Graphite Deposit is good. The general area of the Coosa Graphite Deposit is accessible from local and regional population centers via a network of paved federal, state and county two-lane highways. Various parts of the project lands are traversed by numerous partially maintained dirt and gravel logging roads.
History. The Coosa Graphite Deposit is situated near the southwestern end of the Alabama Graphite Belt, which is a northeast-trending group of graphite deposits and occurrences that are situated in the central and eastern parts of the state. The initial attempt to produce graphite mineralization in the Alabama Graphite Belt commenced in 1888, with efforts focusing upon prospects located to the northeast of the region of the Coosa Graphite Deposit. The first commercial production of graphite from deposits in the Alabama Graphite Belt was in 1899 and limited activities continued at least into the 1940s. Within the lands that comprise the Coosa Graphite Deposit, graphite production was carried out at the Fixico mine, which operated intermittently between 1902 and 1908. Other graphite prospects in the project area were evaluated but no efforts were made to mine any other prospects in the project area. Alabama Graphite acquired property rights that comprise the Coosa Graphite Deposit and carried out trenching and drilling programs and completed an aerial geophysical survey of a portion of the project area between 2012 and 2015.
Project Geology. The Coosa Graphite Deposit is located at the southern-most end of the Appalachian mountain range in east-central Alabama. Within the Appalachian Mountains a group of Precambrian to Paleozoic age metamorphic rocks host scattered graphite deposits, in an area known as the Alabama Graphite Belt. At the Coosa Graphite Deposit, graphite mineralization, sometimes associated with vanadium mineralization, is hosted within the Higgins Ferry Group, which is comprised of coarse to fine-grained biotite-feldspar-quartz gneiss, various quartz-muscovite and quartz-muscovite-graphite schist, quartzite and altered mafic rocks. The rocks of the Higgins Ferry Group are thought to be Precambrian to Paleozoic in age. In the project area, graphite (and vanadium) mineralization is hosted in a series of quartz-muscovite-biotite-graphite and quartz-graphite schists that are generally medium to coarse grained, and are moderately foliated and somewhat contorted. The graphitic schist units are occasionally cut by pegmatites, which are unmineralized with respect to graphite and vanadium. Graphite grades in the quartz-muscovite-biotite-graphite schist are generally one percent graphite or less, while graphite grades in the quartz-graphite schist commonly exceed one percent. The graphitic schists are moderately to strongly weathered to depths that may extend 10s of feet to occasionally more than 100 feet, and can generally be considered to be surface minable.
Project Activities. Prior to its acquisition by Westwater, Alabama Graphite carried out several exploration programs to identify and partially define the potential extent and magnitude of graphite mineralization at the Coosa Graphite Deposit, including core and sonic drilling, trenching and sampling, and an airborne geophysical survey. As a result of this exploration, a near-surface graphite deposit was partially defined in the central portion of the project area. 
Permitting Status. The Company holds an exploration license from the State of Alabama for the Coosa Graphite Deposit, and is currently reviewing and applying for local, State, and federal permits for future development.

Mineral Resources
The TRS was prepared as an Initial Assessment in accordance with S-K 1300 and was filed with the SEC on Form 8-K on December 6, 2022. The TRS was prepared on behalf of the Company by SLR, which qualifies as a Qualified Person (QP) as defined under Item 1302 of Regulation S-K.
The mineral resource estimate for the Coosa Graphite Deposit, based on 205 drill holes totaling 39,434 ft., was completed by SLR with an effective date of November 30, 2022. Based on a 1.98% graphitic carbon (Cg) cut-off grade indicated mineral resources total 26.0 million short tons (Mst) at an average grade of 2.89% Cg for a total of 755,000 short tons (st) Cg. Inferred mineral resources are estimated as 97.0 Mst at an average grade of 3.08% Cg for a total of 3.0 Mst Cg.
The TRS was prepared in accordance with the regulations set forth in S-K 1300 with the objective of disclosing the mineral resources at the Coosa Graphite Deposit. Based on the density of drilling, continuity of geology and mineralization, testing, and data verification, the mineral resource estimates meet the criteria for indicated or inferred mineral resources as summarized in the TRS.

32



Estimated mineral resources are summarized in the following table for indicated and inferred mineral resources, respectively, at a 1.98% Cg.  Mineral resources were estimated separately for each mineralized horizon.  Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. However, considerations of reasonable prospects for economic extraction were applied to the mineral resource calculations within the TRS.

Summary capital and operating cost estimates are not included with the TRS because the Company is reporting the results of an Initial Assessment without economic analysis in accordance with S-K 1300. The technical information has been reviewed by SLR, a QP as defined under Item 1302 of Regulation S-K.
Internal Control
The Company’s internal controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information and processes utilized assessing its indicated and inferred mineral resources are reasonable and reliable estimates aligned with industry best practices and reporting regulations.  Quality assurance (QA) consists of evidence to demonstrate that the assay data has precision and accuracy within generally accepted limits for the sampling and analytical method(s) used in order to have confidence in a resource estimate. Quality control (QC) consists of procedures used to ensure that an adequate level of quality is maintained in the process of collecting, preparing, and assaying the exploration drilling samples. In general, QA/QC programs are designed to prevent or detect contamination and allow assaying (analytical), precision  (repeatability), and accuracy to be quantified. In addition, a QA/QC program can disclose the overall sampling-assaying variability of the sampling method itself.  Our quality assurance and control protocols over sampling and assaying of drill hole samples include insertion of certified reference materials, blanks and duplicates, as well as selective sample validation at secondary laboratories.  As indicated within the TRS, the QP has determined that the Company’s QA/QC programs meet current industry standard practice and the assay results within the database are suitable for use in a Mineral Resource estimate.
​
Management also assesses risks inherent in mineral resource estimates, such as the accuracy of geophysical data that is used to support mine planning, identify hazards and inform operations of the presence of mineable deposits. For further information on risks regarding mining and exploration activity see Item 1A, Risk Factors above.
