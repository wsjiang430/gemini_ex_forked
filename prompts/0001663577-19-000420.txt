On July 1, 2016, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement, as amended (the “Purchase Agreement”), with CleanSpark Holdings LLC, CleanSpark LLC, CleanSpark Technologies LLC and Specialized Energy Solutions, Inc. (together, the “Seller”). Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Company acquired CleanSpark, LLC and all the assets related to the Seller and its line of business and assumed $200,000 in liabilities.
 
In October 2016, the Company changed its name to CleanSpark, Inc. through a short-form merger in order to better reflect the brand identity.
 
On January 22, 2019, CleanSpark entered into an Agreement with Pioneer Critical Power, Inc., whereby it acquired certain intellectual property assets and a customer list. As consideration the Company issued to its sole shareholder (i) 175,000 of the common stock of CleanSpark, (ii) a five-year warrant to purchase 50,000 shares of CleanSpark common stock at an exercise price of $16.00 per share, and (iii) a five-year warrant to purchase 50,000 shares of CleanSpark common stock at an exercise price of $20.00 per share. As a result of the transaction Pioneer Critical Power Inc. became a wholly owned subsidiary of CleanSpark Inc. On February 1, 2019, Pioneer Critical Power, Inc. was renamed to CleanSpark Critical Power Systems, Inc.
 
On December 10, 2019, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) approved the Company’s 1:10 reverse stock split of the Company’s common stock. The reverse stock split took effect on December 11, 2019. Unless otherwise noted, impacted amounts and share information in this annual report and included in the audited financial statements and notes thereto as of and for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, have been adjusted for the stock split as if such stock split occurred on the first day of the first period presented.


Our Business
 
We are in the business of providing advanced energy software and control technology that enables a plug-and-play enterprise solution to modern energy challenges. Our services consist of intelligent energy monitoring and controls, microgrid design and engineering and consulting services. Our software allows energy users to obtain resiliency and economic optimization. Our software is uniquely capable of enabling a microgrid to be scaled to the user's specific needs and can be widely implemented across commercial, industrial, military and municipal deployment.
 
Integral to our business is our mPulse and mVSO software platforms (the “Platforms”). When the Platforms are implemented on a customer’s power system, they are able to control the distributed energy resources on site to provide secure, sustainable energy often at significant cost savings for our energy customers. The Platforms allows customers to efficiently manage renewable energy generation, other distributed energy generation technologies including energy generation assets, energy storage assets, and energy consumption assets. By having autonomous control over the distributed facets of energy usage and energy storage, customers are able to reduce their dependency on utilities, thereby keeping energy costs relatively constant over time. The overall aim is to transform energy consumers into energy producers by supplying power that anticipates their routine instead of interrupting it.
 
We also own patented gasification technologies. Our technology converts any organic material into SynGas. SynGas can be used as clean, renewable, environmentally friendly, warming fuel for power plants, motor vehicles, and as feedstock for the generation of DME (Di-Methyl Ether).
 
As previously disclosed, we plan to continue our focus on the Distributed energy and microgrid side of the business in 2020, as opposed to expending significant efforts on the Gasifier side of the business. We plan to continue our efforts to better our technology, service existing customers and market our System (defined below) to prospective clients. We feel that this focus would provide the best opportunity for our shareholders.

Our Distributed Energy Management Business
 
Integral to our business is our Distributed Energy Management Business (the “DER Business”). The main assets of our DER Business include our propriety software systems (“Systems”) and also our engineering and methodology trade secrets. The Distributed Energy systems and Microgrids that utilize our Systems are capable of providing secure, sustainable energy with significant cost savings for its energy customers. The Systems allows customers to design, engineer, and then efficiently manage renewable energy generation, storage and consumption. By having autonomous control over the multiple facets of energy usage and storage, customers are able to reduce their dependency on utilities, thereby keeping energy costs relatively constant over time. The overall aim is to transform energy consumers into intelligent energy producers by supplying and managing power in a manner that anticipates their routine instead of interrupting it.
 
Around the world, the aging grid is becoming unstable and unreliable due to increases in loads and lack of new large-scale generation facilities. This inherent instability is compounded by the push to integrate a growing number and variety of renewable but intermittent energy generators and advanced technologies into outdated electrical systems. Simultaneously, defense installations, industrial complexes, communities, and campuses across the world are turning to virtual power plants and microgrids as a means to decrease their reliance from the grid, reduce utility costs, utilize cleaner power, and enhance energy security and surety.
 
The convergence of these factors is creating a “perfect storm” in the power supply optimization and energy management arena. Efficiently building and operating the distributed energy management systems and microgrids of tomorrow, while maximizing the use of sustainable energy to produce affordable, stable, predictable, and reliable power on a large scale, is a significant opportunity that first-movers can leverage to capture a large share of this emerging global industry.
 
A microgrid is comprised of any number of generation, energy storage, and smart distribution assets that serve a single or multiple loads, both connected to the utility grid and separate from the utility grid “islanded.” In the past, distributed energy management systems and microgrids have consisted of off-grid generators organized with controls to provide power where utility lines cannot run. Today, modern distributed energy management systems and microgrids integrate renewable energy generation systems (REGS) with advanced energy storage devices and interoperate with the local utility grid. Advanced autonomous cyber-secure microgrids controls relay information between intelligent hardware and localized servers to make decisions in real-time that deliver optimum power where it is needed, when it is needed.
 
Our Systems create an integrated distributed energy management control platform that seamlessly integrates all forms of energy generation with energy storage devices and controls facility loads to provide energy security in real time free of cyber threats. Able to interoperate with the local utility grid, the Systems bring users the ability to choose when to buy or sell power to and from the grid, enabling what we believe is the most cost-effective power solution that exists on the current market.
 
Our Systems are ideal for commercial, industrial, mining, defense, campus and residential users and ranges in size from 4KW to 100MW and beyond and can deliver power at or below the current cost of utility power.
 
Our services consist of distributed energy microgrid system engineering and design, and project consulting services. The work is performed under fixed price bid contracts and negotiated price contracts.
 
mPulse Software Suite
 
mPulse is a modular platform that enables fine-grained control of a Microgrid based on customer operational goals, equipment and forecasts of load and generation. mPulse performs high-frequency calculations, threshold-based alarming, execution of domain-specific business rules, internal and external health monitoring, historical data persistence, and system-to-operator notifications. The modular design increases system flexibility and extensibility. In addition, the deployment of the mPulse system follows a security-conscious posture by deploying hardware-based firewalls as well as encryption across communication channels. mPulse allows configuration for site-specific equipment and operation and provides a clean, informative user interface to allow customers to monitor and analyze the data streams that describe how their microgrid is operating.

-


mPulse supports our innovative fractal approach to microgrid design, which enables multiple microgrids on a single site to interact in a number of different ways, including as peers, in a parent-child relationship, and in parallel or completely disconnected. Each grid can have different operational objectives, and those operational objectives can change over time. Any microgrid can be islanded from the rest of the microgrid as well as the larger utility grid. The mPulse software can control the workflow required in both the islanding steps as well as the reconnecting steps of this maneuver and coordinate connected equipment such that connections are only made when it is safe to do so.
 
Microgrid Value Stream Optimizer (mVSO)
 
The Microgrid Value Stream Optimizer (mVSO) tool provides a robust distributed energy and microgrid system modeling solution. mVSO takes utility rate data and load data for a customer site and helps automate the sizing and analysis of potential microgrid solutions as well as providing a financial analysis around each grid configuration. mVSO uses historical data to generate projected energy generation assets and models how storage responds to varying operational modes and command logics based upon predicted generation and load curves. mVSO analyzes multiple equipment combinations and operational situations to determine the optimal configuration for a site based on the financials, equipment outlay, utility cost savings, etc., to arrive at payback and IRR values. This ultimately provides the user with data to design a distributed energy and/or microgrid system that will meet the customers’ performance benchmarks.
 
Positioning
 
When mPulse originally was developed, a main focus of the platform and the industry was resiliency of microgrid operation, specifically in military contexts. Since that time, the microgrid landscape has continued to evolve, and there is growing opportunity within the commercial and industrial space as the markets in these spaces desire microgrids capable of obtaining the highest economic advantage.
 
Further, this growing focus on economic advantage is in line with the continued market evolution toward an open energy market at regional levels. We want to be well positioned to enter into this market at each step of its availability, from responding to demand response requests all the way through participating in ancillary grid service markets and fully open transactive energy markets as regulation matures. To position ourselves, the mPulse platform implements internal markets at each level of the system. In these internal markets, energy producing assets are modeled as sellers, and energy consuming assets are modeled as buyers, with the market playing matchmaker between the two and virtually “selling” available energy to the highest bidder, thereby satisfying the energy loads at the highest economic advantage for both participants at any given moment.
 
The internal energy market running at our customers’ sites take daily feeds of production and load forecasts from the platform to set up the daily market parameters, then ingest a stream of current positions of both buyers and sellers as well as their individual pricing information, which is calculated based on the details of the energy rate under which those consumers operate. Consumers bid into the market along the schedule of the specific rate structure under which those loads operate, with bids including the calculated value of energy and power based on that rate and the predicted total use and power profile during the time period of that bid. Based on the predicted generation profile and the other active bids currently being satisfied, the market either fills or cannot fill the newly received bid, and based on the market’s feedback, the consumer’s operation mode and setpoint will change, which will determine the actual control commands sent to related equipment.
 
This market scenario is mirrored at every level, from an individual node potentially consisting of only one producer and one consumer (power source and meter, respectively), to a higher-level node, in which other nodes participate as either net producers or net consumers, to the site level, and even up to regional level, when sites are allowed to participate in the market directly. At each level, details of the level below are aggregated and abstracted away, so each level operates in a simple and self-similar way, mirroring the physical construction of the FractalGrid. These markets shine in optimization scenarios, especially in times of just enough supply or even slight scarcity, which generally allows the system to reap the maximum economic value for our customers even in the case of undersized grids. In addition, this flexibility allows for ease of integration for new market participants at each level as regulation matures to support further Demand Response programs, ancillary service markets, and eventually peer-to-peer transactive energy.
 
Quality
 
We employ a quality-first mindset in all aspects of our software design. From a software architecture point of view, this translates in designing for the maintainability, extensibility, scalability, availability, accessibility, and deployability of the system. This design plan paired with our design and engineering methods and experience are intended to help keep us on the leading edge of the microgrid industry.

Material Agreements
 
International Land Alliance, Inc.
 
On November 5, 2019, CleanSpark entered into a binding Memorandum of Understanding (the “MOU”) with International Land Alliance, Inc., a Wyoming corporation (“ILAL”), in order to lay a foundational framework where the Company will deploy its energy solutions products and services to ILAL, its energy projects, and its customers.
 
Pursuant to the terms of the MOU, the parties will work in good faith and pursue the following priorities over the next twelve (12) months:
 

1) | The Company will perform feasibility studies to outline the details and scope of developing microgrid energy solutions to support ILAL projects.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2) | ILAL will (a) exclusively sell the Company’s products and services as part of ILAL’s power solution for its offering of off-grid properties, and (b) include the Company’s mPulse DER Energy Manager within the off-grid energy project bids;
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3) | The Company will provide on-site testing, training, and support services to ILAL’s projects and operations
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In connection with the MOU, and in order to support the power and energy needs of ILAL’s development and construction of certain projects, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement, dated as of November 6, 2019, with ILAL (the “SPA”).
 
Pursuant to the terms of the SPA, ILAL sold, and the Company purchased 1,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock (the “Preferred Stock”) of ILAL for an aggregate purchase price of US $500,000.00 (the “Stock Transaction”), less certain expenses and fees. In connection with the Stock Transaction, ILAL will issue 350,000 shares of its common stock to the Company as commitment shares. ILAL may issue additional shares of its common stock to the Company if certain conditions are not satisfied.
 
Our Gasifier Business
 
We own Patent Nos. 9,890,340B2, 9,359,567, 8,518,133 8,105,401 and 8,347,829 protecting our gasification technology and process for using feedstock comprising gaseous fuel. Our technology is capable of converting any organic material into SynGas. SynGas can be used as clean, renewable, environmentally friendly, warming fuel for power plants, motor vehicles, and as feedstock for the generation of DME (Di-Methyl Ether). 
 
Our process involves the grinding, drying, separating, mixing, and then pelletizing of solid waste. These pellets constitute the feedstock for the Gasifier. Gasifying the pellets produces SynGas. SynGas can be converted into multiple forms of energy including motor vehicle and jet fuels. The SynGas produced is sufficently clean that it generally does not require hot-gas cleanup. SynGas is mostly hydrogen and carbon monoxide. Hydrogen and carbon monoxide are primary building blocks for fuels and chemicals. SynGas is a clean burning fuel suitable for use in duel-fuel diesel engines, gas turbines, and steam boilers.

As discussed above, we do not anticipate deploying significant resources on the gasification business at this time. As opportunities arise we intend to utilize the gasification assets and intellectual properties through licensing or sales agreements.
 
The technologies and prototype will need to undergo additional clinical lab testing to further establish its capability of producing large volumes of clean, renewable energy from any carbon compound (Municipal Solid Waste (MSW), Coal, Sewage Sludge) into clean Synthesis Gas. Our Gasifier is still under development and a commercially viable Gasifier is not expected to be sellable until we are able to expend additional resources on its testing and development. In December of 2014, we executed an agreement with a third party to independently test our production model prototype. The third party was engaged to independently test the Gasifer's performance and certify the results of its performance. Upon completion of the testing, an initial white paper was published outlining the results and suggested improvements. We anticipate that the cost to complete these improvements would be between $250,000 and $500,000. Upon completion of the improvements, we would conduct an extended test run with an independent third party to verify the results needed to prove its commercial viability, at which time we would begin to actively market our Gasifier units.
 
We have not engaged in any significant negotiations to sell or license our Gasifier products to any major customers.

Competition
 
We face significant competition in the alternative energy and microgrid markets. Some of our competitors have substantially larger financial and other resources. Factors that could affect our ability increase sales of our System may include resource limitations, available information and our standards established for projected return on investment.
 
Distributed Energy Management Business Competition
 
Our DER Business and software platforms are set up to compete against larger companies. Our integrated microgrid control platform seamlessly integrates energy generation with energy storage devices and controls facility loads to provide energy security in real time. The systems are able to interoperate with the local utility grid and allows users the ability to obtain the most cost-effective power for a facility. The systems are technology agnostic and can incorporate into multiple vendors and manufacturers products and legacy systems. The systems are ideal for commercial, industrial, mining, defense, campus and community users ranging from 4 kw to 100 MW and beyond and can deliver power at or below the current cost of utility power. All of these attributes contribute to our ability to compete with the larger, more established competitors that have rely on their own manufactured products and hardware solutions.
 
Distributed Energy and Microgrid control technologies are new to the market and can be deployed in various formats. Eight technologies that are predominantly used in commercial applications and/or have been extensively studied are:
