Item 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
Pulse Evolution Group, Inc. (formerly known as Recall Studios, Inc.) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Florida in February 2009 under the name York Entertainment, Inc.  On February 28, 2019, the Company’s corporate name was changed to Pulse Evolution Group, Inc., in recognition of the global market reputation of its major operating subsidiary, Pulse Evolution Corporation, and its stock symbol was changed to “DGLF” in recognition of the Company’s focus on ‘Digital Life’.
Nature of Business
 
Pulse Evolution Group, Inc. is a developer of hyper-realistic digital humans – computer generated assets that can be distributed across the full spectrum of traditional media and emerging display technologies, including live entertainment, virtual reality, augmented reality, mobile, interactive and artificial intelligence applications. The Company’s business plan is to generate revenues through the development and deployment of digital human characters, and related software, but also through roll-up acquisitions within the digital human industry. The Company believes it has the opportunity to make strategic acquisitions of technology and revenue-generating companies, to become a dominant global leader in a sizable and lucrative digital human industry that is, thus far, largely unrecognized as an industry.


On August 8, 2018, the Company entered into a share exchange agreement to acquire up to 100% of Evolution AI Corporation (“EAI”), a development stage artificial intelligence company, which included EAI’s 58% interest in Pulse Evolution Corporation (“PEC”). PEC is a globally recognized pioneer in the development of hyper-realistic digital humans for live shows, virtual reality, augmented reality, holographic, 3D stereoscopic, web, mobile, interactive and artificial intelligence applications. PEC’s principals are most popularly known for producing some of the most visually stunning digital humans in the history of entertainment, including the Academy Award lead character in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008), the digital alter-ego of Jeff Bridges in Tron: Legacy (2010), the holographic performance of ‘Virtual Tupac Shakur’ at the Coachella Valley Music Festival (2012), and ‘Virtual Michael Jackson’ at the Billboard Music Awards (2014). Currently, we indirectly own a majority of the issued and outstanding common stock of PEC through EAI. Pursuant to the terms of the closing agreement, the Company became a 99.7% owner of EAI. The Company accounted for the transaction as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting based on ASC 805 — Business Combinations, which requires recognition and measurement of all identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair value as of the date control is obtained. The Company determined that it was the accounting acquirer under ASC 805. This determination was primarily based on existing management of the Company retaining 4 of the 5 seats on the Board, the provisions of the voting rights agreement entered between the Company and the principal founder of EAI, and the operating management continuing in key roles following the business combination.
 
We believe that digital humans will be ubiquitous in society, culture and industry. In the last decade, hyper-realistic digital humans have performed in movies such as The Curious Case of Benjamin Button or on stage such as the virtual performance of a digital Tupac Shakur at the Coachella Valley Music Festival. We expect that, in years to come, digital humans will not only perform for audiences on stage and in film, but they will also represent individual consumers as digital likeness avatars, in realistic and fantasy form, appearing and interacting on the consumer’s behalf in electronic and mobile communication, social media, video game, virtual reality, and augmented reality. The Company’s long-term goal is to be the ‘face’ of artificial intelligence, to provide a human form to interactive artificially intelligent computer beings that will be common in society, providing useful information and services to people in diverse industries, such as education, health care, telecommunications, defense, transportation and entertainment.
 
Our leadership team is currently focused on applications of digital humans in entertainment. We believe the entertainment industry provides us with attractive near-term opportunities to put digital humans to work in proven performance-oriented business models, while also allowing us to use the visibility of our globally recognized celebrities to showcase our digital human technologies and their applications across other industries. Accordingly, our current business plan is to generate revenues from our digital human representations of some of the world’s best-known living and late celebrities through their appearance across a diverse array of display mediums, such as live entertainment, film and television, video games and mobile applications.

The Company has a long-term agreement with the Estate of Michael Jackson, a shareholder of the Company, to share in the revenues of any commercial use of the digital likeness of Michael Jackson. The Company is also in negotiations regarding the amendment and re-instatement of rights agreements relating to the intellectual property held by Company shareholders, the Estate of Marilyn Monroe and Authentic Brands Group / Elvis Presley Enterprises. In March 2019, the Company entered into an agreement to finance and co-produce Broadway Asia’s theatrical production of DreamWorks’ Kung Fu Panda Spectacular Live at the Venetian Theatre in Macau, Hong Kong, currently scheduled to open in early 2020.
 
We believe our specific business opportunity will be driven by the rapid evolution of the methods by which people access information and content through various forms of interactive electronic media. We believe that we are moving toward a world in which we will simply ask a computer a question and we will be given an answer, by a hyper-realistic digital human who possesses a universe of accurate and relevant information. Through our continued development of the world’s most advanced human animation technology, and our collaboration with the larger community of artificial intelligence pioneers, we expect that we will do more than just put a face on AI. We intend to build your most knowledgeable teacher, your most trusted advisor, and in a digital world that reveals more possibilities each day, maybe even your best friend.
 
Competition
 
We believe the prior work of our principals, continues to position the Company as a recognized leader in the production of hyper-realistic digital humans for applications in entertainment. We are aware of a number of companies connected to the video game market that are also attempting to improve the realism of digital humans in video game applications, and in other real-time applications. Traditional feature film visual effects companies also, from time to time, produce digital human characters for feature films. While such companies, in the video game markets and in the film markets, have struggled to produce digital human characters that are extremely realistic and believable as humans, we do expect the demand for digital humans and related applications to grow and such competition to intensify.
Employees
 
As of May 31, 2019, we have seven full-time employees and utilize independent contractors to fulfill our programming, coding and business development efforts. None of our employees are represented by a union. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
