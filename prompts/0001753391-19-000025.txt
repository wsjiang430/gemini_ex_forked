DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

General

Bigeon is a Nevada corporation that is developing a new kind of messenger application. The product of the Company (the App) is intended to provide an entirely new way of sharing information. The App enables a user to draw a picture or a writing instead of typing the whole message.

After the user finishes drawing, it will either be converted to a regular message using the handwriting mechanism or it will be sent as a graffiti. The Companys product is intended for all sorts of graphic and drawing purposes. The App will be designed to provide technological solutions to a broad range of companies, individual brands, enterprises, and organizations in international markets. Our intended users will be the people whose jobs are connected with drawing and creating graphic animation. Bigeons product will be an appropriate tool to make short sketches on the go and share them with others. It also simplifies the process of creating a message as you do not longer need to use you both hands. The App is going to have a built-in graphic input field with variable size and a variety of instruments for drawing a picture unique and recognizable. Bigeons intended product is planned to represent a whole new kind of graphic solution allowing its users to prepare and share sketches from anywhere.

We are planning to generate revenue in this business by:
 o
 spreading the App by means of digital distribution platforms for mobile and computer software such as AppStore, Google Play and similar;
 o
 offering in-app purchases that will expand the number of available functions for creating graphics;
 o
 distributing customized versions of the product per request of entities specialized in computer design and graphics;
 o
 delivering and updating the content of our product using a suite of advanced media, content and network management software products.

These activities generate revenue through: experience design, content development and production, software development, engineering, implementation, software license fees; and maintenance and support services related to our software.
 
We believe that the adoption and evolution of graphic technologies will increase substantially in years to come both in the industries on which we currently focus and in others. We also believe that adoption of our solutions depends not only upon the solutions that we provide but also depends heavily upon the diversity of the similar products made by other companies. Unlike the opponents we are going to consider all the feedback that we receive in order to fit all the requirements of our users and provide the most suitable functionality. 

Corporate Organization

Our principal office is located at Manesova 345/13 Ceske Budejovice 6, 370 01 Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic. Our telephone number is +420234768135.

The legal entity that is the registrant was originally incorporated and organized as a Nevada corporation under the name Bigeon on June 19, 2018. Our business focuses on the provision of solutions in graphic software field, specifically in provision of an application with the opportunity of graphic input.
Industry Background
 
Over approximately the past 24 months, we believe certain graphic industry trends are creating the opportunity for IT brands, computer graphic enterprises and numerous of other businesses. These trends include: (i) the expectations of potential users; (ii) addressing online competitors by improving media experiences; (iii) accelerating decline in the cost of software; (iv) the increasing sophistication of social networking platforms; (v) increasingly complex customer requirements related to their specific graphic technology and solution objectives; and (vi) customers challenging service providers with the delivery of a satisfactory consumer experience.
 
As a result, a growing number of brand and other organizations have identified the need and opportunity to implement increasingly cost-effective and sales-lifting graphic, and interactive experiences to market to their users. These include creating unique and customized experiences for targeted, timely offerings and relevant promotions and improving engagement resulting in increased sales. We believe our clients consider capitalizing on these industry trends to be increasingly critical to any successful brand sales environment. 
 
Companies are accomplishing their strategies by implementing various graphic technology solutions, which: are implemented in multiple forms and types of configurations; attempt to achieve any of a broad range of individual or combination of objectives; contain various levels of targeting; and are built to deliver or contain a standard or customized experience unique to and within the customers environment

Our Product

Bigeon is now developing an innovative type of a messenger application with availability of graphic input. Many of our competitors offer various solutions for messaging applications but none of them is anyhow related with graphics. Our company will provide prospective users with advanced graphic features including any combinations of colors, variable line width, backgrounds, filling, spraying and many others.

Developing of any application begins with developing of software requirements specification (SRS). It is a document containing the whole description of the software and the connection between its parts. The Company started to develop its SRS upon the establishment in June 2018. The document itself is available as an Exhibit 99.2 to the original filing of the Companys S-1 Registration Statement on February 15, 2019. Mr. Olegas Tunevicius, our sole President and Director, conducted the process himself, using his personal knowledge and experience in the IT field. Along with the SRS, the Company also started developing the design and interactive prototypes of the future app. At this time, development of both SRS and interactive design prototypes is completed. The SRS is available for public as an exhibit to this prospectus. In order to test our design prototypes, please visit us at http://bigeon.in/ and follow the link proposed there. The prototypes on the website only relate to the design of the future application and represent the intended functionality. They do not indicate any progress in development of the software part of the app.

Currently we are considering developing the software part of the application for Android devices and collecting information about related procedures and expenses. Based on the research that we have been conducting, first of all we will need to rent a server with enough capacities to maintain communication for thousands of users at the same time. The Company estimates such expenses to be around $10,000 annually for the first year. In future, following the expansion of our capacities, we will need a more powerful server that may cost up to $100,000. The development process of the app itself has not started yet. We expect to start it as soon as we receive proceeds from our stock offering as we might have to hire third-party developers and pay for their services. We estimate such costs to be around $5,000-$7,000 annually during the first year. If we are successful in our development plan and start it as soon as we receive proceeds from our stock offering, the whole development process shall take up to 1 year. As long as we have not generated any revenue yet, we solely rely on the success of our public offering for obtaining the financing for developing our intended software.

Upon the completion of developing both Andorid and iOS versions of the app, the latter is going to be listed on digital platforms such as Google Play Market and Apple Store, respectively. In order to complete these, we will have to obtain a D-U-N-S number and set up the respective developer accounts for both platforms. When our applications are submitted and confirmed, we will be able to upload the app itself.

Bigeons application is not only unique but it also secure.

Our Markets
 
We currently plan to market and sell our graphic technology solution through popular digital distribution services and platforms (also referred to as app stores) such as Google Play Market, App Store, Amazon Appstore and others. We also intend to market to companies that seek graphic solutions across the Internet in order to offer them individually developed versions of the App for their needs. The management of the Company expects to attract corporate clients among design agencies, bureau of architecture, tattoo studios and similar small companies that deal with creating custom images and/or sketches.

Our graphic technology solutions have application in a wide variety of industries. The industries in which we sell our solutions are established and include web design industry, custom graphics, engineering, fashion industry; however, the planning, development, implementation and maintenance of technology-enabled experiences involving combinations of graphic technologies is relatively new and evolving. Moreover, a number of participants in these industries have only recently started considering or expanding the adoption of these types of technologies, solutions and experiences as part of their overall marketing strategies

Effect of General Economic Conditions on our Business
 
We believe that demand for our product will increase in part as a result of new construction and the recent economic recovery in general. These general economic improvements generally make it easier for our customers to justify decisions to invest in graphic messenger application development.
Regulation
 
We are subject to various federal, state and international laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the Internet and mobile platforms, including those relating to privacy, use and protection of user personal information and data (including the collection of data from minors), the Internet, mobile applications, content, advertising and marketing activities and anti-corruption. Presently, we do not believe that any such legislation or proposed legislation will have a materially adverse impact on our business.
Competition
 
While we believe there is presently no direct competitor with the comprehensive offering of technologies and solutions we will provide to our future customers, there are multiple individual competitors who offer pieces of our solution stack. These include messaging software companies such as Viber, WhatsApp, Telegram, Facebook Messenger. Some of these competitors have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do and may be able to respond more rapidly than we can to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements. We believe that our sales and business development capabilities, our comprehensive offering of graphic technology and solutions, future brand awareness, and proprietary processes are the primary factors affecting our competitive position.
Employees
 
We have only one employee who is our director and President, Mr. Olegas Tunevicius.
 
Legal Proceedings
 
We are not involved in certain legal claims or proceedings, nor have we ever been.
