Mission
Our mission is to build the largest, most trusted and vibrant home-related marketplace in the world.
Overview
Zillow Group, Inc. operates the largest portfolio of real estate and home-related brands on mobile and the web which focus on all stages of the home lifecycle: renting, buying, selling and financing. Zillow Group is committed to empowering consumers with unparalleled data, inspiration and knowledge around homes and connecting them with great real estate professionals. The Zillow Group portfolio of consumer brands includes Zillow, Trulia, Mortgage Lenders of America, StreetEasy, HotPads, Naked Apartments, RealEstate.com and Out East. In addition, Zillow Group provides a comprehensive suite of marketing software and technology solutions to help real estate, rental, and mortgage professionals maximize business opportunities and connect with millions of consumers. Beginning in April 2018, Zillow Offers provides homeowners in certain metropolitan areas with the opportunity to receive offers to purchase their home from Zillow. When Zillow buys a home, it makes certain repairs and lists the home for resale on the open market. In October 2018, we completed the acquisition of Mortgage Lenders of America, L.L.C. (“MLOA”), a licensed mortgage lender, through which we originate residential mortgages to consumers. Zillow Group operates a number of business brands for real estate, rental and mortgage professionals, including Mortech, dotloop, Bridge Interactive and New Home Feed. Zillow, Inc. was incorporated as a Washington corporation in December 2004, and we launched the initial version of our website, Zillow.com, in February 2006. Zillow Group, Inc. was incorporated as a Washington corporation in July 2014 in connection with our acquisition of Trulia. Upon the closing of the Trulia acquisition in February 2015, each of Zillow and Trulia became wholly owned subsidiaries of Zillow Group.
Our living database of approximately 110 million U.S. homes, including homes for sale, homes for rent and homes not currently on the market, attracts an active and vibrant community of users. Individuals and businesses that use Zillow’s mobile applications and websites have updated information on more than 80 million homes, creating exclusive home profiles not available anywhere else. These profiles include detailed information about homes, including property facts, listing information and purchase and sale data. We provide this information to our users where, when and how they want it, through our industry-leading mobile applications and websites. Using complex, proprietary automated valuation models, we provide current home value estimates, or Zestimates, and current rental price estimates, or Rent Zestimates, on approximately 100 million U.S. homes.
For the year ended December 31, 2018, we generated revenue of $1,333.6 million, as compared to $1,076.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of 24%. We generate revenue from the sale of advertising services and our suite of marketing software and technology solutions to businesses and professionals primarily associated with the residential real estate, rental and mortgage industries. We also generate revenue through the resale of homes on the open market through our Zillow Offers program which was announced in April of 2018, as well as through mortgage originations through our October 2018 acquisition of MLOA, a licensed mortgage lender.
As of the second quarter of 2018, Zillow Group had two reportable segments: the Internet, Media & Technology (“IMT”) segment, our historical operating and reportable segment, and the Homes segment. In our IMT segment, we generate revenue from the sale of advertising services and our suite of marketing software and technology solutions to businesses and professionals primarily associated with the residential real estate, rental and mortgage industries. These professionals include real estate, rental and mortgage professionals and brand advertisers. The four revenue categories within our IMT segment are Premier Agent, Rentals, Mortgages and Other.
Premier Agent revenue is generated by the sale of advertising under our Premier Agent and Premier Broker programs, which offer a suite of marketing and business technology products and services to help real estate agents and brokers achieve their advertising goals, while growing and managing their businesses and brands. We primarily offer our Premier Agent and Premier Broker advertising products on a cost per impression basis. Impressions are delivered when a sold advertisement appears on pages viewed by users of our mobile applications and websites. Rentals revenue primarily includes advertising sold to property managers and other rental professionals on a cost per lead, cost per click, cost per impression or cost per lease generated basis, and beginning in 2018, it includes revenue generated through our rental applications product. Rentals revenue also includes revenue generated through our StreetEasy products and services, which is primarily generated on a cost per listing basis. Mortgages revenue primarily includes advertising sold to mortgage lenders and other mortgage professionals on a cost 
per lead basis, including our Connect (formerly known as Long Form) and Custom Quote services, as well as revenue generated by Mortech, which provides subscription-based mortgage software solutions, including a product and pricing engine and lead management platform. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2018, mortgages revenue also includes revenue generated from mortgage originations and the sale of mortgages on the secondary market through our acquisition of MLOA. Other revenue primarily includes revenue generated by new construction and display, as well as revenue from the sale of various other advertising and business software solutions and services and technology solutions for real estate professionals, including dotloop. New construction revenue primarily includes advertising services sold to home builders on a cost per residential community basis. Display revenue primarily consists of graphical mobile and web advertising sold to advertisers promoting their brands on our mobile applications and websites.
In our Homes segment, we generate revenue from the resale of homes on the open market through our Zillow Offers program. We began buying homes through the Zillow Offers program in April of 2018. We began selling homes in July of 2018.
On October 31, 2018, we completed the acquisition of MLOA, a licensed mortgage lender. This acquisition is consistent with our strategy of moving further down funnel and closer to the real estate transaction to create better consumer experiences. The total purchase price for the acquisition of MLOA was approximately $66.7 million in cash. 
Beginning with the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ending March 31, 2019, Zillow Group expects to report financial results for three reportable segments: the IMT segment, the Homes segment and the Mortgages segment. The IMT segment will include the financial results for the Premier Agent, Rentals and new construction marketplaces, as well as dotloop, display and other advertising and business software solutions. The Homes segment will include the financial results from Zillow Group’s buying and selling of homes directly. The Mortgages segment will include the financial results for advertising sold to mortgage lenders and other mortgage professionals, mortgage originations through MLOA and the sale of mortgages on the secondary market, as well as Mortech mortgage software solutions. We expect the Mortgages segment, with the inclusion of MLOA, to have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheets, statements of operations and cash flows in 2019.
Portions of our business may be affected by seasonal fluctuations in the residential real estate market, advertising spending, and other factors. We believe our rapid growth may be masking the underlying seasonality of our business. As we continue to expand our Zillow Offers service, we expect seasonal variances may become more pronounced, causing our operating results to fluctuate. For example, costs and expenses typically peak in the three months ended June 30th, primarily attributable to increases in sales and marketing expenses which are, in turn, primarily attributable to increased investment in marketing and advertising initiatives to attract consumers across online and offline channels during peak seasons for home sales activity. For the year ended December 31, 2018, costs and expenses peaked in the three months ended September 30th, primarily attributable to the addition of our Homes business. In addition, the average number of unique users and visits have historically peaked during the three months ended June 30th or September 30th, also consistent with peak residential real estate activity in the spring and summer months. Because the number of unique users and visits may impact impression inventory, leads to real estate professionals, and graphical display inventory that we monetize, this trend in the average number of unique users and visits may result in seasonality of revenue. Also, as our Homes business revenue depends in part on users accessing our mobile applications and websites to engage in the sale and purchase of homes with Zillow Group on the open market, the impact of increased real estate activity in the spring and summer months may result in seasonality of revenue.
Industry Dynamics
The Importance of Homes
Homes are the center of peoples’ lives, the focus of some of their most important decisions and often their most valuable assets. In addition to whether to buy, sell or rent, consumers frequently make many other important home-related decisions, including decisions relating to home financing and home equity loans. Residential real estate is one of the largest sectors of the U.S. economy and supports millions of professionals that provide services related to home purchases and sales, rentals and home financings.
Large Market Opportunities
Based on external and internal assessments, we believe our current addressable markets include the following:
Purchase and Sale—In the United States, there are 212.8 million people residing in owner-occupied housing, according to data published by the U.S. Census Bureau in November 2018. Approximately 34% of movers in 2018, or 10.9 million people, were homeowners, according to the U.S. Census Bureau migration data published in November 2018.
Sales of approximately 5.4 million existing and over 600 thousand new homes in the United States in 2018 had an aggregate transaction value of approximately $1.8 trillion, according to data published in 2018 by the U.S. Census Bureau and in 2019 by the National Association of REALTORS®. Estimated real estate commission revenue was approximately $87 billion in 2018, according to data from REAL Trends in 2017, and data published in 2018 by the U.S. Census Bureau, and in 2019 by the National Association of REALTORS®. In an effort to acquire new client relationships and sell homes, U.S. real estate agents and brokers will spend an estimated $8.3 billion on residential advertising in 2019, based on the most recent forecast from Borrell Associates released in 2019. In addition, U.S. real estate developers will spend an estimated $715 million on residential advertising in 2019, also based on the most recent forecast from Borrell Associates released in 2019.
Based on current purchase criteria, which considers home value, square footage, year built and other parameters, if Zillow Offers were available in the top 200 metro areas in the U.S., sellers of nearly half of the existing homes sold in 2018 across the entire nation, or approximately 2.7 million homes, would have been eligible to receive offers from Zillow to buy their home.
Home Financing—According to a forecast from the Mortgage Bankers Association published in January 2019, approximately 4.2 million U.S. residential mortgage purchase originations occurred in 2018 for a total value of $1.2 trillion. Based on quarterly performance data released by the Mortgage Bankers Association, estimated annual production revenue by purchase loan originators was approximately $44 billion in 2018. U.S. residential mortgage providers will spend approximately $7.1 billion in 2019 marketing their services and loan products to mortgage borrowers, based on the most recent forecast from Borrell Associates released in 2019.
Rentals—In the United States, there are 106.5 million people residing in rental housing units, according to data published by the U.S. Census Bureau in 2018. Approximately 66% of movers in 2018, or 21.4 million people, were renters, according to the U.S. Census Bureau migration data published in November 2018.
In the third quarter of 2018, there were approximately 46.8 million rental housing units in the United States, with a national vacancy rate of 7.1%, according to data published by the U.S. Census Bureau in October 2018. According to data published by the U.S. Census Bureau from the 2015 Rental Housing Finance Survey, approximately:

• | 26.8% of rental units (12.5 million) are located in buildings with 50 or more units;


• | 8.6% of rental units (4.0 million) are located in buildings with 25 to 49 units;


• | 10.4% of rental units (4.9 million) are located in buildings with 5 to 24 units;


• | 13.7% of rental units (6.4 million) are located in small multi-family structures of 2-4 units;


• | 40.6% of rental units (19.0 million) are 1-unit structures.

According to an IBISWorld industry report on property management in the United States published in 2018, residential landlords spend an estimated $44.0 billion on property management services annually. Based on the most recent forecast from Borrell Associates released in 2019, U.S. rental property managers will spend an estimated $2.7 billion on advertising in 2019, which excludes lease concessions.
Highly Fragmented, Local and Complex Market
The market for residential real estate transactions and home-related services is highly fragmented, local and complex. Each home has unique characteristics, including location, value, size, style, age and condition. Each consumer approaches home-related transactions with a personal set of objectives, priorities and values. Real estate professionals generally operate in local markets, often as independent contractors with different experiences and skills. These conditions create challenges for consumers and real estate, rental and mortgage professionals alike. Consumers are challenged to find information about homes and to find real estate, rental and mortgage professionals who fit their individual needs. Real estate, rental and mortgage professionals are challenged to efficiently advertise their services and identify new clients, nurture those clients through to transactions, and to measure the effectiveness of their marketing efforts.
Preeminent Role of Mobile Devices in Lives of Consumers
Consumers are increasingly turning to mobile devices to access real estate information and services via the internet, as well as to complete transactions. With the widespread adoption of mobile and location-based technologies, consumers increasingly expect home-related information and the ability to transact to be available via their mobile devices where, when 
and how they want it. According to Comscore data published in December 2018, Zillow Group brands represent nearly three quarters of market share of all mobile exclusive visitors to the real estate category. More than two-thirds of our flagship brand Zillow’s usage occurs on a mobile device. We believe that the technological platform shift from desktop computers to mobile devices benefits technology leaders like Zillow Group that are quick to innovate.
Competitive Advantages
We believe we have the following competitive advantages:

• | Powerful Brand and Scale. We have established a powerful brand identity that includes a portfolio of the largest and most vibrant brands, and we have built a large user community. The majority of our traffic comes direct, not dependent on search engines, with demonstrated consumer intent to visit Zillow Group’s brands. Traffic to Zillow Group brands’ mobile applications and websites reached a seasonal peak of more than 195 million monthly unique users in July 2018, an increase of 4% year over year. Visits to Zillow Group brands’ mobile applications and websites, including Zillow, Trulia, StreetEasy and RealEstate.com, increased 14% to 7,182.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. For additional information regarding unique users and visits, see “Unique Users” and “Visits” in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”


• | Inimitable Database of Homes. Our living database of homes is the result of years of substantial investment, sophisticated economic and statistical analysis, complex data aggregation and millions of user contributions. Our dynamic and comprehensive living database includes detailed information on more than 110 million U.S. homes, and includes homes for sale by third party sellers, homes for sale owned by Zillow, homes for rent and recently sold, as well as properties not currently on the market. This database is central to the value we provide to consumers and real estate, rental and mortgage professionals. It contains extensive information that users can search, through an easy-to-use interface, to identify, analyze and compare homes. Our database is relevant to a broad range of users, including buyers, sellers, renters, homeowners, real estate agents and other real estate professionals. It includes information such as:


• | Property facts: Zestimate and its corresponding value range, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, square footage, lot size, assessed tax value and property type such as single-family, condominium, apartment, multifamily, manufactured home or land.


• | Listing information: price, price history and reductions, dollars per square foot, days on the market, listing type (such as for sale by agent, for sale by owner, pre-market inventory, which includes foreclosure, pre-foreclosure, Coming Soon and Make Me Move listings, new construction and rental homes), open houses, property photos and estimated monthly mortgage payment.


• | Purchase and sale data: prior sales information and recent sales nearby.

We synthesize data from hundreds of automated feeds, representing information from tens of thousands of public and private sources. Applying extensive computer analytics to the data, we transform it into information that is accessible, understandable and useful.
We refer to the database as “living” because the information is continually updated by the combination of our proprietary algorithms, synthesis of third-party data from hundreds of sources, and through improvements by us and, importantly, by our community of users. User-generated content from owners, agents and others enriches our database with photos, videos, and additional property information. Individuals and businesses that use Zillow’s mobile applications and websites have updated information on more than 80 million homes in our database, creating exclusive home profiles not available anywhere else. Our inimitable database enables us to create content, products and services not available anywhere else, and attracts an active, vibrant community of users. As of December 31, 2018, we had published more than 4.4 million reviews, including more than 3.7 million reviews of local real estate agents and approximately 649,000 reviews of mortgage professionals submitted by our users on Zillow.

• | Zestimates and Rent Zestimates. We have developed industry-leading automated home valuation models that use advanced statistical methods and complex, proprietary algorithms. We use these models to provide current home value estimates, or Zestimates, and current rental price estimates, or Rent Zestimates, on approximately 100 million U.S. homes. Based on our Zestimates, we produce Zillow Home Value Indexes at the neighborhood, zip code, city, metropolitan statistical area, county and national levels. Our Zillow Home Value Indexes have been cited by

government entities such as the Federal Reserve Bank and the Congressional Oversight Panel, university studies and respected national publications. For historical comparisons, we provide up to 15 years of Zestimate history on each home and valuable information about property and real estate market trends. Our Zestimates, Rent Zestimates and Zillow Home Value Indexes allow consumers to evaluate homes and neighborhoods, and to easily evaluate historical trends, as they contemplate critical home-related decisions.

• | Mobile Leadership and Monetization. We have developed and operate the most popular suite of mobile real estate applications across all major platforms. For example, on our flagship Zillow brand, during December 2018, nearly 880 million homes, or 328 homes per second, were viewed on a mobile device. More than two-thirds of our flagship brand Zillow’s usage occurs on a mobile device. We operate one of the most popular suites of mobile real estate applications with more than fifty applications across all major mobile platforms. We monetize our marketplace business on our mobile platform in the same way we do on our web platform.


• | Independent Market Positions and Consumer Focus. Zillow Group has been built independent of any real estate industry group. We maintain an unwavering commitment to giving consumers free access to as much useful information as possible. We provide information, products and services, designed to empower consumers to make informed decisions about homes and the residential real estate market. We believe our independence enables us to create compelling products and services with broad consumer appeal.


• | Multiple Robust Home-Related Marketplaces. We have created trusted and transparent marketplaces in real estate, rentals and mortgages where consumers can identify and connect with local professionals that are best suited to meet their needs. Our living database of homes provides a foundation on which we can build new consumer and professional marketplaces in other home-related categories.


• | Technology Solutions for Professionals. We offer a suite of marketing and technology solutions to help real estate, rental and mortgage professionals grow their businesses and personal brands including our Premier Agent app that allows real estate professionals to manage their business from wherever they are, dotloop that has digitized the real estate transaction, and Bridge Interactive which has streamlined listing data management.


• | Consumer-Oriented Mortgage Marketplace. Unlike other sources of mortgage rate quotes, consumers can anonymously submit mortgage loan information requests and receive an unlimited number of personalized mortgage quotes directly from hundreds of consumer-rated lenders, including MLOA, through which we originate mortgages. Because we operate this marketplace as part of our real estate home shopping experience, we can efficiently attract motivated users to the marketplace and prioritize the consumer’s experience. For the year ended December 31, 2018, there were approximately 25.4 million mortgage loan information requests submitted on Zillow Group platforms by consumers.


• | Personalized Experience. We present homebuyers and sellers and real estate, rental and mortgage professionals with many opportunities to personalize their Zillow Group experience, leading to more informed home shopping and financing decisions. As immediacy is paramount in the home search experience, all Zillow Group mobile applications and websites empower users by allowing them to set the criteria that matters most to them, while we take on the action of alerting them when a home or rental that matches their criteria hits the market.


• | Proven Management Team. We believe the broad experience and depth of our management team are distinct competitive advantages in the complex and evolving industry in which we compete. The Zillow Group management team has a mix of extensive experience building successful consumer internet companies and real estate and mortgages businesses. We believe the collective skills and experiences of our executives provide our management team with immense strategic insight and ability.

Growth Strategies
Our growth strategies are:

• | Improve the Home-Related Transaction Experience for the Consumer. Maintain our unwavering focus on empowering consumers with information and products and services that they love to use to make home-related decisions. Develop seamless end-to-end technology offerings that meet the ever-changing expectations of today’s consumers in an on-demand economy, with a goal of earning consumers’ preference for Zillow Group products and services across all stages of the home lifecycle.


• | Grow our Audience and Increase Engagement Across all Brands. Expand our targeted marketing and advertising programs, public relations, social media initiatives and content distribution to efficiently increase consumer awareness across all brands in our portfolio. Increase footprint via international expansion, as well as into local markets with new products and services. Launch new brands, products and services that target specific demographics or geographies.


• | Continuously Provide Growth Opportunities for Residential Real Estate Agents and Brokers, Home Builders, Rental Property Managers, and Mortgage Lenders. Provide real estate, rental and mortgage professionals participating in our marketplaces continuous opportunities to grow their respective businesses and increase transactions by creating opportunities for high-quality consumer-initiated connections. Support participating professionals by developing a broad variety of marketing software, technology solutions, productivity tools and other support services to help those professionals manage and grow their businesses and personal brands.


• | Deepen and Expand Our Marketplaces Across the Lifecycle of Homes. Deepen and expand our platform beyond advertising services for real estate, rental and mortgage professionals through direct market participation, by purchasing homes from, selling homes to, and originating mortgages for consumers. In the future, develop other ancillary products and services to address friction in residential real estate transactions for consumers and industry professionals. Also, pursue commercial relationships and acquisitions to strengthen our market position, enhance our technology offerings and accelerate our growth.


• | Leverage our Data Advantage. Enhance the information in our database of more than 110 million homes, and use it as the foundation for new analyses, insights and tools that inform strategic decisions. Our living database of homes provides a foundation on which we can build new consumer and professional marketplaces in other home-related categories. Our unmatched audience size and traffic pattern data also provides us with a competitive advantage.

Real Estate Products and Services
We provide advertising products and services for real estate, rental and mortgage professionals that enable them to create and promote useful content for consumers. Additionally, in 2018 we introduced new services to enable consumers to directly buy and sell homes through our Zillow Offers program and to help consumers finance real estate transactions through our acquisition of MLOA.
Premier Agent and Premier Broker Programs 
Our Premier Agent and Premier Broker programs offer a suite of marketing and business technology products and services to help real estate agents and brokers achieve their advertising goals, while growing and managing their businesses and brands. All Premier Agents and Premier Brokers receive access to a dashboard portal on our mobile application or website that provides individualized program performance analytics, our customer relationship management, or CRM, tool that captures detailed information about each contact made with a Premier Agent or Premier Broker through our mobile and web platforms and our account management tools. 
We primarily offer our Premier Agent and Premier Broker advertising products on a cost per impression basis. Payment is received prior to the delivery of impressions. Impressions are delivered when a sold advertisement appears on pages viewed by users of our mobile applications and websites. We determine the cost per impression delivered in each zip code using an auction-based pricing method in consideration of the total amount spent by Premier Agents and Premier Brokers to purchase impressions in the zip code during the month. A Premier Agent’s or Premier Broker’s share of voice in a zip code is determined by their proportional monthly budgeted spend in that zip code as a percentage of the total monthly budgeted spend of all Premier Agents and Premier Brokers in that zip code. The cost per impression that we charge is dynamic - as demand for impressions in a zip code increases or decreases, the cost per impression in that zip code may be increased or decreased accordingly. 
In April 2018, we began testing a new form of lead validation and distribution related to our auction-based pricing model whereby the share of voice purchased by Premier Agents and Premier Brokers represents both the share of impressions delivered as advertisements appearing on pages viewed by users of our mobile applications and websites, as well as the proportion of validated consumer connections a Premier Agent or Premier Broker receives. When consumers who are interested in connecting with a real estate professional do not select a specific Premier Agent or Premier Broker advertisement on one of Zillow Group’s mobile applications or websites, the validated consumer leads will be distributed to Premier Agents and Premier Brokers in proportion to their share of voice. We believe distributing validated consumer connection leads on the basis of share of voice creates better experiences for consumers and further strengthens our partnerships with real estate professionals. We substantially completed the nationwide adoption of this new lead distribution model in the fourth quarter of 2018.
In October 2018, we began testing a new Flex Pricing model for Premier Broker and Premier Agent advertising services in limited markets. With the Flex Pricing model, Premier Brokers and Premier Agents are provided with validated leads at no upfront cost, and they pay a performance advertising fee only when a real estate transaction is closed with one of their leads.
Zillow Group Rentals
 Zillow Group continues to develop its rental marketplace across mobile applications and websites, that serve both consumers and rental professionals. Zillow Group Rentals is the largest rental network on the internet and includes listing distribution across Zillow, Trulia and HotPads, reaching millions of rental shoppers each month. Zillow Group Rentals advertisers gain access to the leading technology and marketing platform that connects rental properties with consumer contacts and, beginning in 2018, to tools to effectively convert contacts into tenants, including through a rental applications product.
Mortgages
We offer two mortgage advertising products – Connect (formerly known as “Long Form”) and Custom Quotes. In Zillow Group’s Connect platform, consumers answer a series of questions to find a local lender, and mortgage professionals receive contacts based on data such as location and customer reviews. In our Custom Quotes mortgage marketing platform, lending institutions display their mortgage rates directly to consumers who are shopping for refinance and purchase rates. In Custom Quotes, consumers request free, personalized quotes in response to their submission of limited anonymous data, such as specific loan amount, zip code, purchase price or estimated home value, and credit score. Consumers decide if and when to contact the mortgage professionals who provide quotes. For the year ended December 31, 2018, there were approximately 25.4 million mortgage loan information requests submitted on Zillow Group platforms by consumers through Connect and Custom Quotes. User-generated ratings and reviews of mortgage professionals are provided as a powerful tool to help consumers shop for their loans. Our Connect and Custom Quote services are operated by our wholly owned subsidiary, Zillow Group Marketplace, Inc. (formerly Zillow Group Mortgages, Inc.), a licensed mortgage broker, pursuant to a support services agreement.
In October 2018, we completed the acquisition of MLOA, a licensed mortgage lender. This acquisition is consistent with our strategy of moving further down funnel and closer to the real estate transaction to create better consumer experiences. Thus, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2018, Zillow’s suite of products now includes mortgage originations. This acquisition will allow Zillow to streamline and shorten the home-buying process for consumers who purchase homes through Zillow Offers.
Zillow Group New Construction
Zillow Group’s new construction marketing platform, Promoted Communities, allows home builders to showcase their available inventory to our millions of in-market home shoppers across the web. Promoted Communities continues to drive discoverability for home builders through dynamic listings of their available lots, plans, spec homes, and community details pages, while our Builder Boost products with Precision Targeting let home builders enhance their community’s presence on Zillow, Trulia and Facebook®. Zillow Group marketing partners also receive exclusive access to robust data and consumer insights to help them make informed marketing decisions.
Zillow Offers
In 2017, we began testing the Zillow Instant Offers marketplace, a way for homeowners to sell their homes quickly by providing them with offers from investors and a comparative market analysis from a local real estate agent as an estimate for what the home might fetch on the open market. Beginning in April 2018, Zillow discontinued the Instant Offers marketplace and launched the Zillow Offers service, which allows homeowners to either sell their home directly to Zillow or have Zillow connect them with a Premier Agent to assist in the sale of their home through a traditional listed transaction. If a homeowner accepts an offer from Zillow Offers, Zillow buys the house, makes certain repairs and updates, and then lists it for sale on the open market. The Zillow Offers service provides sellers with certainty, control, and convenience, allowing them to avoid the many complexities of a traditional residential sale process. As of December 31, 2018, Zillow Offers was buying and selling homes in 5 metropolitan areas across the U.S. 
Information Products and Services
We provide consumers with information products and services to enable them to make intelligent decisions about homes.
Zestimates and Rent Zestimates
Our Zestimate and Rent Zestimate valuations are computed using complex, proprietary algorithms we have developed and refined through years of statistical analysis and technological development.
A Zestimate is our estimated current market value of a home. We generate Zestimates using a variety of information, including:


• | Physical attributes: location, lot size, square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms and many other details.


• | Tax assessments: property tax information, actual property taxes paid, exceptions to tax assessments and other information provided in the tax assessors’ records.


• | Prior and current transactions: actual sale prices over time of the home itself and comparable recent sales of nearby homes.


• | User data: data provided directly by millions of users of our mobile applications and websites.

We use proprietary automated valuation models that apply advanced algorithms to analyze our data to identify relationships within a specific geographic area between home-related data and actual sales prices. We provide current home value estimates, or Zestimates, on approximately 100 million U.S. homes. Home characteristics, such as square footage, location or the number of bathrooms, are given different weights according to their influence on home sale prices in each specific geographic area over a specific period of time, resulting in a set of valuation rules, or models, that are applied to generate each home’s Zestimate.
To improve the accuracy of our Zestimates, our algorithms automatically remove or reconcile data that would otherwise inappropriately skew the valuation rules. In addition, our algorithms will automatically generate a new set of valuation rules based on the constantly changing universe of data included in our database. This allows us to provide timely home value information on a massive scale, updated daily. In 2017, we announced Zillow Prize, a machine learning competition to improve Zestimate accuracy, with a grand prize of up to $1 million to the person or team who submits the most improved Zestimate algorithm model, and in January 2019, we awarded the $1 million prize to the winning team, which beat the Zillow benchmark model by approximately 13%. 
We publicly disclose the accuracy of our Zestimates to further empower consumers in assessing a home’s value. The accuracy may be impacted by a variety of factors, including the amount of data about homes we have for a particular geographic area.
A Rent Zestimate is our estimated current monthly rental price of a home, computed using automated valuation models, similar to our Zestimates, which we have designed to address the unique attributes of a rental home. We estimate rental prices on approximately 100 million homes, including apartments, single-family homes, condominiums and townhomes. Our Rent Zestimates are updated daily.

Consumers and real estate professionals can update property information by, for example, adding home photos and personalized information regarding the neighborhood or school district, creating exclusive home profiles not available anywhere else.
Our map-based user interface enables our users to search, navigate and zoom to areas of interest and find and compare home information quickly and efficiently from a variety of different perspectives across homes, neighborhoods, cities, counties and other geographic regions. Our consumer search experience supports complex search queries and filters across our data set of homes, allowing consumers to customize their searches and gain actionable insights.
Our team of economists and statisticians generates unbiased local and national real estate data and analysis on 933 metropolitan areas and approximately 15,000 individual neighborhoods that we provide to consumers and real estate, rental and mortgage professionals at no cost. This gives our users access to local market trends and data, such as home price cuts, list to sale price ratio and foreclosure data that was historically not easily obtained, if available at all. Users can compare these metrics across neighborhoods and different time periods using our real-time charting and filtering.
For Sale and Rental Listings
We provide comprehensive for sale and rental listings through relationships with real estate brokerages, real estate listings aggregators, multiple listing services, apartment management companies, home builders, and other third parties. In addition, we provide consumers with access to exclusive home listings, such as our Make Me Move listings, which are a homeowner’s posted price at which they would be willing to move. We also show listings that may not be available on other sources, including for sale by owner, pre-market inventory, including our Coming Soon listings, New Construction listings and rental listings as well as listings that are owned by Zillow through the Zillow Offers program and which are available for sale.
Marketplace of Real Estate Agents
We present consumers with ratings and contact information for the listing agent and local buyer’s agents alongside home profiles and listings for homes to assist them in evaluating and selecting the real estate agent best suited for them. We enhance this offering by providing an online professional directory for consumers to search and contact real estate professionals that they might wish to engage. Our directory includes rich profiles of real estate professionals, including more than 3.7 million ratings and reviews provided by our users, allowing consumers to evaluate these agents based on a number of criteria, including neighborhood specialization and number of listings.
Marketplace of Mortgage Professionals
In our mortgages marketplace, consumers can answer a series of questions to find a local lender, and mortgage professionals receive contacts based on data such as location and customer reviews, or consumers can anonymously request free, personalized mortgage quotes from consumer-rated-and-reviewed mortgage professionals. Consumers can then choose to contact those mortgage professionals at their discretion. For the year ended December 31, 2018, there were approximately 25.4 million mortgage loan information requests submitted on Zillow Group platforms by consumers. More than half of consumers who submit a loan information request do so on a mobile device. As of December 31, 2018, we had published approximately 649,000 reviews of mortgage professionals submitted by our consumers.
Mobile Access
We operate one of the most popular suites of mobile real estate applications with more than fifty applications across all major mobile platforms. Our mobile real estate applications provide consumers and real estate, rental and mortgage professionals with location-based access to many of our products and services, including Zestimates, Rent Zestimates, for sale and rental listings and extensive home-related data. Through our mobile applications, for example, a consumer can learn about the home’s for-sale price, Zestimate, number of bedrooms, square footage and past sales, as well as similar information about surrounding homes. The consumer can connect with a real estate professional through our mobile applications to get more information or schedule a showing. For example, on our flagship Zillow brand, during December 2018, nearly 880 million homes were viewed on a mobile device, which equates to 328 homes per second.
Marketing
We believe Zillow Group has considerable opportunity to increase brand awareness and grow traffic through product development, targeted advertising programs and strategic partnerships. As such, we opportunistically advertise to consumers and professionals in various online and offline channels that have tested well for us and pursue strategic partnerships that drive traffic and brand awareness for Zillow Group.
At Zillow Group, marketing begins with effective product development, which then becomes amplified by impactful brand advertising and marketing communications. We create immersive consumer products that people want to use frequently, talk about and share. More recently, we also began creating products that alleviate the stress of activities like selling or buying a home, such as Zillow Offers. The engaging nature of our products enables us to execute compelling advertising campaigns integrated with our robust and viral communications program, which together comprise the primary drivers of our brand awareness and traffic acquisition efforts. 
The communications team for our flagship Zillow brand includes former journalists who have established Zillow Group as an authoritative source for information on a broad range of home and real estate-related subjects. A typical week includes commentary from our real estate experts across dozens of national print and broadcast media outlets, guest opinion pieces or blog posts by our chief economists, and wide-ranging national and local media coverage of Zillow Group products, including Zillow Offers, listings, data and consumer tips. 
In September 2018, we released the third annual Zillow Group Report on Consumer Housing Trends, which highlights our latest consumer research. The report has garnered the attention of media outlets such as the Wall Street Journal, New York Times, Fox Business, Associated Press and Money Magazine and serves to establish Zillow Group as the authority on residential real estate consumers and their needs, aspirations and challenges.
We focus substantial public relations effort around the marketing of our Zillow Real Estate Market Reports, which are in-depth reports produced by our economics and analytics bureau for 909 U.S. markets. Data is released on a monthly and quarterly basis, and the data is widely used by government entities such as the Federal Reserve and Congressional Oversight Panel, as well as regularly featured in respected media outlets such as the Wall Street Journal, New York Times, Bloomberg, Reuters and across numerous national network and cable news shows including CNBC, CNN, Fox News and Bloomberg. We believe the considerable effort we have spent on public relations and social media has allowed us to build large and credible brands.
Our living database of homes creates significant opportunities for home-ownership lifecycle marketing. A typical person will at various times in life be a renter, buyer, homeowner, mortgage refinancer or seller, and this presents opportunities to communicate with consumers over many years before, during and after a transaction. We actively communicate with our users through email and social media channels.
Sales, Consumer Care and Customer Support
Our sales teams are responsible for generating customers across our mobile applications and websites.
Our largest sales teams sell our Premier Agent and Premier Broker products to real estate agents, and are located in Seattle, Washington, Denver, Colorado, Irvine, California, and New York, New York. We also have sales teams in Seattle, Washington, Denver, Colorado, New York, New York, and Irvine, California that sell our rental products to rental professionals. In addition, we have sales teams in Seattle, Washington and Lincoln, Nebraska that support sales in our mortgage marketplaces. We also have sales teams in Seattle, Washington, Denver, Colorado, and San Francisco, California that sell our new construction marketing solutions. We attract customers through a combination of outbound calling and inbound customer requests generated from our websites and event marketing activities. We also maintain field sales teams in San Francisco, California and New York, New York to specifically target larger advertising customers in the real estate and related content categories, such as real estate brokerages, home builders, lenders and home service providers, as well as advertisers in the telecommunications, automotive, insurance and other industries. Beginning in October 2018, as a result of our acquisition of MLOA, we maintain a team of loan origination officers in Overland Park, Kansas that support sales of mortgage originations. 
We believe that consumer care and customer support are important to our success. Our consumer care and customer support teams are located in Seattle, Washington and Denver, Colorado. Our customer support team responds to commercial and technical issues from our advertisers, and our consumer care team responds to consumer issues from our user community. In addition, our Zillow Offers consumer care team works with consumers during the home selling process as the main point of contact for consumers, helping coordinate a transaction between the consumer and the local agent representing Zillow, or providing Premier Agents with listing appointment opportunities. The Zillow Offers consumer care teams are located in Seattle, Washington, Denver, Colorado, Atlanta, Georgia, and Dallas, Texas. 
Technology and Infrastructure
Zillow Group is a data- and technology-driven company. Our technical infrastructure, mobile applications and websites are built to provide consumers and real estate, rental and mortgage professionals with access to rich real estate data and powerful online tools to help them accomplish their home-related goals. Our success depends on our ability to innovate and enhance our products and services, adapt to changes in technology, and support new devices and operating systems.
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred and are recorded in technology and development expenses. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, expenses attributable to research and development for our business totaled $298.1 million, $193.0 million and $170.1 million, respectively. We expect to continue making significant investments in research and development as we explore new ways to deliver greater value to our consumer users and advertiser customers. For 
information about our research and development costs, see Note 2 of the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included within this annual report.
Many of our services are available through real-time web-based application programming interfaces that allow our information to be easily integrated into third-party websites. We provide HTML and JavaScript-based widgets to allow easy integration of Zillow Group information onto other websites, with little custom programming. Our technology platform is built using industry-leading third-party and internally developed software as well as open source technologies. This combination allows for rapid development and release of high-performance software in a cost-effective and scalable manner. Our mobile applications and websites are designed to have high availability, from the internet connectivity providers we choose, to the servers, databases and networking hardware that we deploy. We design our systems so that the failure of any individual component is not expected to affect the overall availability of our platform. We also leverage content delivery networks and use other third-party cloud computing services, including map-related and ad serving services, to ensure fast and local access to content. We employ a host of encryption, antivirus, firewall, monitoring, and patch-management technology to protect and maintain our systems.
To deliver web and mobile Zillow Group brand content while ensuring scalability and redundancy, we utilize both third-party web services for cloud computing and storage and shared data centers in Seattle, Washington and Santa Clara, California.
Intellectual Property
We protect our intellectual property through a combination of trademarks, trade dress, domain names, copyrights, trade secrets and patents, as well as contractual provisions and restrictions on access to our proprietary technology.
Our trademarks registered in the United States and several other jurisdictions include, but are not limited to, “Zillow,” “Trulia,” “Zestimate,” “Premier Agent,” “Make Me Move,” “Mortech,” “Marksman,” “Hotpads,” “StreetEasy,” “dotloop,” “Find Your Way Home,” “Naked Apartments,” “New Home Feed,” the Z in a house logo, the Trulia marker logo, as well as logos that correspond with several of our other trademarks. We also have filed other trademark applications, including an application for “Zillow Offers,” in the United States and certain other jurisdictions and will pursue additional trademark registrations to the extent we believe it will be beneficial and cost-effective.
We are the registered holder of a variety of domestic and international domain names that include, but are not limited to, “Zillowgroup.com,” “Zillow.com,” “Trulia.com,” “RealEstate.com,” “Mortech.com,” “HotPads.com,” “Streeteasy.com,” “DotLoop.com,” “Retsly.com,” “NakedApartments.com,” “BridgeInteractive.com,” “NewHomeFeed.com,” “Mortgagelendersofamerica.com,” and other similar variations. We view the strength of brand awareness and loyalty with respect to both our consumer- and business-facing brands as a key differentiator. As a result, our ability to protect these intellectual property assets is very important to our business.
We have 28 patents of varying lengths issued in the United States and internationally. These patents cover proprietary techniques that relate to determining a current value for a real estate property, performing summarization of geographic data points in response to zoom selection, the incorporation of individual aerial images and incorporating visual information into a master planar image, the collection, storage and display of home attribute values, providing for a multi-faceted search, and other proprietary techniques relevant to our products and services. Our Zestimate home valuation, for example, which we consider to be a significant competitive advantage with respect to consumer engagement, is currently protected by a patent. We have 47 patent applications pending in the United States and internationally, which seek to cover proprietary techniques relevant to our products and services. We intend to pursue additional patent protection to the extent we believe it will be beneficial and cost-effective.
In addition to the protection provided by our intellectual property rights, we enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees, consultants, contractors and business partners. Our employees and contractors are also subject to invention assignment provisions. We further control the use of our proprietary technology and intellectual property through provisions in both our general and product-specific terms of use on our mobile applications and websites.
Competition
We face competition to attract consumers to our mobile applications, websites, and services and to attract advertisers to purchase our advertising products and services.
Competition for Consumers
Our business model depends on our ability to attract consumers to our mobile applications, websites, and services and enhance their engagement with our products and services in a cost-effective manner. New entrants join the categories in which we operate at a rapid pace. Our competitors include companies that provide, or could develop, technology, products and services for real estate, rental, new construction and mortgage professionals and other residential real estate market participants, including operators of mobile applications and websites. We also compete with companies and individuals purchasing and selling homes in the metropolitan areas where we offer our Zillow Offers service and with companies originating mortgage loans in the states in which MLOA is a licensed lender. We compete for consumers primarily on the basis of the quality of the consumer experience, the utility of the data and services we provide, the breadth, depth and accuracy of information, brand awareness and reputation, and the value we offer to home buyers and sellers. We believe we compete favorably on these factors.
Competition for Advertisers
We face intense competition from traditional and online or mobile media sources to attract advertisers. Online and on mobile, we compete with website operators dedicated to providing real estate, rental, new construction, and mortgage information and services to real estate professionals and consumers, local brokerage sites and major internet portals, general search engines, e-commerce, and social media sites, as well as other technology and media companies. We also compete for a share of advertisers’ overall marketing budgets with traditional media such as television, magazines, newspapers and home/apartment guide publications, particularly with respect to advertising dollars spent at the local level by real estate professionals to advertise their qualifications and listings. We compete for advertising revenue based on perceived return on investment and perceived transaction readiness and overall quality of consumer leads, the effectiveness and relevance of our advertising products, pricing structure and our ability to effectively deliver types of ads to targeted demographics. We believe we compete favorably on these factors.
Government Regulation
We operate in an increasingly complex legal and regulatory environment. Our business and the products and services that we offer are affected by a continually expanding and evolving range of local, state, federal, and international laws and regulations. 
Our IMT segment, which includes the provision of advertising services, marketing software, and technology solutions to businesses and professionals primarily associated with the residential real estate, rental and mortgages industries, is subject to a variety of laws and regulations relating to the collection, use, and disclosure of data collected from our users, including those promulgated and enforced by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and certain states, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, which we expect to come into effect on January 1, 2020. Additionally, laws, regulations, and standards covering marketing and advertising activities conducted by telephone, email, mobile devices, and the internet, may be applicable to our business, such as the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, the Telemarketing Sales Rule, the CAN-SPAM Act, and similar state consumer protection laws. 
By providing a medium through which users can post content and communicate with one another, we may also be subject to laws governing intellectual property ownership, obscenity, libel, and privacy, among other issues. In addition, the real estate agents, mortgage professionals, banks, property managers, rental agents and certain of our other customers and advertisers are subject to various state and federal laws and regulations, including, but not limited to those relating to real estate, rentals and mortgages, which may impact their use of our mobile applications and websites. We endeavor to ensure that any content created by Zillow Group is consistent with such laws and regulations by obtaining assurances of compliance from our advertisers and consumers for their activities through, and the content they provide on, our mobile applications and websites. 
Certain of our mortgage marketing products are operated by our wholly owned subsidiary, Zillow Group Marketplace, Inc. (formerly Zillow Group Mortgages, Inc.), a licensed mortgage broker, and in October 2018 we completed the acquisition of MLOA, a licensed mortgage lender, through which we originate residential mortgages. Mortgage products are regulated at the state level by licensing authorities and administrative agencies, with additional oversight from the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (“BCFP”) and other federal agencies. Zillow Group Marketplace, Inc. and MLOA are subject to stringent state and federal laws and regulations and to the scrutiny of state and federal government agencies as a licensed mortgage broker and licensed mortgage lender, respectively, including numerous consumer protection laws. 
As a buyer and seller of residential real estate through our Zillow Offers business, we may be subject to additional local, state and federal laws and regulations governing such transactions, including those administered by the BCFP, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the states and municipalities in which we transact. 
The real estate, mortgages, and rentals industries in which we operate and provide services are subject to significant state, local and federal laws and regulation, and certain of our activities may be deemed to be covered by these industry-specific laws and regulations. Since the laws and regulations governing real estate, rentals and mortgages are constantly evolving and striving to keep pace with innovations in technology and media, it is possible that we may have to materially alter the way we conduct some parts of our business activities or be prohibited from conducting such activities altogether at some point in the future. See “Risk Factors” for a discussion of our regulatory risks.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had 4,336 full-time employees.
