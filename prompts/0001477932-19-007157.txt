Our Corporate History and Background

GridIron BioNutients, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated on July 31, 2014 under the laws of the State of Nevada. From our formation on July 31, 2014 until October 9, 2017, we were engaged in the business of cloud storage services. Sommay Vongsa served as President, Secretary, Treasurer and sole director from July 31, 2014, until his resignation on October 9, 2017. Concurrent with his resignation, Mr. Vongsa appointed Darren Long, as the Company’s new Chief Executive Officer, Secretary, Chairman of the board of directors, and Secretary; Timothy Orr, as the Company’s new President and a director; and Brian Martinho, as the Company’s new Treasurer and a director. Effective February 26, 2018, Darren Long resigned as a member and Chairman of the Board of Directors, and as Chief Executive Officer, of the Company. Effective February 26, 2018, Brian Martinho resigned as a member of the Board of Directors, and as Treasurer, of the Company. Effective, February 27, 2018, Timothy Orr, as the sole member of the Board of Directors, appointed himself as Secretary and Treasurer of the Company. Mr. Orr is also presently the Company’s President.

Effective November 28, 2017, the board of directors and the stockholders of the majority of voting power of the Company approved an amendment to the Company’s Articles of Incorporation to change the name of the Company from “My Cloudz, Inc.” to “GridIron BioNutrients, Inc.” A Certificate of Amendment to the Articles of Incorporation effecting the change of name of the Company was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada effective November 27, 2017. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. recognized the name change effective December 18, 2017. Under Rule 14c-2, promulgated pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the name change became effective February 21, 2018.

From inception until we completed our reverse acquisition of GridIron BioNutrients, our principal business was cloud storage services. 

Reverse Acquisition of GridIron BioNutrients

On October 9, 2017, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the “Share Exchange Agreement”), by and among the Company, GridIron BioNutrients, Inc., then a privately-held Nevada corporation since renamed GridIron Ventures, Inc. (“GridIron Ventures”), and the holders of common stock of GridIron Ventures. The holders of the common stock of GridIron Ventures consisted of 3 stockholders.

Under the terms and conditions of the Share Exchange Agreement, the Company offered, sold and issued 70,000,000 shares of common stock in consideration for all the issued and outstanding shares in GridIron Ventures. The effect of the issuance was that GridIron Ventures shareholders held approximately 57.0% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the Company, giving effect the Share Exchange Agreement.

Darren Long, the founder of GridIron Ventures, became the Company’s new Chief Executive Officer, Chairman of the board of directors, and Secretary, was then the holder of 35,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company. Timothy Orr, became the Company’s new President, a director of the Company, and the holder of 17,500,000 shares of common stock of the Company. Brian Martinho, became the Company’s new Treasurer, a director, and the holder of 17,500,000 shares of common stock of the Company. The Company’s new officers and sole director, therefore, control an aggregate of 70,000,000, or 57.0%, of the outstanding common stock of the Company, on a fully diluted basis, giving effect to the Share Exchange Agreement.

As a result of the Share Exchange Agreement, GridIron Ventures became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.

The share exchange transaction with GridIron Ventures was treated as a reverse acquisition, with GridIron Ventures as the acquiror and the Company as the acquired party. Unless the context suggests otherwise, when we refer in this Form 10-K to business and financial information for periods prior to the consummation of the reverse acquisition, we are referring to the business and financial information of GridIron Ventures.

Distribution of Products

Gridiron’s products are currently available for sale on its website http://gridironbionutrients.com. The Company intends to retain a consultant(s) to provide avenues to distribution its products within the next twelve months. However, in order to retain any consultant(s) the Company will require funding and currently the Company does not have the required funding to accomplish this task. If the Company is unable to secure financing; it would likely result in a material loss of any investment made into the Company.
Competition

Competition within the cannabidiol (CBD) industry is intense with many well-established companies within the market and numerous start-up companies entering the market. Gridiron intends to brand and market high quality CBD products through both exclusive and non-exclusive strategic alliances that will serve to make the Company a market leader.

In addition to the products described herein the Company intends to add an additional CBD water beverage to its product line within the next 4-5 months. The Company can provide no assurance or guarantee that it will be able to develop and/or maintain any strategic alliances now or in the future or that its anticipated new CBD beverage will be accepted by the market if and when developed. If the Company cannot develop and maintain strategic alliances or be successful with the offer of its CBD products and proposed CBD products it would be a significant material negative impact on the business that could result in a significant loss to any investment made into the Company.

Sources of Raw Materials

Gridiron MVP™ product(s) contain proprietary blend of nutrients that are sourced from various third parties and formulated into the water beverage and concentrate. If for any reason any of these sources are disrupted and the Company is unable to obtain the raw materials necessary to formulate the Gridiron MVP™ product(s) it would materially impact the business that may result in significant losses. Moreover, the Company will be dependent upon third party bottling facilities for its Gridiron MVP™ product; currently the Company has no arrangements or otherwise with any bottling facility and cannot provide any assurance that a suitable bottling facility can be retained or maintained in the future.

The Company currently has a Distribution place for the Gridiron Salve, Gridiron Premium Hemp Oil Drops (1oz /2oz) and Gridiron Premium Hemp Oil Capsules. If there is a disruption with the manufacturer of these products for any reason with the Company, it could result in significant delays and/or the inability to deliver the products to customers which would negatively impact the Company’s business.

Strategic Partners

The Company intends to develop both exclusive and non-exclusive strategic alliances that promote the Company’s products.

Government Regulation and Approvals

We are not aware of any governmental regulations or approvals needed for any of our products. We do not believe that we are subject to any government regulations relating to the ownership and licensing of our intellectual property.
Cannabis Regulation

Although a number of states of the United States have legalized medical marijuana, recreational marijuana, or both, it remains illegal under United States federal law. Cannabis currently remains a Schedule I drug under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970. Under United States federal law, a Schedule I drug or substance has a high potential for abuse, no accepted medical use in the United States, and a lack of accepted safety for the use of the drug under medical supervision. As such, cannabis related practices or activities, including without limitation, the manufacture, importation, possession, use, or distribution of cannabis, remain illegal under United States federal law.

Although federally illegal, the U.S. federal government’s approach to enforcement of such laws has of least until recently trended toward non-enforcement. On August 29, 2013, the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) issued a memorandum known as the “Cole Memorandum” to all U.S. Attorneys’ offices (federal prosecutors). The Cole Memorandum generally directed U.S. Attorneys not to prioritize the enforcement of federal cannabis laws against individuals and businesses that rigorously comply with state regulatory provisions in states with strictly regulated medical or recreational cannabis programs. While not legally binding, and merely prosecutorial guidance, the Cole Memorandum laid a framework for managing the tension between state and federal laws concerning state regulated cannabis businesses.

However, on January 4, 2018 the Cole Memorandum was revoked by Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a long-time opponent of state-regulated medical and recreational cannabis. While this did not create a change in federal law, as the Cole Memorandum was not itself law, the revocation removed the DOJ’s guidance to U.S. Attorneys that state regulated cannabis industries substantively in compliance with the Cole Memorandum’s guidelines should not be a prosecutorial priority. In addition to his revocation of the Cole Memorandum, Attorney General Sessions also issued a one-page memorandum known as the “Sessions Memorandum”. The Sessions Memorandum confirmed the rescission of the Cole Memorandum and explained the rationale of the DOJ in doing so: the Cole Memorandum, according to the Sessions Memorandum, was “unnecessary” due to existing general enforcement guidance adopted in the 1980s, as set forth in the U.S. Attorney’s Manual (the “USAM”). The USAM enforcement priorities, like those of the Cole Memorandum, are also based on the federal government’s limited resources, and include “law enforcement priorities set by the Attorney General,” the “seriousness” of the alleged crimes, the “deterrent effect of criminal prosecution,” and “the cumulative impact of particular crimes on the community.”

While the Sessions Memorandum emphasizes that cannabis is a Schedule I controlled substance, and reiterates the statutory view that cannabis is a “dangerous drug and that marijuana activity is a serious crime,” it does not otherwise indicate that the prosecution of cannabis-related offenses is now a DOJ priority. Furthermore, the Sessions Memorandum explicitly describes itself as a guide to prosecutorial discretion. Such discretion is firmly in the hands of U.S. Attorneys in deciding whether or not to prosecute cannabis-related offenses. Our outside U.S. counsel continuously monitors all U.S. Attorney comments related to regulated medical and adult-use cannabis laws to assess various risks and enforcement priorities within each jurisdiction. Dozens of U.S. Attorneys across the country have affirmed that their view of federal enforcement priorities has not changed, although a few have displayed greater ambivalence. 

On January 15, 2019, U.S. Attorney General nominee William P. Barr intimated a markedly different approach to cannabis regulation than his predecessor during his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Mr. Barr stated that his approach to cannabis regulation would be not to upset settled expectations that have arisen as a result of the Cole Memorandum, that it would be inappropriate to upset the current situation as there has been reliance on the Cole Memorandum and that he would not be targeting companies that have relied on the Cole Memorandum and are complying with state laws with respect to the distribution and production of cannabis. While he did not offer support for cannabis legalization, Mr. Barr did emphasize the need for the U.S. Congress to clarify federal laws to address the untenable current situation which has resulted in a backdoor nullification of federal law.

Additionally, under U.S. federal law it may, under certain circumstances, be a violation of federal money laundering statutes for financial institutions to accept any proceeds from cannabis sales or any other Schedule I controlled substances. Banks and other financial institutions could be prosecuted and possibly convicted of money laundering for providing services to U.S. cannabis businesses. Under U.S. federal law, banks or other financial institutions that provide a cannabis business with a checking account, debit or credit card, small business loan or any other service could be found guilty of money laundering or conspiracy. Despite these laws, in February 2014, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FCEN”) of the Treasury Department issued a memorandum (the “FCEN Memorandum”) providing instructions to banks seeking to provide services to cannabis-related businesses. The FCEN Memorandum states that in some circumstances, it is permissible for banks to provide services to cannabis-related businesses without risking prosecution for violation of federal money laundering laws. It refers to supplementary guidance that Deputy Attorney General Cole issued to federal prosecutors relating to the prosecution of money laundering offenses predicated on cannabis-related violations of the CSA. It is unclear at this time whether the current administration will follow the guidelines of the FCEN Memorandum.

Although we do not produces, handle or sell cannabis, and the possession, cultivation and distribution of marijuana for medical use is permitted in Nevada, and medical and recreational use is permitted in the State of Washington, where our administrative offices are located, provided compliance with applicable state and local laws, rules, and regulations, marijuana is illegal under federal law. We believe we operate our business in compliance with applicable Nevada and Washington law and regulations. Any changes in federal, state or local law enforcement regarding marijuana may affect our ability to operate our business. Strict enforcement of federal law regarding marijuana would likely result in the inability to proceed with our business plans, could expose us to potential criminal liability and could subject our properties to civil forfeiture. Any changes in banking, insurance or other business services may also affect our ability to operate our business.
