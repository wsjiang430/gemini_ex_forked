Xcel Brands, Inc. is a media and consumer products company engaged in the design, production, marketing, and direct-to-consumer sales of branded apparel, footwear, accessories, jewelry, home goods and other consumer products, and the acquisition of dynamic consumer lifestyle brands.

Our vision is intended to reimagine shopping, entertainment, and social media as one.

Our strong relationships with leading retailers and interactive television companies and cable network TV enable us to reach consumers in over 400 million homes worldwide and hundreds of millions of social media followers.
Our objective is to build a diversified portfolio of lifestyle consumer brands through organic growth and the strategic acquisition of new brands. To grow our brands, we are focused on the following primary strategies:

• | licensing our brands for distribution through interactive television (i.e. QVC, The Shopping Channel) whereby we design, manage production, merchandise the shows, and manage the on-air talent;


• | licensing our brands to manufacturers and retailers for promotion and distribution through e-commerce, social commerce, and traditional brick-and-mortar retail channels whereby we provide certain design services and, in certain cases, manage supply and merchandising;


• | distribution of our brands to retailers that sell to the end consumer (wholesale);


• | distribution of our brands through our e-commerce site directly to the end consumer;

3


• | entering into strategic supply agreements directly with overseas factories for distribution to our retail partners and through our own direct-to-consumer e-commerce sites; and

We believe that Xcel offers a unique value proposition to our retail and direct-to-consumer customers, and our licensees for the following reasons:

• | our management team, including our officers’ and directors’ experience in, and relationships within the industry;


• | our Fast-to-Market supply chain and integrated technology platform that enables us to design and distribute trend-right product; and


• | our significant media and internet presence and distribution

Our Fast-to-Market platform was developed to shorten the supply chain cycle by utilizing state of the art supply chain management technology, trend analytics and data science to actively monitor fashion trends and read and react to customer demands. 
Recent Highlights
In December 2017, we launched our Judith Ripka Fine Jewelry e-commerce operations, in January 2018 we launched our Judith Ripka Fine Jewelry wholesale operations, and in November 2018, we launched our apparel wholesale operations.
In February 2019, we acquired the Halston Heritage Brands. The acquisition of the Halston Heritage Brands gives us an opportunity to focus on the entirety of the Halston Brand, the various labels, and their design nuances while continuing to preserve the iconic American brand’s legacy. 
Company History and Corporate Information
The Company was incorporated on August 31, 1989 in the State of Delaware under the name Houston Operating Company. On April 19, 2005, we changed our name to NetFabric Holdings, Inc. On September 29, 2011, Xcel Brands, Inc., a privately-held Delaware corporation (which we refer to as Old Xcel), Netfabric Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and certain stockholders of the Company entered into an agreement of merger and plan of reorganization pursuant to which Netfabric Acquisition Corp. was merged with and into Old Xcel, with Old Xcel surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. On September 29, 2011, we changed our name to Xcel Brands, Inc.
Our principal office is located at 1333 Broadway, New York, NY 10018. Our telephone number is (347) 727-2474. Additionally, we maintain websites for our respective brands and an e-commerce site for our Judith Ripka brand at www.isaacmizrahi.com, www.judithripka.com, and www.cwonder.com. Our corporate website is www.xcelbrands.com.
Our Brand Portfolio
Currently, our brand portfolio consists of the Isaac Mizrahi Brand, the Judith Ripka Brand, the H Halston Brand, the Halston Heritage Brand and the C Wonder Brand, and the various labels under these brands.
Isaac Mizrahi
Isaac Mizrahi is an iconic American brand that stands for timeless, cosmopolitan style. Isaac Mizrahi, the designer, launched his eponymous label in 1987 to critical acclaim, including four Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) awards. Since then, this brand has become known and beloved around the world for its colorful and stylish designs. As a true lifestyle brand, under Xcel’s ownership it has expanded into over 150 different product categories including sportswear, footwear, handbags, watches, eyewear, tech accessories, home, and other merchandise. Under our ubiquitous-channel retail sales strategy, the brand is available across various distribution channels to reach customers wherever they shop: better department stores, such as Lord & Taylor and Hudson’s Bay; interactive television, including QVC and The Shopping Channel; and national specialty retailers. The brand is also sold in various global locations, including Canada, and the United Kingdom. We acquired the IsaacMizrahi brand in September 2011. 
Judith Ripka
Judith Ripka is a luxury jewelry brand founded by Judith Ripka in 1977. This brand has become known worldwide for its distinctive designs featuring intricate metalwork, vibrant colors, and distinctive use of texture. The Judith Ripka Fine Jewelry collection consists of pieces in 18 karat gold and sterling silver with precious colored jewels and diamonds, and is currently available in fine jewelry stores, luxury retailers, and via e-commerce. A line of luxury watches was introduced in 2015. As Chief Designer, Ms. Ripka also launched an innovative collection of fine jewelry on QVC under the Judith Ripka Brand in 1996, where she offers 
4

customers fine jewelry, watches, and accessories at more accessible price points, including precious and semi-precious stones and multi-faceted diamonique stones made exclusively for the brand. In December 2017, we launched our Judith Ripka Fine Jewelry e-commerce operations and in January 2018, we launched the Judith Ripka Fine Jewelry wholesale operations.
Halston 
Since our acquisition of the Halston Heritage Brands on February 11, 2019, we own all Halston labels under our brands. The Halston brand was founded by Roy Halston Frowick in the 1960s, and quickly became one of the most important American fashion brands in the world, becoming synonymous with glamour, sophistication, and femininity. Halston’s groundbreaking designs and visionary style still influence designers around the world today. We acquired the H Halston brands in December 2014 from HIP. We launched the H by Halston brand on QVC in September 2015, which is available exclusively through interactive television channels. In April 2016 we launched the H Halston brand lifestyle collection certain better department stores. Halston Heritage is distributed in premium retailers. 
C Wonder
The C Wonder brand was founded by J. Christopher Burch in 2011 to offer a wide-ranging assortment of beautiful, versatile, and spirited products that are designed to transport its customers to a place they have never been. C Wonder offers women’s clothing, footwear, jewelry and accessories, and delightful surprises at every turn. We acquired the C Wonder Brand in July 2015, and launched the brand on QVC in March 2016. During the first quarter of 2017, we reached an agreement with QVC to enable us to transition the brand to a broader base of retailers, including department stores.
Growth Strategy
Our vision is intended to reimagine shopping, entertainment, and social media as one. To fulfill this vision, we plan to continue to grow the reach of our brand portfolio by leveraging our own internal design, production, integrated technology platforms and marketing expertise, and our relationships with our retail and direct-to-consumer customers, key licensees, manufacturers and retailers. We also continue to market our brands through our innovative ubiquitous-channel retail sales strategy. Our strategy includes distribution through interactive television, e-commerce, and traditional brick-and-mortar retail channels. By leveraging the reach and consumer engagement of our media partners, and by developing rich online video and social media content under our brands, our strategy is to drive increased customer engagement and generate sales across our channels of distribution. Key elements of our strategy include:

• | Expand and Leverage Fast-to-Market Production Platform. In 2015, we developed a Fast-to-Market production platform designed to deliver short lead production capabilities to our retail customers, helping drive traffic and enable retailers to respond quickly to customer demand - a read-and-react model. Our Fast-to-Market production platform shortens the supply chain cycle by utilizing state of the art product lifecycle management systems (“PLM”), proprietary merchandising strategies, 3D design, trend analytics, data science and consumer insight testing to actively monitor fashion trends, while leveraging our experience and know-how to quickly design, test, market, produce, and source high-quality goods. We launched womens’ sportswear collections under several of our brands in the department store channel through our Fast-to-Market production platform in 2016 and 2017 through a license, and in November 2018 we transitioned the license to a wholesale business model. Given some of the challenges facing the department store industry today, including declining customer traffic, aggressive mark-down cadence, and inability to respond quickly to customer demands, we developed this Fast-to-Market production platform to address these challenges and deliver a 360-degree solution to our retail partners, including design, marketing, production, and sourcing services. We intend to leverage the platform across additional brands and retailers, and believe that it provides us with a value-added service that differentiates us from our competitors and competing brands. 


• | Continue to Develop our Integrated Technologies Platform. We are developing and investing in integrated technologies including PLM and ERP systems, 3D design, trend analytics, data science, and consumer insight testing as a refinement of our Fast-to-Market production platform in order to design and plan our apparel collections more efficiently and intelligently. Driven by short-lead marketing, such as social media and new direct-to-consumer business models, consumers now expect more from apparel brands and retailers, and we believe that the solution is to deliver to the customer what they want, when they want it, at a price that they can confirm is fair. Advances in 3D design technologies and software allow us to design more efficiently, seamlessly communicate technical aspects of designs with our manufacturing partners, and produce better fitting, more consistent products. Additionally, photo-realistic images generated by the current generation of 3D design software can be used to perform consumer insight testing on products, to determine demand and plan quantities for production even before a sample is made. Trend analytics including advanced algorithms focused on internet searches, social media, and inventory trends provide a forward-looking view of consumer design preferences and allow us to design into trends early-on, while data analytics will allow us to review performance and respond quickly in our read-and-react Fast-to-Market model. We will also seek to utilize machine learning and artificial intelligence to automate at least a portion of these functions.

5

We believe that our investment into these technologies position us to provide unique and advanced solutions to retailers in the current and rapidly changing environment. Importantly, we believe that it will help us continue to grow our business across our brands and in private label production, and the integrated technologies platform itself should develop more significant value as we continue to build and develop it.

• | Expand Other Retail Partnerships. We have entered into promotional collaborations and/or marketing agreements with large global companies such as Hewlett Packard, Revlon, Johnson & Johnson, and Kleenex, and have developed exclusive programs through certain licensees for specialty retailers such as Best Buy and Bed Bath & Beyond. We plan to continue to develop strategic relationships under our brands that can leverage our media reach through interactive television and social media to drive traffic and sales for our brands and retail partners and enhance the visibility of our brands.


• | Expand Wholesale License Relationships. We have entered into numerous license agreements for various product categories under our brands. With the launch of our Fast-to-Market production platform in 2016, we have expanded the presence of our brands at department stores and subsequently launched additional categories in the department store channel, including footwear, handbags, dresses, costume jewelry, and sunglasses. We continue to seek opportunities to expand the businesses of our licensees, as well as entering into licenses for new categories under each of our brands where the category is authentic to the brand, for both our existing brands as well as brands that we may acquire and/or develop in the future. 


• | Expand Internationally. In 2015, we expanded the Mizrahi Brand into Italy and France successfully on QVC and launched the H by Halston brand on QVC in the United Kingdom. In 2016, we expanded the Mizrahi Brand into the United Kingdom and the H by Halston brand into Italy and France on QVC. Halston Heritage is distributed through brick-and-mortar retail in Mexico and Canada. We plan to continue to expand our brands internationally and to license to certain international licensing partners the right to distribute products under our brands through department stores and other retailers in such international markets.


• | Deliver Quality Product Offerings. We employ a professional team to provide best in class design, production and distribution to ensure that our products adhere to stringent quality standards and design specifications that we have developed. We intend to continue to invest in our design and marketing capabilities in order to differentiate our services to our customers and licensees and our brands in the marketplace. 


• | Acquire, Develop or Partner with Brands. We plan to continue to pursue the acquisition and/or development of additional brands or the rights to brands which we believe are synergistic and complementary to our overall strategy. Our brand acquisition and development strategy are focused on dynamic brands that we believe:


• | are synergistic to our existing portfolio of brands;


• | are strategic to our growth in a channel of distribution; and


• | are expected to be accretive to our earnings.

Licensing Design, Production and Marketing
Interactive TV
QVC is an important strategic partner in our interactive television business and is our largest licensee for each of our Mizrahi, Ripka and Halston brands. QVC’s business model is to promote and sell products through its interactive television programs and related e-commerce and mobile platforms. We employ and manage on-air spokespersons under each of these brands in order to promote products under our brands on QVC. According to QVC, QVC (including HSN) had global revenues of approximately $11.3 billion in 2018, of which e-commerce sales represented approximately $5.8 billion, and QVC’s programming currently reaches approximately 360 million homes worldwide. QVC was ranked as the number three mobile retailer in the U.S. according to the 2017 Internet Retailer Mobile 500, and as number four among multi-category retailers in North America, according to the 2016 Internet Retailer Top 500. Our agreements with QVC allow our on-air spokespersons to promote our non-QVC product lines and strategic partnerships under the Mizrahi, Ripka, and Halston Brands through QVC’s programs, subject to certain parameters including the payment of a portion of our non-QVC revenues to QVC. We believe that our ability to continue to leverage QVC’s media platform, reach, and attractive customer base to cross-promote products in and drive traffic to our other channels of distribution provides us a unique advantage.
In addition to full design services and marketing support, we also provide production to QVC. This business model allows us to focus on our core competencies of design, production, marketing, and brand management without much of the risk and investment requirements in inventory associated with traditional consumer product companies. The Mizrahi Brand is licensed through our wholly owned subsidiary, IM Brands, LLC (“IM Brands”), the Ripka Brand is licensed through our wholly owned subsidiary, JR Licensing, LLC (“JR Licensing”) and the Halston Brand is licensed through our wholly owned subsidiaries, H Licensing, LLC (“H Licensing”) and H Heritage Licensing, LLC ("H Heritage Licensing"),
QVC Agreements
Through our wholly owned subsidiaries, we have entered into direct-to-retail license agreements with QVC, pursuant to which we design, and QVC sources and sells, various products under our IsaacMizrahiLIVE brand, the Judith Ripka brands, the H by 
6

Halston brand, and the C Wonder brand. These agreements include, respectively, the QVC Agreement for the Mizrahi Brand (the "IM QVC Agreement"), the QVC Agreement for the Ripka Brand (the "Ripka QVC Agreement"), and the QVC Agreement for the H Halston Brand (the H Halston QVC Agreement"), (collectively, the “QVC Agreements”). QVC owns the rights to all designs produced under the QVC Agreements, and the QVC Agreements include the sale of products across various categories through QVC’s television media and related internet sites.
Pursuant to these agreements, we have granted to QVC and its affiliates the exclusive, worldwide right to promote our branded products, and the right to use and publish the related trademarks, service marks, copyrights, designs, logos, and other intellectual property rights owned, used, licensed and/or developed by us, for varying terms as set forth below. The Agreements include automatic renewal periods as detailed below unless terminated by either party.

Agreement | Current Term Expiry | Automatic Renewal | Xcel Commenced Brand with QVC | QVC Product Launch
IM QVC Agreement | September 30, 2020 | one-year period | September 2011 | 2010 
Ripka QVC Agreement | March 31, 2020 | one-year period | April 2014 | 1999 
H QVC Agreement | December 31, 2020 | one-year period | January 2015 | September 2015 

In connection with the foregoing and during the same periods, QVC and its subsidiaries have the exclusive, worldwide right to use the names, likenesses, images, voices, and performances of our spokespersons to promote the respective products. Under the IM QVC Agreement, IM Brands has also granted to QVC and its affiliates, during the same period, exclusive, worldwide rights to promote third party vendor co-branded products that, in addition to bearing and being marketed in connection with the trademarks and logos of such third-party vendors, also bear or are marketed in connection with the IsaacMizrahiLIVE trademark and related logo.
Under the QVC Agreements, QVC is obligated to make payments to us on a quarterly basis, based upon the net retail sales of the specified branded products. Net retail sales are defined as the aggregate amount of all revenue generated through the sale of the specified branded products by QVC and its subsidiaries under the QVC Agreements, excluding freight, shipping and handling charges, customer returns, and sales, use, or other taxes.
Notwithstanding our grant of worldwide promotion rights to QVC, we may, with the permission of QVC, sell the respective branded products (i) to better or prestige retailers, but excluding discount divisions of such companies and mass merchants, (ii) via specifically branded brick-and-mortar retail stores, and (iii) via company websites, in exchange for making reverse royalty payments to QVC based on the net retail sales of such products through such channels.
Also, under the QVC Agreements, we will pay a royalty participation fee to QVC on revenue earned from the sale, license, consignment, or any other form of distribution of any products, bearing, marketed in connection with or otherwise associated with the specified trademarks and brands.
Under the QVC Agreements, we are restricted from selling products under the specified respective brands or trademarks (including the trademarks, copyrights, designs, logos, and related intellectual property themselves) to mass merchants. The QVC Agreements generally prohibit us from selling products under the specified respective brands or any of our other trademarks and brands to a direct competitor of QVC (generally defined as any entity other than QVC whose primary means of deriving revenue is the transmission of interactive television programs). In addition, during the terms of the IM QVC Agreement, and the Ripka QVC Agreement, and for one year thereafter, the respective subsidiary may not, without QVC’s consent, promote, advertise, endorse or sell (i) the specified branded products through any means or (ii) any products through interactive television. During the term of the H QVC Agreement, and for one year thereafter, H Licensing may not, without QVC’s consent, promote, advertise, endorse or sell any products, including the H by Halston Brands, through interactive television.
In addition to the foregoing, certain of the QVC Agreements permit us to promote brick-and-mortar collections on QVC’s television program subject to certain terms and restrictions.
While sales under the QVC Agreements have been generated primarily in the United States, we are in the process of expanding internationally. We commenced sales of our IsaacMizrahiLIVE brand through QVC in the United Kingdom in May 2014 and launched the brand through QVC in Italy in August 2015, France in September 2015, and Germany in November 2015. We began selling the Ripka Brand through QVC in Japan in May 2015. The H by Halston brand was launched on QVC in the United Kingdom 
7

in November 2015, Italy in August 2016, France in September 2016, and Germany in October 2016. We plan to continue to expand our brands internationally through QVC where QVC has or develops an international presence.
In addition, the Company also received fees from QVC related to the management and design of the LCNY brand pursuant to an agreement with Kate Spade Company (“KSC”), formerly Fifth & Pacific Companies, Inc. and formerly Liz Claiborne, Inc. (the “LCNY Agreement”). The LCNY Agreement expired July 31, 2016.
For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, net revenue from the QVC Agreements collectively accounted for 72% and 81%, respectively, of the total revenues of the Company.
H Halston Licensing Agreement
On December 22, 2014, H Licensing and HIP, entered into a trademark license agreement (the “HIP License Agreement”), whereby H Licensing granted to HIP a non-assignable exclusive sublicense to use the H Halston trademark in association with the manufacture, distribution, promotion, advertising, and sale of products bearing the H Halston trademark and any related services thereto in all channels of distribution, excluding interactive television and its related e-commerce and digital distribution, and excluding certain mass retailers. HIP was required to pay royalties to H Licensing during the term, with a minimum guaranteed royalty of $600,000 per year during the initial term for 2016 through 2024 and $1,200,000 for any year thereafter. Benjamin Malka, a director of our Company, is the chief executive officer and a 25% equity holder of House of Halston, LLC, the parent company of HIP.
On September 1, 2015, we entered into a license agreement with Lord & Taylor, LLC (the “L&T License”) and simultaneously amended the HIP License Agreement eliminating HIP’s minimum guaranteed royalty obligations, provided the L&T License is in effect. In addition, we entered into a sublicense agreement with HIP (the “HIP Sublicense Agreement”), obligating us to pay HIP on an annual basis the greater of (i) 50% of royalties received under the L&T License from H Halston products or (ii) guaranteed minimum royalties. Provided that Lord & Taylor is paying us at least $1,000,000 per quarter under the L&T License, the remaining contractually guaranteed minimum royalties are equal to $0.75 million, $0.75 million, $1.5 million, and $1.75 million for the twelve months ending January 31, 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021, respectively.
On December 12, 2016, we entered into another license agreement for the H Halston brand with Dillard’s Inc. and affiliates (the “Dillard’s License”, and together with the L&T License, the “DRT Licenses”).
Through October 26, 2018, the Company and Halston Operating Company, LLC ("HOC"), a subsidiary of House of Halston ("HOH"), operated under an at-will license on the terms set forth below in lieu of the terms of the HIP License agreement and HIP sublicense agreement:

• | The HIP Trademark Usage and Royalty Participation Agreement, had an initial term that expired on December 31, 2020 unless sooner terminated or renewed, and required that we pay to HIP: (i) 50% of the excess H Halston Royalty paid to us under the DRT Licenses and any other third party licenses that we may enter into; (ii) 25% of the excess developed brand royalty paid to us for the Highline Collective Brand under the DRT Licenses, and 20% of the excess developed brand royalty paid to us for any subsequent developed brand under the DRT Licenses, and (iii) 10% of the excess private label brand royalty paid to us under the DRT Licenses and during the first term only of the DRT Licenses. Additionally, we have the right, but not the obligation, at any time after January 31, 2023, to terminate the obligations under points (ii) and (iii) above by paying to HIP an amount equal to four times the sum of the developed brand credits and private label credits for the contract year ending on January 31, 2023 (the "Buy Out Payment''). The Buy-Out Payment was payable by us and at our sole discretion either (a) in cash, or (b) in a number of common shares of Xcel calculated based on the amount of the Buy-Out Payment divided by the average closing price for common shares of Xcel on a national exchange for the preceding five trading days, subject to a minimum price for common shares of Xcel of $7.00 per common share.


• | A license and supply agreement with the Halston Operating Company, LLC (“HOC”), a subsidiary of HOH, with an initial term ending on January 31, 2022, subject to renewal. Under the HOC at-will license and supply agreement, HOC shall provide licensed products for sale to pre-approved retailers, including Hudson Bay Company ("HBC") and Dillard’s, and shall also be responsible for overseeing the visual merchandising and in-store retail environments for such approved retailers, and was responsible for training and oversight of any retail staff responsible for selling the licensed products within HBC and Dillard’s, as reasonably agreed upon between HOC and HBC and Dillard’s. The HOC at-will license and supply agreement provided for, among other things, design fees of $1.2 million for the period from July 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017, subsequent design fees of $2.4 million for the contractual yearly periods ending on January 31, 2019, and on December 31, 2020, 2021, and 2022, respectively, and sales-based royalties on the categories of products licensed under the agreement and the contractual year of payment.

Effective October 26, 2018, we terminated the HIP License Agreement and the HIP Sublicense Agreement. In addition, the at-will license was terminated and is no longer in effect.

Other Licensing Agreements
We have entered into numerous other licensing agreements for sales and distribution through e-commerce and traditional brick-and-mortar retailers. Authorized distribution channels include department stores such as Lord & Taylor, Macy’s, Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom’s, and Saks Fifth Avenue, off-price retailers such as Neiman’s Last Call, Nordstrom Rack, Saks Off Fifth, and TJX (including TJ Maxx, Marshall’s and Home Goods), and national specialty retailers such as Best Buy and Bed Bath & Beyond. Under our other licenses, a supplier is granted rights, typically on an exclusive basis, to a single or small group of related product categories for sale to multiple accounts within an approved channel of distribution and territory. Our other license agreements typically provide the licensee with the exclusive rights for a certain product category in a specified territory and/or distribution channel under a specific brand or brands. Our other license agreements cover various categories, including but not limited to women’s apparel, footwear, and accessories; bath and body; jewelry; home products; men’s apparel and accessories; children’s and infant apparel, footwear, and accessories; and electronics cases and accessories. The terms of the agreements generally range from three to six years with renewal options.
We are in discussions with other potential licensees and strategic partners to license and/or co-brand the Mizrahi brand, Ripka brand, Halston brand, and C Wonder brand for additional categories. In certain cases, we have engaged licensing agents to assist in the procurement of such licenses for which we or our licensees pay such agents’ fees based upon a percentage of the net sales of licensed products by such licensees, or a percentage of the royalty payments that we receive from such licensees. While many of the new and proposed licensing agreements will likely require us to provide seasonal design services, most of our new and prospective licensing partners have their own design staff, and we therefore expect low incremental overhead costs related to expanding our licensing business. We will endeavor, where possible, to require licensees to provide guaranteed minimum royalties under their license agreements.
Our licensees currently sell our branded licensed products through brick-and-mortar retailers, e-commerce, and in certain cases supply products to interactive television companies for sale through their television programs and/or through their internet websites. We generally recognize revenues from our other licenses based on a percentage of the sales of products under our brands, but excluding (i) sales of products to interactive television networks, where we receive a retail royalty directly from the interactive television licensee, and (ii) sales of products to e-commerce sites operated by us. Additionally, based upon guaranteed minimum royalty provisions required under many of the license agreements, we are able to recognize revenue related to certain other licenses based on the greater of the sales-based royalty or the guaranteed minimum royalty.
Wholesale and e-Commerce
In December 2017, we launched our Judith Ripka Fine Jewelry e-commerce business and in January 2018 we launched Judith Ripka Fine Jewelry wholesale operations. In November 2018 we launched our apparel wholesale business. Our strategy is to complement our interactive television and licensing business with a wholesale and direct-to-consumer business model by leveraging our design, merchandising, sourcing and production capabilities. Our goal is to grow our brands organically in multiple distribution channels and provide a platform that could enable us to acquire brands or develop private label brands for our retail partners. 
Design and Promotional Services
We provide design and other services to certain of our licensees and, in some cases, for private label programs for certain of our retail partners. In particular, we provide all design services to QVC for products sold under the IM QVC Agreement, Ripka QVC Agreement and H QVC Agreement. This includes seasonal design guidance, product development and merchandising, product design and sample review and approvals through our in-house design organization. Additionally, the Company provides limited design services under wholesale licenses which may include seasonal design guidance (such as style guides) and/or print and pattern development, for which certain of our licensees pay us fixed fees for such services as determined in their agreements. In general, the design of products under our wholesale licenses is expected to be completed by the licensees at our direction.
In certain cases, the Company provides promotional services and collaborations with other brands or companies, which may include the use of our brands for the promotion of such company or brands through the internet, television, or other digital content, print media or other marketing campaigns featuring, in-person appearances by our celebrity spokespersons, the development of limited collections of products (which may include co-branded products) for such company, or other services as determined on a case-by-case basis. These include promotions with Hewlett Packard, Revlon, Johnson & Johnson, and Kleenex.
We also provide certain technology services to our retail partners and certain of our licensees under our proprietary integrated technology platform.
Marketing
9

Marketing is a critical element to maximize brand value to our licensees and our Company. Therefore, we provide social media marketing and other marketing and public relations support for our brands.
Given our ubiquitous-channel retail sales strategy focusing on the sale of branded products through various distribution channels (including e-commerce, interactive television, and traditional brick-and-mortar sales channels), our marketing efforts currently focus on PR and fashion editorial, social media campaigns, personal appearances, and digital content in order to drive retail sales of product and consumer awareness across our various sales distribution channels. We seek to create the intersection where shopping, entertainment, and social meet. As such, our marketing is currently conducted primarily through social media, blogs, videos, images, and other digital content that are all updated regularly. Our efforts also include promoting namesakes of our brands and our personalities through various media including television (such as Project Runway All-Stars), design for performances, and other events. We also work with our retail partners to leverage their marketing resources, including e-commerce platforms and related digital marketing campaigns, social media platforms, direct mail pieces, and public relations efforts.
Our agreements with QVC allow our brand spokespersons to promote our non-QVC product lines and strategic partnerships under our brands through QVC’s programs, subject to certain parameters including the payment of a portion of our non-QVC revenues to QVC. We believe that this provides us with the ability to leverage QVC’s media platform (including television, e-commerce, and social media) and QVC’s customer base of approximately 400 million households worldwide to cross-promote products in and drive traffic to our other channels of distribution. Many of our licensees make advertising and marketing contributions to the Company under their license agreements which are used to fund marketing-related expenses and further promote our brands as we deem appropriate. Certain of the wholesale licenses contain requirements to provide advertising or marketing for our brands under their respective license agreements.
We also market the Mizrahi brand through www.isaacmizrahi.com, Halston Brand through www.halston.com, the Judith Ripka Fine Jewelry brand through www.judithripka.com and C Wonder brand through www.cwonder.com. Through our websites, we are able to present the products under our brands to customers with branding that reflects each brand’s heritage and unique point-of-view.
Our Judith Ripka Fine Jewelry brand e-commerce business growth is dependent on driving traffic to our website and converting our visitors into customers. Our strategy to focus on new customer acquisition has started to show results in 2018. This increase in our core customer base is fueling our rapid growth.

Each of our current brands has and any future acquired brand will likely have many competitors within each of its specific distribution channels that span a broad variety of product categories, including the apparel, footwear, accessories, jewelry, home furnishings and décor, food products, and sporting goods industries. These competitors have the ability to compete with the Company and our licensees in terms of fashion, quality, price, products, and/or marketing, and ultimately retail floor space and consumer spending.
Because many of our competitors have significantly greater cash, revenues, and resources than we do, we must work to differentiate ourselves from our direct and indirect competitors to successfully compete for market share with the brands we own and for future acquisitions. We believe that the following factors help differentiate our Company in an increasingly crowded competitive landscape:

• | our management team, including our officers’ and directors’ historical track records and relationships within the industry;


• | our brand management platform, which has a strong focus on design, product and marketing; and


• | our operating strategies of wholesales and direct-to consumer sales and licensing brands with significant media presence and driving sales through our ubiquitous-channel retail sales strategy across interactive television, brick-and-mortar, and e-commerce distribution channels.

We expect our and our existing and future licenses to relate to products in the apparel, footwear, accessories, jewelry, home goods, and other consumer products industries, in which our licensees face intense competition, including from our other brands and licensees. In general, competitive factors include quality, price, style, name recognition, and service. In addition, various fashion trends and the limited availability of shelf space could affect competition for our licensees’ products. Many of our licensees’ competitors have greater financial, distribution, marketing, and other resources than our licensees and have achieved significant name recognition for their brand names. Our licensees may be unable to successfully compete in the markets for their products, and we may not be able to continue to compete successfully with respect to our licensing arrangements.

Where laws limit our ability to record in our name trademarks that we have purchased, we have obtained by way of license all necessary rights to operate our business. Certain of these trademarks and associated marks are registered or pending registration with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in block letter and/or logo formats, as well as in combination with a variety of ancillary designs for use in connection with a variety of product categories, such as apparel, footwear and various other goods and services including, in some cases, home furnishings and decor. The Company intends to renew and maintain registrations as appropriate prior to expiration and it makes efforts to diligently prosecute all pending applications consistent with the Company’s business goals. In addition, the Company registers its trademarks in certain other countries and regions around the world as it deems appropriate.
The Company and its licensees do not presently earn a material amount of revenue from either the licensing of our trademarks internationally or the sale of products under our trademarks internationally. However, the Company has registered its trademarks in certain territories where it expects that it may do business in the foreseeable future. If the Company or a licensee intends to make use of the trademarks in international territories, the Company will seek to register its trademarks in such international territories as it deems appropriate based upon factors including the revenue potential, prospective market and trademark laws in such territory or territories.
Generally, the Company is primarily responsible for monitoring and protecting its trademarks around the world. The Company seeks to require its licensing partners to advise the Company of any violations of its trademark rights of which its licensing partners become aware and relies primarily upon a combination of federal, state, and local laws, as well as contractual restrictions to protect its intellectual property rights both domestically and internationally.
