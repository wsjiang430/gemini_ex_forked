Overview
 
 We are a land and water resource development company with over 45,000 acres of land in three areas of eastern San Bernardino County, California.  Virtually all of this land is underlain by high-quality, naturally recharging groundwater resources, and is situated in proximity to the Colorado River and the Colorado River Aqueduct ("CRA"), California's primary mode of water transportation for imports from the Colorado River into the State.  Our properties are suitable for various uses, including large-scale agricultural development, groundwater storage and water supply projects.  Our main objective is to realize the highest and best use of these land and water resources in an environmentally responsible way.
 
 We believe that the long-term highest and best use of our land and water assets will be realized through the development of a combination of water supply and storage projects at our properties. Therefore, we have primarily focused on the development of the Cadiz Valley Water Conservation, Recovery and Storage Project ("Water Project" or "Project"), which will capture and conserve millions of acre-feet1 of native groundwater currently being lost to evaporation from the aquifer system beneath our 34,500-acre property in the Cadiz and Fenner valleys of eastern San Bernardino County (the "Cadiz/Fenner Property"), and deliver it to water providers throughout Southern California (see "Water Resource Development").  A second phase of the Water Project would offer storage of up to one million acre-feet of imported water in the aquifer system.  We believe that the ultimate implementation of this Water Project will provide a significant source of future cash flow.

1 One acre-foot is equal to approximately 326,000 gallons or the volume of water that will cover an area of one acre to a depth of one-foot.  An acre-foot is generally considered to be enough water to meet the annual water needs of one average California household.
  1
 
 The primary factor driving the value of such projects is ongoing pressure on California's traditional water supplies and the resulting demand for new, reliable supply solutions that can meet both immediate and long-term water needs.  Available water supply in Southern California is constrained by regulatory restrictions on each of the State's three main water sources:  the CRA, the State Water Project, which provides water supplies from Northern California to the central and southern parts of the state, and the Los Angeles Aqueduct, which delivers water from the eastern Sierra Nevada mountains to Los Angeles.  Southern California's water providers rely on imports from these systems for a majority of their water supplies, but deliveries from all three into the region are consistently below capacity, even in wet years.
 
 Further, the availability of supplies in California differs greatly from year to year due to natural hydrological variability.  For nearly a decade, California struggled through an historic drought featuring record-low winter precipitation. Then, following a series of strong storms that delivered record amounts of rain and snow during the 2016-2017 winter, state officials declared an end to the drought. The 2017-2018 winter was abnormally dry for a majority of the State, yet the 2018 â€“ 2019 winter is on track to be another wet year, with snowpack and rainfall well above average through February 2019.  The rapid swings between wet and dry years challenge California's traditional supply system and support the need for reliable storage and local supply.
 
 Given the variety of challenges and limitations faced by the State's existing infrastructure, Southern California water providers are presently pursuing investments in storage, supply and infrastructure to meet long-term demand.  The Cadiz Water Project is a local supply option in Southern California that could help address the region's water supply challenges by providing new reliable supply and local groundwater storage opportunities (see "Water Resource Development" below) in both dry and wet years. Following a multi-year California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") review and permitting process, the Water Project received permits that allow the capture and conservation of 2.5 million acre-feet of groundwater over 50 years in accordance with the terms of a groundwater management plan approved by San Bernardino County, the public agency responsible for groundwater use at the project area. 
 
 In addition to our Water Project proposal, we are engaged in agricultural joint ventures at the Cadiz/Fenner Property that put some of the groundwater currently being lost to evaporation from the underlying aquifer system to immediate beneficial use.  We have farmed portions of the Cadiz/Fenner Property since the late 1980s relying on groundwater from the aquifer system for irrigation.  The site is well-suited for various permanent and seasonal crops. Presently, the property has 2,100 acres leased for cultivation of citrus.
 
 Our current working capital requirements relate largely to the final development activities associated with the Water Project and those activities consistent with the Water Project related to further development of our land and agricultural assets.  While we continue to believe that the ultimate implementation of the Water Project will provide the primary source of our future cash flow, we also believe there is significant additional value in our underlying agricultural assets.
 
 We also continue to explore additional uses of our land and water resource assets, including renewable energy development, the marketing of our approved desert tortoise land conservation bank (which is located on our properties outside the Water Project area) and other long-term legacy uses of our properties, such as habitat conservation and cultural development.

(a)     General Development of Business
 
 We are a Delaware corporation formed in 1992.  As part of our historical business strategy, we have conducted our land acquisition, water development activities, agricultural operations, and other land development initiatives to maximize the long-term value of our properties and future prospects (see "Narrative Description of Business").
 
 Our initial focus was on the acquisition of land and the assembly of contiguous land holdings through property exchanges to prove the quantity and quality of water resources in this Mojave Desert region of eastern San Bernardino County.  We subsequently established agricultural operations on our properties in the Cadiz/Fenner Valley and sought to develop the water resources underlying that site.  In 1993, we secured permits to develop up to 9,600 acres of agriculture at the Cadiz/Fenner Property and withdraw more than one million acre-feet of groundwater from the underlying aquifer system.  The agricultural operations initially began on 1,900 acres and featured vineyards, citrus orchards and seasonal vegetables.
 
 The agricultural development demonstrated that the geology and hydrology of the property is also uniquely suited and able to support a project that could offer additional water supplies and water storage opportunities in Southern California.
 
 In 1997, we entered into the first of a series of agreements with the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California ("Metropolitan"), the largest water wholesaler in the region and owner of the nearby CRA, to jointly design, permit, and build such a project ("2002 Project").  Between 1997 and 2002, we and Metropolitan received substantially all of the state and federal approvals required to construct and operate the 2002 Project, including a Record of Decision ("ROD") from the U.S. Department of the Interior, which approved the 2002 Project and offered a right-of-way for construction of facilities, including a 35-mile water conveyance pipeline from the Cadiz/Fenner Property to the CRA across federal lands.  In October 2002, Metropolitan's Board of Directors considered whether or not to accept the right-of-way permit offered by the federal government.  By a very narrow margin, the Metropolitan Board voted not to accept the right-of-way grant nor proceed any further with the 2002 Project.
 
 Following Metropolitan's decision, we began to pursue new partnerships and redesigned the 2002 Project to meet the changing needs of Southern California's water providers.  We refocused on the safe and sustainable management of the aquifer system beneath our Cadiz/Fenner Property with the goal of providing a reliable, annual water supply and storage for the region.
 
 In 2009, we commissioned environmental consulting firm CH2M HILL to complete a comprehensive study of the water resources at the Project area.  Following more than one year of analysis, CH2M HILL released its study of the aquifer system in February 2010.  Utilizing new models produced by the U.S. Geological Survey in 2006 and 2008, the study estimated the total groundwater in storage in the aquifer system to be between 17 and 34 million acre-feet, a quantity on par with Lake Mead, the nation's largest surface reservoir.  The study also identified a renewable annual supply of native groundwater in the aquifer system currently being lost to evaporation.  CH2M HILL's findings, which were peer reviewed by leading groundwater experts, confirmed that the aquifer system could sustainably support a water supply and storage project that would capture and conserve groundwater lost to evaporation in an initial phase and import and store water in the aquifer system in a second phase (see "Water Project" below).
  3
 
 In September 2008 we entered into a lease agreement with the Arizona & California Railroad Company ("ARZC") to utilize its existing right-of-way between the Cadiz property and the CRA to construct a pipeline able to deliver water from the property into the existing Southern California water transportation system. Although the federal government had approved a right-of-way for the 2002 Project's conveyance pipeline over open federal land, the Water Project proposed co-locating the conveyance pipeline within this existing railroad right-of-way from Cadiz to the CRA near Rice, CA. This route was approximately 10 miles longer than the 2002 route, but it avoided impacts to desert habitats that would have occurred with the 2002 route. In 2009, the United States Department of the Interior evaluated the Water Project's proposed use of an existing railroad right-of-way for a water conveyance pipeline and summarized that the proposed pipeline was within the scope of the right-of-way and required no federal Bureau of Land Management ("BLM") permitting.
 
 Between 2010 and 2011 six Southern California water providers executed option agreements to participate in the new Water Project.  Under our lease agreement, the ARZC also reserved water from the Water Project to further a variety of critical railroad purposes.
 
 In 2011, an environmental review and permitting process for the Water Project was commenced in accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) led by Santa Margarita Water District ("SMWD"), one of the Project participants.  After an extensive public review process as required by CEQA, the SMWD Board of Directors certified the Final Environmental Impact Report ("FEIR") on July 31, 2012 and became the first participating agency to convert its option agreement to a Water Purchase and Sale Agreement for firm supplies from the Water Project. On October 1, 2012, San Bernardino County ("County"), a Responsible Agency under CEQA, also adopted CEQA findings and approved the Project's Groundwater Monitoring, Management and Mitigation Plan ('GMMMP" or "Plan") and the withdrawal of 50,000 acre-feet (AF) of water per year for 50 years.
 
 Following receipt of these important approvals, we were named as a real-party-in-interest in nine lawsuits brought by parties seeking a reconsideration of the environmental documents and limitation of the Project approvals granted by SMWD and the County.  Six lawsuits brought by two petitioners ultimately proceeded to trial in Orange County Superior Court ("Court") before one judge in December 2013.  In September 2014, the Court issued final signed judgments ("Judgments") formally denying all claims brought in the six remaining lawsuits.  The Judgments upheld the conclusions of the environmental review and the approvals of the Water Project. 
 
 During the fourth quarter of 2014, the petitioners in the six original Court cases filed independent appeals of the six Judgments with the California Court of Appeals, Fourth District. In May 2016, a three-justice panel unanimously ruled in favor of the Water Project and sustained the lower court rulings. Thereafter, all litigation was dismissed.  As a result, the approvals of the Project by the County and SMWD were deemed final and the Company's permits to capture and conserve 2.5 million acre-feet of groundwater over 50 years under the terms of the groundwater management plan have vested under applicable law.
  4
 
 While defending the Project's CEQA permits, the Company and the Water Project participants also began a dialogue with BLM in response to federal appropriations language that required the Interior Department to certify that the Project's proposed use of the ARZC right-of-way was within the scope of the original right-of-way grant.  The dialogue with the BLM occurred over more than two years and culminated in a controversial guidance opinion issued by the BLM California office in October 2015 that did not certify the Project's proposed use. The Company, the ARZC, Water Project participants, Water Project supporters, members of Congress, the railroad industry and third parties that utilize railroad rights-of-way to co-locate infrastructure across the country voiced concern about the guidance opinion via letters, statements and meetings with the BLM.  In October 2017, the BLM withdrew its October 2015 letter and concluded that the Project is within the scope of the ARZC ROW and therefore required nothing further from the BLM to construct the conveyance pipeline within the ARZC ROW.
 
 Prior to moving forward to construction of the Project facilities, the Company is focused on finalizing contracts with Project participating agencies, arranging final terms to convey water in California's water transportation infrastructure, and completing final permitting, and implementation, including final design.
 
 See "Narrative Description of Business" below for more detail.
 
(b)     Financial Information about Industry Segments
 
 Our primary business is to acquire and develop land with water resources for various uses, including groundwater supply, groundwater storage and agriculture.  As a result, our financial results are reported in a single segment.  See Consolidated Financial Statements.  See also Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations".
 
(c)     Narrative Description of Business
 
 Our business strategy is to pursue the development of our landholdings for their highest and best uses.  At present, our development activities include water resource, land and agricultural development.
 
Water Resource Development
 
 Our portfolio of land and water resource assets is located in proximity to the Colorado River and the Colorado River Aqueduct ("CRA"), the principal source of imported water for Southern California, and provides us with the opportunity to participate in a variety of water supply, water storage, and conservation programs with public water agencies and other partners.
 The Water Project
 
 The Cadiz Valley Water Conservation, Recovery and Storage Project ("Water Project") is designed to capture and conserve renewable native groundwater currently being lost to evaporation from the aquifer system underlying our Cadiz/Fenner Property, and provide a new reliable water supply for approximately 400,000 people in Southern California.  In this first phase, Phase I, the total quantity of groundwater to be recovered and conveyed to Water Project participants will not exceed a long-term annual average of 50,000 acre-feet per year for 50 years.  The Water Project also offers participants in Phase I the ability to carry-over their annual supply and store it in the groundwater basin from year to year.  Up to 150,000 acre-feet can be stored as part of Phase I.  A second phase of the Water Project, Phase II, will offer an additional 850,000 acre-feet of capacity that can store imported water supplies at the project area for future dry years.
  5
 
 Water Project facilities required for Phase I primarily include, among other things:
 
 
Â· | High-yield wells designed to efficiently recover available native groundwater at the Water Project area;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Â· | A water conveyance pipeline to deliver water from the well-field to the CRA for further delivery to Project participants;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Â· | An energy source to provide power to the well-field, pipeline and pumping facilities; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Â· | A water treatment facility at the wellfield to meet anticipated water quality requirements set by the operator of the CRA.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



 If an imported water storage component of the Project is ultimately implemented in Phase II, the following additional facilities would be required, among other things:
 
 
Â· | Facilities to pump water through the conveyance pipeline from the CRA to the Water Project well-field and/or through the Company's pipeline from Barstow, CA, to Cadiz; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Â· | Spreading basins, which are shallow settling ponds that will be configured to efficiently percolate water from the ground surface down to the water table using subsurface storage capacity for the storage of water.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Phase I
 
 Phase I has been fully reviewed and permitted in accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). In May 2016, all permits and approvals were sustained in the California Court of Appeal and are no longer subject to further litigation. As a result, the Project presently is permitted to provide an average of 50,000 acre-feet of water for 50 years to meet municipal and industrial (M&I) water needs in Southern California.
 
 In October 2017, the US BLM provided a letter finding that the Project's proposed use of a portion of the ARZC ROW from Cadiz to Freda, California to construct and operate the Water Project's water conveyance pipeline and related railroad improvements is within the scope of the original right-of-way grant and not subject to additional permitting.  The buried pipeline would be constructed parallel to the railroad tracks and be used to convey water between our Cadiz Valley property and the CRA.
 
 Construction of Phase I Water Project facilities that would allow for the delivery of up to 75,000 acre-feet in any one year is expected to cost approximately $310 million and will require capital financing that we expect will be secured by definitive Purchase and Sale Agreements with Project participants and the new facility assets.
  6
 
 In addition to finalizing construction financing terms, prior to construction, the Water Project must (1) finalize contracts with Project participating agencies, (2) secure transportation arrangements to deliver water into each participant's service area, and (3) complete final design, engineering and construction permitting.  Below is a discussion of present activities to advance these objectives.
 
 (1)  Contracts with Public Water Agencies or Private Water Utilities
 
 The Company has executed Letters of Intent ("LOIs"), option agreements and purchase agreements, or contracts (collectively, "Agreements") with public water agencies and private water utilities in California during the Project's development.  These participating agencies serve more than one million customers in cities throughout California's San Bernardino, Riverside, Los Angeles, Orange, Imperial and Ventura Counties. Twenty percent of Water Project supplies have been reserved for San Bernardino County-based agencies.
 
 Santa Margarita Water District ("SMWD"), Orange County's second largest water provider, was the first participant to convert its option agreement and adopt resolutions approving a Water Purchase and Sale Agreement for 5,000 acre-feet of water.  The structure of the SMWD purchase agreement calls for an annually adjusted water supply payment, plus a pro rata portion of the capital recovery charge and operating and maintenance costs.  The capital recovery charge is calculated by amortizing the total capital investment by the Company over a 30-year term.
 
 Agreements entered into prior to the beginning of the CEQA review process provide to participants the right to acquire an annual supply of 5,000 acre-feet of water at a $775 per acre-foot (2010 dollars, subject to adjustment), which is competitive with the incremental cost of new water.  In addition, these agencies received options to acquire storage rights in the Water Project to allow for the management of their Water Project supplies in complement with their own water resources.  Up to 150,000 acre-feet of carry-over storage is available for reservation by the agencies prior to construction commencement.  Participants that elect to achieve year-to-year flexibility in their use of Project water by utilizing carry-over storage will reserve storage capacity for $1,500 per acre-foot prior to construction.
 
 LOIs that have been entered into since completion of the CEQA review process reserve supplies from the Water Project at $960 per acre-foot (2014 dollars, subject to adjustment).  These LOIs also include the option to reserve carry-over storage capacity for $1,500 per acre-foot prior to construction.
 
 Presently, total reservations of supplies from the Water Project via these Agreements are in excess of Water Project capacity.  Prior to construction of the Water Project, we expect to convert existing option agreements and LOIs to purchase agreements.  We are working collaboratively with the participating water agencies to account for any oversubscription in the final definitive Purchase and Sale Agreements and allow for inclusive participation across Southern California.
  7
 
 (2)  Conveyance Arrangements
 
 Prior to construction of the Water Project, and in coordination with final participation contracts described in (1) above, an agreement and terms for moving water supplies in the CRA must be negotiated with Metropolitan Water District of Southern California ("Metropolitan"), which owns and controls the CRA.
 
 Water supplies conserved by the Project would enter the CRA at the termination of the project's conveyance pipeline near Rice, CA. The CEQA process considered a variety of options to enter the CRA and assumed final entry into the CRA would be determined by MWD in consultation with the Project's participating agencies. Once arrangements are reached, the Metropolitan Board would take action as a responsible agency under CEQA regarding the terms and conditions of the Water Project's use of the CRA to transport water to its participating agencies.
 
 There is no application yet before Metropolitan related to entry and transportation of Project supplies, but we expect such a formal application will be filed by SMWD, the Project's lead agency, when the Project's contractual arrangements with participants are finalized.  Any agreement as to the terms and conditions of the Water Project's use of the CRA will be negotiated between and entered into by Metropolitan and the Project participating agencies, not the Company.  Discussions with Metropolitan regarding conveyance of Project water in the CRA have been led by SMWD, the Water Project's CEQA lead agency, and are ongoing.
 
 Water Project supplies entering the CRA will comply with Metropolitan's published engineering, design and water quality standards and will be subject to all applicable fees and charges routinely established by Metropolitan for the conveyance of water within its service territory.  Total dissolved solids or salts in the Cadiz water supply are substantially lower than the water in the CRA. Other constituents that are already lower than State and Federal standards but potentially higher than the water in the CRA will be lowered via treatment to ambient levels or removed entirely. Extensive pilot testing of treatment options at the Project area in 2018 confirmed the capability of cost-effective treatment technologies to successfully remove such constituents. We believe there are multiple benefits that can be secured by MWD upon making space reasonably available for the Water Project supplies and providing the region the flexibility of relying on the Water Project in both wet and dry years.
 
 Northern Pipeline
 
 We currently own a 96-mile long, 30-inch wide existing idle natural gas pipeline that extends northwest from the Cadiz/Fenner Property terminating in Barstow, California, and have entered into a purchase agreement for a further 124-mile segment connecting this line from Barstow to Wheeler Ridge, California.  The pipeline crosses San Bernardino, Los Angeles and Kern counties, including the Barstow and Bakersfield areas, which serve as hubs for water delivered from northern and central California to communities in Southern California.
 
 Initial feasibility studies indicated that, upon conversion, the 30-inch pipeline could transport between 18,000 and 30,000 acre-feet of water per year between the Water Project area and the Central and Northern California water transportation networks. As a result, this pipeline could diversify delivery opportunities for the Water Project and the Company's broader water resource development efforts.
  8
 
 If this pipeline were to become operational, then the Water Project would link the Colorado River Aqueduct and State Water Project systems - two of Southern California's main water delivery systems - providing flexible opportunities for both supply and storage.  The Northern Pipeline could deliver Phase I supplies, either directly or via exchange, to existing and potential customers of Phase I of the Project.  Any use of the pipeline would be conducted in conformity with the Water Project's groundwater management plan and is subject to further CEQA evaluation and potentially federal environmental permitting.
 
 In December 2018, the Company entered into an amendment (the "Amendment") to its option agreement ("Option Agreement") with EPNG to purchase the 124-mile segment of the pipeline. The Option Agreement, as amended, allows the Company to purchase the 124-mile pipeline segment with an initial payment of $2 million and a subsequent payment of $18 million ("Deferred Payment").  Following entry into the Amendment, the Company exercised the option and entered into a purchase agreement for the 124-mile pipeline, providing to EPNG the initial consideration of $2 million.
 
 Under our purchase agreement with EPNG, the Deferred Payment is due to EPNG within 30 days of satisfaction of certain conditions precedent by EPNG.  We do not currently have the cash resources on hand to satisfy the Deferred Payment.  If we do not complete the purchase of the additional 124-mile pipeline, then our Northern Pipeline opportunities will be limited to the 96-mile segment that we own.
 
 (3) Final Design and Permitting
 
 As a component of completing contract terms with participating agencies and related wheeling arrangements with Metropolitan, we must also finalize design of Project facilities and acquire relevant construction permits with state and local agencies. Together with SMWD we have engaged engineering and environmental consultants to complete design plans for the 43-mile pipeline, Project wellfield, any necessary water treatment facilities, and facilities required to connect to the Metropolitan system at and near the CRA. This work is ongoing and expected to proceed in coordination with the negotiation of contracts and wheeling arrangements.
 
 Once facility design and layout near completion, we will need to obtain additional permits and approvals from state or local entities prior to construction. This may include but is not limited to confirmation of existing access rights, easements and rights-of-way, for areas that may be crossed by Project facilities in the Project area subject to final pipeline configuration.
 
 Phase II
 
 In a second phase of the Water Project, we expect to make available up to one million acre-feet of capacity in the aquifer system for storage of surplus water conveyed to the Project area.  Under the Imported Water Storage Component, or Phase II, water from the Colorado River or the State Water Project, via some or all of an existing 220-mile pipeline that extends from Wheeler Ridge, California southeast to Barstow and there onwards to our Cadiz/Fenner property (see "Northern Pipeline", above), could be conveyed to spreading basins that would be constructed on our private property to percolate into the aquifer system and held in storage. When needed, previously stored water would be returned to Phase II participating agencies via the Project's 43-mile conveyance pipeline to the CRA, described above, or the Northern Pipeline.
  9
 
 Phase II has already been the subject of programmatic environmental review in accordance with CEQA, but still requires project-level environmental review and permitting once participating agencies are identified. Phase II may also require federal permits subject to the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA.
 
Agricultural Development
 
 Our Cadiz/Fenner Property, consisting of approximately 35,000 acres of desert land, is zoned for agricultural development.  In 1993, we secured conditional use permits to develop agriculture on up to 9,600 acres of the property and withdraw groundwater from the underlying aquifer system for irrigation.  We have since maintained various levels of crops on the Property as we developed the Water Project.  In 2013, we entered into a lease agreement with a third party to develop up to 1,480 acres of lemons at the site, 640 acres of which have been planted to date.
 
 In February 2016, we entered into a lease agreement with Fenner Valley Farms LLC ("FVF"), a subsidiary of Water Asset Management LLC, a related party, pursuant to which FVF leased, for a 99-year term, 2,100 acres at the Cadiz/Fenner property to be used to plant, grow and harvest agricultural crops ("FVF Lease").  As consideration for the lease, FVF paid us a one-time payment of $12,000,000 in February 2016.  The acreage that was historically farmed by us and the acreage that is leased to a third party to develop lemons was included within the leased acreage.  Following entry into this lease, we are no longer directly involved in the current agricultural operations at the site and all agricultural revenue is derived pursuant to the FVF Lease.
 
 As part of the agricultural development to be conducted under the lease arrangements, the groundwater production capacity of the property's existing well-field is expected to be enhanced through infrastructure improvements that are complementary to the Water Project.  While any additional well-field development for agricultural use would be financed by our agricultural partners as provided under our agricultural lease arrangements, we retained a call feature that allows us, at any time in the initial 20 years, to acquire the well-field and integrate any new agricultural well-field infrastructure developed into the Water Project's facilities.
 
Additional Eastern Mojave Properties
 
 We also own approximately 11,000 acres outside of the Cadiz/Fenner Valley area in two locations within the Mojave Desert in eastern San Bernardino County.
 
 Our primary landholding outside of the Cadiz area is approximately 9,000 acres in the Piute Valley.  This landholding is located approximately 15 miles from the resort community of Laughlin, Nevada, and about 12 miles from the Colorado River town of Needles, California.  Extensive hydrological studies, including the drilling and testing of a full-scale production well, have demonstrated that this landholding is underlain by high-quality groundwater.  The aquifer system underlying this property is naturally recharged by precipitation (both rain and snow) within a watershed of approximately 975 square miles and could be suitable for a water supply project, agricultural development or solar energy production.  These private properties are proximate to or border areas designated by the federal government as National Monument, Critical Desert Tortoise Habitat and/or Desert Wilderness Areas and are suitable candidates for preservation and conservation (see "Land Conservation Bank" below).
  10
 
 Additionally, we own acreage located near Danby Dry Lake in Ward Valley, approximately 30 miles southeast of our Cadiz/Fenner Valley properties.  The Danby Dry Lake property is located approximately 10 miles north of the CRA.  Initial hydrological studies indicate that the area has excellent potential for a water supply project. Certain of the properties in this area may also be suitable for agricultural development and/or preservation and conservation.
 
Land Conservation Bank
 
 Approximately 7,500 acres of our properties outside of the Cadiz/Fenner Valley area in the Piute Valley are located within terrain designated by the federal government as Critical Desert Tortoise Habitat and/or Desert Wilderness Areas and offer limited development opportunities.  In February 2015, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife approved our establishment of the Fenner Valley Desert Tortoise Conservation Bank ("Fenner Bank"), a land conservation bank that makes available these properties for mitigation of impacts to tortoise and other sensitive species that would be caused by development across the Southern California desert.  Under its enabling documents, the Fenner Bank offers credits that can be acquired by entities that must mitigate or offset impacts linked to planned development.  For example, this bank can service the mitigation requirements of renewable energy, military, residential and commercial development projects being considered throughout the desert. Credits sold by the Fenner Bank will fund our permanent preservation of the land as well as research by outside entities, including San Diego Zoo Global, into desert tortoise health and species protection.
Northern Pipeline
 
 The Northern Pipeline, described above, also represents new opportunities for the Company independent of the Water Project to offer water transportation to locations along the 220-mile pipeline route that are not presently interconnected by existing water infrastructure.  The pipeline crosses California's major water infrastructure as well as urban and agricultural centers and can be utilized to transport water, independent of the Water Project, between users who presently lack direct interconnections along the pipeline route. We are presently engaged in discussions with parties that may be interested in such transportation.  The ability to serve points along the 124-mile portion of the pipeline from Barstow to Wheeler Ridge is dependent upon completion of certain conditions precedent under our purchase agreement with EPNG, described above.  If the acquisition of the 124-mile segment is not completed, then our Northern Pipeline opportunities will be limited to the 96-mile segment that we own.
Other Opportunities
 
 Other opportunities in the water and agricultural or related infrastructure business complementary to our current objectives could provide new opportunities for our Company.
 
 Over the longer-term, we believe the population of Southern California, Nevada and Arizona will continue to grow, and that, in time, the economics of commercial and residential development at our properties may become attractive.
 
 We remain committed to the sustainable use of our land and water assets, and will continue to explore all opportunities for environmentally responsible development of these assets.  We cannot estimate which of these opportunities will ultimately be utilized.
  11
 
Seasonality
 
 Our water resource development activities are not seasonal in nature.
 
 Our farming operations have been limited to the cultivation of lemons and grapes/raisins and spring and fall plantings of vegetables on the Cadiz Valley properties.  These operations have been subject to the general seasonal trends that are characteristic of the agricultural industry.
Competition
 
 We face competition for the acquisition, development and sale of our properties from a number of competitors.  We may also face competition in the development of water resources and agriculture associated with our properties.  Since California has scarce water resources and an increasing demand for available water, we believe that location, price and reliability of delivery are the principal competitive factors affecting transfers of water in California.

 As of December 31, 2018, we employed 9 full-time employees (i.e. those individuals working more than 1,000 hours per year).  We believe that our employee relations are good.
 
Regulation
 
 Our operations are subject to varying degrees of federal, state and local laws and regulations.  As we proceed with the development of our properties, including the Water Project, we will be required to satisfy various regulatory authorities that we are in compliance with the laws, regulations and policies enforced by such authorities.  Groundwater development, and the export of conserved groundwater for sale to entities such as public water agencies, is subject to regulation by specific existing statutes, in addition to general environmental statutes applicable to all development projects.  Additionally, we must obtain a variety of approvals and permits from state and federal governments with respect to issues that may include environmental issues, issues related to special status species, issues related to the public trust, and others.  Because of the discretionary nature of these approvals and concerns, which may be raised by various governmental officials, public interest groups and other interested parties during both the development and the approval process, our ability to develop properties and realize income from our projects, including the Water Project, could be delayed, reduced or eliminated.
