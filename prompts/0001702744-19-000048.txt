Item 1. Business
Simply Good Foods was formed in Delaware on March 30, 2017, to consummate the Business Combination, which occurred on July 7, 2017. As a result, Simply Good Foods owns all of the equity in Atkins.
Our principal executive offices are located at 1225 17th Street, Suite 1000, Denver, Colorado, 80202. Our telephone number is (303) 633-2840. We maintain a web site at www.thesimplygoodfoodscompany.com. 
Overview
Simply Good Foods is a developer, marketer and seller of branded nutritional foods and snacking products. Our highly-focused product portfolio consists primarily of nutrition bars, ready-to-drink (“RTD”) shakes, snacks and confectionery products marketed under the Atkins®, SimplyProtein®, and Atkins Endulge® brand names. Our goal is to lead the nutritious snacking movement with trusted brands that offer a variety of convenient, innovative, great-tasting, “better-for-you” snacks and meal replacements. Over the past 45 years, Atkins has become an iconic American brand that for many consumers stands for “low carb,” “low sugar” and “protein rich” nutrition. The Atkins approach focuses on a healthy nutritional approach with reduced levels of refined carbohydrates and sugars and encourages the consumption of lean protein, fiber, fruits, vegetables and healthy fats.
In our core Atkins snacking business, we strive to offer a complete line of nutrition bars, RTD shakes and confections that satisfy hunger while providing consumers with a convenient, “better-for-you” snacking alternative. Our sales, marketing and R&D capabilities enable us to distribute products into a national customer base across the mass merchandiser, grocery, drug, club stores, e-commerce, and small format retail such as convenience and gas station. We believe that Atkins’ broad brand recognition, our depth of management talent and strong cash generation position us to continue to innovate in the Atkins brand and acquire other brands, and thereby become an industry leading snacking platform. To that end, in December 2016, Atkins completed the acquisition of Wellness Foods, Inc. (“Wellness Foods”), a Canada-based developer, marketer and seller of the SimplyProtein® brand that is focused on protein-rich and low-sugar products. On August 21, 2019, we announced that we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Quest Nutrition, LLC, a healthy, lifestyle food brand. See “Recent Developments” for additional information on the Acquisition.
We believe snacking occasions are on the rise as consumers crave convenient, healthy and delicious foods, snacks and meal replacements for their on-the-go lifestyles. We believe our emphasis on nutrition bars and RTD shakes positions us to capitalize on consumers’ busy schedules. We believe a number of existing and emerging consumer trends within the U.S. food and beverage industry will continue to both drive the growth of the nutritional snacking category and increase the demand for our product offerings. Some of these trends include increased consumption of smaller, more frequent meals throughout the day, consumers’ strong preference for convenient, “better-for-you” snacks, consumers’ greater focus on health and wellness, and consumers’ moves toward controlling carbohydrate and sugar consumption, as well as the trend of consumers seeking to add convenient sources of protein and fiber to their diets.
Recent Developments
Quest Acquisition
On August 21, 2019, we entered into a stock purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Voyage Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Voyage Holdings”), VMG Quest Blocker, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“VMG Blocker”, and together with Voyage Holdings, the “Target Companies”), VMG Voyage Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, VMG Tax-Exempt II, L.P. a Delaware limited partnership (together with VMG Voyage Holdings, LLC, the “VMG Sellers”) and other parties (collectively, the “Sellers”). Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Company will acquire Quest Nutrition, LLC (“Quest”), a healthy lifestyle food company (the “Acquisition”) for a cash purchase price of $1.0 billion (subject to customary adjustments for the Target Companies' levels of cash, indebtedness, net working capital and transaction expenses as of the closing). The Acquisition is expected to close by the end of the 2019 calendar year, subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions. There is no financing condition for the Acquisition.
We expect to realize several benefits from the Acquisition, including the following:

• | Highly Attractive, Complementary Portfolio of Nutritional Snacking Brands. Quest's products (primarily bars, cookies, chips and pizza) compete in many of the attractive, fast growing sub-segments within the nutritional snacking category. Quest has an extremely loyal following and favorable demographic profile with strong appeal among consumers ages 18-35 that complements Atkins' strength among consumers 35+. 


• | Scalable, Growth-Oriented Platform. Given Quest's growth trajectory, innovation pipeline and identified cost synergies, we believe there is financial flexibility to continue investing in the Quest business and expand margins that should, over time, be relatively similar to Simply Good Foods.

• | Enhances Innovative Culture to Deliver on Shared Mission. This transaction will enable Simply Good Foods to benefit from Quest's effectiveness within e-commerce, social platforms as well as specialty and other non-tracked distribution channels, while Quest will benefit from Simply Good Foods' expertise in building distribution in food/drug/mass channels and growing brand awareness via broad reach media. 


• | Achievable Synergies. The transaction delivers on key growth criteria while achieving an estimated $20 million in run-rate cost synergies over three years by leveraging efficiencies of scale. 


• | Financial Overview. The strategic acquisition of Quest provides Simply Good Foods with additional scale and is complementary to the Company's long-term net sales and Adjusted EBITDA growth algorithm. 

Financing of the Acquisition
On October 9, 2019, we completed an underwritten public offering of 13,379,205 shares of our common stock at a price per share of $26.16 (the “Offering”), resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately $350.0 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and our estimated fees and expenses for the Offering. We intend to use these net proceeds to pay a portion of the purchase price and related fees and expenses for the Acquisition, or for general corporate purposes if the acquisition is not consummated.
We plan to fund the remainder of the Acquisition by using a significant portion of the approximately $265 million of cash on hand and committed financing pursuant to debt commitments from Barclays, Credit Suisse and Goldman Sachs.
Our Strengths
Powerful brand with strong consumer awareness and loyalty. We are a leading player in the fast growing nutritional snacking category, and Atkins is one of the leading brands with scale in both nutrition bars and RTD shakes. The Atkins iconic brand has 83% aided brand awareness with U.S. consumers today, based on a study conducted by Atkins in July 2019. Our highly-focused snacking portfolio provides us with a leading position within retailers’ nutrition and wellness aisles, resulting in meaningful shelf space. Atkins’ ability to appeal to both weight management program consumers and consumers focused on everyday nutritious eating makes it a highly attractive and strategic brand for a diverse set of retailers across various distribution channels.

Aligned with consumer mega trends. Increasing global concern about growing rates of obesity and weight-related diseases and other health issues has resulted in increased scientific, media and consumer focus on nutrition. Over 100 independent, peer reviewed, clinical studies show the benefits of controlling carbohydrates. Management believes that this focus is prompting consumers to rebalance their nutritional breakdown away from carbohydrates. In fact, 73% of consumers are seeking to lower their carbohydrate intake according to Health Focus International. Atkins brand attributes, “low carb,” “low sugar” and “protein rich” nutrition, are well aligned with consumer mega trends. In addition, consumers’ eating habits are gradually shifting towards increased convenience, snacking and meal replacement. Our portfolio of convenient and nutritious products as well as our ongoing effort to meet consumer demands for “cleaner labels,” which we define as products made with fewer, simpler and more recognizable ingredients, are strategically aligned with these trends.
Scalable snacking and food platform. With the highly-recognized Atkins brand as an anchor, we have been able to grow our product offerings through our brand extensions and through acquisitions, such as the December 2016 acquisition of Wellness Foods and the pending acquisition of Quest, a healthy lifestyle food brand. Our in-house product development experience, combined with our outsourced manufacturing model, allow us to bring new products to market quickly. We pride ourselves on knowing our consumers and mining insights that lead to new products and ideas. We believe that we have the ability to leverage our strong relationships with our retail customers and distributors, brand building record, and category management expertise to help new products, brands and brand extensions gain distribution and consumer recognition, allowing us to continue to successfully expand our snacking platform.
Asset-light business with strong cash generation. We retain core in-house capabilities including sales, marketing, brand management, customer relationships, product development, and supply-chain know-how, while partnering with a diversified pool of contract manufacturers and distributors to execute manufacturing and distribution. Outsourcing these competencies allows us to focus our efforts on innovation, marketing and sales to strive to meet consumer demands. Our lean infrastructure allows for significant flexibility and speed-to-market and minimal capital investment, which translates into relatively consistent and robust free cash flow generation over time, driven by strong gross margins.
Experienced leadership team. Simply Good Foods has an experienced team of industry veterans with extensive experience across multiple branded consumer products, food and nutrition categories. For example, our President and Chief Executive Officer, Joseph Scalzo, has significant experience operating packaged foods businesses, having served in various leadership roles at Dean Foods, WhiteWave Foods, The Gillette Company, The Coca-Cola Company, and The Procter & Gamble Company. Our management team's extensive experience is complemented by the significant industry expertise of our directors James Kilts, the former Chief Executive Officer of The Gillette Company and Nabisco, and former President of Kraft USA and Oscar Mayer, and David West, the former Chief Executive Officer of Big Heart Pet 
5

Brands and The Hershey Company. Our management team’s deep expertise and proven track record in managing brands and operating packaged food businesses is a key driver of our success and positions Simply Good Foods as an attractive vehicle for future long-term growth within the snacking space and broader food category.
Our Strategies
Continue our advocacy, education and activation for core program consumers. Consumers who purchase Atkins’ products have shown a strong affinity for the brand as evidenced by a relatively high level of servings per buyer, per year. Historically, our core target consumer base has consisted of individuals participating in branded weight management programs. These consumers are our most loyal, profitable and frequent purchasers. We use targeted television and print ads with a celebrity-based campaign that motivates the potential programmatic buyer to try the Atkins approach to weight loss. We retain these buyers with a value-added “tool-kit” of a resource-filled website and mobile app that contains all the content necessary to follow the Atkins approach successfully, including menu planners, shopping lists, carb counter, community support, inspirational success stories, and over 1,600 recipes. We have an active and growing digital and social presence, using a comprehensive approach of search, banner and search engine optimization efforts. We are a leader in social media, with a top-tier presence on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. We also have a growing network of social influencers, who promote the Atkins philosophy in their targeted blogs. We believe that social media is a cost-effective way of continuing to attract and retain these core consumers. We expect our recently improved Atkins brand website and mobile application will continue to attract core consumers, including millennials, to our Atkins products. We believe that our ongoing efforts to educate consumers about the benefits of a lower carbohydrate lifestyle will further reinforce the brand to core consumers who are focused on a programmatic approach to weight management.
Further develop marketing strategy to reach self-directed low carbohydrate consumers. We intend to continue to make focused changes to our approach to consumer outreach. According to an Information Resources, Inc. (“IRI”) study, over 50% of our current consumers are self-directed low carbohydrate eaters (not on a program diet) who buy and consume our products, despite the fact that historically, Atkins’ marketing and advertising have not been targeted towards them. Management expects that the brand’s redesigned marketing and advertising, such as our food-focused television advertising, will continue to be effective at reaching the large addressable market of self-directed low carbohydrate consumers. Additionally, social media continues to be an important component of our marketing tools and we have an active and growing presence on key social channels such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. During the fifty-three week period ended August 31, 2019, we had approximately 9 million new visitors to our www.atkins.com website.

Innovate and expand the portfolio of product offerings to meet consumer demands for “cleaner labels,” higher protein products and new product forms. Management expects that our ongoing efforts to meet consumer demands for “cleaner labels” will be effective at reaching self-directed low carbohydrate consumers, who are focused on weight management as part of overall health, wellness and “clean eating.” Management is committed to continually finding new and innovative formulations to reduce the number of product ingredients, as well as using “better for you” ingredients like nuts, fiber and whey protein in its existing products, while maintaining and improving taste and quality. In addition, we intend to continue to enhance, strengthen and expand our product offerings with new and innovative flavors and forms, simple ingredients and packaging alternatives, all while maintaining a commitment to delivering products that meet our nutritional profile and provide the convenience that consumers crave. Our in-house research and development laboratory allows us to develop new products internally and bring them to market quickly through our contract manufacturing network without diverging from high standards of taste, quality, safety and nutritional content. Additionally, we intend to satisfy developing consumer demands through the pursuit of merger and acquisition transactions, such as the December 2016 acquisition of Wellness Foods and our pending acquisition of Quest.
Expand distribution in white space opportunities. In the fifty-three week period ended August 31, 2019, approximately 79% of Atkins’ gross sales in the U.S. were through the mass retailer and grocery distribution channels. Management team believes there is opportunity for the brand to further penetrate other distribution channels such as convenience and club stores. Management also believes that the development of the SimplyProtein® brand will allow us to expand distribution into the natural and specialty channel. In addition, while shoppers have become heavy consumers of e-commerce purchases generally, only approximately 5% of Atkins’ gross sales for the fifty-three week period ended August 31, 2019 were through its e-commerce channel. We intend to leverage our brand recognition to further develop the distribution channels through which we reach consumers, including through the expansion of the e-commerce channel.
Leverage platform to expand in attractive food and snacking categories. Management believes the fragmented snacking category presents a substantial opportunity for consolidation and the opportunity to build, through disciplined acquisitions, a leading platform in the snacking space and broader food category. As a leader in nutritious snacking, we believe we have the unique capability to leverage our operating platform and customer relationships to expand beyond the Atkins brand. Our experienced management team has deep expertise in brand building to expand the business into additional brands and products in the snacking segment. Over time, we expect to continue seeking to identify and evaluate acquisition opportunities to complement our platform, and we see significant opportunity for growth and synergies in complementary adjacent snacking categories such as the “better-for-you” eating space.

Our Goals
Our goal for the Atkins and Simply Protein brands is to improve global health by providing products that are consistent with how a healthier world eats. To make this vision a reality, we strive to embed our brand as a part of everyday life through advocacy, education and innovation. For over 45 years, Atkins has become an iconic American brand that for many consumers stands for “low carb,” “low sugar” and “protein rich” nutrition. Our vision and mission, coupled with our belief that today’s consumer is looking for sustainable, healthy long-term habits, has inspired our focus on nutritional snacking. We believe that wellbeing is not just about weight loss or quick results, but also about a healthier approach to eating.
Our Approach to Healthy Living and Healthy Weight
Over 150 independent, peer reviewed, clinical studies support that eating the right foods can improve health, not only in terms of weight management, but also in terms of related chronic issues like Type 2 Diabetes and cardiovascular disease. We believe that we offer a balanced approach to nutrition that can result in better health.
Dr. Robert Atkins, a well-known cardiologist, discovered the beneficial effects of a low carbohydrate nutritional regimen on his patients and helped refine the modern understanding of human nutrition and its link to health. More people are recognizing that Atkins is the foundation of the new convention of eating right, and that the old convention of eating excess carbohydrates and sugar has actually contributed to global obesity. Dr. Atkins limited his patients’ intake of sugar and carbohydrates not only for the weight management benefits, but also because of the numerous other health benefits to his patients. While calorie control plays some role in wellness, studies show that it can be far more important to know what the body does with food and its components. We believe that controlling consumption of carbohydrates that the human body quickly turns into sugar is the single biggest factor in eating right. When there is too much sugar and too many carbohydrates in the bloodstream, the body stores them as fat. Many people do not know that starchy carbohydrates such as breads, pasta, cereal, rice and potatoes are really just complex chains of sugars. We believe that eating proteins and healthy fat, while controlling carbohydrate consumption are the foundation of eating right. In our opinion, the old conventional wisdom of “all calories are created equal,” no matter how many of them are sugars, is simply wrong—eating sugar floods the body with the wrong kind of fuel and sends the wrong metabolic signals. Our approach aims to satisfy appetite while creating more stable energy, a higher metabolism and less stored fat. The human body works better with the right fuel.
Our Products
Core Products
Our core products consist of nutrition bars, RTD shakes and confections under the Atkins and SimplyProtein brands.
Nutrition Bars. To keep on-the-go consumers energized and fueled, our nutrition bars offer a convenient and effective solution, providing consumers with protein, fiber and a delicious taste. Atkins offers two main types of nutrition bars: Atkins Meal Bars and Atkins Snack Bars. Atkins Meal Bars contain 13 to 17 grams of protein, and are available in 11 different flavors. With 2 to 4 grams of net carbs, Atkins Snack Bars contain 7 to 13 grams of protein. Atkins offers 15 varieties of Atkins Snack Bars.

To add to Atkins’ portfolio of nutrition bars and snacks, in December 2016 we acquired Wellness Foods, a Canada-based company which owns the SimplyProtein® brand. Beginning in October 2018, we began selling SimplyProtein products in select U.S. stores and online. SimplyProtein products offer snacking solutions with simple, recognizable ingredients that contain satisfying protein and 3 grams of sugar or less. SimplyProtein crispy bars, baked bars and crunchy bites offer on-the-go snacks that are Non-GMO Project Verified and gluten free, with no artificial sweeteners, colors, flavors or preservatives. 
RTD Shakes. Our rich and creamy Atkins RTD shakes contain 10 to 15 grams of protein, as well as other important vitamins and minerals. Available in a variety of flavors, including cookies and crème, café caramel and creamy chocolate, RTD shakes are made with high quality ingredients and are designed to provide energy balance through the day. Our Plus RTD shakes contain 30 grams of protein, for our consumers seeking higher protein content. 
Confections. We believe our Atkins Endulge® line, which is designed to satisfy consumers’ sweet cravings, and which we call Treats, consists of delicious desserts without all of the added sugar. Atkins offers a variety of different Treats, such as peanut butter cups and pecan caramel clusters, each with only 1 gram of sugar or less and low net carbs, providing consumers with the option to indulge.
Other Products
Through third-party partnerships, we offer complementary Atkins branded frozen meals.
Licensed Frozen Meals. Atkins signed a renewable seven-year license agreement with Bellisio Foods, Inc., or “Bellisio”, effective September 1, 2016, to license its frozen meals business. Bellisio manufactures, distributes, markets, promotes and sells Atkins frozen food 
7

products under the Atkins licensed marks. These products include Atkins branded frozen breakfasts, lunches and dinners. With a large selection of meal types, including pizzas, breakfast bowls and more, we believe our frozen meals offer a great way to learn the basics of protein rich, low-carbohydrate and low-sugar eating in a simple, convenient and delicious way. The scope of the license includes all frozen meals across all retail channels (excluding online), in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.
Recipes. We offer over 1,600 protein rich, low-carbohydrate and low-sugar recipes designed to help consumers achieve and maintain a healthy lifestyle, while still enjoying delicious food.
Marketing, Advertising and Consumer Outreach
Simply Good Foods believes advocacy and education are key foundations of our approach to growth. By increasing consumer awareness about the benefits of adopting a low-carbohydrate approach to healthy eating, we are able to capture a larger audience and spread our message about the benefits of a low-carbohydrate approach to healthy living. Accordingly, we have structured our marketing and advertising not only to promote our products, but also to educate consumers.
Target Demographics
Atkins has built a large consumer following, with its weight management consumer forming the core of a much larger group of consumers looking for a more nutritious lifestyle. These consumers are an important foundation for our business. They are loyal, profitable and frequent purchasers of Atkins’ products. Beyond this group, we believe that there is significant opportunity to expand Atkins’ marketing, education and products to consumers who are not necessarily looking for a weight loss plan, but rather are focused more generally on long-term low-carbohydrate healthy living. We refer to these consumers as self-directed low-carb consumers. We believe our brand is uniquely positioned to capture both branded program consumers and self-directed low-carb consumers, and as part of our growth initiatives, we direct our marketing and advertising efforts to capitalize on this significant incremental opportunity.
Branded Program Consumers. We identify branded program consumers as those consumers open to a weight-management program. These consumers are typically of the belief that Atkins’ nutritional approach is effective, that Atkins’ food products generally make them less hungry than other approaches and that Atkins’ snacks are an effective way to facilitate weight management. Our primary message to these consumers is that our products and snacks enable weight management while still allowing consumers to maintain a sustainable and satisfying lifestyle. Atkins emphasizes to these consumers the emotional benefits of healthy living - increased energy, strength and self-esteem - and the simplicity and healthiness of its program.
Self-Directed Low-Carb Consumers. We identify self-directed low-carb consumers as those consumers not interested in a directed, programmatic approach to weight management, but who rather are interested in low-carbohydrate and low-sugar principles. These consumers are generally of the view that lowering carbohydrate and sugar intake is a better, healthier way to eat and should result in weight loss and maintenance. Our primary message to these consumers is that we offer delicious low-carbohydrate food options to provide better choices for snacking and meals. Atkins emphasizes appetite appeal and a more generalized theme of controlling carbohydrate and sugar consumption rather than weight management.
Education and Consumer Knowledge
We believe the first step in expanding our consumer base and growing our business is educating consumers on the benefits of the Atkins approach to eating and teaching them how to make smarter food choices. In order to facilitate awareness of the health benefits of a low-carbohydrate, low-sugar and protein rich eating approach and spread knowledge of what we believe are the dangers of a carbohydrate rich diet, we have established a variety of marketing and advertising strategies to connect with consumers, including digital marketing and social media platforms, television advertising, celebrity endorsements and free online consumer tracking, management and facilitation tools. We find that the more consumers know about the science behind the Atkins approach to nutritious eating, the more likely they are to rebalance their nutrition away from carbohydrates.
Celebrity Endorsements
We utilize celebrity partnerships to increase consumer awareness of our products and serve as real-life motivational and inspirational success stories. Rob Lowe is currently our official brand spokesperson, as a follower of the Atkins nutritional approach for many years. Atkins has also partnered with other celebrities, such as Lauren Alaina and Alyssa Milano, who publicly attribute their weight loss to Atkins’ products and programs. By actively supporting Atkins’ products and nutritional approach, these celebrities serve as a valuable resource contemporizing the Atkins brand, educating consumers, encouraging them to learn more about Atkins and building brand awareness.
8

Television Advertising
In addition to digital marketing and social media, we also engage in television advertising. Atkins specifically uses television as a means to encourage more consumers to learn about Atkins, share success stories and increase consumer awareness regarding the benefits of low-carbohydrate and low-sugar eating approaches. In the fifty-three week period ended August 31, 2019, approximately 39% of Atkins’ U.S. Selling and marketing expenses were spent on television advertising.
Atkins’ Tools
We maintain a dynamic arsenal of complimentary educational, nutritional and weight management tools, including a mobile app and tracker, carb counter, meal plans and shopping lists. We also maintain discussion boards and groups on the Atkins website and social media platforms to keep our consumers inspired, motivated, connected and informed.
Mobile App. The Atkins mobile app allows consumers to search, track and plan their meals on their mobile phone or tablet. The app includes a comprehensive food search, which helps consumers find nutritional information for grocery items, restaurant meals, and Atkins-friendly recipes and products. The recently upgraded meal tracker allows consumers to track net carbs consumed based on their specific program. The progress tracker allows consumers to record their weight, body measurements and exercise to track weight loss to date and proximity to their goal weight. In addition, the mobile app includes over 1,000 recipes, making it simple to find and prepare low-carbohydrate and low-sugar meals.
Carb Counter. On Atkins’ website, Atkins offers a user-friendly guide to count carbohydrates. The Carb Counter tracks hundreds of different foods to assist consumers in tracking their daily carb intake. Specifically, the Carb Counter focuses on net carbs that effect blood sugar.
Meal Plans & Shopping Lists. Whether looking to cook or preferring grab-and-go, Atkins offers meal plans that fit a plethora of lifestyles. These meal plans are easily downloaded from Atkins’ website. These meal plans outline what consumers should eat throughout the day, including snacks.
Discussion Boards and Groups. Atkins maintains discussion boards on its website so that its consumers can connect with Atkins professionals and other members of the Atkins community. The discussion boards allow consumers to engage with Atkins nutrition professionals to receive advice and encouragement. Groups, also available on the website, facilitate support and encouragement among consumers and allow them to connect with one another and share their interests and goals. There are over 100 groups that a consumer may join, such as “Vegetarians on Atkins,” “Atkins Newbies” and “Continuing to Lose Weight”. A consumer may even start his or her own group.
Digital Marketing and Social Media
We dedicate a sizeable portion of our marketing and advertising spend to digital marketing channels. We maintain a registered domain at www.atkins.com, which serves as the primary source of information regarding Atkins’ products. In fiscal 2019, Atkins had approximately 9 million new visitors to its website, based on internal tracking. The Atkins website is used as a platform for consumer testimonials and success stories, and as a means to communicate simple nutrition choices that we believe can deliver a healthy holistic lifestyle and sustainable weight management.
We use social media platforms extensively for online collaboration like iPhone and Android smartphone apps, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. These platforms are fundamentally changing the way we engage with our consumers and allow Atkins to directly reach desirable target demographics, such as millennials.
Facebook. We maintain an Atkins Facebook page, which we use to facilitate consumer services, distribute brand information and news, and publish videos and pictures promoting the brand. We also conduct regular contests and giveaways. As of October 2019, Atkins had approximately 829,000 Facebook followers.
Instagram. We maintain an Atkins Instagram account, @atkinsnutritionals, which we use as motivational, inspirational and aspirational publishing, and as an authentic representation of low-carb lifestyles. We frequently publish consumer success stories, and conduct regular contests for our consumers. As of October 2019, Atkins had approximately 75,000 Instagram followers.
Twitter. We maintain an active Atkins Twitter account, @atkinsinsider, which we use to disseminate trending news and information, as well as to publish short format tips, tricks and hacks. We also engage in chats with success stories, and conduct regular contests for our consumers. As of October 2019, Atkins had approximately 41,000 Twitter followers.

Product Innovation
A portion of our sales is driven by new products, and as a result, we believe innovation is, and will continue to be, an important component of our business. We take a deliberate approach to new product development, focusing on enhancing existing products, innovating flavor and form varieties and expanding into adjacent snacking products. Our innovation model is designed to respond to competitive demands, with a primary focus on enhancing the quality and flavor of our products while simplifying composition and reducing the number of ingredients to meet consumer demands for cleaner labels.
Our innovation strategy is based on ongoing research into consumers’ healthy lifestyle and nutritional needs. We pride ourselves on knowing our consumers and developing products that meet their needs. The average Atkins consumers purchases about 45 servings per year with multi-year consumers purchasing nearly 95 servings annually. Providing variety in snacking options to our consumers is an important strategy in our product innovation. New flavors, textures and snacking formats, like our new peppermint patties, are important to meeting consumer needs.
Management believes that an important component of meeting consumers' nutritional needs is a focus on evolving current products and creating new products with cleaner and fewer ingredients. Accordingly, we are committed to continually finding new and innovative formulations to reduce the number of ingredients in our products, as well as using “better-for-you” ingredients like nuts, fiber and whey protein, while continually improving taste and quality.
We maintain an in-house research and development team as well as market research and consumer insight capabilities. Through our research and development lab in Louisville, Colorado, we control the brand’s innovations and product formulations from the ground up. By developing new products, prototypes and adjacencies in-house, we facilitate our core competencies in product innovation, and enhance our speed to market.
In addition, as part of our innovation process, we collaborate with nationally recognized third-party flavor houses and product development firms for new product development and then conduct our own proprietary consumer research to identify and improve upon new product concepts. We plan to continue to conduct extensive consumer research in order to develop successful new products including product flavor and concept testing, marketing and trend analysis and consumer prototype testing.
Management also believes the fragmented snacking category presents a substantial opportunity for consolidation and the opportunity to build, through disciplined acquisitions, a leading platform in the snacking space and broader food category. As a leader in nutritious snacking, management believes we have the unique capability to leverage our operating platform and customer relationships to expand beyond the Atkins brand. Our experienced management team has deep expertise in brand building to expand the business into additional brands and products in the snacking segment. Simply Good Foods is actively seeking to identify and evaluate new acquisition opportunities to complement the Atkins platform, as evidenced by our pending acquisition of Quest, and sees significant opportunity for growth and synergies in complementary adjacent snacking categories such as sports/active and adult nutritional snacks, salty snacks and protein snacks, as well as in the “better-for-you” eating space. 
Intellectual Property
We own numerous domestic and international trademarks and other proprietary rights that are important to our business. Depending upon the jurisdiction, trademarks are valid as long as they are used in the regular course of trade and/or their registrations are properly maintained. We believe the protection of our trademarks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress and trade secrets are important to our success. We aggressively protect our intellectual property rights by relying on a combination of watch services and trademark, copyright, patent, trade dress and trade secret laws, and through the domain name dispute resolution system. Atkins domain name is www.atkins.com, which has traffic of approximately 9 million new visitors in 2019 based on internal estimates. We also own virtually all of the recipes and specifications to our products.
Competition
We compete primarily with nutritional snacking brands in large retail environments. The nutritional snacking industry is fragmented and highly competitive, and includes a number of diverse competitors.
Our identified competitors include, but are not limited to, CLIF Bar, KIND bars, Special K, Slimfast, Muscle Milk, Premier Nutrition and thinkThin. On August 21, 2019, we announced that we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Quest, a healthy, lifestyle food brand. See “Recent Developments” for additional information on the Acquisition. 
We believe that the principal competitive factors in the nutritional snacking and weight management industries are:

• | ingredients;


• | taste;

10


• | low-carbohydrate, low-sugar, protein rich versus other nutritional approaches;


• | convenience;


• | brand awareness and loyalty among consumers;


• | media spending;


• | product variety and packaging; and


• | access to retailer shelf space.

We believe that we currently compete effectively with respect to each of these factors. However, a number of companies in the nutritional snacking and weight management industry have greater financial resources, more comprehensive product lines, broader market presence, longer standing relationships with distributors and suppliers, longer operating histories, greater distribution capabilities, stronger brand recognition and greater marketing resources than we have.
Supply Chain
We operate an asset-light business model. For the manufacture of our products, we subcontract with contract manufacturers, and as a result, our operations are highly flexible and require minimal capital expenditure. The supply chain for our international business also uses exclusively contract manufacturers, and is completely separate from our North American supply chain, which is described below.
U.S. Supply Chain. The majority of our products are shipped directly to one central warehouse, which is a leased warehouse managed by a third-party logistics provider who then distributes products to customers. For certain customers, RTD shakes are shipped directly from the contract manufacturer to the customer's location. In addition, our use of demand forecasting and vendor-managed inventory systems enable us to meet shipping demands, ensure timely delivery of orders and offer service levels to our customers.
Sourcing. The principal ingredients to manufacture our products include chocolate and other coatings, dairy, proteins, soy and nuts. Our packaging supplies consist of flexible film, cartons, tetra paper and corrugate. All of our core ingredients are purchased according to rigorous standards to assure food quality and safety. These core ingredients are generally available in adequate quantities from suppliers. We visit with major suppliers to source competitively priced, quality ingredients that meet our standards. We manage actively the cost of some ingredients including milk protein concentrate, whey proteins, chocolate coatings, some nuts, soy crisps and liquid soy, as well as packaging—corrugated, film, printed boxes and tetra paper.
Manufacturing. We rely on contract manufacturers to manufacture our products. The contract manufacturers schedule and purchase ingredient inventory independently, according to parameters set in their contracts and forecasts we provide. Our contract manufacturers are regularly audited by third parties and are required to follow rigorous food safety guidelines. We believe our contract manufacturers have capacity to meet our anticipated supply needs, although short term high demand can cause disruptions. We monitor both near-term and long-term capacity as well as fulfillment rates and overall performance of our manufacturing partners and qualify alternate suppliers as needed. We receive finished products from our contract manufacturers, which includes all packaging and ingredients used, as well as an agreed-upon tolling charge for each item produced. These finished products are then shipped directly to our distribution center in Greenfield, Indiana, or shipped directly from the contract manufacturer to the customer, in the case of RTDs to select customers. 
U.S. Storage. We have one leased distribution center in Greenfield, Indiana, referred to as the Distribution Center, where we store finished goods. The Distribution Center has approximately 423,000 square feet of floor space.
Distribution. For the majority of our customers, our logistics provider distributes the finished goods via truckloads from our Distribution Center, which first flow through regional terminals. At the terminals, our orders are consolidated with other customer orders. The finished goods are then distributed to retailer distribution centers. The regular weekly shipments and consolidation have diminished our costs. We manage approximately 44% of outgoing volume by writing our own orders to retailer distribution centers and maintaining agreed finished goods inventory levels at their warehouse(s). For direct to customer shipments, a third party logistic provider ships products directly from a contract manufacturer's warehouse to the customer. 
Retailers. We have a wide variety of customers across the mass, food, club, drug, and e-commerce channels. Walmart Stores, Inc. (“Walmart”), our largest customer represents approximately 44% of consolidated sales of Simply Good Foods in fiscal year 2019, of which approximately 36% is through their mass retail channel and approximately 8% is through their club channel. No other customer represents more than 10% of sales.
E-Commerce. We aim to ensure that our consumers may access our brand in the way that best suits their lifestyles by offering home delivery of Atkins’ snacking products. We sell our products on Atkins.com as well as Amazon.com. 
Food Safety and Quality. Food safety and quality is a top priority and we dedicate substantial resources to ensure that consumers receive safe, high quality food products. Our products are manufactured in facilities that have programs and controls in place regarding

consistent quality and food safety. Product attributes, such as taste, aroma, texture and appearance are regularly monitored. Good Manufacturing Practices and comprehensive food safety programs are designed to produce a safe, wholesome product. Our suppliers are required to have equally robust processes in place and confirm their compliance with product specifications with Letters of Guaranty and Certificates of Analysis for shipments of core ingredients to be used in our products. Finally, random samples of finished goods are regularly sent to a third-party laboratory for testing.
International. Our products are also sold outside North America. Our top international sales are in Australia/New Zealand and the Netherlands. For the fifty-three week period ended August 31, 2019, international net sales represented approximately 5% of total net sales. Our international supply chain is self-sufficient and run by a lean team solely focused on international operations. Similar to U.S. operations, international operations utilize contract manufacturers for products, and distributors for distributions and sales. 
Atkins’ History
Dr. Robert Atkins was a cardiologist who discovered that by controlling carbohydrate consumption in his patients, he could improve their health and lower their weight. In 1972, Dr. Robert Atkins published a book, Dr. Atkins’ Diet Revolution, and became famous as a diet doctor. He also founded a company, Atkins Nutritionals, to make food products that were consistent with his approach to nutrition. In the 1980s and 1990s, Atkins was a doctor-founded diet brand. In 2003, Atkins was acquired from its founders by Parthenon and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners. In the early 2000s, in the midst of the low carb diet craze, the Atkins diet was the most popular diet in the U.S., with one in two adults claiming they were using Atkins for weight loss. The strategy pursued by management at that time was to proliferate the brand into numerous categories within the grocery store. Atkins launched over 1,100 SKUs in categories such as bread, macaroni and cheese, ice cream, barbecue sauce, vitamin pills and supplements—categories well beyond Atkins’ core snacking business. As the low carb diet craze faded, those new products did not sell well and Atkins filed for bankruptcy in 2005. Atkins re-emerged from bankruptcy in 2006, and was subsequently acquired by North Castle Partners in 2007. Atkins repositioned the business based on two strategies: a focus on core, programmatic weight loss consumers, and a focus on healthy snacking. Roark Capital Group (“Roark“) acquired Atkins in 2010. Atkins positioned the brand to consumers as a balanced approach to weight loss and upgraded the snacking products to improve taste and expand flavor variety. Supported by increased levels of marketing spending, those strategies resulted in eight consecutive years of U.S. Multi-Outlet Retail Sales growth. In 2016, Atkins evolved its strategy to continue to target consumers focused on a programmatic approach to weight loss, while adding a new target consumer: self-directed low carbohydrate consumers, who prefer a self-directed, rather than programmatic, approach to nutrition. Since 2016, Atkins has purposefully and thoughtfully broadened the brand, positioning toward a healthier approach to eating, while focusing on the core snacking business.
Segments
Our business is organized around one reportable segment that sells its branded nutritional foods and snacking products designed around the nutrition principles of the Atkins eating approach, which is based on our go-to-market strategies, the objectives of the business and how our chief decision maker, the CEO, monitors operating performance and allocates resources.
Employees
As of August 31, 2019, we had approximately 150 employees, including international employees. None of the U.S. employees are represented by a labor union or are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that we have good relations with our employees.
Regulation and Compliance
Along with contract manufacturers, brokers, distributors, ingredients and packaging suppliers, Simply Good Foods is primarily subject to laws and regulations in the United States promulgated by federal, state and local government authorities.

Under various statutes, these agencies, among other things, prescribe the requirements and establish the standards for quality and safety and regulate marketing and advertising to consumers. Certain of these agencies, in certain circumstances, must not only approve products, but also review the manufacturing processes and facilities used to produce these products before they can be marketed in the United States.
Simply Good Foods is subject to labor and employment laws, laws governing advertising, privacy laws, safety regulations and other laws, including consumer protection regulations that regulate retailers or govern the promotion and sale of merchandise.

We continue to monitor their development and our compliance.
