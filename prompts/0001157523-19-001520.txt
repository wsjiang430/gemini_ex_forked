Overview
 
Culp, Inc. manufactures, sources, and markets mattress fabrics and sewn covers used for covering mattresses and foundations and other bedding products; and upholstery fabrics, including cut and sewn kits, primarily used in production of upholstered furniture. Our new home accessories segment is the company’s finished product and global e-commerce business that manufactures, sources, and markets bedding accessories and home goods directly to consumers and businesses. The company competes in a fashion-driven business, and we strive to differentiate ourselves by placing a sustained focus on product innovation and creativity. In addition, Culp places great emphasis on providing excellent and dependable service to our customers. Our focused efforts to protect our financial strength have allowed us to maintain our position as a financially stable and trusted supplier of innovative fabrics to bedding and furniture manufacturers, while also developing a new e-commerce platform to support sales of bedding accessories and specialty home goods to both consumers and business retailers.
 
We believe Culp is the largest producer of mattress fabrics in North America and one of the largest marketers of upholstery fabrics for furniture in North America, measured by total sales. We have three operating segments — mattress fabrics, upholstery fabrics, and home accessories. The mattress fabrics business markets primarily knitted and woven fabrics, as well as sewn covers made from those fabrics, which are used in the production of bedding products, including mattresses, foundations, and mattress sets. The upholstery fabrics business markets a variety of fabric products that are used principally in the production of residential and commercial upholstered furniture, including sofas, recliners, chairs, loveseats, sectionals, sofa-beds, and office seating, as well as window treatment products and installation services for customers in the hospitality and commercial industries. The home accessories business markets a variety of bedding accessories and home goods, including mattress pads and protectors, sheet sets, pillows, comforters, duvet covers, towels, fabric by the yard, and dog beds, directly to consumers and businesses through global e-commerce and business-to-business sales channels. Through our June 22, 2018 investment in eLuxury, LLC (“eLuxury”), we now have a majority-owned company located in Evansville, Indiana, which operates the global e-commerce platform for the home accessories segment.
 
Culp markets a variety of fabrics and other products in different categories to a global customer base, including fabrics produced at our manufacturing facilities and fabrics produced by other suppliers. As of the end of fiscal 2019, we had active production facilities located in North Carolina; Tennessee; Quebec, Canada; Shanghai, China; and a joint venture facility in Haiti. We also source fabrics and cut and sewn kits from other manufacturers, located primarily in China, Turkey, and Vietnam, with almost all of such fabrics and cut and sewn kits produced specifically for Culp and created by Culp designers. Additionally, our home accessories segment markets a variety of mattress pad products manufactured at our facility in Indiana, and also sources other finished bedding accessory and home good products internally from our other business segments, as well as from other manufacturers located primarily in the United States, China, and Southeast Asia.  We operate distribution centers in North Carolina, Canada, China, and Haiti to facilitate distribution of our fabric products. Products for our home accessories segment are available for sale on eLuxury’s own branded website, eLuxury.com, and through leading online retailers for specialty home goods. These products are primarily distributed from our facility in Indiana, as well as U.S. fulfillment centers for certain products and third-party online retailers.

Over the past decade, the portion of total company sales represented by fabrics produced outside of the U.S. and Canada has increased, while sales of goods produced in the U.S. have decreased. This trend is related primarily to the upholstery fabrics segment, where, following the closure of our manufacturing facility in Anderson, South Carolina during the second quarter of fiscal 2019, substantially all of our sales consisted of fabrics produced in Asia. The mattress fabrics business remains mostly based in North America. For the home accessories segment, approximately 40% of our sales in fiscal 2019 consisted of products produced outside of the United States.
 
Total net sales in fiscal 2019 were $296.7 million. The mattress fabrics segment had net sales of $145.1 million (49% of total net sales), the upholstery fabrics segment had net sales of $135.6 million (46% of total net sales), and the home accessories segment had net sales of 16.0 million (5% of total net sales).
 
Sales increased in our upholstery fabrics segment and declined in our mattress fabrics segment during fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018. The mattress fabrics segment was affected by significant challenges, primarily associated with low-priced imported mattresses from China, which disrupted the bedding industry and reduced demand for our mattress fabrics and sewn covers. The upholstery fabrics segment was affected by uncertainties surrounding international tariffs and a softer retail environment for furniture, primarily during the second half of fiscal 2019. The decline in mattress fabrics sales reversed a trend of increasing sales over the last several years, while the increase in upholstery fabrics sales built upon the sales increase for this segment in fiscal 2018, reversing a multi-year trend of sales declines.
 
This is our first year of reporting for our new home accessories segment, commencing with the June 2018 majority investment in eLuxury. This segment experienced challenges during fiscal 2019 related to new product roll-out costs, reduced demand for legacy mattress pad products, and the overall weaker retail environment during the second half of the year.
 
Overall, Culp faced a difficult business environment during fiscal 2019. Despite these challenges, both the mattress fabrics segment and upholstery fabrics segment continued to build upon strategic initiatives and structural changes that were implemented over the last several years. A number of steps were taken in prior years to consolidate and streamline operations, while adding capacity where necessary. These initiatives continued in fiscal 2019, with the mattress fabrics segment consolidating its weaving operations to one facility, our plant in Quebec, Canada, in order to maximize efficiencies and improve our cost structure. The mattress fabrics segment also expanded production of our CLASS sewn mattress covers in Haiti and China to meet customer demand in the growing boxed bedding market. Additionally, the upholstery fabrics segment closed its manufacturing facility in Anderson, South Carolina due to a continued decline in demand for the products manufactured at this facility. Late in fiscal 2019, this segment developed strategic supplier relationships in Vietnam for additional sourcing of our cut and sewn kits, which has allowed us to begin altering our supply chains to meet customer demands in conjunction with ongoing trade disputes between the U.S. and China. The flexible manufacturing and sourcing platform created through these changes has allowed Culp to place a greater emphasis on product innovation and the introduction of new designs to keep current with industry trends. At the same time, it allows us to differentiate our products and respond to shifting demand trends.

In addition to internal strategic actions, the company has made recent acquisitions to expand our product offering and enhance our ability to reach new customers and markets. Late in fiscal 2018, the upholstery segment acquired Read Window Products, a window treatments company providing expanded capacity and additional capabilities for our growing business in the hospitality industry. Additionally, in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we acquired a majority interest in eLuxury, an e-commerce company offering bedding accessories and home good products direct to consumers, which has provided a new sales channel and an expanded addressable market for the company’s finished products in the bedding accessories and home goods categories. These acquisitions represent a continuation of our efforts to diversify our product offerings and expand the markets into which we sell those products, as industry demand from our traditional markets has been inconsistent during the past several years.
 
We have continued to experience positive responses from customers to our innovative designs and new products introduced during recent years. An increasing percentage of our sales are now coming from those latest product introductions. The upholstery fabrics segment has experienced strong demand for its LiveSmart® brand of performance fabrics. In the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we launched an expansion of this performance line to include a sustainable fabric line utilizing recycled fibers combined with LiveSmart® performance technology. Additionally, our new home accessories business segment developed and introduced a number of new bedding accessories and home good items, including dog beds, fabrics by the yard, and a new mattress pad line, during the second half of fiscal 2019. These new products were developed in coordination with our other business segments utilizing Culp fabrics.

Additional financial information about our operating segments can be found in Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report.
 
Mattress Fabrics. The mattress fabrics segment, also known as Culp Home Fashions, manufactures and markets mattress fabrics and mattress covers to bedding manufacturers. These products include woven jacquard fabrics, knitted fabrics, and some converted fabrics. Culp Home Fashions has manufacturing facilities located in Stokesdale and High Point, North Carolina, and St. Jerome, Quebec, Canada. The division also sources products internally from Culp China, as well as from a supplier in Turkey, based on our own designs and production schedule. Additionally, Culp Home Fashions has a joint venture mattress cover facility in Haiti and utilizes the Culp China platform for the production of sewn mattress covers as well. Knitted fabrics are produced at both the Stokesdale and St. Jerome facilities, while jacquard (damask) fabric is now produced solely at the St. Jerome facility following consolidation of our weaving operations during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. The majority of our finishing and inspection processes for mattress fabrics are conducted at the Stokesdale plant, while the St. Jerome plant provides additional capacity and a second location for these processes. Both of these facilities now offer finished goods distribution capabilities, with a new distribution facility in Canada added during fiscal 2017. The Stokesdale plant continues to house the division offices.
 
Culp Home Fashions had capital expenditures totaling $74 million during the past ten years, with especially high spending levels during the four fiscal years spanning fiscal 2015 through fiscal 2018.  These expenditures provided for increased knit machine capacity, faster and more efficient weaving machines, and the initial capital required for our sewn cover business, while also allowing us to maintain our leading-edge technology through modernization and expansion projects. These capital expenditures also provided high technology finishing equipment for woven and knitted fabric and a much-improved U.S. platform for warehousing and distribution, along with the new distribution facility in Canada noted above.
 
Asset acquisition transactions in fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2014 allowed us to enhance and secure our competitive position and to expand our mattress fabrics business. Taken together, the two transactions allowed us to secure our supply for knitted mattress fabrics, an important and growing product category, while also gaining control of product development and improving customer service. In addition to these transactions, we have continued to make further investments in knitting machines and finishing equipment, increasing our internal production capacity.
 
Our sewn mattress cover business, established during fiscal 2013 and owned by Culp, has a manufacturing plant in High Point, North Carolina. This facility is leased by the company, and its operation involves a limited capital investment in equipment. The business participates in a joint marketing arrangement for the production and marketing of sewn mattress covers with A. Lava & Son Co. of Chicago, a leading provider of mattress covers. The marketing venture is known as Culp-Lava Applied Sewn Solutions (CLASS). In fiscal 2017, in response to continued growth in mattress cover demand, we entered into a joint venture with A Lava to construct a second location for our CLASS operations in Haiti, and that joint-venture facility began production of mattress covers for our CLASS business during the second quarter of 2018. We also utilize our Culp China platform to manufacture sewn mattress covers for our CLASS business and to source these products from third-party suppliers in China. These three manufacturing locations in North Carolina, Haiti, and China give us repetitive production capabilities and allow us greater flexibility in meeting demand for mattress covers from bedding producers.

As noted above, fiscal 2018 marked the completion of several multi-year capital projects for the mattress fabrics business, including consolidating certain operations, expanding capacity, improving efficiency and customer service, and maintaining our flexible approach to fabric sourcing.  In fiscal 2019, we continued these initiatives by consolidating our weaving operations to one facility, our plant in Quebec, Canada, and also expanding production of our CLASS sewn mattress covers in Haiti and China to meet customer demand in the growing boxed bedding market.  Additionally, we continued to expand our design capabilities, launching product software and a new library system for cataloguing creations to drive marketing and enhance innovation.
 
After eight consecutive years of growth, sales declined in fiscal 2019, mainly as a result of the acceleration of low-priced mattress imports from China towards the end of fiscal 2018 and through the first three quarters of fiscal 2019. This disrupted the U.S. bedding industry and resulted in a decline in sales for domestic bedding manufacturers, which affected us as a supplier to those manufacturers. In May of 2019, the U.S. Department of Commerce imposed punitive anti-dumping measures against Chinese-made mattresses. We believe this action ultimately will provide some relief for the domestic mattress industry. At the same time, management took action during fiscal 2019 to respond to the challenging business environment by consolidating our weaving operations into one facility, expanding production of our CLASS sewn mattress covers in Haiti and China, controlling costs, and maintaining a focus on providing customers with products that remain in demand and upholding high levels of customer service.
 
Upholstery Fabrics. The upholstery fabrics segment markets fabrics for residential and commercial furniture, including jacquard woven fabrics, velvets, micro denier suedes, woven dobbies, knitted fabrics, piece-dyed woven products, and polyurethane “leather look” fabrics. With the acquisition of Read Window Products at the end of fiscal 2018, this segment also markets window treatment products and installation services, including roller shades, drapery, hardware, and top-of-mattress soft goods, for customers in the hospitality and commercial industries.
 
Following the closure of our manufacturing facility in Anderson, South Carolina during the second quarter of fiscal 2019, this segment currently operates two manufacturing facilities in Shanghai, China. We market cut and sewn fabric kits produced in these locations, as well as a variety of upholstery fabrics and cut and sewn kits sourced from third party producers, mostly in China and, toward the end of fiscal 2019, in Vietnam. Following the closure of our South Carolina facility, sales of non-U.S. produced upholstery accounted for substantially all of our upholstery fabric sales. Our China facilities in Shanghai include production of cut and sewn “kits” made to specifications of furniture manufacturing customers using sourced fabrics, as well as design, finishing, warehousing, quality control and inspection operations. We continue to expand our marketing efforts to sell our China products in countries other than the U.S., including the Chinese local market. Additionally, we fabricate a variety of window treatments, using mostly customer-supplied fabrics and materials, at our facility in Knoxville, Tennessee.
 
Our upholstery fabrics business has moved from one that relied on a large fixed capital base that is difficult to adjust to a more flexible and scalable marketer of upholstery fabrics that meets changing levels of customer demand and tastes. At the same time, we have maintained control of the most important “value added” aspects of our business, such as design, finishing, quality control, and logistics. This strategic approach has allowed us to limit our investment of capital in fixed assets and control the costs of our products, while continuing to leverage our design and finishing expertise, industry knowledge, and important relationships.
  7
 
After six consecutive years of sales growth, sales declined in fiscal 2016 and 2017, mainly as a result of a weaker demand environment for upholstered furniture, before increasing by 10% in fiscal 2018 and 3.5% in fiscal 2019.  Our higher sales over the last two fiscal years were supported by our efforts to expand the breadth of this segment’s customer base to include more residential furniture manufacturers, including customers in international markets, as well as the growing success of our line of performance fabrics, such as LiveSmart®. Additionally, fiscal 2019 includes the first full year of sales from Read Window Products, our window treatment and installation services businesses for customers in the hospitality and commercial industries, which more than offset the loss of sales from the closure of our Anderson, South Carolina facility during the second quarter. We believe our success over the longer term is due largely to a business strategy that has included: 1) innovation in a low-cost environment, 2) speed-to-market execution, 3) consistent quality, 4) reliable service and lead times, and 5) increased recognition of and reliance on the Culp brand.
 
Our progress has been achieved through a unique business model that has enabled the upholstery fabrics segment to execute a strategy that we believe is clearly differentiated from our competitors. In this way, we have maintained our ability to provide furniture manufacturers with products from every category of fabric used to cover upholstered furniture and meet continually changing demand levels and consumer preferences. In recent years, we have implemented additional steps to grow net sales, including an emphasis on markets beyond residential furniture, such as the hospitality market. One result of these efforts was the acquisition of Read Window Products at the end of fiscal 2018, representing a significant expansion of our production capabilities in the hospitality market, along with the addition of window treatment installation services.
 
Home Accessories. Culp acquired a majority interest in eLuxury, an online retailer of bedding accessories and home goods, during the first quarter of fiscal 2019, which is now reported under our new home accessories segment. This strategic investment represents the company’s first foray into direct to consumer sales, adding a new sales channel and an expanded addressable market for finished products.
 
The home accessories segment markets bedding accessories and home goods directly to consumers and businesses through global e-commerce and business-to-business sales channels.  The primary products for this segment include mattress pads manufactured at eLuxury’s facility located in Evansville, Indiana, as well as other bedding accessory and home good products, including mattress protectors, sheet sets, pillows, comforters, duvet covers, towels, fabric by the yard, and dog beds.  Some of these products are sourced internally from Culp’s other business segments, while others are sourced from other manufacturers located primarily in the United States, China, and Southeast Asia.
 
Products for the home accessories segment are available on eLuxury’s own branded website, eLuxury.com, and through leading online retailers for specialty home goods.  Inventory for this segment primarily is stored at and distributed from eLuxury’s facility in Indiana, as well as U.S. fulfillment centers for certain products and third-party online retailers.
  8
 
Our strategic focus for this segment is to develop innovative bedding accessory products and other specialty home good items through the company’s global manufacturing platform and in coordination with all of Culp’s other business segments.  During the second half of fiscal 2019, we developed and launched new products featuring Culp mattress fabrics and upholstery fabrics, including mattress pads and mattress protectors made with Culp mattress fabrics and dog beds made with LiveSmart® performance fabric. Additionally, we are focused on expanding our sales channels beyond eLuxury’s global e-commerce platform to reach business retailers, both in brick and mortar stores and through their online platforms, as well as customers in the hospitality industry.
 
Overview of Industry and Markets
 
Culp markets products primarily to manufacturers, as well as business retailers, hospitality customers, and consumers. The mattress fabrics segment and home accessories segment supply the bedding industry, which produces mattress sets (mattresses, box springs, foundations and top of bed components) and bedding accessory products. The upholstery fabrics segment primarily supplies the residential furniture industry and, to a lesser extent, the commercial furniture industry. The residential furniture market includes upholstered furniture sold to consumers for household use, including sofas, sofa-beds, chairs, recliners, and sectionals. The commercial furniture, fabrics, and window treatments market includes fabrics and window treatment products used in the hospitality industry (primarily hotels and motels); fabrics used for upholstered office seating and modular office systems sold primarily for use in offices and other institutional settings, as well as commercial textile wall coverings; and window treatments for commercial application. The home accessories segment also supplies the home goods markets, which includes a variety of home décor, housewares, furnishings, and accessory products.  The principal industries into which the company sells products – the bedding industry and residential and commercial furniture industry – are described in more detail below. Currently, a great majority of our products for our mattress fabrics and upholstery fabrics segments are sold to manufacturers for end use in the U.S., and thus the discussions below are focused on that market.
 
Overview of Bedding Industry
 
The bedding industry has contracted and expanded in recent years in accordance with the general economy, although traditionally the industry has been relatively mature and stable. This is due in part to the fact that a majority of bedding industry sales are replacement purchases, which are less volatile than sales based on economic growth and new household formations.  Until recently, the U.S. bedding industry has largely remained a North American-based business, with limited competition from imports.  This dynamic has mainly been due to short lead times demanded by mattress manufacturers and retailers, the customized nature of product lines, the relatively low direct labor content in mattresses, and strong brand recognition.  Imports of bedding into the U.S. had been increasing gradually in recent years, but this trend significantly accelerated over the past two years, especially for lower-priced bedding.  During this time, China has accounted for the largest share of the imported units.  The result has been a decline in sales for the major U.S. bedding manufacturers, which has affected major suppliers, including Culp, to those manufacturers.
  9
 
As a result of the significant influx of low-priced imports from China, a number of domestic “mattress petitioners” filed an anti-dumping petition with the U.S. International Trade Commission and the U.S. Department of Commerce in September of 2018.  In November of 2018, the U.S. International Trade Commission found a reasonable indication that unfairly traded imports of mattresses from China caused material injury to the U.S. mattress industry, and in May of 2019, the Department of Commerce imposed punitive anti-dumping duties against Chinese-made mattresses.  We believe that, in anticipation of this ruling, the level of mattress imports entering the U.S. from China began to decline substantially in March and April 2019.  We expect this decline will continue as a result of the Department of Commerce ruling, although mattress imports from Vietnam, as well as other countries, may continue to rise as China producers move production out of China to avoid the anti-dumping duties.
 
A key trend driving the bedding industry is the increased demand for roll-packed/compressed mattresses in both online and traditional sales channels, as consumer acceptance of boxed beds as a delivery mechanism continues to drive growth and increase market share for this product, increasing potential demand for sewn mattress covers.   Another important trend is the increased awareness among consumers about the health benefits of better sleep, with an increased focus on the quality of bedding products and an apparent willingness on the part of consumers to upgrade their bedding. A further trend is the strong and growing emphasis on the design knitted or woven into mattress fabrics to appeal to the customer’s visual attraction and perceived value of the mattress on the retail floor. Mattress fabric design efforts are based on current trends in home decor and fashion. Additionally, the growth in non- traditional sources for retail mattress sales, such as online e-commerce channels and wholesale warehouse clubs, has the potential to increase overall consumption of goods due to convenience and high traffic volume, which in turn results in higher turnover of product. Among fabric types, knitted fabrics have continued to increase in popularity.  Knitted fabric was initially used primarily on premium mattresses, but these products are now being placed increasingly on mattresses at mid-range to lower retail price points.
 
Overview of Residential and Commercial Furniture Industry
 
Sales of residential and commercial furniture were both severely affected by the global economic downturn in fiscal years 2008 and 2009 and have now been in recovery for several years along with the overall economy. The pace of recovery, however, has been uneven and often weak in recent years. In general, sales of residential furniture are influenced significantly by the housing industry and by trends in home sales and household formations, while demand for commercial furniture generally reflects economic trends affecting businesses.
 
The sourcing of components and fully assembled furniture from overseas continues to play a major role in the furniture industry. By far, the largest source for these imports continues to be China. Imports of upholstery fabric, both in roll and in “kit” form, have also had a significant impact on the market for upholstery fabrics in recent years. Fabrics entering the U.S. from China and other low labor cost countries have resulted in increased price competition in the upholstery fabric and upholstered furniture markets.
 
In general, the residential furniture industry has been consolidating for several years. The result of this trend is fewer, but larger, customers for marketers of upholstery fabrics. Intense price competition continues to be an important consideration for both residential and commercial furniture.
  10
 
Additionally, with the ongoing global trade dispute between the U.S. and China, including the imposition of tariffs during fiscal 2019 and the possibility for additional tariffs on China imports, some customers are now beginning to alter supply chains away from China.
 
Products
 
As described above, our products include mattress fabrics and upholstery fabrics, which are two of our identified operating segments. These fabrics are sold in roll form and as sewn mattress covers by the mattress fabrics segment, and in roll form and as cut and sewn kits by the upholstery fabrics segment.  Additionally, with the acquisition of Read Window Products, our upholstery segment products also include window treatments and related products.  Products for our new home accessories segment include a variety of finished good bedding accessories and specialty home goods.
Mattress Fabrics Segment
 
Mattress fabrics segment sales constituted 49% of our total net sales for fiscal 2019, compared with 60% for fiscal 2018.  The company has emphasized fabrics that have broad appeal at prices generally ranging from $1.50 to more than $10.00 per yard.
Upholstery Fabrics Segment
 
Upholstery fabrics segment sales totaled 46% of our sales for fiscal 2019, compared with 40% of for fiscal 2018. The company has emphasized fabrics that have broad appeal at “good” and “better” prices, generally ranging from $3.00 to $12.00 per yard.
Home Accessories Segment
 
Sales for our new home accessories segment totaled 5% of our sales for fiscal 2019, with no prior year sales.
 
Culp Product Categories by Segment
 
We market products in most categories of fabric that manufacturers currently use for bedding and furniture. Additionally, with the acquisition of Read Window Products, we also market window treatment products to customers in the hospitality and commercial industries.  Our home accessories segment markets a variety of finished bedding accessories and home goods sold directly to consumers, as well as business retailers in the bedding and home furnishings industries and customers in the hospitality industry.  The following table indicates the product lines within each segment, and, with respect to the fabric products, a brief description of their characteristics.

Manufacturing and Sourcing
 
Mattress Fabrics Segment
 
Our mattress fabrics segment operates four manufacturing plants, with two located in North Carolina, one in St. Jerome, Quebec, Canada and a joint venture facility in Haiti.  Over the past ten fiscal years, we made capital expenditures of approximately $74 million to consolidate our production facilities and to modernize both knit and weaving equipment, enhance and provide knit and woven finishing capabilities, and expand capacity. The result has been an increase in manufacturing efficiency and reductions in operating costs, as well as expanded product offerings and capacity.
 
Knitted fabrics are produced at both our Stokesdale facility and our St. Jerome plant, while production of jacquard mattress fabrics was consolidated into the St. Jerome facility during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. The majority of our finishing and inspection processes for mattress fabrics are conducted at the Stokesdale plant, with the St. Jerome plant providing additional capacity and a second location for these processes, along with distribution capabilities. We produce sewn mattress covers at our manufacturing facility in High Point, North Carolina, at our joint venture facility in Haiti, and at the manufacturing facilities of our Culp China platform in China. Our sewn cover business participates in a joint marketing arrangement for the production and marketing of sewn mattress covers with A. Lava & Son Co. of Chicago, a leading provider of mattress covers. This marketing venture is known as Culp-Lava Applied Sewn Solutions (CLASS). Our High Point facility for our sewn cover business is a leased space with limited capital investment in equipment. In fiscal 2017, we entered into a 50/50 joint venture with A. Lava to construct a second location for our CLASS operations in Haiti, and this joint venture facility began production of mattress covers for our CLASS business during the second quarter of fiscal 2018. Additionally, we utilize the company’s Culp China platform to manufacture sewn mattress covers for our CLASS business. These three manufacturing locations give us repetitive production capabilities and allow us greater flexibility in meeting demand for mattress covers from bedding producers.

In addition to the mattress fabrics and sewn covers we manufacture, we have important supply arrangements in place that allow us to source mattress fabric and sewn covers from strategic suppliers. We source some Culp-designed knitted fabrics, certain converted fabric products, and sewn mattress covers using our Culp China platform.  We also source a portion of our woven jacquard fabric and knitted fabric, which is obtained from a supplier located in Turkey, based on designs and a production schedule created by Culp.
 
Upholstery Fabrics Segment
 
The upholstery fabrics segment currently operates two manufacturing facilities in China.  During the second quarter of fiscal 2019, we closed our U.S. plant located in Anderson, South Carolina, which mainly produced velvet upholstery fabrics with some production of certain decorative fabrics. Additionally, we fabricate a variety of window treatments, using mostly customer-supplied fabrics and materials, at our Read Window Products facility in Knoxville, Tennessee.
 
Our upholstery fabrics facilities in China are all located within the same industrial area in Shanghai. At these facilities, we apply value-added finishing processes to fabrics sourced from a limited number of strategic suppliers in China, and we inspect sourced fabric there as well. In addition, the Shanghai operations include facilities where sourced fabric is cut and sewn to provide “kits” that are designed to be placed on specific furniture frames designated by our customers.
 
A large portion of our upholstery fabric products, as well as certain elements of our production processes, are being sourced from outside suppliers. Our facilities in China provide a base from which to access a variety of products, including certain fabrics (such as micro denier suedes and polyurethane fabrics) that are not produced anywhere within the U.S. We have found opportunities to develop significant relationships with key overseas suppliers in China that allow us to source products on a cost-effective basis, while limiting our investment of capital in manufacturing assets. We source unfinished and finished fabrics, as well as a portion of our cut and sewn kits, from a limited number of strategic suppliers in China who are willing to commit significant capacity to meet our needs while working with our product development team located in China to meet the demands of our customers.  Beginning in late fiscal 2019, we also developed strategic supplier relationships in Vietnam for additional sourcing of our cut and sewn kits, which has allowed us to begin adjusting our supply chains to meet customer demands in conjunction with ongoing trade disputes between the U.S. and China. The majority of upholstery fabrics and materials used by our Read Window Products business to fabricate window treatments are customer-supplied. These materials are generally sourced by customers, and we also source a portion of other window treatment products such as hardware and roller shades, from outside suppliers in the U.S., Turkey, and China.
 
Home Accessories Segment
 
Through our June 2018 investment in eLuxury, our home accessories segment currently operates one manufacturing plant in Evansville, Indiana, which primarily produces mattress pad products.  Certain bedding accessory and home good products, such as mattress protectors, dog beds, and fabric by the yard, are sourced internally from the company’s other business segments, while other products are sourced from third-party manufacturers located primarily in the United States, China, and Southeast Asia.

Product Design and Styling
 
Consumer tastes and preferences related to bedding, upholstered furniture, window treatment products, and home goods change over time. The use of new fabrics and creative designs remains an important consideration for manufacturers and marketers to distinguish their products at retail and to capitalize on changes in preferred colors, patterns, and textures. Culp’s success is largely dependent on our ability to market fabrics and products with appealing designs and patterns. The process of developing new designs involves maintaining an awareness of broad fashion and color trends both in the United States and internationally.
Mattress Fabrics Segment
 
Design innovation is a very important element of producing mattress fabrics.  We invest significant resources to stay ahead of current design trends, including maintaining a trained and active design staff, investing in research and development activities such as participation in international design shows, and implementing systems for creating and cataloguing new designs. Price point delineation is accomplished through fabric quality as well as variation in design. Additionally, consumers are drawn to the mattress that is the most visually appealing when walking into a retail showroom. Fiber differentiation also plays an important part in design. For example, rayon, organic cotton, and other special fibers are incorporated into the design process to allow the retailer to offer consumers additional benefits related to their sleeping experience. Similarly, many fabrics contain special production finishes that enhance fabric performance.
 
Mattress fabric designs are not routinely introduced on a scheduled season. Designs are typically introduced upon the request of the customer as they plan introductions to retailers. Additionally, we work closely with our customers on new design offerings around the major furniture markets such as Las Vegas, Nevada, and High Point, North Carolina.
 
Upholstery Fabrics Segment
 
The company has developed an upholstery fabrics design and product development team (with staff located in the U.S. and in China) with a primary focus on value in designing body cloths, while promoting style leadership with pillow fabrics and color. Our design staff travels regularly to international trade and design shows to maintain familiarity with current design and fashion trends. The team searches continually for new ideas and for the best sources of raw materials, yarns, and fabrics, utilizing a supply network located mostly in China. Using these design elements, they develop product offerings using ideas and materials that take both fashion trends and cost considerations into account to offer products designed to meet the needs of furniture manufacturers and ultimately the desires of consumers.
 
Upholstery fabric designs are introduced at major fabric trade conferences that occur twice a year in the United States (June and December). In recent years we have become more aggressive in registering copyrights for popular fabric patterns and taking steps to discourage the illegal copying of our proprietary designs.
  15
 
Home Accessories Segment
 
The home accessories segment designs primarily finished products packaged for delivery to consumers.  Products incorporate fabrics from Culp’s other operating segments, reflecting the design innovation of these two segments and optimizing the company’s global supply chain, as well as finished products supplied from outside vendors.  The home accessories segment works to develop product offerings designed to meet the desires of consumers in the bedding accessory and home goods markets.
Distribution
 
Mattress Fabrics Segment
 
The vast majority of our shipments of mattress fabrics originate from our facilities in Stokesdale, North Carolina, and we have additional distribution capabilities in Canada, China, and Haiti. Through arrangements with major customers and in accordance with industry practice, we maintain a significant inventory of mattress fabrics at our distribution facility in Stokesdale (“make to stock”), so that products may be shipped to customers with short lead times and on a “just in time” basis.
Upholstery Fabrics Segment
 
A majority of our upholstery fabrics are marketed on a “make to order” basis and are shipped directly from our distribution facilities in Burlington, North Carolina, and Shanghai, China. In addition to “make to order” distribution, an inventory of a limited number of fabric patterns is held at our distribution facilities in Burlington and Shanghai from which our customers can obtain quick delivery of sourced fabrics through a program known as “Culp Express.” Window treatment products sold through our Read Window business are done on a “job order” basis, with manufactured products shipped directly from our manufacturing facility in Knoxville, Tennessee to the job installation site.
Home Accessories
 
Inventory for our home accessories business is primarily held at eLuxury’s distribution facility in Evansville, Indiana, and at U.S. fulfillment centers for certain products and third-party online retailers.
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
 
Mattress Fabrics Segment
 
Raw materials account for approximately 60%-70% of mattress fabric production costs. The mattress fabrics segment purchases primarily synthetic yarns (polyester, polypropylene, and rayon), certain greige (unfinished) goods, latex adhesives, laminates, dyes, and other chemicals. Most of these materials are available from several suppliers, and prices fluctuate based on supply and demand, the general rate of inflation, and particularly on the price of petrochemical products. The mattress fabrics segment has generally not had significant difficulty in obtaining raw materials.
  16
 
Upholstery Fabrics Segment
 
Raw materials account for approximately 60%-70% of upholstery fabric manufacturing costs for products the company manufactures. Prior to closure of the Anderson, South Carolina facility during the second quarter of fiscal 2019, this segment purchased synthetic yarns (polyester, acrylic, rayon, and polypropylene), latex adhesives, dyes, and other chemicals from various suppliers. Following the closure, we ceased purchases of synthetic yarns and dyes, although these raw materials remain important to our suppliers of finished and unfinished fabrics.
 
Increased reliance by both our U.S. and China upholstery operations on outside suppliers for basic production needs such as base fabrics, yarns, and finishing services has caused the upholstery fabrics segment to become more vulnerable to price increases, delays, or production interruptions caused by problems within businesses that we do not control.
 
Home Accessories Segment
 
The home accessories segment purchases primarily cotton and synthetic fabric, yarns (polyester and rayon), and polyester fiberfill for products the company manufactures.  All of these materials are available from several suppliers, and prices fluctuate based on supply and demand, the general rate of inflation, and particularly on the price of petrochemical products.  The home accessories segment has generally not had significant difficulty in obtaining raw materials.
All Segments
 
Many of our basic raw materials are petrochemical products or are produced from such products. For this reason, our material costs can be sensitive to changes in prices for petrochemicals and the underlying price of oil. From fiscal 2015 and continuing into fiscal 2018, our profitability was aided by lower raw material prices due to lower oil prices, among other factors.  Later in fiscal 2018, we began to experience higher raw material prices.  We had a significant escalation of polyester prices due to a global shortage of certain components during the second and third quarters of fiscal 2019, after which these prices stabilized and returned to pre-escalation levels.
Seasonality
 
Mattress Fabrics Segment
 
The mattress fabrics business and the bedding industry in general are slightly seasonal, with sales being the highest in early spring and late summer, with another peak in mid-winter.
Upholstery Fabrics Segment
 
The upholstery fabrics business today is less seasonal than it once was.  In the past, seasonality resulted from one-week closings of our manufacturing facilities and the facilities of most of our customers in the U.S. during our first and third fiscal quarters for the holiday weeks of July 4th and Christmas.  This effect has become much less pronounced as a larger portion of our fabrics are produced or sold in locations outside of the U.S.  The timing of the Chinese National Holiday in October and, to a larger extent, the Chinese New Year (which occurs in January or February each year) now have a more significant impact on upholstery sales than the effects of U.S. holiday periods, often causing sales to be higher in advance of these holiday periods and sometimes lower during or immediately following the same periods.
  17
 
Home Accessories Segment
 
The home accessories business is subject to seasonal influences relating to traditional and promotional holidays driven by coupons and discounts from various sales channels, with generally higher sales during these holiday periods.
Competition
 
Competition for our products is high and is based primarily on price, design, quality, timing of delivery, and service.
 
Mattress Fabrics Segment
 
The mattress fabrics market is concentrated in a few relatively large suppliers, as well as some niche producers focusing mainly on knitted products. We believe our principal mattress fabric competitors are BekaertDeslee Textiles, Global Textile Alliance, and several smaller companies producing knitted and other fabric, as well as mattress components (sewn covers).  In addition, our bedding customers continue to face increasing competition from imports of finished beds, which indirectly compete with our mattress fabrics by replacing potential sales of our fabrics to those customers.
Upholstery Fabrics Segment
 
In the upholstery fabrics market, we compete against a large number of companies, ranging from a few large manufacturers comparable in size to the company to small producers and converters (companies who buy and re-sell fabrics, but have no manufacturing). We believe our principal upholstery fabric competitors are Dorell Fabrics Co., Merrimack Fabrics, Morgan Fabrics, Richloom Fabrics, and Specialty Textile, Inc. (or STI), plus a large number of smaller competitors (both manufacturers and converters).
 
The trend in the upholstery fabrics industry to greater overseas competition and the entry of more converters has caused the upholstery fabrics industry to become substantially more fragmented in recent years, with lower barriers to entry. This has resulted in a larger number of competitors selling upholstery fabrics, with an increase in competition based on price.
 
Home Accessories Segment
 
The home accessories market operates in a highly competitive and fragmented business environment and competes with other online retailers, as well as national, regional, and local retail stores, including department stores, specialty stores, and mass merchandise stores, that may carry similar product lines.
  18
 
Environmental and Other Regulations
 
We are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) and federal and state environmental laws, as well as similar laws governing our manufacturing facilities in China and Canada. We periodically review our compliance with these laws and regulations in an attempt to minimize the risk of violations.
 
Our operations involve a variety of materials and processes that are subject to environmental regulation. Under current law, environmental liability can arise from previously owned properties, leased properties and properties owned by third parties, as well as from properties currently owned and leased by the company. Environmental liabilities can also be asserted by adjacent landowners or other third parties in toxic tort litigation.
 
In addition, under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (“CERCLA”), and analogous state statutes, liability can be imposed for the disposal of waste at sites targeted for cleanup by federal and state regulatory authorities. Liability under CERCLA is strict as well as joint and several.
 
The U.S. Congress is considering legislation to address climate change that is intended to reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide. In addition, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has made a determination that greenhouse gas emissions may be a threat to human health and the environment. International agreements may also result in new regulations on greenhouse gas emissions. It is uncertain if, when, and in what form, a mandatory carbon dioxide emissions reduction program may be enacted either through legislation or regulation. However, if enacted, this type of program could materially increase our operating costs, including costs of raw materials, transportation, and electricity. It is difficult to predict the extent to which any new rules or regulations would affect our business, but we would expect the effect on our operations to be similar to that for other manufacturers, particularly those in our industry.
 
We are periodically involved in environmental claims or litigation and requests for information from environmental regulators. Each of these matters is carefully evaluated, and the company provides for environmental matters based on information presently available. Based on this information, we do not currently believe that environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on either the company’s financial condition or results of operations. However, there can be no assurance that the costs associated with environmental matters will not increase in the future.
 
Employees
 
As of April 28, 2019, we had 1,440 employees, compared to 1,392 at April 29, 2018.  Overall, our total number of employees has increased steadily over the past five years primarily due to the growth in our mattress fabrics segment. The decrease in the number of employees in our upholstery fabrics segment can be attributed to the closure of our Anderson, SC facility during the second quarter of fiscal 2019.  The number of employees in our home accessories segment can be attributed to our June 2018 investment in eLuxury, LLC.
 
The hourly employees at our manufacturing facility in Canada (approximately 11% of the company’s workforce) are represented by a local, unaffiliated union.  The collective bargaining agreement for these employees expires on February 1, 2020.  We are not aware of any efforts to organize any more of our employees, and we believe our relations with our employees are good.

Backlog
 
Mattress Fabrics and Home Accessories Segments
 
The backlog for the mattress fabric and home accessories segments is not a reliable predictor of future shipments because the majority of sales for the mattress fabrics segment are on a just-in-time basis, and the majority of sales for the home accessories segment are shipments from inventory on a quick turnaround basis.
Upholstery Fabrics Segment
 
Although it is difficult to predict the amount of backlog that is “firm,” we have reported the portion of the upholstery fabric backlog from customers with confirmed shipping dates within five weeks of the end of the fiscal year.  On April 28, 2019, the portion of the upholstery fabric backlog with confirmed shipping dates prior to June 3, 2019 was $10.7 million, all of which are expected to be filled during the first quarter of fiscal 2020, compared with $9.4 million as of the end of fiscal 2018 (for confirmed shipping dates prior to June 4, 2018).

Intellectual Property
 
We currently hold, or have registration applications pending for, numerous trademarks and copyrights for various product and trade names, logos, and fabric designs in the United States and certain foreign countries. We view such intellectual property, along with any unregistered copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade names, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, and proprietary technologies, as an important part of our business, and we seek to diligently protect, monitor, and defend, through appropriate action, against their unauthorized use.
