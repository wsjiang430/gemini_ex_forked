Overview
 On October 1, 2022 (the “Distribution Date”), the spin-off (the “Spin-Off” or the “Separation”) of the product business of Adeia Inc. (formerly known as Xperi Holding Corporation) (“Adeia” or the “Former Parent”) into Xperi Inc. (“we”, “our”, the “Company” or “Xperi”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Adeia, was completed. The Spin-Off was achieved through our Former Parent's distribution (the “Distribution”) of 100% of the shares of Xperi’s common stock to holders of our Former Parent’s common stock as of the close of business on the record date of September 21, 2022 (the “Record Date”). Each Adeia stockholder of record received four shares of Xperi common stock for every ten shares of Adeia common stock held on the Record Date. Following the Distribution, we became an independent, publicly-traded company with our common stock listed under the symbol “XPER” on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”), and our Former Parent retains no ownership interest in Xperi.
 In connection with the Spin-Off, we entered into a Separation and Distribution Agreement and several other agreements with our Former Parent to effect the Spin-Off and provide a framework for our relationship with our Former Parent after the Spin-Off. In addition to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the other principal agreements entered into with our Former Parent include a Tax Matters Agreement, a Transition Services Agreement, an Employee Matters Agreement, a Cross Business License Agreement, and a Data Sharing Agreement. For additional information, see Note - 1 to our consolidated financial statements.

 Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic
 Please refer to the “Risk Factors” and Executive Summary section of Part II, Item 7 “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for information concerning the continuing effect of the COVID-19 pandemic and related macroeconomic conditions on our business.
 Market Opportunity
 Consumer preferences and behavior around media consumption are undergoing a significant transformation, driven by new platforms for content delivery, greater availability of diverse content, and an increase in time spent consuming video content. Video content delivery is rapidly shifting from linear broadcast to over-the-top (“OTT”) platforms, impacting not just how users consume content, but also the ad-supported programming ecosystem. Our technologies sit on the forefront of this transformation, enhancing consumer experiences where consumers spend their time the most – in their homes and in their cars.

Our technologies not only enhance user experiences, but also enable partners across the entire ecosystem to participate in the evolving content delivery value chain.
 •Shift to OTT and Streaming: OTT has rapidly become a mainstream content delivery mechanism through a wide variety of providers such as Netflix, Disney+ and YouTube. OTT media now accounts for 38% of weekly video viewing for adults ages 18 and older. Proliferation of OTT has created demand for a new generation of entertainment products that are centered on the OTT viewing experience. Consumers are increasingly looking for solutions that allow them to navigate across the fragmented and complex entertainment landscape of OTT content.
 •OTT Advertising Monetization: The shift to OTT has not only impacted user needs for entertainment devices, but also disrupted the ad-based programming model that was centered on linear TV programming. While delivering ad-based programming to OTT audiences has presented new challenges, it has also created opportunities for advertisers to deliver customized, highly relevant, and targeted ad content to a critical and growing demographic. There is a new set of industry participants that are looking for ways to monetize the ad-based ecosystem, including consumer electronics manufacturers, OEMs, and others that have historically not participated in the OTT value chain. Thus, we believe there is a significant market opportunity for tools that enable OEMs to monetize their products through recurring revenue streams across the lifecycle of the device rather than just a one-time monetization opportunity at the point-of-sale.
 •Marked Need for An Independent Media Platform: Close to half of Smart TVs each year are shipped into Western Europe and North America by leading electronics manufacturers who lack the scale required to support the technology, content, and monetization requirements of a streaming media platform. This creates a unique opportunity for an independent media platform that allows Smart TV OEMs to brand the experience, retain customer ownership, and participate in the long-term monetization throughout the typical 5-year lifecycle of TV ownership.
 •Increasing Consumption of Video Content: Average weekly video viewing has increased 10%, from 40 hours per week in 2015 to 44 hours per week in 2020, driven by a number of factors, including increased availability of content catering to various consumer tastes and preferences, new platforms for consumption such as personal devices (e.g., mobiles and tablets), and disruption from the COVID-19 pandemic. Consumers are increasing their spend on entertainment devices that deliver superior experiences and simplify the consumption of content across multiple platforms and devices. Omdia S.A. estimates revenues from the shipment of these platforms and devices in North America alone (including TVs, Smartphones, Tablets and PCs, Streaming Media Players, connected Blu-Rays players, and Video Game consoles) are expected to surpass $190 billion in 2023 and continue to grow by 3% year-over-year to 2025.
 •Growing Connectivity in Cars and the Future of Semi-Autonomous and Autonomous Vehicles: As the automobile dashboard interface becomes more integral to the in-car experience, purchasing a car for its infotainment capabilities starts to move up the list of purchase considerations for car buyers. A McKinsey survey reported that 37% of consumers state they are eager to switch to cars with increased connectivity and nearly half of high-end auto consumers express an interest in exploring the digital capabilities of their new cars. Autonomous and semi-autonomous driving technologies have made significant progress over the last several years and passenger cars are increasingly being fitted with autonomous driving features. If autonomous driving technologies become mainstream, the automobile will become a more common place for media consumption. Over time, we believe consumers will place significant importance on the quality of media delivery and will expect the quality of delivery in the car to be comparable to that of their living room.
 •Increasing Use of “Smart” Devices: Consumers have long relied on smartphones enabled with virtual assistants, talk-to-text, and other intelligent features, and increasingly want other home devices (as well as their automobiles) to be enabled with similar smart capabilities. “Smart” devices have created attractive opportunities to deliver personalized content discovery and highly differentiated experiences in the car, on par with consumers’ home media devices.
 •New Use Cases for Edge AI Computing: Artificial intelligence and machine learning (“AI/ML”) based technologies are finding new use cases in consumer devices and technologies at a rapid rate. Similar to consumer reliance on smart phones, consumers increasingly expect their smart speakers, virtual assistants, security cameras, and other devices to learn user behavior and adapt to it. However, consumer privacy and data protection are critical features that limit the ability to transfer personal data from the device to the cloud for computing, and such transfers are further limited by challenges such as low bandwidth and unreliable connectivity. AI/ML based technologies need to be built directly into consumer devices to address security and data concerns and deliver the experience users expect. The shift toward edge-based device capabilities is creating a potential opportunity for semiconductor components that are AI/ML capable, have low power requirements, and can be produced at reasonable cost.


Strategy
 Our business focuses on creating extraordinary experiences at home and on the go for millions of consumers around the world, elevating content and how audiences connect with it, in a way that is more intelligent, immersive, and personal:
 •Pay-TV: We transform the traditional television user experience from linear multichannel video programming distributors (“MVPD”) with cloud-based DVRs into an immersive, intuitive, and hyper-personalized experience. Our iconic user experience, with enhanced imagery and relevant, personalized recommendations, enables consumers to navigate to the entertainment they love in an enjoyable and engaging experience.
 •Consumer Electronics: Our technologies enable clear, bright visuals and immersive sound, across nearly all platforms people listen, watch and play – at the movies, throughout the home and on the most popular mobile devices and gaming platforms. We continue to develop our machine-learning capabilities through our Perceive subsidiary which delivers datacenter-class accuracy and performance to edge-based devices at ultra-low power, performing tasks such as face recognition and audio/video event detection.
 •Connected Car: We seek to transform the automotive experience by bringing high-quality multimedia and personalization to the connected car. We immerse drivers in more of their favorite audio content, with crystal-clear, subscription-free digital radio. Our products are designed to give drivers confidence, as vehicles with our AI-powered in-cabin sensing solutions improve the safety, comfort, and security of everyone in the car. With autonomous vehicles pushing consumer expectations higher, we are innovating to create the dashboard of the future, accommodating more types of entertainment, from video to gaming and more. 
 •Media Platform: We are uniquely positioned as an independent media platform that allows Smart TV OEMs to brand the experience, retain customer ownership and generate recurring revenues by participating in monetization throughout the approximate 5 year lifecycle of TV ownership. Our platform creates high viewer engagement with an unbiased, content-first user experience where Hybrid TV and streaming services integrate in a personalized way that makes it easy to find, watch and enjoy content across siloed ecosystems. We endeavor to connect advertisers and entertainment producers to audiences they cannot as easily reach on other platforms. Our unique footprint includes millions of traditional, linear TV households, where we deterministically capture viewership data throughout the home, as well as anyone streaming from our ad-supported content network. By creating an environment where users search less and watch more, we enable content producers to grow their audiences, and consumer brands to increase exposure to their marketing campaigns over time.

Media Platform
 

Media Platform provides a means to monetize our solutions as consumers find, watch, and enjoy their favorite media entertainment on connected devices. We license proprietary streaming middleware solutions that connect advertisers and entertainment producers to audiences they cannot as easily reach on other platforms due to our content-first user experience that monetizes live and streaming TV. Our unique footprint includes millions of linear TV households, where we capture viewership data throughout the home, as well as anyone streaming from our ad-supported content network.
 Media Platform includes the recently acquired Vewd Smart TV video app framework and core middleware solution, the TiVo OS, consumer devices that leverage the TiVo OS (TiVo Stream 4K), future consumer devices that leverage the TiVo OS (connected TVs and connected cars), and the monetization of TiVo OS.
 Platform - TiVo OS
 TiVo OS drives industry-leading consumer engagement by delivering rich metadata, personalization, natural language understanding and voice control, and content integration services. TiVo OS provides industry-leading content recommendations based on AI-defined insights encouraging consumers to continually discover their next new favorite. TiVo OS uniquely brings services from long-time partners such as Disney, Sling, and YouTube TV, among others, and seamlessly integrates local TV, free ad-supported TV ("FAST") and the most popular Ad-supported Video on Demand (“AVOD”), Subscription Video on Demand (“SVOD”), and virtual Multichannel Video Programming Distributor (“vMVPD”) services. As the TiVo OS footprint increases, the inventory of FAST and AVOD services such as our own TiVo+ network increases and provides a robust opportunity to monetize this unique, connected TV advertisement inventory.
 Devices – TiVo Stream 4K
 TiVo Stream 4K is a best-in-class streaming media player that currently leverages components of TiVo OS with market-leading networking, video and sound technologies to provide a powerful hardware platform on which TiVo OS can operate to upgrade any screen with an HDMI connection to a smart, connected device.

 Devices – TiVo OS for TV
 TiVo OS for TV is a Linux-based Smart TV operating system that leverages TiVo OS technologies, features, and capabilities. We expect the TiVo OS platform for Smart TVs to launch in 2023. TiVo OS for TVs will be licensed as a software-as-a-service to consumer electronic OEMs and will include the right to monetize all or part of the end-user content engagement over the life of the product. For Tier 2 and Tier 3 Smart TV OEMs, TiVo OS will provide a platform to participate in the fast-growing connected TV monetization value chain with scale and cross-platform end-user insight not available to OEMs on a standalone basis.
Monetization - TiVo OS
 TiVo OS is primarily monetized through video or display advertisement impressions; subscription VOD, pay TV service bounties, and revenue shares; TV viewership data licensing; off-platform connected TV ads; and other opportunities on device clients that connect to and leverage TiVo OS.
As the platform scales, we expect to monetize through the following vehicles:
 •Ad Supported Content: The sale of ad inventory on services, including our own TiVo+ and certain third-party AVOD services.
 •SVOD and MVPD Services: Revenue shared by SVOD and virtual MVPD services on new user subscriptions activated or re-activated through our OS platform.
 •Home Screen Ad Placements: Ad placements on the TiVo OS platform’s home screen by streaming services, studios, and other consumer brands.
 •Data Licensing: Revenue from advertisers, advertising agencies, and networks to license data generated from TiVo platforms to inform their ad buying decisions.
 •Off-Platform Ads: Household identifications taken from the TiVo OS platform and used to target other media sources.


Monetization – TV Viewership Data
We offer TV viewership data with program airing data for millions of households. Broadcasters, MVPDs, content producers, advertising agencies and advertisers use our TV viewership data, alone or in combination with third-party data sources utilizing industry-leading data safe havens, to target promotions and advertising directly, or through third-party viewer segments, to monetize their subscriber customer base.
Monetization – Advertising Solutions
 We provide advertisers with nationwide or regionally-targeted advertising on our various owned or operated devices. Advertisers place ads in a variety of display formats in both traditional linear television and digital advertising for internet delivered content, seamlessly incorporated into the user interface. Using our Personalized Content Discovery platform, we also target content promotions as “paid search” by directly including the sponsored content in user interface’s recommended content carousel. We work with service providers bundling their non-TiVo advertising inventory with our native inventory, thereby giving us a more significant national footprint.
Growth Factors
 There are several facets of our product growth strategy. These growth drivers include: the delivery and monetization of the TiVo OS into Smart TVs, proliferation of in-cabin monitoring (AutoSense) and infotainment (AutoStage) solutions into the connected car market, increased adoption of our IPTV solutions in the Pay-TV market, and unit growth in consumer electronics from in-home Wi-Fi solutions (Play-Fi) and IMAX Enhanced. We have a long track record of developing premium solutions for the marketplace that provide an extraordinary experience for end users.
Competition
 Pay-TV
 There are a number of companies that produce and market advanced media solutions such as UXs, interactive program guides, DVRs, search, recommendation, natural language voice, metadata, and advanced data and analytics in the various formats which compete, or we believe will compete, with our products and services over time. Principal competitive factors include brand recognition and awareness, product and service functionality, innovation, ease of use, personalization, content access and availability, mobility and pricing. While we are competitive across this range of factors, we believe our primary competitive differentiation includes our ability to integrate all our products to create unique value for our customers.
 Our platform faces competition from companies such as Synamedia, MediaKind, Kudelski, Enghouse Systems Limited, and from solutions developed by multiple system operators such as Comcast X1 and Liberty Global plc’s Horizon Media, which have created competing products that provide user interface software for use on set-top-boxes and CE and mobile devices. Such companies may offer more economically attractive agreements to service providers and CE manufacturers by bundling multiple products together. We face competition for our Pay-TV product offerings from customers who choose to build their own interactive program guide and DVR solutions. We believe that we provide a strong alternative to “do-it-yourself,” as we have innovative, high-quality products ready to be implemented, with local and network DVR, integrated data distribution infrastructure and content, as well as third-party services (such as VOD services). We differentiate our products by continuing to integrate our broad portfolio of products into a suite of solutions and services for our customers. We believe our solutions speed our customers’ time to market, are superior to “do-it-yourself” products, and can be deployed at a lower cost than internally built products.
 In video metadata, we compete with other providers of entertainment-related content metadata such as Gracenote (a subsidiary of Nielsen Holdings plc) and Ericsson Group’s Red Bee Media, as well as a number of local metadata providers. While we do not believe that our competitors’ metadata sets offer the same comprehensive breadth of focus on media exploration, discovery, and management in as many regions of the world as we do, they present competition to our metadata business for each of their areas of focus.
Consumer Electronics
Our audio licensing products face competition from other third-party providers of similar solutions as well as internal engineering and design groups among industry IC providers and consumer electronics manufacturers.

Our primary competitor is Dolby Laboratories, which develops and markets, among other things, high-definition audio products and services. Dolby’s long-standing market position, brand, business relationships, resources and inclusion in various industry standards provide it with a strong competitive position.
 In addition to Dolby, we compete in specific product markets with companies such as Fraunhofer IIS and various other consumer electronics product manufacturers. Many of these competitors have a wide variety of strengths that afford them competitive advantages, such as longer operating histories, greater resources, greater name recognition, or the ability to offer their technologies for a lower price or for free. We have historically competed effectively against these companies due in part to our brand being a premium offering that contains superior proprietary technology, the quality of our customer service, our inclusion in industry standards and our industry relationships.
 Connected Car
 Our HD Radio and DTS AutoStage solutions face competition from subscription-based digital service providers such as Sirius/XM, Pandora, Gracenote, and other digital audio and data service providers.
 Our DTS AutoSense in-cabin monitoring technologies broadly compete with other image processing software vendors targeting the automotive industry, such as SmartEye and Seeing Machines, as well as engineering and design groups of tier one automotive suppliers that seek to provide similar technologies by employing different approaches with their internal teams.
Media Platform
 TV Audience Data. We collect and analyze audience research data in an area where companies such as comScore, Inc. and Nielsen Holdings plc and other online data analytics companies compete for research spend from advertisers, advertising agencies and television networks. Other large companies are also focusing resources in this area including Comcast, Meta Platforms Inc. (Facebook) and Alphabet, Inc.’s Google business. Many of our existing customers are investing in platforms to enable their businesses with these capabilities. We believe that there is a significant opportunity for us as an independent data and technology provider, with proprietary access to critical data assets associated with consumers’ engagement with entertainment media.
 TiVo Stream 4K. We compete against products with on-demand OTT streaming capabilities offered by internet CE manufacturers. For example, many CE manufacturers have television or internet-enabled streaming devices for accessing video over the internet such as Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV, Google Chromecast and Roku. TVs with integrated streaming capabilities from manufacturers such as Samsung, Vizio and LG also represent competition to the TiVo Stream 4K.
 TiVo OS. We compete for Smart TV platform support with companies such as Roku, Alphabet, Inc’s Google TV and Amazon’s FireTV. We believe the overall OTT streaming market growth, our independent position, our differentiated end-user solution, and our more inclusive business model of sharing economics with Tier 2 and Tier 3 Smart TV OEMs represents an opportunity where we can establish a strong position.
 In approaching content owners, advertisers and ad agencies to participate in the TiVo OS platform, we are competing with the same platforms and TV OEMs operating their own TV operating systems such as Samsung, Vizio and LG. In this fast-expanding connected TV advertising market, we believe our cross-platform data insight from Pay-TV and TiVo OS households will allow us to create and promote a unique and compelling offering for advertisers.
 Over time, we expect to see new competitors and other competing technologies emerge.
 Intellectual Property Portfolio
 We operate in an industry in which innovation, investment in new ideas and protection of our intellectual property rights are critical for success. We protect our innovations and inventions through a variety of means, including, but not limited to, applying for patent, copyright, and trademark protection domestically and internationally, and protecting our trade secrets. As of December 31, 2022, we held approximately 753 United States issued patents and 185 patent applications, as well as approximately 984 foreign issued patents and 298 patent applications. The last of the issued patents to expire is in 2041.
Research & Development
 As demonstrated by our portfolio of industry-recognized, widely-deployed advanced technologies, we have a long track record of innovating in the fields of audio, imaging, and video discovery. We believe that ongoing investment in R&D is required for us to remain competitive in the markets we serve.
Today, we have a collection of world-class talent and strong research and development capabilities in various locations throughout the world. Starting with core research, machine learning and advanced algorithm development, we continue to focus on next generation technology solutions. Our ongoing investment in R&D, supported by a strong industry network of partners, enables us to deliver differentiated, cost-effective solutions that enhance the end-user experience for an ever-larger universe of addressable markets.
Legislative and Regulatory Actions
 A number of government and legislative initiatives have been enacted to encourage development and implementation of technologies that protect the rights and intellectual property of the content owners. For example, the United States and other countries have adopted certain laws, including the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (“DMCA”) and the European Copyright Directive, which are aimed at the prevention of content piracy and the manufacture and sale of products that circumvent copy protection technologies.
Compatibility Between Cable Systems and CE Equipment
 Beginning in 2003, the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) adopted regulations implementing an agreement between cable television system operators and CE manufacturers to facilitate the retail availability of so-called “plug and play” devices that use unidirectional CableCARDs, including digital televisions and other digital devices that enable subscribers to access cable television programming without the need for a set-top-box (STB) (but without the ability for consumers to use interactive content). In September 2020, the FCC eliminated rules requiring cable providers to support CableCARD. While the cable industry has continued to provide CableCARDs for third-party devices like ours, we cannot predict the ultimate impact of any new technical equipment regulations on our business and operations. Current FCC regulations no longer prohibit multi-channel video service providers from deploying navigation devices with combined security and non-security functions, and further developments with respect to these issues could impact the availability and/or demand for “plug and play” devices, particularly bi-directional devices and STBs, all of which could affect demand for UXs incorporated in STBs or CE devices. If the cable industry decided to cease providing CableCARD support for TiVo retail customers, recurring monthly retail services fees would be affected as customers would be likely to cancel TiVo service on their devices.
General Government Regulation
 We are subject to a number of foreign and domestic laws and regulations that affect companies that import or export software and technology, such as the U.S. export control regulations as administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce.
 We are also subject to a number of foreign and domestic laws that affect companies conducting business on the internet. Laws relating to user privacy, freedom of expression, content, advertising, accessibility, network neutrality, information security and intellectual property rights are being debated and considered for adoption by many countries throughout the world. Each jurisdiction may enact different standards, which could impact our ability to deliver or monetize data, services or other solutions through the internet.
 In the United States, service providers have been subject to claims of defamation, libel, invasion of privacy and other data protection claims, torts, unlawful activity, copyright or trademark infringement, or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials searched and the ads posted or the content generated by users. In addition, several other federal laws could have an impact on our business. For example, the DMCA has provisions that limit, but do not eliminate, our liability for hosting or linking to third-party websites that include materials that infringe copyrights or other rights, so long as we comply with the statutory requirements of this act. The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act restricts the ability of service providers to collect information from minors and the Protection of Children from Sexual Predators Act of 1998 requires service providers to report evidence of violations of federal child pornography laws under certain circumstances.
 The privacy regulatory landscape has been changing rapidly, and we may become subject to new privacy or cybersecurity laws and regulations in the U.S. and internationally. Such laws and regulations could affect our ability to process personal data (in particular, our ability to use certain data or personal information for purposes such as monetization, risk or fraud avoidance, and targeted marketing or advertising, or otherwise to provide data about the end-users and/or customers and their behavior), our

ability to control our costs by using certain vendors or service providers, or our ability to offer certain services in certain jurisdictions, which in turn could negatively affect our financial condition and business operations, and subject us to fines, penalties, or other liability. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, became effective on January 1, 2020. The CCPA created new individual privacy rights for consumers (as that word is broadly defined in the law) and placed increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling personal data of consumers or households. The CCPA requires covered businesses to provide new disclosures to California consumers, and allows for a new cause of action for data breaches. The CCPA also provides a consumer with the right to (i) opt out of certain sales of personal information, (ii) know the personal information that the business maintains about the consumer, and (iii) request deletion of personal information. It is unclear how the CCPA will be interpreted, but as currently written, it will likely impact our business activities and exemplifies the vulnerability of our business not only to cyber threats but also the evolving regulatory environment related to personal data. The CCPA’s privacy measures were amended and strengthened by the California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, which became effective on January 1, 2023, with enforcement commencing on July 1, 2023. The CPRA bolstered the consumer rights granted under CCPA and took the right to opt out of certain sales of personal information further to include the right to opt out of the sharing of personal information.
 We are also subject to international laws (including but not limited to the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation) associated with data protection, privacy, and other aspects of our business in Europe, Asia, and elsewhere in the world, and the interpretation and application of data protection laws remains uncertain. Because our services are accessible worldwide, foreign jurisdictions may claim that we are required to comply with their laws. Further, the application of existing laws regulating or requiring licenses for certain businesses of our advertisers can be unclear.
 Our operations in China may also be subject to privacy regulations. China passed the Personal Information Protection Law effective November 1, 2021, which creates a comprehensive set of data privacy and security obligations that not only apply to the processing of personal information within China, but also to the processing outside of China if such processing is for purposes of providing products and services to, or analyzing and evaluating the behavior of, individuals located in China. The law provides for various requirements on personal information protection, including obligations of obtaining informed consent and limiting to the minimum scope necessary for the collection and processing of personal information, requirements for conducting a personal information protection impact assessment for certain data processing activities, and responsibilities for adopting necessary measures to safeguard the security of the personal information. The law also requires a security assessment and regulatory approval, government certification and/or conclusion of a standard data transfer agreement with the overseas recipient before transferring personal information outside of China. Lastly, the law imposes significant fines of up to RMB 50 million (approx. $7.7 million) or 5% of annual revenue for violations of the law. Chinese data protection laws are still evolving and may impose additional restrictions on companies doing business in China. Our efforts to comply with these laws and regulations may result in increased costs of doing business.
 Human Capital Resources
 The opportunities for our success and growth depend in large part on our ability to attract, develop, and retain a talented and engaged workforce. In particular, we are competing for technical talent and we need to offer not only robust and attractive compensation packages but also provide broad opportunities for our employees to make an impact, grow, and develop. As of December 31, 2022, we had a global talent base consisting of approximately 2,100 full-time employees.
 To enable our talent to actively contribute to – and have a positive impact on – the overall business and culture, we have developed a set of programs and initiatives that include competitive compensation and benefits offerings, skills and management development, diversity and inclusion initiatives, goal and performance management, and succession planning. In support of these efforts, our Board of Directors monitors these programs and initiatives and provides guidance and feedback as appropriate. Our goal is to provide a work environment that empowers our teams and enables them to enjoy a healthy and productive work-life balance for themselves, their families, and their community.
 Our incentives are based on merit and we have a strong pay-for-performance culture. We benchmark our total rewards annually to ensure our compensation and benefit programs remain competitive with industry peers. Our compensation framework for employees reflects a combination of fixed and variable pay including base salary, bonuses, performance awards, and stock-based compensation. We offer employees benefits that vary by country and are designed to meet or exceed local laws and are competitive in the marketplace.
 We invest in the career growth of our employees by providing a wide range of development opportunities, including face-to-face, virtual, social and self-directed learning, mentoring, coaching, and external development. Annual assessments are performed to identify talent needs based on department goals and to evaluate how each function is positioned from a talent perspective. We believe in the principles of a learning organization and strive to provide continuous educational opportunities

for our employees. In 2020, we invested in a global online learning platform. More than 200 courses and programs have been created, offering a wide range of skill development opportunities for employees to become more knowledgeable and effective in their roles. We also offer customized leadership and management development programs for our management teams.
 We leverage our manager ecosystem, coupled with industry-standard performance management tools, to align corporate goals with employee objectives. Employees are encouraged to create and align individual, functional and team-based goals, track performance against goals, write self-evaluations, and solicit feedback.
 We have demonstrated support and commitment to developing a culture of non-discrimination and embracing diversity, equity, and inclusion throughout our workforce. We have numerous employee resource groups (ERGs), employee-led, voluntary communities for groups that share similar backgrounds or identities. ERGs develop programming throughout the year supporting culture and belonging, encourage diversity, and empower employees to achieve their personal and career goals. Our current employee resource groups represent the LGBTQ+ community (PRIDE at Xperi), the Black community (Mahogany at Xperi, or MaX), women (Women in Tech, or WiT), and veterans (Veterans at Xperi, or VaX). We also have formed a Diversity, Equity and Inclusion council comprised of all levels of employees and senior executives. The purpose of the council is, among other things, to identify and address issues of diversity, equity and inclusion through multiple and unique perspectives from a diverse group of our employees. In June 2020, we joined the business coalition in support of the Equality Act, a measure that supports federal legislation that would provide the same basic protections to LGBTQ+ people as are provided to other protected groups under federal law. The Board of Directors believes that board diversity is important to serving the long-term interests of stockholders and takes diversity into consideration when identifying potential director candidates.
 We measure employee experience by collecting insight and understanding of engagement and satisfaction. We use an employee engagement survey, executive roundtables and employee focus groups to solicit input. Task forces are regularly created to identify and address gaps, resulting in changes to policies and practices and benefits offerings. A recent survey to assess employee well-being during the initial work-from-home period related to the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the payment of a working-from-home stipend to employees that covered certain costs associated with setting up home offices.
 None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement or are represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any organized work stoppages and we consider the relationships with our employees to be positive.
 Environmental, Social & Governance
Xperi will publish its latest Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) report in March 2023. Our report will be available on the Xperi website.
 Using insights from the development of our inaugural materiality assessment, we created our ESG program around three key focus areas: Culture and Belonging, Resilience, and Community Impact. As part of our Resilience pillar, we aim to be positive stewards of the environment. Climate change is one of the defining challenges facing our society today, and we are committed to doing our part to address this challenge head on. In 2022, we conducted our first greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory of our Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions, establishing a baseline to understand our environmental impact. This will inform our goal-setting in the future as we work to address our carbon footprint. We have taken additional steps to reduce our impact through actions such as increasing energy efficiency within our office buildings, reducing the square footage of our office portfolio, and migrating the majority of on-premise IT assets towards more energy efficient solutions.
