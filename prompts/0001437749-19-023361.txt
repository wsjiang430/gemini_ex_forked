Item 1. Business
Overview
 
Delta Apparel, Inc. (collectively with DTG2Go, LLC, Salt Life, LLC, M.J. Soffe, LLC, and other subsidiaries, "Delta Apparel," "we," "us," "our," or the "Company") is a vertically-integrated, international apparel company. With approximately 8,500 employees worldwide, we design, manufacture, source, and market a diverse portfolio of core activewear and lifestyle apparel products under our primary brands of Salt Life®, COAST®, Soffe®, and Delta. We are a market leader in the direct-to-garment digital print and fulfillment industry, bringing DTG2Go technology and innovation to the supply chain of our customers. We specialize in selling casual and athletic products through a variety of distribution channels and tiers, including outdoor and sporting goods retailers, independent and specialty stores, better department stores and mid-tier retailers, mass merchants and e-retailers, the U.S. military, and through our business-to-business ecommerce sites. Our products are also made available direct-to-consumer on our websites and in our branded retail stores. This diversified distribution allows us to capitalize on our strengths to provide our activewear and lifestyle apparel products to a broad and evolving customer base whose shopping preferences may span multiple retail channels.
 
We design and internally manufacture the majority of our products. More than 90% of the apparel units that we sell are sewn in our owned or leased facilities. This allows us to offer a high degree of consistency and quality, leverage scale efficiencies, and react quickly to changes in trends within the marketplace. We have manufacturing operations located in the United States, El Salvador, Honduras, and Mexico, and we use domestic and foreign contractors as additional sources of production. Our distribution facilities are strategically located throughout the United States to better serve our customers with same-day shipping on our catalog products and weekly replenishments to retailers.
 
Through several acquisitions, we became a diversified branded apparel company with well-recognized brands in our portfolio, expanded product offerings, broadened distribution channels and customer reach, and increased leverage of our vertical manufacturing platform. We continue to monitor and evaluate our portfolio, making strategic acquisitions or exiting markets as needed to support our long-term growth and profitability goals.
 
We were incorporated in Georgia in 1999, and our headquarters is located in Greenville, South Carolina. We operate on a 52-53 week fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to September 30. All references to "2019" and "2018" relate to the 52 week fiscal years ended on September 28, 2019, and September 29, 2018, respectively. Our common stock trades on the NYSE American under the symbol “DLA." We are filing as a smaller reporting company for our 2019 fiscal year end as our public float was less than the $250 million threshold on the last day of our second quarter.
 
We make available copies of materials we file with, or furnish to, the SEC free of charge at https://ir.deltaapparelinc.com. The information found on our website is not part of this, or any other, report that we file with or furnish to the SEC. In addition, we will provide upon request, at no cost, paper or electronic copies of our reports and other filings made with the SEC.

Segments, Products, Brands, and Customers
 
Our operations are managed and reported in two segments, Delta Group and Salt Life Group, which reflect the manner in which the business is managed and results are reviewed by the Chief Executive Officer, who is our chief operating decision maker.
Delta Group
 
The Delta Group is comprised of the following business units primarily focused on core activewear styles: Delta Activewear (encompassing our core Delta Catalog business and FunTees private label business), DTG2Go, and Soffe.
Delta Activewear
 Delta Activewear has been a preferred supplier to the market for core basic tee shirts for many years.  Our Delta Pro Weight® and Magnum Weight® products are a huge part of our heritage. These lines offer a diverse selection of mid-weight and heavier-weight, 100% cotton fabrications.  We also provide innovative products like our Delta Soft, Delta Dri performance, Ringspun, and Fleece lines.  After decades of being a key source for casual and sport basics done right, three years ago we decided to expand our industry-leading brand and raised the bar even higher with the introduction of the Delta Platinum line.  Our ‘cut above the rest’ collection provides a fresh, fashionable edge to Delta’s product assortment.  More luxurious in look and feel, Platinum silhouettes take their refined attitude uptown, downtown, to brunch, to the office and anywhere in between.   Service is a key component of Delta Activewear.  We provide superior service to our customers by shipping the same day of order receipt down to a piece level, allowing customers to purchase exactly what they need when they need it.  We are also excited to be offering a seamless solution for small-run decoration needs with our on-demand digital print services, powered by DTG2Go. Through our FunTees business, we serve our customers as their supply chain partner, from product development to shipment of their branded products, with the majority of products being sold with value-added services including embellishment, hangers, hangtags and ticketing, so that they are ready for retail sale to the end consumers.  We assist our customers in managing their production and inventory needs and provide technology tools to help them manage and grow their business.  We sell our products to a diversified audience, including sporting goods retailers, large licensed screen printers, specialty and resort stores, and ad-specialty and promotional products businesses. We also service major branded sportswear companies, trendy regional brands, retailers, and sports-licensed apparel marketers.

DTG2Go
 We are a market leader in the direct-to-garment digital print and fulfillment industry, bringing technology and innovation to the supply chain of our many customers.  We use highly-automated factory processes and our proprietary software to deliver on-demand, digitally printed apparel direct to consumers on behalf of our customers.

Soffe
 Founded in 1946, Soffe is an iconic, heritage brand that designs and produces high quality activewear for spirit makers and record breakers. Soffe sells a wide range of activewear products for women, men, juniors and children with appealing graphics anchored in today's trends. Widely known for the original “cheer short” with the signature roll-down waistband, Soffe also offers spirit wear and team wear that outfits cheerleaders, dancers, and gymnasts around the world. Intensity by Soffe leads the way in female fit, fashion-forward team uniforms and features the first female-fit fast pitch pant, in addition to practice gear and accessories. Layered with Soffe's female presentation are styles that seamlessly transition from studio to street-wear for all day comfort. Soffe's heritage is anchored in the military, and we continue to be a proud supplier to both active duty and veteran United States military personnel worldwide. The men's assortment features the tagline "anchored in the military, grounded in training" and offers everything from physical training gear certified by the respective branches of the military, classic base layers that include the favored 3-pack tees, and the iconic "ranger panty." We apply graphics to Soffe activewear using screen print and digital print technology in our North Carolina facility. Soffe has diverse distribution channels which include all military branches, as well as big box and independent sporting goods retailers, department stores, team dealers, school uniform suppliers, and specialty stores.  We also offer our Soffe products direct to consumers at www.soffe.com and at our branded retail stores.
Salt Life Group
 
The Salt Life Group is comprised of our lifestyle brands focused on a broad range of apparel garments, headwear and related accessories to meet consumer preferences and fashion trends, and includes our Salt Life and Coast business units.
Salt Life
Salt Life is an authentic, aspirational lifestyle brand that embraces those who love the ocean and all it offers, from surfing, fishing, and diving to beach fun and sun-soaked relaxation. The Salt Life brand combines function and fashion with a tailored fit for the active lifestyles of those that “live the Salt Life.” With increased worldwide appeal, Salt Life continues to expand its product assortment outside of apparel, now offering swimwear, sunglasses, bags, and accessories as well as its own craft beer, Salt Life Lager. From its first merchandise offerings in 2006, Salt Life has grown distribution to include surf shops, specialty stores, department stores, and outdoor retailers to complement our own network of branded retail stores. In 2019, we upgraded the Salt Life ecommerce site at www.saltlife.com to a new technology platform, providing our customers a seamless, omni-channel experience with the Salt Life brand.
Coast
 Offering a full line of premium casual apparel, Coast is as much a testament to good times and carefree afternoons as it is to superior quality, custom fit, and maximum comfort. The Coast collection is designed to bring the coastal experience of weekends and summers at the beach to everyday life, keeping those that celebrate the relaxed, yet sophisticated coastal lifestyle fully connected, year-round. Coast Apparel is available direct to consumer through our branded retail locations and our ecommerce site at www.coastapparel.com.

Manufacturing, Sourcing, and Distribution
 
The vast majority of our products are manufactured or sewn in facilities that we own or lease and operate to support both the Delta Group and Salt Life Group. To a lesser extent, we also use third-party contractors and suppliers to supplement our requirements. Our vertically integrated manufacturing operations include a textile facility and sew and decoration facilities.
 
Our manufacturing operations begin with the purchase of yarn and other raw materials from third-party suppliers. We have operated with a supply agreement with Parkdale Mills, Inc. and Parkdale America, LLC (collectively "Parkdale") to supply our yarn requirements since 2005, with our existing agreement running through December 31, 2021. Under the supply agreement, we purchase all of our yarn requirements for use in our manufacturing operations from Parkdale, excluding yarns that Parkdale does not manufacture or cannot manufacture due to temporary capacity constraints. The purchase price of yarn is based upon the cost of cotton, as reported by the New York Cotton Exchange, plus a fixed conversion cost. We set future cotton prices with purchase commitments as a component of the purchase price in advance of the shipment of finished yarn from Parkdale.
 
We manufacture fabrics in our leased textile facility located near San Pedro Sula, Honduras. We also purchase specialized fabrics that we currently do not have the capacity or capability to produce and may purchase other fabrics when it is cost-effective to do so. In fiscal years 2019 and 2018, we manufactured over 80% of fabrics used in our internally-produced garments. The manufacturing process continues at one of our six apparel manufacturing facilities where fabric is cut and sewn into finished garments. These owned or leased facilities are located domestically (two in North Carolina) and internationally (two in Honduras, one in El Salvador and one in Mexico). In fiscal years 2019 and 2018, approximately 90% or more of our manufactured products were sewn in our owned or leased manufacturing facilities. The remaining products were sewn by third-party contractors located primarily in the Caribbean Basin. To supplement our internal manufacturing platform, we purchase products from third-party global suppliers. In fiscal years 2019 and 2018, we sourced less than 20% of our total products from third parties.
 
Many of the garments will be decorated using a screen printing or digital printing technology as well as retail-packaged, including ticketing, hang tags, and hangers.  These services can be performed domestically for quick-turn service or internationally in our facilities in El Salvador and Mexico. We offer digital fulfillment services, powered by DTG2Go, at seven domestic facilities, including three such facilities that are integrated with Delta Group distribution centers. These facilities support our strategy of establishing integrated fulfillment locations that combine our DTG2Go state-of-the-art digital platform with our Delta Activewear business's supply of fashion and core basic garments. Furthermore, these facilities create a seamless nationwide footprint allowing us to reach over half of all U.S. consumers with one-day shipping.
 
 At fiscal 2019 year end, we operated nine distribution facilities strategically located throughout the United States that carry in-stock inventory for shipment to customers, with most shipments made via third-party carriers. To better serve customers, we allow products to be ordered by the piece, dozen, or full case quantity, and we aggressively leverage our strengths and efficiencies to meet the quick-turn needs of our customers. Because a significant portion of our business consists of at-once replenishment, we believe that backlog order levels do not provide a general indication of future sales.
 
See Item 2. Properties for more information about each of our primary manufacturing and distribution facilities.


Sales & Marketing
 
Our sales and marketing functions consist of both employed and independent sales representatives and agencies located throughout the country. Our sales teams service specialty and boutique shops, upscale and traditional department stores, mid-tier retailers, sporting goods stores, e-retailers and the U.S. military. Our brands leverage both in-house and outsourced marketing communication professionals to amplify their lifestyle statements.
 
The majority of our apparel products are produced based on forecasts to permit quick shipments to our customers; however, our private label programs are generally made only to order. During fiscal year 2019, we shipped our products to approximately 9,000 customers, many of whom have numerous retail "doors."  No single customer accounted for more than 10% of our sales in fiscal years 2019 or 2018, and our strategy is to not become dependent on any single customer. Revenues attributable to sales of our products in foreign countries, as a percentage of our consolidated net sales, represented approximately 1% in both fiscal years 2019 and 2018.
 
Trademarks and License Agreements
 
We own several well-recognized trademarks that are important to our business. Salt Life® is an authentic, aspirational lifestyle brand that embraces those who love the ocean and everything associated with living the "Salt Life". Soffe® has stood for quality and value in the athletic and activewear market for more than sixty years. Our other registered trademarks include COAST®, Intensity Athletics®, Kudzu®, Pro Weight®, Magnum Weight®, and the Delta Design. Our trademarks are valuable assets that differentiate the marketing of our products. We vigorously protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights against infringement. While our strategy is to own the intellectual property we use within our business, the Soffe business unit is an official licensee for branches of the United States military.  We believe these license agreements are important given the military heritage of Soffe.

Competition
 
As a vertically-integrated apparel company, we have numerous competitors with respect to the manufacturing and sale of apparel products in both domestic and international markets, many of which are larger and have more brand recognition and greater marketing budgets. Some of these competitors may benefit from lower production costs that can result from greater operational scale, a differing supply chain footprint, or trade-related agreements and other macroeconomic factors that may enable them to compete more effectively.
 
Competition in our Delta Group segment is generally based upon price, service, delivery time, and quality with the relative importance of each factor dependent upon the needs of the particular customer and the specific product offering. These businesses are highly price competitive and competitor actions can greatly influence pricing and demand for our products. While price is still important in the private label market, quality and service are generally more important factors for customer choice. Our ability to consistently service the needs of our private label customers greatly impacts future business with these customers. We believe our Western Hemisphere-centered manufacturing platform enables us to compete with our competitors by providing an outlet for customers to diversify their sourcing footprints and reduce time to market. Furthermore, as an integrated entity with design, manufacturing, sourcing, and marketing capabilities, we believe the interdependencies within our portfolio provide cost, quality, and speed to market advantages that enable us to be more competitive.
 
We believe that competition within our Salt Life Group segment is based primarily upon brand recognition, design, and consumer preference. We focus on sustaining the strong reputation of our lifestyle brands by adapting our product offerings to changes in fashion trends and consumer preferences.  We aim to keep our merchandise offerings fresh with unique artwork and new designs and support the integrated lifestyle statement of our products through effective consumer marketing. We believe that our favorable competitive position stems from strong consumer recognition and brand loyalty, the high quality of our products, and our flexibility and process control, which drive product consistency. We believe that our ability to remain competitive in the areas of quality, price, design, marketing, product development, manufacturing, technology and distribution will, in large part, determine our future success.
 
Seasonality
 
Although our various product lines are sold on a year-round basis, the demand for specific products or styles reflects some seasonality. By diversifying our product lines over the years, we have reduced the overall seasonality of our business. Sales in our third fiscal quarter (quarter ended in June) are typically the highest and represented 27% of fiscal year 2019 net sales.  Our first fiscal quarter (quarter ended in December) typically is the lowest and represented 24% of fiscal year 2019 net sales. Consumer demand for apparel is cyclical and dependent upon the overall level of demand for soft goods, which may or may not coincide with the overall level of discretionary consumer spending. These levels of demand change as regional, domestic and international economic conditions change. Therefore, the distribution of sales by quarter in fiscal year 2019 may not be indicative of the distribution in future years.
Employees and Social Responsibility
 
As of September 28, 2019, we employed approximately 8,500 full time employees, of whom approximately 1,150 were employed in the United States. A total of approximately 3,150 employees at two of our facilities in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, are party to multi-year collective bargaining agreements. We have historically conducted our operations without significant labor disruptions and believe that our relations with our employees are good. We have invested significant time and resources to have the working conditions in all of our facilities meet or exceed the standards imposed by governing laws and regulations. All of our manufacturing facilities in Honduras, El Salvador and Mexico are Worldwide Responsible Accredited Production (WRAP) certified. We are a Category C affiliate with the Fair Labor Association (FLA), which further enhances human rights compliance monitoring for our plants and our third party contractors. In addition, we have proactive programs to promote workplace safety, personal health and employee wellness. We also support educational institutions and/or charitable organizations in communities where we operate.
Environmental and Regulatory Matters
 
We are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, wastewater discharges, storm water flows, air emissions and solid waste disposal. Our plants generate very small quantities of hazardous waste, which are either recycled or disposed of off-site.
  5



The environmental regulations applicable to our business are becoming increasingly stringent, and we incur capital and other expenditures annually to achieve compliance with environmental standards. We currently do not expect that the amount of expenditures required to comply with these environmental standards will have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition or liquidity. There can be no assurance, however, that future changes in federal, state, or local regulations, interpretations of existing regulations or the discovery of currently unknown problems or conditions will not require substantial additional expenditures. Similarly, while we believe that we are currently in compliance with all applicable environmental requirements, the extent of our liability, if any, for past failures to comply with laws, regulations and permits applicable to our operations cannot be determined and could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition and liquidity.
