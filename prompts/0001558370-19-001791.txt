     Overview of Our Business
     Axcelis Technologies, Inc. (“Axcelis,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) designs, manufactures and services ion implantation and other processing equipment used in the fabrication of semiconductor chips. We believe that our Purion family of products offers the most innovative implanters available on the market today. We sell to leading semiconductor chip manufacturers worldwide. The ion implantation business represented 95.3% of our revenue in 2018, with the remaining 4.7% of revenue derived from other legacy processing systems. In addition to equipment, we provide extensive aftermarket lifecycle products and services, including used tools, spare parts, equipment upgrades, maintenance services and customer training.
     Axcelis’ business commenced in 1978 and its current corporate entity was incorporated in Delaware in 1995. We are headquartered in Beverly, Massachusetts and maintain an internet site at www.axcelis.com. On or through our website, investors may access, free of charge, our annual reports on Form 10‑K, quarterly reports on Form 10‑Q, current reports on Form 8‑K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our website and the information contained therein or connected thereto shall not be deemed to be incorporated into this Form 10‑K.
     Despite a significant slowdown in memory spending in the second half of 2018, revenue increased by nearly 8% over 2017, with systems revenue increasing by 6.7%, and revenues from Customer Support & Innovation (“CS&I”), our aftermarket business, increasing by nearly 10%.  2018 full year gross margin exceeded 40% and cash increased by 33% to $178.0 million.
 Our 2018 results were the product of hard work across the Company over prior years to expand the Purion install base to a large and diverse group of customers. We have focused on key markets in the mature process technology sector such as image sensor, power device and mature foundry and logic. We developed Purion product extensions specifically for these markets and becoming key partners with these customers.  As a result, our fourth quarter 2018 revenues showed a split of 68% mature process technology and 32% memory, illustrating our expansion into the mature process technology sector, and the reduction in our dependence on memory customers.  For the full year the mix was 54% mature process technology and 46% memory. 
     We continue to work diligently to ensure that manufacturing and operating expense levels remain well aligned to business conditions. We believe that the most fundamental interest of our stockholders is consistent, profitable, financial performance, which we expect to continue to deliver in 2019. Our performance is subject to risks and uncertainties discussed below under Item 1A Risk Factors.
     Industry Overview
     Semiconductor chips, also known as integrated circuits, are used in a continuously evolving range of consumer and industrial products, including for example, personal computers, mobile devices, automobiles, sensors and controllers for the “internet of things,” and data storage servers. Types of semiconductor chips include dynamic random-access memory (“DRAM”) and “negative and” (“NAND”) Flash memory; logic devices to process information; and “system on chip” devices (which have both logic and memory features). The increased number of devices providing information to and receiving information from the Internet, sometimes referred to as the “Connected World,” is increasing demand for chips. These chips are used in data input, such as image sensors, which are often manufactured using mature processing technologies, as well as for memory chips to support the storage of data, internet streaming and “cloud computing” data analytics.
     Most semiconductor chips are built on silicon wafers of either 200mm (8 inches) or 300mm (12 inches) in diameter. Each semiconductor chip is made up of millions of tiny transistors or “switches” to control the functions of the 

 
  2

device. Transistors are created in the silicon wafer by introducing various precisely placed impurities into the silicon in specific patterns. 
     Semiconductor chip manufacturers own or manage wafer fabrication facilities (often referred to as “fabs”), which utilize many different types of equipment in the making of integrated circuits. Over 300 process steps utilizing over 50 different types of process tools are required to make a single device like a microprocessor. Semiconductor chip manufacturers seek device performance benefits through new products and technology enhancements and productivity improvements through increased throughput, equipment utilization and higher manufacturing yields. Capacity is added by increasing the amount of manufacturing equipment in existing fabrication facilities and by constructing new fabrication facilities. 
     We have different types of customers, which impacts timing of purchases and technology requirements. Some customers are integrated electronics manufacturers, making semiconductor chips for their own devices.  These same companies may also act as foundries, manufacturing chips for other electronic manufacturers or chip design companies.  Some customers only function as foundries.  A few companies design and manufacture branded chips that are sold to device manufacturers.  In addition, some customers have partnerships or joint ventures with two or more semiconductor chip manufacturers to share the technology development and capital investment.  The timing of purchases by foundry customers will depend on their success in securing manufacturing contracts.  Also, foundry customers will look for equipment that can deliver the broadest capabilities in order to be prepared to manufacture all chip types, while integrated electronics manufacturers may invest in processing equipment dedicated to a specific application they require for their products.
     The semiconductor capital equipment industry is cyclical, as global chip production capacities successively exceed, then lag behind, global chip demand. When chip demand is high, and inventories low, chip manufacturers add capacity through capital equipment purchases. Given the difficulties of forecasting and calibrating chip demand and production capacity, the industry periodically experiences excess chip inventories and softening chip prices. Device manufacturers react with muted capital spending, lowering the demand for capital equipment. Changes in consumer and business demand for products in which chips are used also affect the industry. A successful semiconductor capital equipment manufacturer must not only provide some of the most technically complex products manufactured in the world but also must manage its business to thrive during low points in the cycle.

 Ion Implantation Systems
     Ion implantation is a principal step in the transistor formation cycle of the semiconductor chip manufacturing process. Ion implantation is also used to change the material characteristics of the silicon for reasons other than electrical doping, a process known as “material modification.” An ion implanter is a large, technically advanced system that injects dopants such as arsenic, boron or phosphorus into a wafer. These dopants are ionized and therefore have an electrical charge state. This electric charge state allows the dopants to be accelerated, focused and filtered with electric and magnetic fields. Ion implanters use these fields to create a beam of ions with a precisely defined energy level (ranging between several hundred and eight million electron‑volts) and with a precisely defined beam current level (ranging from microamps to milliamps). Certain areas of the silicon wafer are blocked off by a polymer material known as photoresist, which acts as a “stencil” to pattern devices so that the dopants will only enter the wafer where needed. Typical process flows require twenty implant steps, with the most advanced processes requiring thirty or more steps. Each implant step is characterized by four key parameters: dopant type, dose (amount of dopant), energy (depth into the silicon) and tilt/twist (angle of wafer relative to the ion beam).
     In order to efficiently cover the wide range of implant steps, three different types of implanters have been developed, each targeted at a specific range of applications, primarily defined by dose and energy. The three traditional implanter types are referred to as high energy, medium current and high current:
    
· | High energy implanters emerged to address the need for deeper implants with a high energy range and low dose.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Medium current implanters are the original model of ion implanter, with mid to low‑range energy and dose capability.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | High current implanters were the second type of implanter to emerge, having low energy capability and high dose range.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          The Purion Platform and Family of Ion Implanters
     Axcelis offers a complete line of high energy, high current and medium current implanters for all application requirements. Our Purion flagship systems are all based on a common platform which enables a unique combination of implant purity, precision and productivity. Combining a state‑of‑the‑art single wafer end station, with advanced spot beam architectures (that ensures all points across the wafer see the same beam condition at the same beam angle), Purion products enable exceptional process control to optimize devise performance and yield, at high productivity.
· | High Energy Implant. Our Purion XE high energy system combines Axcelis’ production‑proven RF Linac high energy, spot beam technology with the Purion platform wafer handling system. Axcelis is a market leader in high energy ion implanters, and we expect to maintain our leadership in the high energy segment through sales of both our legacy multi‑wafer high energy systems and the Purion XE, the Purion EXE and the Purion VXE. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Medium Current Implant. Our Purion M medium current system offers higher productivity and lower electrical energy consumption compared to competitive offerings, in addition to other advantages. Our Purion M systems also offer differentiated capabilities for specialty applications. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | High Current Implant. Our Purion H spot beam, high current system covers all traditional high current requirements as well as those associated with emerging and future devices. Purion H capabilities extend beyond traditional high current energy and dose ranges, in order to cover new device fabrication requirements as well as to maximize capital utilization and flexibility.

 We believe our ion implant products will continue to meet customer demand for advantages in productivity, process performance and technical extendibility. 
     Aftermarket Support and Services
     Through our Customer Support and Innovation (“CS&I”), business, we offer our customers extensive aftermarket service and support throughout the lifecycle of the equipment we manufacture. We believe that approximately 3,200 of our products are in use in 31 countries worldwide. The service and support that we provide includes used tools, spare parts, equipment upgrades, and maintenance services. We offer varying levels of sales, service and applications support out of our field offices to customers located in 31 countries. Revenue generated through our CS&I business represented 36.6%, 36.0% and 47.8% of revenue in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
     To support our aftermarket business, we have sales and marketing personnel, field service engineers, and spare parts and applications engineers, as well as employees located at our manufacturing facilities who work with our customers to provide customer training and documentation, product, process and applications support. 
     Most of our customers maintain spare parts inventories for our machines. In addition to our web‑based spare parts management and replenishment tracking program, we offer a number of Business‑to‑Business options to support our customers’ parts management requirements. Our Axcelis Managed Inventory service offering, a parts consignment arrangement, provides the customer with full spares support, with Axcelis retaining responsibility for the complete supply chain. These services provide ease of use alternatives that help us reduce order fulfillment costs and improve cycle time, resulting in an expanded customer base for this service offering.
     Sales and Marketing
     We primarily sell our equipment and services through our direct sales force. We conduct sales and marketing activities from our sales offices located in the United States, Taiwan, South Korea, China, Germany, Singapore, Japan and Italy. In February 2018, we entered into a distribution and service agreement with SCREEN Semiconductor Solutions, a subsidiary of SCREEN Holdings Co. Ltd., for our Purion ion implant product line in Japan.
     International revenue, including export sales from our U.S. manufacturing facilities to foreign customers and sales by foreign subsidiaries and branches, accounted for 87.7%, 84.9% and 80.0% of total revenue in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Substantially all of our sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. See Note 17 to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 15 of this Form 10‑K for a breakdown of our revenue and long‑lived assets in the United States, Europe and Asia. See also Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” for information about risks attendant to our foreign operations.
     Customers
     In 2018, the top 20 semiconductor chip manufacturers accounted for approximately 88.8% of total semiconductor capital equipment spending, down from 90.9% in 2017. These manufacturers are from the largest semiconductor chip manufacturing regions in the world: the United States, Asia Pacific (Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore, Japan and China) and Europe. 
     Information on net sales to unaffiliated customers is included in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For the year ended December 31, 2018, revenues from each of Samsung Electronics Co, Ltd., and SK hynix represented 10 percent or more of consolidated revenues and the loss of these customers would have a material adverse effect on our business. 
         Research and Development
     Our industry continues to experience rapid technological change, requiring us to frequently introduce new products and enhancements. Our Beverly, Massachusetts Advanced Technology Center houses a process development 

 
  5

laboratory with 12,500 sq. ft. of class 10/100/1000 clean room for product demonstrations and process development and a 34,000 sq. ft. customer training center. The Advanced Technology Center provides infrastructure and process capabilities that allow customers to test their unique process steps on our systems under conditions that substantially replicate the customers’ production environments. This facility also provides significant capability for our research and development efforts.
     We devote a significant portion of our personnel and financial resources to research and development programs and seek to maintain close relationships with our customers to remain responsive to their product needs. We have also sought to reduce the development cycle for new products through a collaborative process whereby our engineering, manufacturing and marketing personnel work closely together with one another and with our customers at an earlier stage in the process. We use 3D, computer‑aided design, finite element analysis and other computer‑based modeling methods to test new designs.
     Our expenses for research and development were $51.9 million, $43.1 million and $34.4 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, or 11.7%, 10.5% and 12.9% of revenue, respectively. We expect that research and development expenditures will continue to represent a similar level of investment in future years.
     Manufacturing
     We manufacture products at our 417,000 sq. ft. ISO 9001:2015, ISO 14001:2015 certified plant in Beverly, Massachusetts. Our facility employs best in class manufacturing techniques, including lean manufacturing, six sigma controls and advanced inventory management, purchasing and quality systems.
     Our clean manufacturing process uses class 1,000/10,000 space to facilitate most of our manufacturing requirements.
     Our core competency in manufacturing and supply chain management is built around system assembly and testing, which remains an in‑house capability due to the high degree of expertise and intellectual property associated with the process and design. Non‑core work is sourced to one of several global partners and includes items such as vacuum systems, wafer handling and commodity‑level components. We continuously pursue outsourcing opportunities where the economics are justified, with a goal of enabling quality and margin improvement. Our supply chain team is globally focused and is located in Beverly and Singapore. Customized and commercially available software solutions drive our planning, purchasing and inventory tracking process.
     Our products are designed to be assembled and tested in a modular fashion, which facilitates our industry‑recognized “ship‑from‑cell” process. Specially developed test stands, software and tooling provide the framework for this accelerated delivery process. Customers that choose ship‑from‑cell substantially improve their delivery times while receiving the same high level of quality provided by more traditional longer cycle integration techniques. Product margins and inventory turns also improve as a result of shorter factory cycle times and increased labor productivity.
     Installation of our equipment is provided by factory and field teams. The process includes assembling the equipment at our installation site, and after it has been connected, recalibrating it to factory specifications.
     Competition
     The semiconductor industry is highly competitive and is characterized by a small number of participants ranging in size. Significant competitive factors in the semiconductor capital equipment market include price, cost of ownership, equipment performance, customer support, capabilities and breadth of product line.
     In ion implantation, we mainly compete against Applied Materials, Inc. Applied Materials and Axcelis are the only ion implant manufacturers with a full range of implant products, and service and support infrastructures able to service our customers globally. Three other niche players we compete with from time to time include Advanced Ion Beam Technology, Inc., Nissin Ion Implantation Co., Ltd. and Sumitomo Heavy Industries Ion Technology Co., Ltd.

     Intellectual Property
     We rely on patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret protection in the United States and in other countries, as well as contractual restrictions, to protect our proprietary rights in our products and our business. As of January 1, 2019, we had 243 active patents issued in the United States and 491 active patents granted in other countries, as well as 216 patent applications (48 in the United States and 168 in other countries) on file with various patent agencies worldwide. Patents are generally in effect for up to 20 years from the filing of the application.
     We intend to file additional patent applications and grow our intellectual property portfolio as appropriate. Although patents are important to our business, we do not believe that we are substantially dependent on any single patent or any group of patents.
     We have trademarks, both registered and unregistered, that are maintained to provide customer recognition for our products in the marketplace. Trademark registrations generally remain in effect as long as the trademarks are in use. From time to time, we enter into license agreements with third parties under which we obtain or grant rights to patented or proprietary technology. We do not believe that any of our licenses are currently material to us. 
     Backlog
     Systems backlog, including deferred systems revenue, was $65.1 million and $87.3 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We believe it is meaningful to investors to include deferred systems revenue as part of our backlog. Deferred systems revenue represents revenue that will be recognized in future periods based on prior shipments or customer prepayments. Our policy is to include in backlog only those system orders for which we have accepted purchase orders and are typically due to ship within six months. All orders are subject to cancellations or rescheduling by customers with limited or no penalties.
     Backlog does not include orders received and fulfilled within a quarter. Our backlog at the beginning of a quarter typically does not include all orders required to achieve our sales objectives for that quarter. Backlog is not necessarily an indicator of future business trends because orders for services or parts received during the quarter are generally performed or shipped within the same quarter.
     Bookings in the quarter ended December 31, 2018 were $42.1 million compared to $103.8 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2017.
     Employees
     As of December 31, 2018, we had 992 employees and 87 temporary staff worldwide, of which 761 work in North America, 261 in Asia and 57 in Europe. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. Our employees are not represented by a labor union and are not subject to a collective bargaining agreement. One of our European locations has formed a work council, which has certain information and discussion rights under applicable law.     Environmental
     We are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate that regulate, among other things: air emissions; water discharges; and the generation, use, storage, transportation, handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes produced by our manufacturing, research and development and sales activities. As with other companies engaged in like businesses, the nature of our operations exposes us to the risk of environmental liabilities, claims, penalties and orders.
     We are proud of our commitment to improving our environment. We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and that there are no pending environmental matters that would have a material impact on our business. We are ISO 9001:2015 and ISO 14001:2015 certified at our Beverly, MA facility.
