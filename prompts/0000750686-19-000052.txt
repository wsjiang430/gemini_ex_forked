Item 1. Business
Overview. Camden National Corporation (hereafter referred to as “we,” “our,” “us,” or the “Company”) is a publicly-held bank holding company, with $4.3 billion in assets at December 31, 2018, incorporated under the laws of the State of Maine and headquartered in Camden, Maine. Camden National Bank (the "Bank"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, was founded in 1875. The Company was founded in 1984, went public in 1997 and is now registered with NASDAQ Global Market (“NASDAQ”) under the ticker symbol "CAC."
The Company, as a diversified financial services provider, pursues the objective of achieving long-term sustainable growth by balancing growth opportunities against profit, while mitigating risks inherent in the financial services industry. The primary business of the Company and the Bank is to attract deposits from, and to extend loans to, consumer, institutional, municipal, non-profit and commercial customers. The Company, through the Bank, provides a broad array of banking and other financial services, including wealth management and trust services, brokerage, investment advisory and insurance services, to consumer, business, non-profit and municipal customers. For the year ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, net interest income was our primary revenue source, representing 76%, 75% and 74%, respectively, of our total revenues (sum of net interest income and non-interest income). Net interest income is the interest earned on our lending activities, investment securities and other interest-earning assets, less the interest paid on interest-bearing deposits and borrowings. 
Our consolidated financial statements accompanying this Form 10-K include the accounts of the Company, the Bank and its subsidiaries and divisions. All inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
We are committed to the philosophy of serving the financial needs of customers in our communities, as described in our core purpose: Through each interaction, we will enrich the lives of people, help businesses succeed and vitalize communities.
We have achieved a five-year compounded annual asset growth rate of 11%, resulting in $4.3 billion in total assets at December 31, 2018. The following is a chronological time-line of significant events and factors contributing to our asset growth over the past five years:

• | 2014 — We achieved loan growth of $192.2 million. We expanded our franchise outside of Maine by opening our first commercial loan office in Manchester, New Hampshire. This commercial loan office provided us with a wider reach across northern New England and access to new markets.


• | 2015 — We completed the acquisition of SBM Financial, Inc. ("SBM"), the parent company of The Bank of Maine, on October 16, 2015. This was and continues to be the Company's largest acquisition to-date, with total acquired assets of $816.3 million, including loans of $628.0 million, and deposits and borrowings of $721.2 million. The acquisition provided us with an expanded presence in Southern and Central Maine, significant low-cost deposits (including interest and non-interest checking, savings and money market), and strengthened our mortgage banking platform.


• | 2016 — We achieved loan growth of $104.4 million, or 4%, and deposits growth of $102.2 million, or 4%.


• | 2017 — We achieved loan growth of $187.9 million, or 7% and deposits growth of $172.0 million, or 6%, driven by low-cost deposits growth of 11%.


• | 2018 — We achieved loan growth of $243.8 million, or 9% and deposits growth of $464.0 million, or 15%, driven by low-cost deposits growth of 15%.

The financial services industry continues to experience consolidations through mergers that could create opportunities for us to promote our value proposition to other financial institutions and financial service companies. We continue to evaluate the possibility of expansion into new markets through both de novo expansion and acquisitions. In addition, we are focused on maximizing growth across our current markets, and particularly those markets seen as growth markets where we currently have less of a presence and market share. Further details of our financial information can be found within the consolidated financial statements within Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.

Supervision and Regulation
The following discussion addresses elements of the regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies and their subsidiaries. This regulatory framework is intended primarily for the protection of depositors, the Federal Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”), and the banking system as a whole, rather than the protection of shareholders or non-depository creditors of a bank holding company such as the Company.
As a bank holding company, the Company is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“FRB”) under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (“BHCA”). As a national bank, the Bank is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”).
The following is a summary of certain aspects of various statutes and regulations applicable to the Company and its direct and indirect subsidiaries. This summary is not a comprehensive analysis of all applicable laws, and you should refer to the applicable statutes and regulations for more information. Changes in applicable laws or regulations, and in their interpretation and application by regulatory agencies and other governmental authorities, cannot be predicted, but may have a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Regulation of the Company
As a bank holding company, the Company is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the FRB, which has the authority, among other things, to order bank holding companies to cease and desist from unsafe or unsound banking practices; to assess civil money penalties; and to order termination of non-banking activities or termination of ownership and control of a non-banking subsidiary by a bank holding company.
Source of Strength. Under long-standing FRB policy, now codified by Section 616 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”), the Company is required to serve as a source of financial strength for the Bank. This support may be required at times when the Company may not have the resources to provide it. In the event of a bank holding company’s bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a bank subsidiary will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment.
Acquisitions and Activities. The BHCA prohibits a bank holding company, without prior approval of the FRB, from acquiring all or substantially all the assets of a bank, acquiring control of a bank, merging or consolidating with another bank holding company, or acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of another bank or bank holding company if, after such acquisition, the acquiring bank holding company would control more than 5% of any class of the voting shares of such other bank or bank holding company. The BHCA also prohibits a bank holding company from engaging directly or indirectly in activities other than those of banking, managing or controlling banks or furnishing services to its subsidiary banks. However, a bank holding company may engage in and may own shares of companies engaged in activities that the FRB has determined, by order or regulation, to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto.
Limitations on Acquisitions of Company Common Stock. The Change in Bank Control Act prohibits a person or group of persons acting in concert from acquiring “control” of a bank holding company unless the FRB has been notified and has not 
5

objected to the transaction. Under a rebuttable presumption established by the FRB, the acquisition of 10% or more of a class of voting securities of a bank holding company with a class of securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act would generally constitute the acquisition of control of a bank holding company. In addition, the BHCA prohibits any company from acquiring control of a bank or bank holding company without first having obtained the approval of the FRB. Among other circumstances, under the BHCA, a company is deemed to control a bank or bank holding company if the company owns, controls or holds with power to vote 25% or more of a class of voting securities of the bank or bank holding company, controls in any manner the election of a majority of directors or trustees of the bank or bank holding company, or the FRB determines that the company has the power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of the bank or bank holding company.
Regulation of the Bank
The Bank is subject to regulation, supervision, and examination by the OCC. Additionally, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) has secondary supervisory authority as the insurer of the Bank’s deposits. The Bank is also subject to regulations issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ("CFPB"), as enforced by the OCC. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the FRB may directly examine the subsidiaries of the Company, including the Bank. The enforcement powers available to the federal banking regulators include, among other things, the ability to issue cease and desist or removal orders; to terminate insurance of deposits; to assess civil money penalties; to issue directives to increase capital; to place the Bank into receivership; and to initiate injunctive actions against banking organizations and institution-affiliated parties.
Deposit Insurance. The deposit obligations of the Bank are insured by the FDIC’s DIF up to the applicable limits. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (“FDIA”), insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC if the FDIC finds that the insured depository institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC.
The Bank’s deposits are subject to deposit insurance assessments to maintain the DIF. The Bank’s deposit insurance assessments are based on its assets. To determine its deposit insurance assessment, the Bank computes the base amount of its average consolidated assets less its average tangible equity (defined as the amount of Tier I capital) and the applicable assessment rate. On May 20, 2016, the FDIC’s Board of Directors adopted a final rule that changed the manner in which deposit insurance assessment rates are calculated for established small banks (generally those banks with less than $10 billion of assets that have been insured for at least five years). The rule utilizes the CAMELS rating system, which is a supervisory rating system designed to take into account and reflect all financial and operational risks that a bank may face, including capital adequacy, asset quality, management capability, earnings, liquidity and sensitivity to market risk. Each of the seven financial ratios and a weighted average of CAMELS component ratings is multiplied by a corresponding pricing multiplier. The sum of these products is added to a uniform amount, with the resulting sum being an institution’s initial base assessment rate (subject to minimum or maximum assessment rates based on a bank’s CAMELS composite rating). This method takes into account various measures, including an institution’s leverage ratio, brokered deposit ratio, one year asset growth, the ratio of net income before taxes to total assets and considerations related to asset quality. Assessments for established small banks with a CAMELS rating of 1 or 2 range from 1.5 to 16 basis points, after adjustments. Assessment rates for established small banks with a CAMELS rating of 3 range from 3 to 30 basis points, after adjustments. Assessment rates for established small banks with a CAMELS composite rating of 4 or 5 range from 11 to 30 basis points, after adjustments. The FDIC has the power to adjust deposit insurance assessment rates at any time, and the Company is not able to predict the amount or timing of any adjustment. 
The FDIA, as amended by the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act and the Dodd-Frank Act, establishes a minimum reserve ratio of the DIF to estimated insured deposits of 1.15% prior to September 2020 and 1.35% thereafter. Further, the Dodd-Frank Act required that, in setting assessments, the FDIC offset the effect of the increase in the minimum reserve ratio from 1.15% to 1.35% on banks with less than $10 billion in assets.
To satisfy these requirements, on March 15, 2016, the FDIC’s Board of Directors approved a final rule to increase the DIF’s reserve ratio to the statutorily required minimum ratio of 1.35% of estimated insured deposits. The final rule imposed a 4.5 basis points surcharge on the quarterly insurance assessments of large banks, which became effective on July 1, 2016. The surcharge continued through September 31, 2018, when the reserve ratio reached 1.36% of insured deposits, exceeding the statutorily required minimum reserve ratio of 1.35%. Small banks, such as the Bank, were not required to pay the surcharge. To offset the effect of the increase in the reserve ratio on small banks, those banks will receive credits for the portion of their assessments that helped to raise the reserve ratio from 1.15% to 1.35%. Credits will be applied automatically to reduce a small bank’s regular assessment in each quarter that the reserve ratio is at least 1.38%, up to the entire amount of the credit or assessment.

Activities and Investments of National Banking Associations. National banking associations must comply with the National Bank Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder by the OCC, which limit the activities of national banking associations to those that are deemed to be part of, or incidental to, the “business of banking.” Activities that are part of, or incidental to, the business of banking include taking deposits, borrowing and lending money and discounting or negotiating promissory notes, drafts, bills of exchange, and other evidences of debt. Subsidiaries of national banking associations generally may only engage in activities permissible for the parent national bank.
Lending Restrictions. Federal law limits a bank’s authority to extend credit to its insiders, including its directors, executive officers and 10% shareholders, as well as to entities controlled by such persons. Among other things, extensions of credit to insiders are required to be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons. Also, the terms of such extensions of credit may not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features and may not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons, individually and in the aggregate, which limits are based, in part, on the amount of the bank’s capital. The Dodd-Frank Act explicitly provides that an extension of credit to an insider includes credit exposure arising from a derivatives transaction, repurchase agreement, reverse repurchase agreement, securities lending transaction or securities borrowing transaction. Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act requires that asset sale transactions with insiders must be on market terms, and if the transaction represents more than 10% of the capital and surplus of the Bank, be approved by a majority of the disinterested directors of the Bank.
Brokered Deposits. Section 29 of the FDIA and FDIC regulations generally limit the ability of an insured depository institution to accept, renew or roll over any brokered deposit unless the institution’s capital category is “well capitalized” or, with a waiver from the FDIC, “adequately capitalized.” A bank that is “adequately capitalized” and that accepts or renews brokered deposits subject to a waiver from the FDIC is subject to additional restrictions on the interest rates it may offer. Depository institutions that have brokered deposits in excess of 10% of total assets will be subject to increased FDIC deposit insurance premium assessments. In May 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (“EGRRCPA”) was enacted. Section 202 of the EGRRCPA amended Section 29 of the FDIA to exempt a capped amount of reciprocal deposits from treatment as brokered deposits. On December 18, 2018, the FDIC adopted a final rule to implement Section 202 of the EGRRCPA. Under the final rule, an institution that is “well capitalized” and has a CAMELS composite rating of 1 or 2 may exempt reciprocal deposits from treatment as brokered deposits up to $5 billion or 20% of the institution’s total liabilities. Institutions that are not well rated or well capitalized may treat reciprocal deposits as non-brokered up to an amount equal to a “special cap” set forth in the final rule. In addition, on December 18, 2018, the FDIC issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking in connection with the FDIC’s comprehensive review of its regulatory approach to brokered deposits to solicit comment on all aspects of the FDIC’s brokered deposit regulations. The Company is not able to predict at this time whether any regulatory changes will be adopted as a result of the FDIC’s notice, or what impact, if any, such changes would have on the Bank. 
Community Reinvestment Act. The Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”) requires the OCC to evaluate the Bank’s performance in helping to meet the credit needs of the entire communities it serves, including low and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with its safe and sound banking operations, and to take this record into consideration when evaluating certain applications. The OCC’s CRA regulations are generally based upon objective criteria of the performance of institutions under three key assessment tests: (i) a lending test, to evaluate the institution’s record of making loans in its service areas; (ii) an investment test, to evaluate the institution’s record of investing in community development projects, affordable housing, and programs benefiting low- or moderate-income individuals and businesses; and (iii) a service test, to evaluate the institution’s delivery of services through its branches, ATMs, and other offices. The OCC rates a national bank’s compliance with the CRA as “Outstanding,” “Satisfactory,” “Needs to Improve” or “Substantial Noncompliance.” Failure of the Bank to receive at least a “Satisfactory” rating could inhibit the Bank or the Company from undertaking certain activities, including acquisitions of other financial institutions. The Bank currently has an “Outstanding” CRA rating.
Capital Adequacy and Safety and Soundness
Regulatory Capital Requirements. In July 2013, The FRB, the OCC and the FDIC approved final capital rules (“Capital Rules”) that are based on the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s (“Basel Committee”) framework for strengthening capital and liquidity regulation (referred to as Basel III). The Capital Rules are intended to reflect the relationship between the banking organization’s capital and the degree of risk associated with its operations based on transactions recorded on-balance sheet as well as off-balance sheet items. The FRB and the OCC may from time to time require that a banking organization maintain capital above the minimum levels discussed below, due to the banking organization’s financial condition or actual or anticipated growth. The Company and the Bank became subject to the Capital Rules, applying the Standardized Approach, effective January 1, 2015. 
7

The Capital Rules define qualifying capital instruments and specify minimum amounts of capital as a percentage of assets that banking organizations are required to maintain. Common Equity Tier I (“CET1”) capital generally includes common stock and related surplus, retained earnings and, in certain cases and subject to certain limitations, minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries, less goodwill, other non-qualifying intangible assets and certain other deductions. Tier I capital for banks and bank holding companies generally consists of the sum of CET1 capital and “Additional Tier I capital” instruments, including non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, related surplus and, in certain cases and subject to limitations, minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries that does not qualify as CET1 capital, less certain deductions. Tier II capital consists of other types of capital instruments, including subordinated debt and, for smaller banking organizations, legacy hybrid capital securities, and, subject to limitations, a banking organization’s allowances for loan and lease losses. The sum of Tier I and Tier II capital less certain required deductions represents qualifying total risk-based capital. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, bank holding companies are not permitted to include trust preferred securities and cumulative perpetual preferred stock in Tier I capital. However, the FRB’s capital rule applicable to bank holding companies permanently grandfathers non-qualifying capital instruments, including trust preferred securities, issued and included in Tier 1 capital before May 19, 2010, and permits bank holding companies with less than $15 billion in total assets as of December 31, 2009, to include such instruments in Additional Tier I capital, subject to a limit of 25% of Tier I capital. In addition, under the Capital Rules, accumulated other comprehensive income (positive or negative) must be reflected in Tier I capital; however, the Company was permitted to make a one-time, permanent election to continue to exclude accumulated other comprehensive income from capital. The Company has made this election.
Under the Capital Rules, risk-based capital ratios are calculated by dividing CET1, Tier I and total risk-based capital, respectively, by risk-weighted assets. Assets and off-balance sheet credit equivalents are assigned a risk weight based primarily on relative credit risk.
Under the Capital Rules, the Company and the Bank are each required to maintain a minimum CET1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 4.5%, a minimum Tier I capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 6%, a minimum total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 8% and a minimum leverage ratio of 4%. Additionally, subject to a transition schedule that was fully phased in on January 1, 2019, the Capital Rules require an institution to establish a capital conservation buffer of CET1 capital in an amount above the minimum risk-based capital requirements for “adequately capitalized” institutions equal to 2.5% of total risk weighted assets. Banking institutions with a ratio of CET1 capital to risk-weighted assets above the minimum requirement but below the capital conservation buffer face restrictions on the ability to pay dividends, pay discretionary bonuses, and to engage in share repurchases based on the amount of the shortfall and the institution’s “eligible retained income” (that is, four quarter trailing net income, net of distributions and tax effects not reflected in net income). 
The EGRRCPA requires the federal bank regulators to adopt regulations to implement an exemption from the U.S. Basel III capital rules for smaller banking organizations, including the Company and the Bank, that maintain a “Community Bank Leverage Ratio” of at least 8% to 10%. Specifically, the legislation provides that if any depository institution or depository institution holding company with less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets maintains tangible equity in excess of this leverage ratio, as implemented by the federal bank regulators, it would be deemed to be in compliance with (i) the leverage and risk-based capital requirements promulgated by the federal banking agencies; (ii) in the case of a depository institution, the capital ratio requirements to be considered “well-capitalized” under the federal banking agencies’ “prompt corrective action” regime (see “—Prompt Corrective Action” below); and (iii) “any other capital or leverage requirements” to which the depository institution or holding company is subject, unless the appropriate federal banking agency determines otherwise based on the particular institution’s risk profile. 
On November 21, 2018, the FRB, OCC and FDIC proposed a rule to implement the Community Bank Leverage Ratio. Under the proposal, a qualifying small banking organization, such as the Company, that has less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets and meets certain risk-based criteria can choose to apply the proposed Community Bank Leverage Ratio framework if its Community Bank Leverage Ratio is greater than 9%. The Company is evaluating the potential impact of this proposal.
In December 2017, the Basel Committee published standards that it described as the finalization of the Basel III post-crisis regulatory reforms (the standards are commonly referred to as “Basel IV”). Among other things, these standards revise the Basel Committee's standardized approach for credit risk (including by recalibrating risk weights and introducing new capital requirements for certain "unconditionally cancellable commitments," such as home equity lines of credit) and provides a new standardized approach for operational risk capital. Under the Basel framework, these standards will generally be effective on January 1, 2022, with an aggregate output floor phasing in through January 1, 2027. Under the current U.S. capital rules, operational risk capital requirements and a capital floor apply only to advanced approaches institutions, and not to the Company or Bank. The impact of Basel IV on the Company and the Bank will depend on the manner in which it is implemented by the federal bank regulators.

The FDIA requires the federal banking agencies to take prompt corrective action with respect to depository institutions that do not meet the minimum capital requirements described above. The FDIA establishes five capital categories (“well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized”). The federal banking regulators must take certain mandatory supervisory actions, and are authorized to take other discretionary actions, with respect to institutions that are less than adequately capitalized, with supervisory actions progressively becoming more punitive as the institution’s capital category declines. Supervisory actions include: (i) restrictions on payment of capital distributions and management fees, (ii) requirements that a federal bank regulator monitor the condition of the institution and its efforts to restore its capital, (iii) submission of a capital restoration plan, (iv) restrictions on the growth of the institution’s assets and (v) requirements for prior regulatory approval of certain expansion proposals. A bank that is “critically undercapitalized” (i.e., has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0%) will be subject to further restrictions and generally will be placed in conservatorship or receivership within 90 days. An insured depository institution is considered “well capitalized” if it (i) has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater; (ii) a Tier I risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater; (iii) a CET1 ratio of at least 6.5% or greater, (iv) a leverage capital ratio of 5.0% or greater; and (v) is not subject to any written agreement, order, capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure.
The FDIA’s prompt corrective action provisions apply only to depository institutions such as the Bank, and not to bank holding companies. Under the FRB’s regulations, a bank holding company, such as the Company, is considered “well capitalized” if the bank holding company (i) has a total risk based capital ratio of at least 10%, (ii) has a Tier I risk-based capital ratio of at least 6%, and (iii) is not subject to any written agreement order, capital directive or prompt corrective action directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. Although prompt corrective action regulations apply only to depository institutions and not to bank holding companies, a bank that is required to submit a capital restoration plan generally must concurrently submit a performance guarantee by its parent holding company. The liability of the parent holding company under any such guarantee is limited to the lesser of five percent of the bank’s assets at the time it became “undercapitalized” or the amount needed to comply.
Information concerning the Company and the Bank with respect to capital requirements is incorporated by reference
from Item 7. "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Capital
Resources" and Note 13 of the consolidated financial statements included within this report.
The Bank and the Company meet all capital requirements under the Capital Rules, including the capital conservation buffer, and each meet the capital ratio requirements to be “well capitalized” for purposes of the prompt corrective action provisions of the FDIA and applicable FRB regulations, respectively.
Safety and Soundness Standards. The FDIA requires the federal bank regulatory agencies to prescribe safety and soundness standards, by regulations or guidelines, as the agencies deem appropriate. Guidelines adopted by the federal bank regulatory agencies establish general standards relating to internal controls and information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings and compensation, fees and benefits. In general, these guidelines require, among other things, appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risk and exposures specified in the guidelines. The guidelines prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer, employee, director or principal shareholder. In addition, the federal banking agencies adopted regulations that authorize, but do not require, an agency to order an institution that has been given notice by an agency that it is not satisfying any of such safety and soundness standards to submit a compliance plan. If, after being so notified, an institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an acceptable compliance plan, the agency must issue an order directing action to correct the deficiency and may issue an order restricting asset growth, requiring an institution to increase its ratio of tangible equity to assets or directing other actions of the types to which an undercapitalized institution is subject under the “prompt corrective action” provisions of the FDIA. See “—Prompt Corrective Action” above. If an institution fails to comply with such an order, the agency may seek to enforce such order in judicial proceedings and to impose civil money penalties.

Dividend and Share Repurchase Restrictions
The Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries. The revenue of the Company (on a parent-only basis) is derived primarily from interest and dividends paid to it by the Bank. The right of the Company, and consequently the right of shareholders of the Company, to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of the Bank through the payment of such dividends or otherwise is necessarily subject to the prior claims of creditors of the Bank (including depositors), except to the extent that certain claims of the Company in a creditor capacity may be recognized. The Company and the Bank are subject to various federal and state restrictions on their ability to pay dividends as described below.
Restrictions on Bank Holding Company Dividends. The FRB has the authority to prohibit bank holding companies from paying dividends if such payment is deemed to be an unsafe or unsound practice. The FRB has indicated generally that it may be an unsafe or unsound practice for bank holding companies to pay dividends unless the bank holding company’s net income over the preceding year is sufficient to fund the dividends and the expected rate of earnings retention is consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Further, the Company’s ability to pay dividends is restricted if it does not maintain the capital conservation buffer. See “—Capital Adequacy and Safety and Soundness—Regulatory Capital Requirements” above.
Under Maine law, a corporation’s Board of Directors may declare, and the corporation may pay, dividends on its outstanding shares, in cash or other property, generally only out of the corporation’s unreserved and unrestricted earned surplus, or out of the unreserved and unrestricted net earnings of the current fiscal year and the next preceding fiscal year taken as a single period, except under certain circumstances, including when the corporation is insolvent, or when the payment of the dividend would render the corporation insolvent or when the declaration would be contrary to the corporation’s charter.
Restrictions on Bank Dividends. Under OCC regulations, national banks generally may not declare a dividend in excess of the bank’s undivided profits and, absent OCC approval, if the total amount of dividends declared by the national bank in any calendar year exceeds the total of the national bank’s retained net income year-to-date combined with its retained net income for the preceding two years. National banks also are prohibited from declaring or paying any dividend if, after making the dividend, the national bank would be considered “undercapitalized” (as defined by reference to other OCC regulations). The OCC has the authority to use its enforcement powers to prohibit a national bank, such as the Bank, from paying dividends if, in its opinion, the payment of dividends would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. Further, the Bank’s ability to pay dividends is restricted if it does not maintain the capital conservation buffer. See “—Capital Adequacy and Safety and Soundness—Regulatory Capital Requirements” above.
Restrictions on Share Repurchases. Under the Capital Rules, any repurchase or redemption of a regulatory capital instrument is subject to approval by the FRB, in the case of the Company, or the OCC, in the case of the Bank. Accordingly, the Company may not repurchase its common stock without the prior approval of the FRB.
Certain Transactions by Banks with their Affiliates
Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and the FRB’s Regulation W restrict transactions between a bank and its affiliates, including its parent bank holding company. The Bank is subject to these restrictions, which include quantitative and qualitative limits on the amounts and types of transactions that may occur, including extensions of credit to affiliates, investments in the stock or securities of affiliates, purchases of assets from affiliates and other “covered transactions.” Generally, a bank’s (including its subsidiaries) covered transactions with any affiliate are subject to the following limits: (i)  the aggregate amount of covered transactions with any one affiliate cannot exceed 10% of the bank’s capital stock and surplus; and (ii)  the aggregate amount of covered transactions with all affiliates cannot exceed 20% of the bank’s capital stock and surplus. For this purpose, “covered transactions” are defined by statute to include a loan or extension of credit to an affiliate, a purchase of or investment in securities issued by an affiliate, a purchase of assets from an affiliate unless exempted by the FRB, the acceptance of securities issued by an affiliate as collateral for a loan or extension of credit to any person or company, the issuance of a guarantee, acceptance or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate, securities borrowing or lending transactions with an affiliate that creates a credit exposure to such affiliate, or a derivatives transaction with an affiliate that creates a credit exposure to such affiliate. Covered transactions are also subject to certain collateral security requirements. Covered transactions as well as other types of transactions between a bank and its affiliates must be on market terms and not otherwise unduly favorable to an affiliate, including a parent holding company. 
Anti-Tying Restrictions
Generally, a bank is prohibited from extending credit, leasing or selling property, furnishing any service or fixing or varying the consideration for any of the foregoing on the condition that (i) the customer obtains additional credit, property or 
10

services from the bank’s parent holding company or any subsidiary of the holding company, or (ii) the customer will not obtain credit, property or services from a competitor of the bank or its affiliates (except to the extent the restriction is a reasonable condition imposed to assure the soundness of the credit extended).
Consumer Protection Regulation
The Company and the Bank are subject to federal and state laws designed to protect consumers and prohibit unfair or deceptive business practices, including the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Home Ownership Protection Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, as amended by the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 (“FACT Act”), the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (“GLBA”), the Truth in Lending Act, the CRA, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the National Flood Insurance Act and various state law counterparts. These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must interact with customers when taking deposits, making loans, collecting loans and providing other services. Further, the Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB, which has the responsibility for making rules and regulations under the federal consumer protection laws relating to financial products and services. The CFPB also has a broad mandate to prohibit unfair, deceptive or abusive acts and practices and is specifically empowered to require certain disclosures to consumers and draft model disclosure forms. Failure to comply with consumer protection laws and regulations can subject financial institutions to enforcement actions, fines and other penalties. The OCC examines the Bank for compliance with CFPB rules and enforces CFPB rules with respect to the Bank.
Mortgage Reform. The Dodd-Frank Act prescribes certain standards that mortgage lenders must consider before making a residential mortgage loan, including verifying a borrower’s ability to repay such mortgage loan, and allows borrowers to assert violations of certain provisions of the Truth in Lending Act as a defense to foreclosure proceedings. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, prepayment penalties are prohibited for certain mortgage transactions and creditors are prohibited from financing insurance policies in connection with a residential mortgage loan or home equity line of credit. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act prohibits mortgage originators from receiving compensation based on the terms of residential mortgage loans and generally limits the ability of a mortgage originator to be compensated by others if compensation is received from a consumer. The Dodd-Frank Act requires mortgage lenders to make additional disclosures prior to the extension of credit, in each billing statement and for negative amortization loans and hybrid adjustable rate mortgages.
Privacy and Customer Information Security. The GLBA requires financial institutions to implement policies and procedures regarding the disclosure of nonpublic personal information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties. In general, the Bank must provide its customers with an initial and annual disclosure that explains its policies and procedures regarding the disclosure of such nonpublic personal information, and, except as otherwise required or permitted by law, the Bank is prohibited from disclosing such information except as provided in such policies and procedures. However, an annual disclosure is not required to be provided by a financial institution if the financial institution only discloses information under exceptions from GLBA that do not require an opt out to be provided and if there has been no change in its privacy policies and practices since its most recent disclosure provided to consumers. The GLBA also requires that the Bank develop, implement and maintain a comprehensive written information security program designed to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer information (as defined under GLBA), to protect against anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such information; and to protect against unauthorized access to or use of such information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer. The Bank is also required to send a notice to customers whose sensitive information has been compromised if unauthorized use of this information is reasonably possible. Most states, including the states where the Bank operates, have enacted legislation concerning breaches of data security and Congress is considering federal legislation that would require consumer notice of data security breaches. Pursuant to the FACT Act, the Bank must develop and implement a written identity theft prevention program to detect, prevent, and mitigate identity theft in connection with the opening of certain accounts or certain existing accounts. Additionally, the FACT Act amends the Fair Credit Reporting Act to generally prohibit a person from using information received from an affiliate to make a solicitation for marketing purposes to a consumer, unless the consumer is given notice and a reasonable opportunity and a reasonable and simple method to opt out of the making of such solicitations.
Anti-Money Laundering
The Bank Secrecy Act. Under the Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”), a financial institution, is required to have systems in place to detect certain transactions, based on the size and nature of the transaction. Financial institutions are generally required to report to the United States Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) any cash transactions involving more than $10,000. In addition, financial institutions are required to file suspicious activity reports for any transaction or series of transactions that involve more than $5,000 and which the financial institution knows, suspects or has reason to suspect involves illegal funds, is designed to evade the requirements of the BSA or has no lawful purpose. The 
11

Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (“USA PATRIOT Act”), which amended the BSA, together with the implementing regulations of various federal regulatory agencies, has caused financial institutions, such as the Bank, to adopt and implement additional policies or amend existing policies and procedures with respect to, among other things, anti-money laundering compliance, suspicious activity, currency transaction reporting, customer identity verification and customer risk analysis. In evaluating an application under Section 3 of the BHCA to acquire a bank or an application under the Bank Merger Act to merge banks or affect a purchase of assets and assumption of deposits and other liabilities, the applicable federal banking regulator must consider the anti-money laundering compliance record of both the applicant and the target. In addition, under the USA PATRIOT Act, financial institutions are required to take steps to monitor their correspondent banking and private banking relationships as well as, if applicable, their relationships with “shell banks.”
OFAC. The U.S. has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals and others. These sanctions, which are administered by the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), take many different forms. Generally, however, they contain one or more of the following elements: (i) restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country, including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on “U.S. persons” engaging in financial or other transactions relating to a sanctioned country or with certain designated persons and entities; (ii) a blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest, by prohibiting transfers of property subject to U.S. jurisdiction (including property in the possession or control of U.S. persons); and (iii) restrictions on transactions with or involving certain persons or entities. Blocked assets (for example, property and bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the Company.
Regulation of Other Activities
Volcker Rule Restrictions on Proprietary Trading and Sponsorship of Hedge Funds and Private Equity Funds. Since its enactment, the Dodd-Frank Act has barred banking organizations, such as the Company and the Bank, from engaging in proprietary trading and from sponsoring and investing in hedge funds and private equity funds, except as permitted under certain circumstances, in a provision commonly referred to as the “Volcker Rule.” 
The EGRRCPA amended the Volcker Rule to exclude certain banking organizations that do not have, and are not controlled by a company that has, more than $10 billion in total consolidated assets, and trading assets and liabilities that comprise more than 5% of total assets. This exclusion became effective immediately following enactment of the EGRRCPA. In July 2018, the FRB, FDIC and OCC issued an interagency statement in which the regulators stated they would not enforce the Volcker Rule in a manner inconsistent with the EGRRCPA and that the agencies intended to address the statutory changes to the Volcker Rule through a separate rulemaking process. On December 21, 2018, the OCC, FRB, FDIC, SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission jointly issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to implement the EGRRCPA’s exclusion with respect to small banking organizations. We are evaluating the proposed rule, and any potential impact on the Company or the Bank will depend on the final form of the agencies’ regulations and cannot be predicted at this time.
