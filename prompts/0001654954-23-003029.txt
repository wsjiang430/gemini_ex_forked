Item 1. BUSINESS
Overview

TOMI Environmental Solutions, Inc. (“TOMI”, “we” and “our”) is a global bacteria decontamination and infectious disease control company, providing environmental solutions for indoor air and surface decontamination through the manufacturing, sales, service and licensing of our SteraMist® brand of products, including SteraMist® BIT™, a low percentage (7.8%) hydrogen peroxide-based fog or mist that uses Binary Ionization Technology (“BIT™”). Our solution and process are environmentally friendly as the only by-product from our decontamination process is oxygen and humidity. Our solution is organic and is listed in Canada as a sustainably a green product with no carbon footprint. Most of our competitors in the disinfection space leave significant by-products and are corrosive. SteraMist is not corrosive, and it does not damage equipment or facilities.

Our SteraMist® is a patented technology that produces ionized Hydrogen Peroxide (“iHP™”) using cold plasma science created under a grant by the United States Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (“DARPA”). Our Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) registered BIT™ Solution is composed of a low concentration of hydrogen peroxide converted to iHP™ after passing the trade secret blended solution including its sole active ingredient of 7.8% hydrogen peroxide through an atmospheric cold plasma arc. The newly formed iHP™ fog and mist consists of submicron’s to 3-micron radical particles that are carried throughout the treatment area in a fog or mist moving with the same velocity and characteristics of a gas. This allows the ionized hydrogen peroxide fog or mist to affect all surfaces and air space throughout the targeted treatment area, over, above and beyond the ability of a manual cleaning processes. iHP™ damages pathogenic organisms through the oxidation of proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids. SteraMist® no-touch disinfection and or decontamination treat areas mechanically, causing cellular disruptions and/or dysfunctions resulting in a 6-log (99.9999%) and greater kill or inactivation of all pathogens in the treatment area. This is a science that the world needs to follow. This simple and effective process-takes 7.8 % hydrogen peroxide and under pressure pushes the liquid through a nozzle in which the stream is met by an atmospheric cold plasma arc which converts the hydrogen peroxide into a plasma created hydroxyl radical with 6-log and greater kill. This is a duplication of what occurs in atmospheric chemistry and the only by-product is oxygen and humidity. The world needs to thank, Titan Defense, DARPA and of course nature for the science behind our technology!

Under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (“FIFRA”), we are required to register with the EPA and certain state regulatory authorities as a seller of disinfectants. In June 2015, SteraMist® BIT™ was registered with the EPA as a hospital-healthcare disinfectant and general broad-spectrum surface disinfectant for use as a misting/fogging agent. SteraMist® BIT™ now holds EPA registrations (# 90150-2) for mold control, and air and surface remediation (# 90150-1). In February 2016, we expanded our label with the EPA to include Clostridium difficile Spores and MRSA, as well as the influenza (Avian) virus h1n1, which we believe has better positioned us to penetrate all industries including the biodefense and healthcare industry. In August 2017, our EPA label was further expanded to include efficacy against Salmonella and Norovirus. As of January 27, 2017, our technology is one of 53 of the EPA’s “Registered Antimicrobial Products Effective against Clostridium difficile Spores”, as published on the EPA’s K List. Further, in December 2017, SteraMist® was included in the EPA’s list G (Norovirus), L (Ebola) and M (Avian Flu). In March 2020, our EPA label was further amended to include Emerging Viral Pathogens claims, thus meeting the criteria against Enveloped viruses and Large Non-enveloped viruses and included on List N (Emerging Viral Pathogens including SARS-CoV-2). In 2021, the EPA granted SteraMist® BIT™ 0.35% hydrogen peroxide – EPA registration number 90150-3.  On June 2, 2022, SteraMist was included on the EPA’s List Q for the use of its BIT solution to help fight the spread of rare or novel viruses such as Monkeypox virus, SARS-CoV-2 and its variants that causes COVID-19.

SteraMist® BIT™ brings to the world a mechanical and automated method of cleaning using a game-changing technology and EPA registered Hospital-HealthCare disinfectant providing an upgrade to existing disinfecting and cleaning protocols while limiting liability in a facility when it comes to resistant infectious pathogens.  We maintain this registration in all fifty (50) states, Washington DC, Canada, and approximately forty (40) other countries receive our product.

Our Technology

BIT™ was initially developed in response to Amerithrax, the weaponized anthrax spore attacks that occurred in Washington, D.C. shortly after the September 11, 2001 U.S. terrorist attacks. BIT™ is a patented process that aerosolizes and activates a low concentration hydrogen peroxide solution, producing a fine aqueous mist (0.3-3 um in diameter) that contains a high concentration of Reactive Oxidative Species (“ROS”), mostly hydroxyl radicals (“OH”). ROS cause damage to pathogenic and resistant organisms, such as bacteria, bacteria spores, viruses, mold spores, other fungi and yeast, via oxidation of proteins carbohydrates, lipids and rendering the building blocks of nature’s amino acids, DNA and RNA inactive - leading to cellular death, disruption and/or dysfunction.

Testing detailed by DARPA demonstrated these hydroxyl radicals aggressively break the double bonds and other bonds in bacteria, bacterial spores, fungi, fungus spores, viruses and certain biological and chemical warfare agents and neutralize their threat while producing nontoxic by-products. The unique alteration of the chemistry of our solution occurs after our EPA-registered solution passes through an atmospheric cold plasma arc, which causes the breaking of the double bond of a hydrogen peroxide molecule, the net result - our .OH hydroxyl radical. This hydroxyl radical is known as iHP™. This patented process allows these hydroxyl radicals to exist in high concentrations without rapidly recombining and losing their reactivity, while seeking to attach with any and all surfaces within the proximity of TOMI’s mist.

The sole active ingredient of BIT™ is a low percentage (7.8%) Hydrogen Peroxide and is represented by the TOMI™ SteraMist® brand of products. Our technology produces a germ-killing aerosol that moves throughout a space like a gas. Our technology is able to efficiently and effectively kill pathogenic and resistant organisms in the air and on the surfaces without damaging delicate equipment or computers, and the only by-product is oxygen and water in the form of humidity.

Each and every SteraMist® product utilizes the innovative and easy-to-use power of Binary Ionization Technology which is designed to be easily incorporated into any industry’s current cleaning procedures. No wipe, no rinse, no residue, non-corrosive, high level efficacy, quick turnaround time, superior material compatibility (spray direct on sensitive equipment), and a submicron particle allows the mist/fog to reach every area being treated regardless of what is in the space.

                SteraMist® is being used throughout the world and has been demonstrated to reduce certain resistant problem organisms, such as bacterial spores, Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (“VRE”), Clostridium difficile, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (“MERS”), Ebola (“Ebola”) and SARS CoV-2 the virus that causes COVID. In U.S. hospitals where SteraMist® is being used for terminal cleaning, evidence has demonstrated a reduction of Clostridium difficile spore rates. SteraMist® has reduced outbreaks of nosocomial MDRO’s (Klebsiella pneumoniae, AB, pseudomonas aeruginosa) at large hospital to small clinics and has contributed to the control of MERS, Ebola and COVID throughout the world.

Although our technology was developed to combat the hardest to kill pathogens and neutralize the most difficult chemical agents, our products and services have been used by our customers who are fighting at the front lines of combating the COVID-19 pandemic, especially from early 2020 to 2021. As the COVID-19 pandemic gradually subsided, our customers continue to use our products in new general cleaning protocols due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Our technology passed a sanctioned test showing six-log reduction against Geobacillus stearothermophilus. Geobacillus stearothermophilus is the laboratory testing gold standard and is commonly used as a challenge organism for sterilization validation studies and periodic check of sterilization cycles. BIT™ has also been shown to effectively decontaminate weaponized biological agents, including weaponized anthrax, chemical agents such as VX (an extremely toxic organophosphate) and sulfur mustard (otherwise known as mustard gas) when applied using properly developed international protocols.

SteraMist® products are fully validated or are in the final process of completion to comply with good manufacturing practice standards, have received Conformité Européene (“CE”) marks in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and are approved by Underwriters Laboratory (“UL”). Our solution is manufactured at an EPA-registered solution blender and our product performance is supported by good laboratory practice efficacy data for Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella, Norovirus, SARS CoV-2, mold spores, MRSA, h1n1, Geobacillus stearothermophilus and Clostridium difficile spores.

Industries & Market Segments

Our SteraMist® products are designed to address a wide spectrum of industries using iHP™. Our operations consist of five main divisions based on our current target industries: Hospital-HealthCare, Life Sciences, TOMI Service Network (“TSN”), Food Safety, and Commercial.

We continue to offer our customers a wide range of innovative mobile products designed to be easily incorporated into their existing disinfection and decontamination procedures and protocols. Our newly released SteraPak, among other product lines will allow us to progress further into market share, specifically for our Life Science, Hospital-HealthCare, TSN, and Commercial divisions. Additionally, we offer integrated facility equipment installations known as Custom Engineered Systems (“CES”), routine & emergency iHP Corporate Service, essential training packages, validations and qualifications, and onsite performance maintenance requests.

Each of these are structured to address the unique disinfection and decontamination needs of our customers worldwide regardless of industry requiring or requesting SteraMist® disinfection decontamination.

A brief overview of the target industries is presented below:

Life Sciences

The SteraMist® Environment System, CES, the SteraMist® Select Surface Unit (Plus), SteraBox, 90 Degree Applicator and our iHP™ Corporate Service Division, are designed to be tailored to provide a complete solution to address the regulatory inspections of disinfecting/decontaminating and Installation Qualification (IQ)-Operational Qualification (OQ)–Performance Qualification (PQ) validation processes within the life sciences industry.

Long term, ongoing projects and validations continue to be a focus and lead to proposals and interest for our CES permanent decontamination room. As these are longer lead-time sales and manufactured upon order that can take months to design, procure, assemble, and implement, we expect installations to have material impact to our results in 2023 and 2024.

TOMI’s iHP service department continues to grow with new and existing customers in several divisions. In the life science sector, TOMI’s iHP service department has kept its relationships with large pharmaceuticals (Pfizer/ThermoFisher) as well as adding several smaller life science companies (ForDoz/Lonza) to a regular decontamination schedule. In addition to these productions’ facilities, TOMI has treated four BSL-3 research laboratories in all parts of the country within the last two months (UNM/UNC/Bioqual/Scripps). The food safety department steadily gains traction as several plant/produce companies have expressed interest as new and emerging bacteria, toxins, and fungi hamper production. Finally, the commercial division is a stable source of revenue for TOMI and its service network as many public facilities are feeling the effects of Hurricane Ian.

For 2023 and beyond, TOMI expects growth in SteraMist CES bids and the manufacturing and implementation of these fully automated decontamination systems. The installed CES will also result in increased solution sales for Life Sciences as the CES’s are used at regular intervals. The first CES system was completed in 2016 for Dana Farber Cancer Institute, as Dana Farber was designing a new vivarium and had the opportunity to integrate several new technologies to advance overall efficiency, quality, and design. One such technology was the use of our iHP decontamination. TOMI’s CES is an automated system that can be fully integrated into any company’s infrastructure, enabling decontamination, without burdening manual use and with the collaboration of current premier customers and partners, TOMI has further perfected the system. The CES eliminates issues such as human error, guarantees accuracy that is unmatched by competitors, and decreases a client’s labor cost and downtime, and in a short time the CES may make up a majority of TOMI’s revenue. Since its launch, SteraMist’s CES has become a leading solution to growing customer demands.

Hospital-Healthcare

The SteraMist® line of products, specifically the SteraMist® Surface Unit and SteraMist® Total Disinfection Cart, are our main solutions to aid our Hospital-HealthCare customers in providing high quality of safety to their patients and personnel by disinfecting operating rooms, pharmacies, ambulances, and emergency environments throughout a healthcare facility. TOMI’s latest product, the SteraPak®, further assists healthcare communities with an easy-to-use, cordless disinfection solution, creating a more mobile solution. Our customers that have successfully adopted our technology in Hospital-Healthcare facilities, have recurring revenue and reorder rates of our BIT™ Solution. We plan to continue to expand our marketing, advertising and educational campaigns targeted at the Hospital-Healthcare marketing to grow our customer base and increase adoption of our SteraMist® line of products.

Our team of technicians and representatives train, maintain, and service capital equipment throughout the world for our Hospital-HealthCare customers. As our Training and Implementation department expands, we expect continued growth and purchases in our Hospital-HealthCare division. TOMI provides protocol development and implementation of SteraMist® as it is critical in the healthcare setting, including pandemic preparedness.

TOMI anticipates expansion of current HealthCare customers to follow the model of Gila River Health Care. Gila River is one of TOMI’s largest Healthcare customers owning a total of fourteen (14) Surface Units and eight (8) SteraPak’s. The Gila River Indian Community (GRIC) is an Indian reservation in Arizona that is made up of seven (7) districts and is home to the Akimel O’oodham (Pima) and the Pee-Posh (Maricopa) tribes. Gila River Health Care, a premier Native American healthcare system, provides high quality patient care, delivering a wide variety of medical services such as general surgery, dental, and emergency medicine, as well as associated health services such as pharmacy and laboratory operations, skilled nursing, rehabilitation, and medical transport.

Food Safety

New challenges to food safety will continue to emerge, largely because of changes in our food production, food supply, storage complexities, transportation delays, including more imported foods. Changes in the environment leads to food contamination, new and emergent bacteria, toxins, and antimicrobial resistance. Food Safety presents an opportunity for significant growth for TOMI with continued product research and compliance testing.

The food safety industry in North America is under closer scrutiny with the implementation and enforcement of new and established guidelines. SteraMist® aerosolizing cold plasma technology is an effective decontaminant in the food safety industry. SteraMist can assist in compliance with the newly established Food Safety Modernization Act guidelines set in place by the FDA, as well as the Safe Food for Canadians Act and Safe Food for Canadians Regulations in Canada. Today’s Geopolitical aspects of farming and ranching has created an extra layer of concern for the protection of our global limited food supply including food transportation.

TOMI continues to work with premium companies in testing and validating SteraMist® technology in the Food Safety and seed industries. In 2022, we made progress in enhancing brand awareness in the food safety industry by promoting and marketing this division. We are receiving an increase in inquiries within the Food Safety division directly from these efforts.

Every day there are news articles around the world pertaining to the contamination of food supply. Unsafe food containing harmful bacteria, viruses, parasites, or chemical substances causes more than 200 diseases, ranging from diarrhea to cancers. It also creates a vicious cycle of disease and malnutrition, particularly affecting infants, young children, elderly and the sick. With the global population explosion, severe worldwide avian flu pandemics resulting in the unnecessary culling of bird flocks, unusually high accidents resulting in the destruction of over 30 storages, packing and processing food plants, in the U.S. alone, we anticipate an increase in the demand for a mechanical way to disinfect our food supply. TOMI has, in cooperation with the USDA, demonstrated that our technology offers a consistent, quick, and effective alternative to the traditional, decade’s old chemical disinfection process.

SteraMist will deliver more consistent and quicker results in all areas of our food supply–From Farm to Market, Processing to Packaging, and Storage to Delivery. We are currently pursuing all these avenues. Continued testing and market demand coupled with our new BIT™ 0.35% hydrogen peroxide label will make pursuing these opportunities successful. In addition, our solution and process are environmentally friendly in that the by-product of SteraMist is only oxygen and water in the form of humidity. We have our solution listed on OMRI and labeled as organic. Most disinfectants leave residue on equipment, furniture, objects, and foods. SteraMist does not leave any chemical residue on any surface. We have a very low carbon footprint, if any, just oxygen and humidity. SteraMist is the perfect product for the global current issues in food safety. We are told we consume too much food, we produced too little food, and our farming screws up the environment, SteraMist is ready to assist in the defense of our food industry for whatever their needs are.

TOMI Service Network

The TOMI Service Network, or TSN, is an expansive network consisting of professionals throughout North America who are exclusively licensed and trained to use the SteraMist® products. With the purchase of SteraMist and joining TSN, TOMI trains and services a wide array of professional remediation companies in the use of SteraMist® throughout the TSN division. TSN allows for increased accessibility and brand awareness of iHP® services to facilities in need of local routine and emergency disinfection and decontamination.

The TOMI Service Network (“TSN”) division is addressing the cleaning protocols that have changed permanently due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and our network is expected to play a significant role in facilitating and maintaining these protocols throughout the United States and Canada. The urgency for emergency disinfection services is starting to pick up due to employees returning to work and the increasing number of contagious variants becoming more of a world concern. Our education and support of such services that TOMI personnel provide to our members creates an advantage by maintaining strong business relationships while they service thousands of SteraMist® customers, and the world returns to the new normal which will always focus on emerging pathogens.

Our SteraPak® release is an important factor for this market that we will increase the new member onboarding. Current members are showing interest in purchasing the SteraPak® to expand their current SteraMist® offerings.

Commercial

Our Commercial division includes but is not limited to use sites such as aviation, airports, police and fire, prisons, manufacturing companies, automobile, military, cruise ships, shipping ports, preschool education, primary and secondary schools, colleges including dormitories, all modes of public and private transportation, regulatory consulting agencies, retail, housing and recreation, and of course emergency preparedness for counties and cities to use SteraMist® throughout their community.

The Surface unit and SteraPak® is a popular product for this division because customers are looking for a more cost-effective solution compared to the current disinfectants on the market. As quick and mobile disinfection solution is preferred in this industry, we believe that our surface unit along with the SteraPak® will generate customer interest and create sales opportunities. Currently our customers are purchasing our products in all of our divisions to provide quick disinfection throughout various sites in their facilities.

Intellectual Property

Our success depends in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our products and technologies. We protect our technology and products by, among other means, obtaining United States and foreign patents. There can be no assurance, however, that any patent will provide adequate protection for the technology, system, product, service or process it covers. In addition, the process of obtaining and protecting patents can be long and expensive. We also rely upon trade secrets, technical know-how, and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position.

As part of our intellectual property protection strategy, we have registered our BIT™ solution with the EPA, all fifty (50) states in the United States, and multiple countries worldwide. We have received or are in the process of receiving Conformité Européene (“CE”) marks in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and are approved by Underwriters Laboratory (“UL”).

Our portfolio includes more than twenty (20) Utility Patent applications worldwide which expire at various dates through the year 2042 for both method and system claims on SteraMist® BIT™, either published or undergoing prosecution. We continue to pursue further claims to additional capabilities in on-going United States and worldwide patent applications. We have obtained two related United States utility patents giving us protection of our technology until the year 2038. We have obtained utility patents for our technologies in diverse countries such as Brazil, Japan, Korea, Israel, Australia, Taiwan, Canada, Mexico, and, currently pending, in Europe and Singapore, and continue to pursue protections all over the world.

We have submitted utility patent applications in multiple countries, including Europe, China, Brazil, Korea and Australia for further additional applications of SteraMist BIT, and a related application has already been determined novel and inventive in Taiwan, Japan, and Singapore. We have been awarded a design patent on our surface-mounted applicator device in the United States, China, Japan, Taiwan, and Korea. We have filed and have been granted or have pending acceptance on thirty-two (32) separate design patents for our: Decontamination Chamber(s), Decontamination Applicator, Decontamination Cart, Applicator, and Surface Mounted Applicator 90-Degree Device. These patents are published around the world, including but not limited to United States, China, Hong Kong, Europe, United Kingdom, Singapore, Taiwan, Vietnam, Canada, South Korea, and Japan. We are also pursuing IP protection for further applications of our SteraMist BIT in diverse fields in multiple jurisdictions, such as food decontamination and, as the initial DARPA grant proved the application of iHP for the protection of buildings post outbreak or after a biological attack. With worldwide attention on the etiology of SARs CoV2 coming from a lab leak, attention on the prevention and control of a leak or mishap should be on the mind of all the biological labs managers around the world. The fact that iHP and our BIT platform can be incorporated in a new or existing buildings to create an “immune building” should assist in further lab applications of SteraMist in the biosecurity industry in the future

Our products are sold around the world under various brand names and trademarks. We consider our brand names and trademarks to be valuable in the marketing of our products. As of today, we have over two hundred trademarks, (word and/or logo) registered or pending across the globe. TOMI registers marks in eight (8) classes of specification of goods and services: Class 1 for Chemicals for Treating Hazardous Waste, Class 5 for Disinfectants, All-Purpose for Hard Surfaces and for Treating Mold, Class 7 for Handheld Power Operated Spraying Machines, Class 11 for Sterilizers for Medical Use and Air Purification, Class 35 for Business Consultation and Management Services, Class 37 for General Disinfecting Services, Class 40 for Chemical Decontamination and Manufacturing Services, and Class 41 for Providing Education Training and information related to biological and bacterial decontamination services.

We sell our products domestically through our internal sales force, as well as independent sales and manufacturing representatives. Internationally, our products are sold through exclusive and non-exclusive sales representatives and distributors. At the end of September 2021, we on boarded yet another new international partner. Critical Scientific Solutions are specialists in Australia and New Zealand who offer products and solutions to the pharma, biotech, medical device and research sectors. The company was established in 2016 by an executive team who has 30 plus years’ experience for clean room products. The TOMI sales team is already working with Critical Scientific who within months has a large opportunity with the Australian Government agency responsible for scientific research.

Competition

The decontamination and environmental infectious disease control industry is intensely competitive and highly regulated. Competition is intense in all five (5) of our divisions and includes many large and small competitors.

Our competitors include companies that market other hydrogen peroxide-based products, such as Steris Corporation (“Steris”), Bioquell, Inc. (“Bioquell”) currently owned by Ecolab, Inc. (“Ecolab”) and The Clorox Company (“Clorox”), various ultraviolet companies and quad ammonia-chemical companies. During 2021 due to the COVID outbreak, new competitors that manufacture and sell electrostatic sprayers and biostatic protectants, specifically to the commercial industry, entered the market.

We believe our SteraMist® suite of products have a competitive advantage to our competitor’s products in that they are quicker and less caustic, provides a six log kill to a wide variety of pathogens and leave no residue or unpleasant odor. However, some of these competitors may have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger installed customer bases and substantially greater financial and marketing resources than us.

We believe that the principal factors affecting competition in our markets include name recognition and the ability to receive referrals based on client confidence in the service, and our abilities to discover, develop, market, and innovate, disruptive cost-effective products and services. There are no significant barriers of entry that could keep potential competitors from opening similar facilities. Our ability to compete successfully in the industry will depend, in large part, upon our ability to market and sell our indoor decontamination and infectious disease control products and services. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in this industry, or that future competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.

Competitive Advantages

We believe the SteraMist® technology has many advantages over its competition. Our technology can turn over a space to an end-user far faster than its competition. Our technology requires limited preparation to an area compared to our competitors and does not rely on fans or any outside force to move throughout a space. Our “iHP OH” is the smallest submicron 0.3-3-micron particle that receives a charge and can move around an area like a gas, going above, below, and beyond the hardest to reach areas.

Another key and critical advantage is the technology’s superior material compatibility. iHP kills on contact and leaves no dangerous byproducts in the areas being treated. It is important the world is educated and aware of the harsh chemicals that exist on the market, and used with electrostatic sprayers, as they will not ensure proper efficacy on the surface being treated as even if the chemical is EPA registered, it may not be compatible with the sprayer. For example, the sprayer may not be spraying enough of the chemical to kill the virus or the bacteria, in addition to a lot of these harsh chemicals and sprayers are destroying materials and equipment over time, creating a more costly product in the long run. Our low percentage of hydrogen peroxide serves as a competitive advantage with respect to transporting our product by air. Our major hydrogen peroxide competitors have to transport their chemicals by rail, road or sea as the Department of Transportation (DOT) will not allow a product that contains greater than 8% hydrogen peroxide to be transported by air.

Our patented SteraMist technology can treat almost 4,000 cubic feet in 45 minutes with a contact time of only 15 minutes or spray surfaces 5 seconds per square foot with no wet contact time. Our technology has multiple competitive advantages required for disinfection SteraMist is no wipe, no rinse, no residue, non-corrosive, high level efficacy (developed by DARPA for Anthrax spores), quick turnaround time, superior material compatibility (spray direct on sensitive equipment), and our submicron-small micron particles which moves like a gas allows the mist/fog to reach every area being treated regardless of what is in the space.

In summary, SteraMist® offers the following competitive advantages:


· | Provides a 99.9999% or six-log kill and above kill (i.e., the statistical destruction of all microorganisms and their spores) on all challenged pathogens, on multiple surfaces including Bacillus atrophaeus spores, Bacillus subtilis spores and Geobacillus stearothermophilus, the spore that is considered a gold standard for validation of sterilization versus household/industrial cleaners that offer a 99.9% (sanitizing) or three-log kill to 99.99% (disinfection) or four-log kill.
