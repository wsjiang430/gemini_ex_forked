Item 1. Business
Company Overview
 
We offer a state-of-the-art digital publishing platform. We use this platform to power our consumer-facing mobile personalization app, called Zedge, available in the Google Play store and iTunes, which offers an easy, entertaining and immersive way for end-users to engage with our rich and diverse catalogue of wallpapers, video wallpapers, stickers, ringtones, notification sounds on Android and wallpapers, video wallpapers and ringtones, on iOS. We are evolving by developing new, entertainment-focused apps, that will run on our publishing platform. We secure our content from artists, both amateurs and professionals as well as emerging and major brands. Artists have the ability to easily launch a virtual storefront in our Zedge app where they can market and sell their content to our user base.
 
Our Zedge app has been installed more than 396 million times, and at September 30, 2019, boasted more than 33 million monthly active users, or MAU. Our Zedge app has consistently averaged in the ‘Top 60’ most popular free apps in the Google Play store in the United States. MAU is a key performance indicator that captures the number of unique users that used our Zedge app during the previous 30-day period. Historically, we have not made a material investment in paid user acquisition for our Zedge app.
 
Our Zedge app’s success stems from its ability to meet consumer demand for a rich and diverse catalogue of both long-tail and popular content in a fun, intuitive and user-friendly fashion that aligns with their interest in expressing their essence in a bespoke manner, to offer reliable search and discovery capabilities and to make relevant content recommendations to our users. To this end, we invest heavily in both product design and development and the underlying technology required to satisfy both our Zedge app’s users’ and content contributors’ expectations. Our Zedge app utilizes both user-generated and licensed, third-party content to achieve these goals.
 
In March 2018, we launched Zedge Premium, a marketplace within our Zedge app where professional creators and brands market, distribute and sell their digital content to our consumers. Since launching Zedge Premium, we have made and continue making material investments in optimizing our app’s homepage design in order to maximize exposure to premium content with the goal of driving sales. Over time, we expect that Zedge Premium will contribute to a virtuous cycle whereby it drives new consumers into our Zedge app resulting in more artist payouts, which in turn makes the platform more attractive for artists and brands looking to expand their reach and increase their income. In September 2017, we closed a transaction with Freeform Development, Inc., or Freeform, and retained their development personnel in order to accelerate the launch and development of Zedge Premium.
 
In January 2019, we started offering freemium Zedge app users the ability to convert into paying subscribers for amongst other things the ability to remove unsolicited advertisements from our Zedge app. As of July 31, 2019, we amassed 128.940 active subscribers. In fiscal 2020, we hope to further optimize the offer based on user type, geography and price point as well as introduce new subscription enhancements like content bundles and rewards.
 
As of July 31, 2019, approximately 54% of our Zedge app’s user base was located in North America and Europe, evenly split between the regions. Over the past several years, we have experienced a shift in our regional customer make-up with MAU increasing in emerging markets and decreasing in well-developed markets. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, users in emerging markets grew by 8.2% while users in well-developed economies declined 18.3% when compared to the same period in fiscal 2018. This shift has negatively impacted revenue generation because well-developed markets command materially higher advertising rates when compared to emerging markets. MAU growth is tightly coupled with securing new users. Historically, our high ranking in the Google Play store has been one of the primary drivers for securing new users. Although still an important factor, we have started dedicating resources to growth initiatives, both organic and paid. With time, we believe that we can change our growth dynamic in well-developed markets. Aside from targeted growth initiatives, we need to continually improve the core user experience, test different mechanisms and content verticals that may spur growth and capitalize on the role that Zedge Premium artists can have on driving new users into the platform.
 
Historically, we have generated approximately 90% of our revenues from selling our Zedge app’s advertising inventory to advertising networks, advertising exchanges, and direct arrangements with advertisers. Advertising networks and advertising exchanges are third-party technology platforms that facilitate the buying and selling of media advertising inventory from multiple ad networks. The price of advertising inventory is fixed on an advertising network whereas the price for inventory is determined through real-time bidding on an advertising exchange. Advertisers are attracted to our Zedge app because of its sizable user base.

The remainder of our revenues were primarily generated from managing and optimizing the advertising inventory of a third-party mobile application publisher, as well as overseeing the billing, collections and reporting related to advertising for this publisher. The agreement with this mobile application publisher was terminated effective May 31, 2019, and we are no longer providing these services.
 
Zedge Premium is our marketplace in the Zedge app where artists and brands can market, distribute and sell their digital content to our users. The content owner sets the price and the end user can purchase the content by paying for it with Zedge Credits, our closed virtual currency. A user can earn Zedge Credits when taking specific actions such as watching rewarded videos or completing electronic surveys. Alternatively, users can buy Zedge Credits via an in-app purchase. If a user purchases Zedge Credits, Google Play or iTunes keeps 30% of the purchase price with the remaining 70% being paid to us. When a user purchases Zedge Premium content the artist or brand receives 70% of the actual value of the Zedge Credits used to buy the content item and we retain the remaining 30% as our fee, which we recognize as Other Revenue. Some of the Zedge Premium content is available for print-on-demand merchandise. When a user purchases a print-on-demand item, the artist or brand is paid 70% of the net profit, after accounting for cost-of-goods sold, shipping and handling, credit card processing and related costs, and we recognize Other Revenue from the remaining 30%. As Zedge Premium matures and expands, we expect it to also diversify our revenue source mix.
 
In January 2019, we started testing a subscription-based product on Android, whereby users of our Zedge app can prepay a monthly or yearly fee to amongst of things remove unsolicited ads when using our Zedge app. The initial results were positive and, in the third quarter of fiscal 2019, we scaled the offering for our entire Android user base. We offer our Zedge users a choice of a monthly or yearly subscription sold through the Google Play store. For subscriptions sold through the Google Play store, the subscriber executes a clickthrough agreement with us outlining the terms and conditions between us and the subscriber upon purchase of the subscription. The Google Play store processes payments for subscriptions, and retain up to 30% as a fee. Subscription revenue is a series type performance obligation and is recognized net of sales tax amounts collected from subscribers. Both monthly and yearly subscriptions are nonrefundable after seven days, and are automatically renewed at expiration date unless cancelled by subscribers. Because of the cancellation clauses for these subscriptions, the duration of these contracts is daily, and revenue for these contracts is recognized on a daily ratable basis. To date, cancellation rates have been insignificant. As of July 31, 2019, there were approximately 129,000 active subscriptions, consisting of mostly yearly subscriptions.
 
During fiscal 2019, we generated revenues of $8.8 million and a loss from operations of $2.9 million, compared to revenues of $10.8 million and a loss from operations of $1.3 million in fiscal 2018.
 
During fiscal 2019, advertisements from MoPub (owned by Twitter) represented 28.1% of our revenue, advertisements from Google represented 27.9% of our revenues and advertisements from Facebook represented 5.8% of our revenues, as compared with 34.7%, 22.0% and 7.0%, respectively, during fiscal 2018. In addition, advertisements from Ogury contributed 9.8% of our revenues during fiscal 2019, as compared with 14.3% during fiscal 2018.
 
Recent Developments
 
In January 2019, we started offering freemium Zedge app users the ability to convert into paying subscribers for, amongst other things, the ability to remove unsolicited advertisements from our Zedge app. As of July 31, 2019, we had 128,940 paying subscribers.
 
In March 2018, we completed the launch of Zedge Premium, a section of our Zedge app where consumers are able to access a wide portfolio of professionally created content, including high-definition wallpapers, exclusive ringtones, music, videos and 3D-augmented reality figures created by digital artists, photographers, illustrators, musicians and audio engineers from around the world.
 
In September 2017, we entered into an Agreement and Release with Freeform and certain of its former employees, pursuant to which we obtained releases for the employees from their Freeform employment agreements in exchange for the repayment of Freeform’s liabilities.

Our Competitive Advantage
 
We believe that the following competitive strengths will drive the growth of our business:
 

● | Large, global customer base. We benefit from our Zedge app having a large customer base. As of July 31, 2019, we had more than 33 million MAU of which approximately 54% were in North America and Europe, evenly split between the regions, which provide preferred monetization opportunities since these are attractive demographics to advertisers. To serve a global user base, the Android version of our Zedge app is available in 12 languages. Our Zedge app’s global footprint helps us to secure a highly diverse portfolio of content addressing various customer tastes and preferences. In addition, our Zedge app’s customer base attracts advertisers seeking customers that have adequate disposable income to purchase their products and services. Our Zedge app’s large customer base is also a draw to artists and brands looking to market their content to a critical mass of users.

Our Strategy
 
We believe that mobile phone users enjoy personalizing their phones with mobile personalization content. Our Zedge app provide consumers, globally, with a rich array of high-quality personalization content used to express their essence, individuality, and voice in an easy, entertaining and immersive fashion. Professional artists, individual creators and brands turn to our Zedge platform for marketing and distributing their content to our consumers. Our Zedge app currently offers a rich and diverse catalogue of wallpapers, video wallpapers, stickers, ringtones, notification sounds on Android and wallpapers, video wallpapers and ringtones, on iOS. In the future, we may offer new content verticals and enhanced features in our Zedge app.
 
To date, our Zedge app has been downloaded more than 396 million times and has consistently ranked in the ‘Top 60’ most popular free apps in the Google Play store in the United States. The overwhelming majority of our Zedge app’s downloads have been organic in nature without our investing in paid user-acquisition campaigns. Our Zedge app continues to serve as a low-cost user acquisition channel.
 
Our vision calls for utilizing our Zedge app’s digital publishing platform to not only continue being one of the world’s leading mobile personalization content apps but to also use this platform to publish new stand-alone apps that extend our value proposition in entertainment. We have engineered the platform to support an array of digital content enabling us to launch new apps with relative ease and speed. We want to capitalize on our Zedge app’s existing large install base as well as organic search traffic across the web and in the app stores as a low-cost user acquisition channel for these new entertainment apps. Our goal is to ensure that these new apps are equally valuable and viable across both Android and iOS.
 
If we execute our vision, we would build a network of apps which can be used for cross-promotional purposes. We identified the entertainment market as our focal point for new apps because we believe that apps in that market:
 

● | generally overlap well with the demographic of our Zedge app’s existing customer base;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | enjoy a higher frequency of use when compared to our Zedge app enabling the potential for both a subscription and ad-based monetization model; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | allow for us to attract new users who may not be interested in our Zedge app’s personalization content.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We expect our first foray to be an entertainment app dedicated to “Chat Stories,” serialized, short-form fiction delivered in a text-message format. Every time the user clicks on their screen, he or she sees the next message in the episode.
 
Our Zedge app’s strong position as a leading platform for personalization content that consumers use to express their essence, individuality, and voice in an easy, entertaining and immersive fashion remains critical to our business. In order to maintain this position, we are concentrating our efforts on the following goals:
 

● | Continue growing our Zedge app’s user base, globally. We expect to continue devoting resources to grow our Zedge app’s user base by:
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | studying its users’ needs and enhancing our app to meet those needs;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


● | developing and offering new features and services in the Zedge app that are relevant to new users interested in personalized digital content; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | expanding our Zedge app’s reach by collaborating with strategic partners.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Improve our Zedge app’s monetization. We will continue exploring additional monetization methods for our Zedge app, including in-app purchases, subscription models, e-commerce, new advertising products and brand sponsorships. To this end, in January 2019 we started testing a paid subscription model of our Zedge app which removed unsolicited ads from the app. As of July 31, 2019, we amassed 128,940 paying subscribers. We believe that our Zedge app’s large and expanding customer base is an attractive medium for advertisers, brands and artists and that this will result in new monetization opportunities for our Zedge app over time as well as an appealing audience to promote our new apps.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Ongoing product and technology investment in our Zedge app. We plan on making selected investments in product feature sets and functionalities of our Zedge app in order to both maintain its userbase and attract new users and artists and position its content contributors for optimal success in achieving their marketing and sales goals. Some of these initiatives include ongoing investment in our Zedge app’s search and discovery, content recommendations, supporting new content verticals, improving our Zedge app’s self-serve platform, and connecting creators with relevant end users via our Zedge app.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Building our Zedge app into a best-of-breed platform for artists and creators. Our goal is to build our Zedge app into a platform that artists view as prioritizing their needs ahead of other platforms and addressing all aspects of their marketing and revenue generation goals including, but not limited to, ease in managing their virtual storefront, promotion, education, reporting and distribution.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Increase our marketing efforts for our Zedge app. Historically, we haven’t invested materially in marketing initiatives for our Zedge app. Going forward, we envision the need to better promote our Zedge app and to amplify our Zedge app’s value proposition to artists and individual creators. We envisage these creators and influencers and brands self-promoting their availability on our Zedge app in order to extend their reach, generating incremental income and drive more end-user traffic to our platform. Furthermore, we also plan to continue to invest in app store optimization, search, marketing automation, social marketing and community management in order to retain and expand our Zedge app’s customer base.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Selectively pursue strategic investments and acquisitions. On a selective basis, we will look to invest in or purchase entities that can provide synergistic growth opportunities for our Zedge app and otherwise. In September 2017, we closed the Freeform acquihire in order to accelerate the launch and development of Zedge Premium. We plan to leverage our understanding of the smartphone industry to pursue additional opportunities that we believe can impact our business in a materially positive fashion.

Our History
 
In 2003, Tom Arnoy, Kenneth Sundnes and Paul Shaw launched a consumer website at www.zedge.net that people used to upload and download ringtones.
 
In December 2006, IDT Corporation acquired 90% of Zedge. Zedge Holdings, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in 2008, and our name was changed to Zedge, Inc. in 2016.
 
In 2009, we introduced the Android version of our Zedge app. The Zedge app provided ease-of-use by negating the need for customers to first download a ringtone or wallpaper to their computer and then upload that content to their mobile phone.
 
In 2011, Tom Arnoy was promoted to our Chief Executive Officer and Jonathan Reich was retained as our Chief Operating Officer.
 
We launched the iOS version of our Zedge app in 2013, followed by launch of the Windows Mobile Zedge app in 2014.

During 2014 and 2015, our Zedge app introduced app icons, social sharing features and marketing automation capabilities, and expanded the number of languages supported.
 
In 2016, IDT Corporation spun off our stock to its stockholders, and our Class B Common Stock was listed on the NYSE American with the ticker symbol “ZDGE”.
 
In March 2018, we completed the launch of Zedge Premium, our marketplace that is part of the Zedge app where artists and brands can market, distribute and sell to our users their digital content, including wallpapers, ringtones, video wallpapers and stickers.
 
In January 2019, we started testing a subscription-based product on the Android version of our Zedge app, whereby users could prepay a monthly or yearly fee to remove unsolicited ads when using our Zedge app. As of July 31, 2019, we had 128,940 active subscribers.
 
In August 2019, Tom Arnoy tendered his resignation as our Chief Executive Officer and Michael Jonas, our Executive Chairman, Chairman of the Board, controlling stockholder and a director, assumed the role of interim Chief Executive Officer.


Our Technology
 
Our Zedge app as a scalable distributed platform that is comprised of both open source and proprietary technologies centered on content management and discovery, web and app development, data mining and analytics, deep learning, mobile content/device compatibility, advertising and reporting. We have built a solid framework that allows us to ideate, test, and launch where warranted by the outcome and we have embraced machine learning throughout our technology stack in order to improve content recommendations and relevancy. From an end user’s perspective, our Zedge app’s platform minimizes response latency while maximizing content relevancy and discoverability. We optimize our Zedge app by utilizing systems, algorithms and heuristics that organize our Zedge app’s content based upon real user data and that render the content in a relevant fashion. Our Zedge app’s architecture provides a fully redundant production environment in a cloud-hosted, virtual-server environment.
Competition
 
Our Zedge app faces competition across many different fronts including:
 

● | Mobile personalization products. Generally, our Zedge app competes with other developers’ mobile apps for an end-user’s screen time. More specifically, ringtones, wallpapers, notification sounds, video wallpapers and stickers are a commodity, and many smaller apps and websites offer this content both free and for a fee. We believe that our Zedge app has a competitive advantage due to its:
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | large user base;
--+-----------------


● | “one stop shop” approach which avails customers of ringtones, wallpapers, notification sounds, video wallpapers and stickers within the same Android app;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | modular approach that allows the customer to selectively choose what they would like to personalize without handing over the core elements of the native operating system to a third party and overwhelming the user with a myriad of complex options;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | large content catalogue;
--+-------------------------


● | proprietary recommendation engine; and
--+---------------------------------------


● | market ranking and longevity.
--+------------------------------


● | Advertisers. We face significant competition for advertising spend on our Zedge app from both digital media providers and traditional media outlets, including television, radio and print, many of which have significantly more resources than us.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Content creators. There are many websites and mobile apps that focus on offering content creators an eco-system in which they can market and sell their digital art. Yet, we are not aware of many that as of July 31, 2019 had access to an embedded customer base with more than 33 million MAU, which we believe makes our Zedge app more attractive to many content creators.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Rapid Paced and Changing World of Mobile App Development. The mobile app eco-system changes quickly and regularly with new apps capturing massive audiences competing for consumer’s time, mindshare and money. This is an ongoing competitive threat requiring us to do our best to remain relevant and meaningful.
