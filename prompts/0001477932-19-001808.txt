General Overview
 
Eco Tek 360, Inc. was incorporated in Nevada on March 25, 2005 as “Premier Publishing Group, Inc.”. Originally formed as a publishing company, the Company ceased its publishing operations in or around 2007.
 
After ceasing the publishing operations, the Company’s operations consisted solely of utilizing the expertise of our Board Members and outside agents to further the efforts our advisory services business plan through a wholly-owned subsidiary known as Trident Merchant Group, Inc.
 
In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2013, the Company became involved in the manufacturing and global distribution of ladies’ apparel. During the second quarter, 2014 the Company formed Leading Edge Fashions, LLC of which it controlled 51% of the membership interest. Effective December 31, 2014 the Company's Board of Directors determined it was in the best interest of the Company to discontinue the operations of Leading Edge Fashions, LLC, and in 2014 the Company stopped developing a footprint in the apparel business due to cash restraints and logistics and ceased agreements with all third-parties to distribute their products into SE Asia and China.

Trident has also ceased operations to concentrate on the opportunities related to rejuvenating fibers and re-purposing them into finished products.
 
The Company created a new limited liability company, Pure361, LLC ("Pure361") in May 2015 for the purpose of operating the portion of the Company's business that is involved with the collection, rejuvenation and manufacturing of garments and other accessories for the uniform marketplace that serves the hospitality, food service, medical, manufacturing, education, military, transportation and other commercial uniform industries. The Company owns 51% of Pure361. Pure361 entered into a license agreement with Pure System International Ltd. ("Pure"), the minority owner of Pure 361, related to potential future operations in which Pure361 was granted the exclusive license to use certain licensed intellectual property related to the manufacturing of uniforms from recyclable waste. Pure361 has had no operations to date, nor did it have any assets or liabilities as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 respectively.
 
The Company created a new wholly owned subsidiary, Progressive Fashions Inc. ("PFI") in February 2016 for the purpose of designing, producing and marketing the EMME® Activewear Collection. On June 5, 2017 the Company and True Beauty, LLC (the company that controls the EMME® trademark) terminated the license agreement in order to focus resources on the Rejuvenated Uniform Segment. PFI has generated no revenue to date, nor did it have any assets or liabilities  as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 respectively.
 
Our address is 50 Division Street, Suite 501, Somerville, New Jersey 08876. Our corporate website is http://ecotek360.com/.
 
We have never declared bankruptcy or been in receivership. We have earned minimal revenues and have limited cash on hand. We have sustained losses since inception and have primarily relied upon the sale of our securities and loans from related parties for funding.
Our Current Business
 
Eco Tek 360, Inc. is currently in the development stage. The Company’s business plan is to operate a fiber rejuvenation technology company. It plans on offering branded fabrics, apparel and uniforms to the corporate, hotel, hospital and military markets. We will achieve this by utilizing a patented and proprietary process for rejuvenating textile waste into high quality fabrics and apparel.
The Rejuvenated Uniform Segment
 
In April 2015, we entered into a joint venture and license agreement with Pure Systems International, Ltd. to produce and market garments and other accessories for the commercial uniform marketplace and other market verticals by utilizing Pure Systems International, Ltd.’s patented processes to up-cycle pre-consumer textile waste into reusable fiber of equal or better quality than the original fabric. (the “Rejuvenated Fiber”)
 
In May of 2015, the Company created a new limited liability company, Pure361, LLC (“Pure361”) of which the Company owns 51% and Pure Systems International, Ltd. owns 49%. Pure361 has the exclusive licensee to use Pure System International Ltd.’s patented Rejuvenated Fiber in conjunction with the commercial uniform marketplace and other market verticals.
 
Ms Joy Nunn, the company’s former CTO and Board member resigned as of February 14, 2017, but the company still maintains a license with Pure System International, Ltd.
 
To further strengthen its capabilities in the Rejuvenated Uniform segment the Company has identified alternative technologies to those under license from Pure Systems. The company will be developing customers using this alternative technology by working with equipment vendors and toll manufacturers to produce sales samples.

The Rejuvenated Cardboard Segment
 
In conjunction with its focus on rejuvenated technologies, the Company is exploring the possibility of also manufacturing a rejuvenated cardboard product, and is in the early stages of exploring this potential opportunity.
Competition
 
In the uniform and related products segment, we will compete with many firms, including corporations with large divisions, many of these companies have great financial, technical or marketing resources, longer operating histories, greater brand recognition or larger customer bases than we do and may be able to respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions than we can. The nature and degree of competition varies with the customer and the market. Industry statistics are not available.
 
Competitive pricing may require us to reduce our future prices, which would impact future profitability or result in lost sales. Our competitors, many of whom have greater resources than we do, may be better able to withstand these price reductions and lost sales.
 
Seasonality
 
We do not have a seasonal business cycle.
 
Employees
 
We have no employees. Our officers and directors furnish their time to the development of the Company at no cost and intend to do whatever work is necessary in order to generate revenues. We do not foresee hiring any employees in the near future.
Research and Development
 
We have not incurred any research and development expenditures over the last two fiscal years.
 
Intellectual Property
