Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

 We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on discovering novel, differentiated biologic therapeutics and developing them for the treatment of life-threatening infectious diseases, including those caused by drug-resistant pathogens. Drug-resistant infections account for 2,000,000 illnesses in the United States and 700,000 deaths worldwide each year. We intend to address drug-resistant infections using product candidates from our lysin platform. Lysins are enzymes derived from naturally occurring bacteriophage, which are viruses that infect bacteria. When recombinantly produced and then applied to bacteria, lysins cleave a key component of the target bacterias peptidoglycan cell wall, resulting in rapid bacterial cell death. Conventional antibiotics require bacterial cell division and metabolism to occur in order to exert their intended effect (i.e., cell death or cessation of growth). Based on in vitro tests, lysins, however, are fundamentally different in that they kill bacteria rapidly by enzymatic cleavage of the bacterial cell wall without need for bacterial growth and cell division. In addition to the speed of action and potent cidality, we believe lysins are differentiated by their other hallmark features, which include the demonstrated ability to eradicate biofilms and synergistically boost the efficacy of conventional antibiotics in animal models. Importantly, lysins also have a narrow spectrum, meaning they kill only specific species of bacteria or closely related bacteria. As such, we believe that lysins targeting gram-positive pathogens will not have negative effects on the beneficial, normal human gastrointestinal (GI) microbiome, in contrast to conventional broad spectrum antibiotics which can kill the bodys normal, beneficial bacteria. We believe that the therapeutic profile of lysins is complementary to that of conventional antibiotics. As such, our approach includes the use of lysins in addition to conventional antibiotics for the treatment of serious, drug-resistant bacterial infections, including biofilm-associated infections, to achieve greater efficacy and improve clinical outcomes, as well as potentially protecting against antibiotic resistance. 
 We believe that the properties of our lysins will make them suitable for targeting antibiotic-resistant organisms, such as Staphylococcus aureus (Staph aureus) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), which can cause serious infections such as bacteremia, pneumonia and osteomyelitis. Beyond lysins, we continue to seek and identify novel antibacterial product candidates. We recently discovered a new class of novel lytic agents, called amurin peptides. Our preliminary characterization studies indicate that amurin peptides have potency across a wide range of resistant gram-negative pathogens, including species that are part of the ESKAPE pathogens (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species), which are the leading causes of hospital acquired infections throughout the world. These pathogens are considered to be urgent or serious threats to global health by the U.S. Center for Disease Control (CDC) and critical priorities by the World Health Organization (WHO). We believe that the amurin peptides will be highly complementary to our pathogen-specific lysin platform in addressing these infections. We aim to improve outcomes in patient with these life-threatening bacterial infections through use of our differentiated biologic candidates developed from our novel lysin and amurin platforms. 
 Our most advanced program, CF-301 (exebacase), is an investigational novel lysin that targets Staph aureus, including methicillin-resistant (MRSA) strains, which causes serious infections such as bacteremia, pneumonia and osteomyelitis. Staph aureus is also a common cause of biofilm-associated infections of heart valves (endocarditis), prosthetic joints, indwelling devices and catheters. These infections result in significant morbidity and mortality despite currently available antibiotic therapies. Exebacase is being studied in a Phase 2 superiority study to evaluate its safety, tolerability, efficacy and pharmacokinetics (PK) when used in addition to background standard of care (SOC) antibiotics compared to antibiotics alone for the treatment of Staph aureus bacteremia, including endocarditis in adult patients. 
 We recently announced positive topline results from this first-in-patient Phase 2 superiority study of exebacase, which showed clinically meaningful improvement in clinical responder rates among patients treated with exebacase in addition to SOC antibiotics compared to SOC antibiotics alone. In the primary efficacy analysis population of 116 patients with documented Staph aureus bacteremia, including endocarditis, who received a single intravenous (IV) infusion of blinded study drug, the clinical responder rate was 70.4% for 
 
1 


  patients treated with exebacase and 60.0% for patients dosed with SOC antibiotics alone. In a pre-specified analysis of MRSA-infected patients, the clinical responder rate in patients treated with exebacase was 42.8% higher than the clinical responder rate in patients treated with SOC antibiotics alone (74.1% for patients treated with exebacase compared to 31.3% for patients treated with SOC antibiotics alone (p=0.010)). The clinical responder rate in the subset of patients with bacteremia including right-sided endocarditis was 80.0% for patients treated with exebacase compared to 59.5% for patients treated with SOC antibiotics alone, an increase of 20.5% (p=0.028). In the subset of patients with bacteremia alone, the clinical responder rate was 81.8% for patients treated with exebacase compared to 61.5% for patients treated with SOC antibiotics alone, an increase of 20.3% (p=0.035). Exebacase was well-tolerated and treatment emergent adverse events, including serious treatment-emergent serious adverse events (SAEs) were balanced between the treatment groups. There were no SAEs that we determined to be related to exebacase, there were no reports of hypersensitivity related to exebacase and no patients discontinued treatment with study drug in either treatment group. We believe these data establish proof of concept for exebacase, and for the lysin class as therapeutic agents, and will inform the design of Phase 3 for exebacase. 
 We also continue to advance our preclinical portfolio of novel lysin programs. We have developed a novel, engineered variant of exebacase, known as CF-296, which we believe provides the opportunity for extension of our agents targeting Staph aureus through alternative dosing paradigms or drug product presentations. We are evaluating the potential to develop CF-296 as a targeted therapy for deep-seated, invasive biofilm-associated Staph aureus infections such as prosthetic joint infections. We are conducting further in vitro and in vivo characterization of CF-296 to determine the profile and potential place in therapy for this compound. Our lysin research efforts are focused on a broad-based gram-negative discovery program which aims to identify, optimize and develop lysins that target deadly gram-negative pathogens. We have discovered and engineered lysins with potent activity against drug-resistant P. aeruginosa bacteria, a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with hospital acquired pneumonia and a major medical challenge for patients with cystic fibrosis. We are initiating animal studies of our most promising anti-pseudomonal lysins with the goal of moving this program to the clinic as soon as possible. We were awarded $1.0 million in funding from CARB-X (Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria Biopharmaceutical Accelerator) in 2017 to support these efforts and we announced in January 2019 that CARB-X awarded us an additional $2.3 million in the amount of funding to be received over the next two years. 
 Beyond our lysin programs, we continue our proprietary research to expand our pipeline of complementary, nontraditional antimicrobials to address high unmet medical needs. We have discovered a novel class of phage-derived lytic agents, known as amurin peptides, which have displayed potent activity against a wide range of gram-negative pathogens in preclinical studies, including deadly, drug-resistant P. aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumannii and Enterobacter cloacae bacteria species. We are currently evaluating the in vitro profiles of the amurins as we continue to advance the program. We recently announced an award from CARB-X of up to $6.9 million of funding to support these efforts. 
 Our Strategy 
 Our strategy is to use our novel, highly differentiated therapeutic products, if approved, to achieve a leading market position in the treatment of life-threatening infectious diseases, including those caused by drug-resistant pathogens. We plan to pursue commercialization of therapeutic products through discovery, acquisition and development as follows: 

 | Advance our lead product candidate, exebacase, through Phase 3 clinical development and demonstrate superiority of our therapeutic candidate used in addition to SOC antibiotics over SOC antibiotics alone for the treatment of Staph aureus bacteremia, including endocarditis. If our Phase 3 clinical program confirms the results of the Phase 2 study, demonstrating the superiority of exebacase, used in addition to SOC antibiotics as compared to antibiotics alone, we would seek marketing authorization with a superiority claim which, if exebacase is approved, we believe would be highly differentiated from

conventional antibiotics and would lead to rapid uptake by providers, favorable reimbursements from payors and potential reductions in health care utilization and the overall cost of treatment per patient;

Our Portfolio 
 We intend to develop and commercialize novel therapeutic agents to treat life-threatening infections, including those caused by drug-resistant pathogens. The increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistance among bacterial pathogens has been widely recognized as an urgent public health threat by the CDC, the WHO and the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA). Antibiotic resistance has limited the effectiveness of many conventional antibiotics and the discovery and development of new therapeutics to address resistance has not kept pace with the increasing incidence of these difficult-to-treat microbial infections. According to the IDSA, as of 2010 the estimated cost to the U.S. healthcare system of antibiotic-resistant infections was approximately $21 billion to $34 billion annually, a substantial portion of which is due to increased length of hospital stays necessary to treat these patients. 
 We have focused our research and discovery efforts on those pathogens that are considered to be urgent or serious threats to global health by the CDC or considered critical priority by the WHO. Our current portfolio of programs is reflected below:

 Our Lead Program: Exebacase (CF-301)
Medical Opportunity 
 Staph aureus bacteremia is a serious bacterial infection associated with high morbidity and mortality. In the U.S. alone, there are approximately 200,000 hospitalizations for Staph aureus bacteremia annually. Mortality rates from this bloodstream infection have been reported as ranging from 20-40% despite conventional antibiotics. The last new agent for Staph aureus bacteremia and endocarditis, daptomycin, was approved over 13 years ago based on clinical cure rates of less than 50% in the Phase 3 study that led to its approval. 
 Staph aureus bacteremia can lead to infectious endocarditis, a serious infection affecting the heart valves. The incidence of infective endocarditis in the U.S. has increased over the past decade, with over 47,000 cases in 2011, and is likely due to the growth of the at-risk populations, such as older, diabetic and hemodialysis patients. Staph aureus endocarditis remains difficult to treat with current standard of care antibiotics. One reason for this is biofilm formation which prevents antibiotics from eradicating the bacteria, leading to the need for long courses of antibiotic therapy, which are often unsuccessful and necessitate surgery to eradicate bacteria from infected heart valves. Mortality attributed to Staph aureus bacteremia is higher when the infection is caused by MRSA as compared to methicillin-susceptible (MSSA) Staph aureus. MRSA is considered a serious threat to global health by the CDC and a high priority threat by the WHO. Emerging resistance to conventional antibiotics such as vancomycin and daptomycin, which are used to treat MSSA 
and MRSA, represents an additional serious threat which may have serious consequences in terms of increasing morbidity, mortality and health care utilization. 
 Exebacase Development 
 Exebacase is the first lysin to enter U.S. clinical trials and represents a first-in-class anti-bacterial therapeutic candidate. Exebacase has been granted Fast Track designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the development of a parenteral formulation for the treatment of Staph aureus bacteremia, including endocarditis, caused by MRSA or MSSA. If we are able to obtain regulatory approval of exebacase for this initial indication, we believe exebacase, and/or engineered variants, may be further developed for the treatment of other serious diseases caused by Staph aureus including biofilm-related infections in prosthetic joints and indwelling devices, as well as pneumonia and osteomyelitis. 
 Clinical Studies 
 Phase 2 Clinical Study 
 We are conducting a multi-center, multi-national Phase 2 clinical study of exebacase for the treatment of Staph aureus bacteremia, including endocarditis, caused by MRSA or MSSA. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study compares the efficacy, safety and tolerability of exebacase used in addition to SOC antibiotics to SOC antibiotics alone. The study enrolled 121 patients randomized 3:2 to receive either a single dose of exebacase (0.25 mg/kg) administered as a 2 hour IV infusion in addition to SOC antibiotics or placebo plus SOC antibiotics. The primary efficacy analysis population (also known as the microbiological intent-to-treat population, or mITT) consisted of 116 patients with confirmed Staph aureus infection based on blood culture who received study drug, of which 71 patients received exebacase and 45 patients received placebo. All patients were treated with SOC antibiotics as prescribed by the study investigators, consisting of vancomycin or daptomycin for MRSA and a semi-synthetic penicillin or first-generation cephalosporin for MSSA, prescribed in accordance with treatment guidelines, accepted medical practice and the study protocol. The majority of patients were enrolled in the U.S. (79.3%) with the remainder of patient enrolled from sites in Europe, Latin America, Russia and Israel. A total of 38.8% of exebacase-treated and 35.5% of placebo patients, respectively, had a MRSA infection. The majority of patients in both treatment groups had bacteremia, 77.5% of the exebacase-treated group and 86.7% of the placebo group. Final diagnosis was determined by an independent, blinded clinical adjudication committee. 
 The primary efficacy endpoint of the study was clinical response at day 14. Clinical response was defined by objective clinical response criteria including (1) improvement or complete resolution of all attributable signs 
 
4 


  and symptoms of Staph aureus bacteremia that were present at baseline, (2) no new, worsening or persistent signs and symptoms attributable to Staph aureus bacteremia, (3) no development of a new foci of Staph aureus infection after Day 7, (4) no further anti-staphylococcal therapy was needed, (5) no surgery or further medical intervention for the Staph aureus infection was necessary and (6) the patient is alive. Clinical response was also determined by the independent, blinded clinical adjudication committee. 
 Recently announced topline efficacy results from the core study demonstrated the clinical responder rate was 70.4% for patients treated with exebacase and 60.0% for patients treated with SOC antibiotics alone (p=0.314). In a pre-specified analysis of MRSA-infected patients, the clinical responder rate was 42.8% higher in the exebacase group compared to the SOC antibiotics alone group (74.1% for patients treated with exebacase compared to 31.3% for patients dosed with SOC antibiotics alone (p=0.010)). The clinical responder rate in the subset of patients with bacteremia, including right-sided endocarditis was 80.0% for patients treated with exebacase compared to 59.5% for patients treated with SOC antibiotics alone, an increase of 20.5% (p=0.028). Similarly, in the subset of patients with bacteremia alone, the clinical responder rate was 81.8% for patients treated with exebacase compared to 61.5% for patients treated with SOC antibiotics alone, an increase of 20.3% (p=0.035). 
 Based on these efficacy data, summarized in Table 1 below, treatment with exebacase in addition to SOC antibiotics resulted in clinically meaningful improvements in outcomes compared to antibiotic therapy alone. 
 Table 1 
 

Clinical response at Day 14 | exebacase* | antibioticsalone | p-value
Overall mITT population | 70.4% | 60.0% | 0.314 
MRSA infection | 74.1% | 31.3% | 0.010 
MSSA infection | 68.2% | 73.3% | 0.796 
Bacteremia + right-sided endocarditis | 80.0% | 59.5% | 0.028 
Bacteremia only | 81.8% | 61.5% | 0.035

--+--------------------------------

 Another primary objective of the study was to describe the safety and tolerability of exebacase used in addition to SOC antibacterial therapy compared to SOC antibiotics alone in hospitalized patients with Staph aureus bacteremia, including endocarditis. An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) reviewed unblinded safety and pharmacokinetic data during the study. Treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were defined as an untoward medical event reported from the study drug administration until 28 days after last dose of standard of care antibiotics, regardless of whether or not the event was considered related to study drug. The incidence of TEAEs was balanced between the treatment groups (88.9% and 85.1% of the exebacase and SOC antibiotics alone groups, respectively), with incidence rates as expected for this population, given the severity of the disease under study and that patients had multiple co-morbidities. The incidence rates of TEAEs reported within approximately one week after administration of the single dose of study drug were also balanced between the treatment groups (66.7% and 66.0% in the exebacase and SOC antibiotics alone groups, respectively). The overall rate of serious treatment-emergent SAEs was also similar between the treatment groups (47.2% for the exebacase group and 51.1% for the SOC antibiotics alone group). Among all patients who received study drug, 19.4% of exebacase patients and 14.9% of placebo patients died. There were no SAEs that we determined to be related to study drug. Exebacase was well-tolerated and there were no reports of hypersensitivity related to exebacase and no patients discontinued study drug in either treatment group.

 Based on these safety and tolerability data, summarized in Table 2 below, we concluded that exebacase was well-tolerated in this study.

 | N=72n (%) | N=47n (%) 
TEAE | 64 (88.9) | 40 (85.1) 
TEAE through day 7 | 48 (66.7) | 31 (66.0) 
TEAE leading to study drug interruption | 1 (1.4) | 0 
TEAE leading to study drug withdrawal | 0 | 0 
TEAE related to study drug | 8 (11.1) | 4 (8.5) 
Serious TEAE | 34 (47.2) | 24 (51.1) 
Total deaths | 14 (19.4) | 7 (14.9) 


* | used in addition to antibiotics
--+--------------------------------

 The Phase 2 study is still ongoing as patients are followed up to 180 days after administration of study drug. We expect to complete the study and have the complete data set in the second quarter of 2019. We also expect to have additional data from the 180 day long-term follow-up visit including additional safety, immunogenicity and PK data being assessed in the trial. 
 We expect to progress exebacase into Phase 3 of clinical development. Based on previous feedback from the FDA, we believe that a single confirmatory Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating the superiority of exebacase used in addition to SOC antibiotics compared to SOC antibiotics alone for the treatment of Staph aureus bacteremia, including right-sided endocarditis, together with the full package of Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical data, along with a robust non-clinical and PK/PD data package will be sufficient to support the biologics license application (BLA) submission. As such, the planned Phase 3 study is expected to be a multi-center, multi-national, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled superiority study comparing clinical responder rates of exebacase used in addition to SOC antibiotics to SOC antibiotics alone for the treatment of Staph aureus bacteremia, including right-sided endocarditis. Specific parameters for Phase 3 will be informed by data from the Phase 2 study once it is completed, and relevant guidance from regulatory authorities. If the Phase 3 study confirms superiority of exebacase, used in addition to SOC antibiotics as compared to antibiotics alone, we would seek marketing authorization with a superiority claim, which we believe would be highly differentiated from conventional antibiotics and would lead to rapid uptake by providers and favorable reimbursements from payors. 
 Phase 1 Clinical Study 
 In 2015, we concluded a Phase 1 single ascending dose study in healthy volunteers. This trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and PK of four different intravenous doses of exebacase. Healthy normal subjects were randomized to receive a single IV dose of exebacase or placebo, each administered as a 2 hour IV infusion. 
 In this Phase 1 study, exebacase was generally well tolerated and there were no clinical adverse safety signals. No SAEs or hypersensitivity AEs related to exebacase were reported, and no study stopping rules were met. A total of five non-serious AEs were reporting during the study as follows: two subjects who received exebacase reported a total of three non-serious AEs (headache, contact dermatitis, and allergic rhinitis); two subjects who received placebo reported a total of two non-serious AEs (viral upper respiratory tract infection and 
 
6 


  viral infection). All of these events were mild in intensity and resolved. No patients withdrew from the study due to an AE. There were no clinically relevant changes in inflammatory markers (e.g., erythrocyte sedimentation rate, high sensitivity c-reactive protein, or complement factors including total hemolytic complement (CH50) associated with exebacase dosing. 
 Nine out of 13 subjects dosed with exebacase developed anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) in the study. These ADAs were waning or absent by day 180, and were not correlated with mediators of allergic immune response. Exposure was generally linear, dose dependent and intra-subject variability was low. A pharmacometric analysis of the relationship between exebacase exposure and heart rate (HR), blood pressure and QT interval parameters showed no significant changes in systolic or diastolic blood pressure, HR or HR-corrected QT intervals with increases in exebacase plasma concentration at the doses tested in the Phase 1 study. 
 Estimated effective exposure of exebacase, based on in vivo pharmacology, PK/PD exposure target attainment analysis and PK/PD modeling was attained at the 0.25mg/kg dose in healthy subjects. The Phase 1 Clinical Study Report, as well as reports of the animal studies, PK/PD modeling and in vitro clinical microbiology studies were submitted to the regulatory authorities and an End of Phase 1 Meeting with FDA was conducted prior to advancing into Phase 2. 
 In vitro Microbiologic Studies and Animal Models Demonstrate the Therapeutic Potential of Exebacase 
 We believe exebacase is well differentiated from conventional antibiotics by it spectrum of activity, including: 
 

 | Eradication of biofilms. Exebacase has been shown to clear biofilms in vitro studies and in animal models. Biofilm matrices associated with serious Staph aureus infections form on human tissues (e.g., valve in endocarditis or bone in osteomyelitis) and/or on the abiotic surfaces (e.g., prosthetic joints, catheters and other devices) and protect bacteria from immune defenses. Biofilms pose significant therapeutic challenges by increasing antibiotic tolerance up to 1,000-fold because conventional antibiotics are generally unable to clear or penetrate biofilms and kill dormant Staph aureus bacteria harbored within the biofilms. Hence, surgical removal of infected tissue, catheters, prosthetic joints and other indwelling devices containing Staph aureus biofilms is generally required to eradicate the infections.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Rapid, potent and selective bactericidal activity. In vitro, exebacase kills Staph aureus bacteria within seconds, thereby exerting a bactericidal effect, defined as a 3-log (99.9%) drop in colony forming units (CFU) per mL, within about 30 minutes. Exebacase has exhibited potent antibacterial activity against Staph aureus strains that are sensitive to methicillin as well as strains resistant to methicillin, vancomycin, daptomycin, or linezolid. Exebacase is highly targeted against staphylococcal and some streptococcal species, with no demonstrable activity against gram negative organisms. We believe that this targeted effect will reduce the possible negative effects of exebacase on normal, healthy human bacterial flora, known as the microbiome, in the GI tract, in contrast to broad spectrum antibiotics which are widely known to have deleterious effects on the human GI microbiome.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Potentiation of the efficacy of conventional anti-staphylococcal antibiotics. We have demonstrated strong synergy between exebacase and a wide range of antibiotics in preclinical studies, which we believe may enable exebacase to potentiate the efficacy of current standards of care for the treatment of Staph aureus bacteremia, including daptomycin, vancomycin and oxacillin. Because of this and the aforementioned features of exebacase which are also complementary to antibiotics, we believe the use of exebacase, in addition to conventional anti-staphylococcal antibiotics will provide significantly improved clinical cure rates, compared to antibiotics alone.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Low propensity for the development of resistance. In vitro models designed to induce the emergence of antibiotic resistance, such as 26 day serial passage studies, have shown a low propensity for bacteria to develop resistance to exebacase. In comparison, resistance to standard of care antibiotics such as
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
7 


 
daptomycin can readily be induced in the same model. Importantly, the addition of exebacase to daptomycin or other antibiotics in the same model was observed to suppress the emergence of resistance to conventional antibiotics.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe exebacase has other competitive advantages as well, including: 
 

 | No direct competition. Vancomycin and daptomycin are the only two antibiotics with label indications in the U.S. for the treatment of Staph aureus bacteremia, including endocarditis due to MSSA and MRSA. Daptomycin, the most recently FDA approved drug for this indication, was approved in 2005. Clinical cure rates at the test of cure visit in the Phase 3 non-inferiority study which led to daptomycins approval were less than 50% for both daptomycin and the standard of care comparator. Exebacase has been shown to act synergistically with both daptomycin and vancomycin to improve eradication of Staph aureus in animal studies of Staph aureus endocarditis conducted in different species. As such exebacase is intended to be used in addition to, not as a replacement for, SOC antibiotics. No other agents have been shown to provide improved outcomes over SOC antibiotics.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Patent protection. Our issued patent with composition of matter claims and issued patent with method claims for killing Staph aureus stains both provide protection through 2032, our issued patent with method claims for disrupting or treating biofilm provides protection until 2033 and additional patents, if issued as we expect, could provide further protection beyond 2033.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Eradication of Antibiotic-Resistant Biofilms 
 Biofilm formation is a common characteristic of certain pathogenic bacteria such as Staph aureus and P. aeruginosa and represents a major therapeutic challenge. Biofilms are characterized by densely packed bacterial cells that grow in communities and are enclosed within a complex matrix of dead bacteria and excess cell wall components. Bacteria harbored within biofilms exhibit significant tolerance to conventional antibiotics, and can be up to 1,000-fold less susceptible than planktonic (or, free-floating) bacteria. Infected human tissues, such as the heart valve in endocarditis or bone in osteomyelitis, and the abiotic surfaces of indwelling medical devices, such as central venous catheters, prosthetic joints and cardiac devices are common sites for biofilm formation in the setting of systemic Staph aureus infections. Because conventional antibiotics are relatively ineffective at penetrating biofilms, long courses of antibiotics are generally required and are often unsuccessful, necessitating surgery (e.g., heart valve or prosthetic joint removal and replacement to eradicate the infection). There is a significant unmet medical need for novel treatment strategies to eradicate biofilms, as there are no medical products currently indicated for, or effective in, the eradication of biofilms. 
 Because exebacase disrupts the cell wall of Staph aureus bacteria by enzymatic lysis, we expected exebacase to be highly active against biofilms and we have performed an extensive battery of studies to profile exebacases activity against Staph aureus biofilms. These studies tested exebacase against biofilms formed on a range of surfaces, including polystyrene (i.e., microtiter plates), glass (i.e., chamber slides), and PVC (i.e., catheter tubing), as well as in human serum, plasma, blood and synovial fluid. The results of these studies as detailed and recently published in Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy (Schuch, et al, AAC, July 2017), provide evidence that exebacase is a potent anti-staphylococcal biofilm agent. 
 We recently conducted a pilot study evaluating exebacases ability to eradicate Staph aureus biofilm from the inside of a hemodialysis catheter removed from an infected patient. The endpoint of the model was a reduction in the amount of bacteria (measured in CFUs). Segments of the catheter were assigned to one of three different treatment groups: exebacase, daptomycin (DAP) or exebacase + DAP at the clinically relevant concentration of 1 µg/mL. As shown in Figure 1 below, exebacase eradicated the biofilm at 1 µg/mL whereas daptomycin alone did not clear biofilm at 1 µg/mL. The addition of exebacase with daptomycin resulted in the same clearance of biofilm as exebacase alone. The catheter biofilm contained MRSA as well as other Staph species. We believe these data provide important translation of the previously reported potent efficacy of exebacase against biofilms formed in vitro and in animal models, to biofilms formed in the setting of human disease.

 Figure 1: Sensitivity of MRSA Biofilms on Explanted Human Catheter to Exebacase (CF-301)


In view of the lack of efficacy of conventional antibiotics against biofilms, we believe exebacase, if approved, may provide an important new therapeutic option to address the biofilm components of invasive Staph aureus infections and potentially forestall or eliminate the need for surgical intervention. 
 Rapid, potent and selective bactericidal activity 
 Lysins have demonstrated rapid bactericidal activity. We have performed timekill assays comparing the time it has taken exebacase to kill bacteria in vitro and exert a bactericidal effect to the time required for daptomycin or vancomycin to do the same. All drugs were administered at a concentration of 1x minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC). Exebacase reduced the number of Staph aureus bacteria in tests on 62 strains (20 MSSA and 42 MRSA strains) by 3-logs within 30 minutes. In contrast, daptomycin required six hours to achieve the same level of cell killing, while vancomycin failed to achieve a 2-log, or 99%, cell kill during the same six-hour test period. The rapid bactericidal activity of exebacase is one of the important reasons that we believe it could be a highly desirable therapeutic option, if approved, for the treatment of Staph aureus infections. 
 Exebacase has been bactericidal against all Staph aureus isolates tested to date, regardless of their antibiotic-resistance profile. We have tested over 250 different drug sensitive and resistant isolates of Staph aureus. The isolates tested can be classified by the particular drugs to which they are sensitive or resistant, including MSSA, MRSA, VRSA, linezolid-resistant (LRSA) and daptomycin-resistant (DRSA) Staph aureus. Exebacase was shown to be active against all the strains tested. Our Standard Bacteremia Model utilizes animals infected with 10 million (107) CFU of MRSA and treated 3 hours later with various doses of therapy or buffer. In this model, exebacase produced a dose-dependent increase in survival rates, with mice receiving at least 0.5 mg/kg of exebacase demonstrated at least 90% survival, whereas doses below 0.5 mg/kg resulted in lower survival. 
 Synergy with Standard-of-Care Antibiotics 
 Synergy is defined as the interaction of two or more agents so that their combined effect is greater than the sum of their individual effects. We identified a strong synergy between lysins and a wide range of anti-staphylococcal antibiotics, including daptomycin, vancomycin and oxacillin through in vitro synergy assays. In 
 
9 


  these tests, synergy was assessed by checkerboard assay using the fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) for each combination. An FICI mean was derived from each checkerboard based on two consecutive FIC values along the growth/no growth interface. Synergy was defined as an FICI of £0.5; strongly additive was >0.5-<1; indifference was 1 to <2; and antagonism was ³2. 
 To test and demonstrate this synergy in vivo, we developed the Drug Failure Bacteremia Model where exebacase could be tested in combination with a SOC antibiotic. The Drug Failure Bacteremia Model utilizes an extremely high infection burden of one billion (109) CFU. This produces such an overwhelming infection in the animals such that SOC antibiotics used as monotherapies at their human equivalent doses failed to produce significant cure rates. We tested daptomycin, vancomycin and oxacillin in this model. We then adjusted the dose of exebacase so that monotherapy with exebacase would also fail to have significant cure rates under these intense infection conditions. To test and demonstrate whether the synergy that we had observed in vitro between exebacase and SOC antibiotics would lead to improved efficacy in vivo, we then treated groups of animals in the Drug Failure Bacteremia Model with the drugs as monotherapies and also in combination to evaluate if there was an improvement in efficacy. 
 In the Drug Failure Bacteremia Model, all control mice treated with buffer succumbed to bacterial infection within 12 hours. Administration of a clinical dose of daptomycin as a single agent resulted in clinical failure, as only 31% of mice survived. Similarly, when exebacase was dosed as a single agent at this chosen dose, only 18% of mice survived. In contrast, when mice received the exebacase in addition to daptomycin, 82% survived the bacterial challenge, demonstrating superiority of the combination therapy over either of the single-drug regimens, with a significantly higher survival rate than the sum of the results from the two monotherapies. 
 We have tested the combination of exebacase with daptomycin, vancomycin and oxacillin in multiple experiments with the Drug Failure Bacteremia Model. In each experiment, the combination therapy was shown to be superior to monotherapy with a single drug alone. We have also studied the combination of exebacase with other anti-staphylococcal agents, including linezolid, televancin, nafcillin, cefazolin, clindamycin and azithromycin, in vitro and found exebacase to be synergistic or strongly additive with each agent against both MSSA and MRSA strains. 
 To further explore the activity of exebacase in combination with SOC antibiotics for the treatment of life-threatening, drug-resistant infections, we engaged the LA Biomed Research Institute at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center (UCLA) to perform studies in their standard, well characterized rat and rabbit infective endocarditis models. The endpoint of the model is a reduction in the amount of bacteria (measured as CFUs) on the heart valve, in the kidney and in the spleen. The studies examined the activity of exebacase in combination with daptomycin, in UCLAs prototypical high-burden biofilm-based model. 
 In this study, a single dose of exebacase used in addition to daptomycin resulted in an additional substantial reduction in CFUs, on top of the reduction in CFUs by daptomycin alone. This study is highly relevant to our understanding of the therapeutic potential of exebacase and the intended clinical application in a difficult to treat biofilm-based infection. This study demonstrated that a single dose of exebacase, when combined with four days of daptomycin treatment, resulted in a 3-log drop in bacterial burden in the cardiac vegetations and >2-log drop in the kidney and spleen of infected animals relative to daptomycin treatment alone. Importantly, four out of nine animals treated with exebacase and daptomycin were found to have sterilized kidney, spleen and heart valve vegetations, whereas none of the animals treated with daptomycin alone had tissues that were sterilized.     
 We have subsequently conducted additional experiments at UCLA in the rabbit infective endocarditis model in order to both replicate the results of the rat study, but also to examine a range of exebacase doses used in addition to daptomycin as compared to both buffer and daptomycin alone. The results of a dose-ranging study, where a range of single doses of exebacase was assessed when administered in addition to four days of daptomycin treatment are shown in Figure 2 below. As seen in the rat studies, administration of daptomycin alone resulted in a 3-log reduction in CFUs in the heart valve vegetations in these animals infected with MRSA. 
 
10 


  The addition of a single dose of exebacase, resulted in an additional ~3-log reduction in CFUs in the cardiac vegetations compared to daptomycin alone at all doses of exebacase tested (p < 0.002). Using conventional allometric scaling, the 0.7 mg/kg dose of exebacase approximates the human clinical dose of 0.25mg/kg, which is the dose being studied in our Phase 2 clinical trial. This dose together with daptomycin resulted in a 6-log reduction in CFUs compared to buffer (p < 0.001). Of note, efficacy was maintained even at the lowest dose of exebacase tested (0.09 mg/kg) in this study (p < 0.001). 
 Figure 2: Dose Ranging Study of Exebacase (CF-301) with Daptomycin in Rabbit Infective Endocarditis Model 
 

Collectively, we believe these preclinical data provided significant support to the design of our ongoing Phase 2 study to evaluate the use of exebacase in addition to SOC antibiotics for the treatment of Staph aureus bacteremia, including endocarditis. 
 Non-Clinical Activities 
 Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (CMC)
Exebacase is manufactured using a proprietary engineered E. coli strain that expresses the product in a recombinant manner during the fermentation process. This technology allows production of up to nine grams of exebacase per liter of fermentation broth. After fermentation, the broth containing exebacase is separated and purified through a process containing two chromatographic columns. The resulting product has greater than 99% purity. 
 We recently achieved concurrence with the FDA on our CMC plans for Phase 3 and BLA submission. We intend to further optimize the manufacturing process for increased purity and yield. Once completed, we plan to begin a program to manufacture Phase 3 material. The process will then be scaled up from the current 100 liter fermentation and validated in a series of manufacturing batches to demonstrate consistency. In parallel to the validation, we intend to conduct a comparability program that demonstrates comparability between the final product used in Phase 3 and commercial manufacturing. We intend to include the results in the BLA that we 
 
11 


  expect to submit to the FDA. Following submission, we expect that the FDA will conduct pre-approval inspections of all manufacturing facilities and determine whether it agrees that our commercial material is sufficiently comparable to our Phase 3 material. 
 Safety Pharmacology and Toxicology 
 We conducted non-clinical safety pharmacology and toxicology studies in connection with our Investigational New Drug application (IND) for exebacase. In these studies exebacase was well-tolerated in rats for a single two-hour IV administration of doses up to 25mg/kg (determined by us to be the no observable adverse effect level, or NOAEL) and that a single dose of 2.5 mg/kg was not associated with any effects, adverse or not, and was therefore determined to be the no observable effect level (NOEL). Exebacase was well tolerated in these studies in both rats and dogs for seven consecutive days of once daily two-hour IV infusions of up to 2.5 mg/kg. In a non-GLP pilot study in rats, 1.0 mg/kg/day was well tolerated for up to seven consecutive days of once daily two-hour IV infusions or IV boluses. 
 Dose-dependent adverse effects were seen in both species at doses above 25 mg/kg/day for 1 day in the rat and above 2.5 mg/kg/day for seven-consecutive days in both the rat and the dog. The dose limiting toxicity observed was a localized microscopic histopathological change surrounding certain blood vessels. In accordance with industry practice, we intend to study exebacase in clinical trials at doses much lower than those that caused adverse effects in animals, and we believe these doses to be within the efficacious range of the drug. 
 Upon first exposure to exebacase, no hypersensitivity reaction was observed in any of our animal studies. Upon administration of a second course of exebacase, given two weeks after completion of the first course, including multiple-day courses, hypersensitivity or hypersensitivity-like findings were observed in mice, rats and dogs. In a dedicated hypersensitivity study in rats, using a model intended to elicit hypersensitivity, findings consistent with hypersensitivity were observed after a two week delayed re-challenge with a second course of exebacase and were not dose-dependent. In general, in humans, Type I hypersensitivity is an allergic anaphylaxis-like response (e.g., an immediate and potentially life-threatening allergic reaction) and Type III hypersensitivity is a serum sickness-like response (e.g., fever, joint pain, protein in urine, vascular changes). While the nature of hypersensitivity reactions in rats may not necessarily be predictive of hypersensitivity reactions that may occur in humans, we have also considered the risk of hypersensitivity occurring upon first administration of exebacase due to potential prior exposure to the active protein component of exebacase from the environment, as it is a naturally occurring protein. Testing for anti-drug antibodies was performed in Phase 1 subjects. No clinical hypersensitivity related to exebacase was observed in subjects dosed in our Phase 1 or Phase 2 study. We are collecting additional information about the development of ADAs after dosing with exebacase in the Phase 2 study. 
 CF-296: An Engineered Approach for Invasive Staph aureus Infections 
 We have engineered a lysin variant of exebacase which we believe may suitable for the potential treatment of the most challenging invasive infections caused by Staph aureus including biofilm-related infections in prosthetic joints and indwelling devices and osteomyelitis. Based on the safety pharmacology and toxicology profile of exebacase described above, our objectives for the program were to maintain the spectrum of activity of an anti-staphylococcal lysin while improving the non-clinical safety profile. 
 Lysin Discovery Platform 
 The main objective of our lysin discovery platform has been to bring forth a portfolio of lysins that selectively target the largest threats of resistant bacteria, commonly referred to as the ESKAPE pathogens (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species), which are the leading causes of hospital acquired infections throughout the world.

 Lysins are enzymes derived from naturally occurring bacteriophage, which are viruses that infect bacteria. When recombinantly produced and then applied to bacteria, lysins cleave a key component of the target bacterias peptidoglycan cell wall, resulting in rapid bacterial cell death. Conventional antibiotics require bacterial cell division and metabolism to occur in order to exert their effect (i.e., cell death or cessation of growth). Based on in vitro tests, lysins, however, are fundamentally different in that they kill bacteria rapidly by enzymatic cleavage of the bacterial cell wall without need for bacterial growth and cell division. In addition to the speed of action and potent cidality, we believe lysins are differentiated by their other hallmark features which include the demonstrated ability to eradicate biofilms and synergistically boost the efficacy of conventional antibiotics in animal models. Importantly, lysins also have a narrow spectrum meaning they kill only specific species of bacteria or closely related bacteria. As such, we believe that lysins targeting gram-positive pathogens will not have negative effects on the beneficial, normal human GI microbiome in contrast to conventional broad spectrum antibiotics which can kill the bodys normal, beneficial bacteria. We believe that the potential therapeutic profile of lysins is complementary to that of conventional antibiotics. As such, our approach includes the use of lysins in addition to conventional antibiotics for the treatment of serious, drug-resistant bacterial infections, including biofilm-associated infections, in an effort to achieve greater efficacy and improve clinical outcomes, as well as potentially protect against antibiotic resistance. 
 We employ bioinformatics and a series of metagenomic-based techniques to identify and clone bacteriophage lysins from bacterial, viral, and environmental sources. The field of metagenomics is based on the bulk extraction of DNA/RNA from environmental samples (e.g., soil, water, etc.) without prior isolation of individual microbial sources. This is useful when one considers that less than 1% of microbes are culturable under standard laboratory conditions. Once extracted, the metagenomic DNA can then be examined using sequence-based methods or by proprietary functional screens. These functional screens for bacteriophage lysin activity form the major component of our lysin discovery work. Once cloned, our scientists also employ a variety of techniques to further optimize and engineer changes to the lysins to introduce specific characteristics which we believe may be favorable for potential therapeutic use. 
 For the functional metagenomic work that we perform, environmental genes are expressed in a recombinant format in a standard host organism (i.e., Escherichia coli) and cells are monitored for the acquisition of a desired phenotype. We can vary both the source of environmental DNA and the way we monitor for desired phenotypes to focus only on environmental populations enriched for bacteriophage lysins that can actively kill a pathogen of interest. We sample various DNA sources including viral, prophage, and pathogen-amplified viral metagenomics. Multiple methods for both DNA library construction and for functional screening are used in parallel in order to maximize lysin identification. 
 The application of these methods enables the large scale identification of lysins, enabling the production of lysin banks specific for any particular pathogen. We believe the ability to rapidly identify lysins specific for any pathogen of interest, either by in vitro or in silico methods, will provide a steady pipeline of novel lysins for consideration as potential antimicrobial therapeutic candidates. Using this methodology, we have discovered lysins targeting gram-negative pathogens as part of our proprietary discovery program. These lysins were further characterized with funding from CARB-X and will be further developed and tested in in vivo models as part of this program. 
 In addition to our proprietary lysin discovery program, we have an active collaborative research agreement through which we provide funding for the discovery of new lysins to Dr. Vincent Fischettis Laboratory of Bacterial Pathogenesis and Immunology at The Rockefeller University (Rockefeller). We have the first right to negotiate a license to all discoveries concerning lysins through October 2019. We hold worldwide exclusive license rights to patents for composition of matter for nine lysins from Rockefeller. Each lysin targets a specific species of gram-positive bacteria, including drug-sensitive and drug-resistant forms as shown in Table 3 below.

 The focus of our research and discovery efforts is on identifying lysins which selectively kill specific species of gram-negative bacteria that are considered to be urgent or serious threats to global health by the CDC or critical priorities by the WHO. Emerging strains of multi-drug resistant gram-negative pathogens that are resistant to all or nearly all available antibiotics are considered to be a major global health threat. We believe that lysins targeting gram-negative pathogens have the potential to be important therapeutics to combat antimicrobial resistance due to their novel mechanism of action and therapeutic profile, which is complementary to conventional antibiotics. 
 P. aeruginosa is the initial target of our gram-negative lysin discovery efforts. 
 P. aeruginosa is a gram-negative pathogen which is common in the environment and is an important and much-feared potential pathogen in hospitals. P. aeruginosa readily develops resistance to conventional antibiotics resulting in the emergence of multidrug resistant (MDR) strains, which have become common in some hospitals and regions. P. aeruginosa is a major cause of hospital-acquired infections and is a particularly important cause of infections in immunocompromised hosts, and is also a major pathogen in burn and surgical wound infections. P. aeruginosa is also the most common pathogen isolated from adults with cystic fibrosis, the most common cause of respiratory failure in cystic fibrosis and responsible for the deaths of the majority of these patients. 
 Invasive P. aeruginosa infections, including ventilator associated pneumonia, blood stream infections, complicated urinary tract infections, and infections following surgery carry some of the highest risks of mortality among hospital acquired infections. An estimated 51,000 healthcare-associated P. aeruginosa infections occur in the United States each year. More than 6,000 (13%) of these are multidrug-resistant, with roughly 400 deaths per year attributed to these infections. Infections caused by multidrug resistant P. aeruginosa are associated with high all-cause mortality, hospital mortality and higher health-care related costs compared to infections caused by susceptible strains.   The discovery and development of lysins that target P. aeruginosa is a focus of our research efforts. We developed a strategy for large scale cloning of lysins with potential specificity for the target pathogen. We then conducted functional screening in the context of both media and human serum to identify lysins with potent antimicrobial activity against P. aeruginosa, including resistant strains. For all highly active clones, additional modifications were introduced to generate second and third generation molecules for further in vitro screening. We have identified several lysins that in vitro exhibit the hallmark features which differentiate the lysin class, including rapid and potent bactericidal activity, synergy with a broad range of standard of care agents and the eradication of biofilms. 
 Based on the results of these assays and the additional data we continue to generate in vitro, our gram-negative lysins represent a potential new therapeutic class of bactericidal agents to combat resistant P. aeruginosa. In 2017, we were awarded a grant from CARB-X in support of this program. In January 2019, we announced an additional $2.3 million in the amount of funding to be received in further support of this effort as we move into in vivo models of disease to further characterize these candidates.

 Enterobacteriaceae 
 The Enterobacteriaceae family of gram-negative bacteria includes Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae), Enterobacter species (Enterobacter e.g. Enterobacter cloacae) and Escherichia coli (E. coli), all of which can cause serious, life-threatening infections, and have demonstrated concerning resistance patterns. 
 

 | K. pneumoniae are common causes of serious, potentially life-threatening invasive infections (e.g. pneumonia, complicated urinary tract, intra-abdominal infections) in hospital settings, particularly in intensive care units and among vulnerable patients with impaired immune systems, diabetes or alcohol-use disorders. The mortality rates for hospital-acquired pneumonia due to K. pneumoniae can exceed 50% in vulnerable patients.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Enterobacter cloacae can cause a wide range of invasive infections, and potentially contaminate intravenous fluids and medical devices as the source of deadly outbreaks in the hospital.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | E. coli is the most frequent cause of community and hospital acquired urinary tract infections and a frequent cause of bloodstream infection. Patients in hospitals, nursing homes, and other healthcare settings whose care requires devices like ventilators (breathing machines), urinary (bladder) catheters, or intravenous (vein) catheters, and patients who are taking long courses of certain antibiotics are most at risk for infection.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance among Enterobacteriaceae are recognized public health threats which complicate the treatment of serious nosocomial infections. 
 Enterobacteriaceae can produce enzymes (e.g., extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL)) that confer resistance to most beta-lactam antibiotics, including penicillins, cephalosporins, and the monobactam aztreonam. Infections with ESBL-producing organisms have been associated with poor outcomes. Approximately 20% of K. pneumoniae infections and 31% of Enterobacter infections in intensive care units in the United States now involve strains which are not susceptible to third-generation cephalosporins. Community and hospital-acquired ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae are prevalent worldwide, and their prevalence may be underestimated because reliable identification of ESBL-producing organisms in clinical laboratories can be challenging. 
 Carbapenem antibiotics are considered to be the best currently available antimicrobial agent to treat infections caused by ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae. However, resistance to carbapenems is becoming increasingly prevalent, and the resulting Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), have high levels of resistance to antibiotics. K. pneumoniae and E. coli are a normal part of the human gut bacteria that can become carbapenem-resistant due to enzymes that breakdown carbapenem antibiotics and make them ineffective. Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) and New Delhi Metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM) are two such enzymes that break down carbapenems and make them ineffective. Both of these enzymes have also been reported in P. aeruginosa. CRE infections typically occur in hospitals, nursing homes, and other healthcare settings. Patients who require devices like ventilators (breathing machines), urinary (bladder) catheters, or intravenous (vein) catheters, and/or patients who are taking long courses of certain antibiotics are most at risk for CRE infections. Some CRE bacteria have become resistant to most available antibiotics, are very difficult to treat, and can lead to death in up to 50% of patients who become infected. 
 We believe that lysins which target K. pneumoniae, Enterobacter and E. coli may be important therapeutic options for the treatment of serious, potentially life-threatening invasive infections caused by multidrug resistant pathogens. Because of the novel mechanism by which lysins kill bacterial, no cross resistance to conventional antibiotics, and as such, KPC, NDM and similar enzymes are not expected to have any effect on the activity of lysins. We believe that lysins may help to improve clinical outcomes of infections caused by these pathogens and thus we are also focusing research efforts to identify and develop lysins which target them. 
 Amurin Discovery Program 
 Amurin peptides are a class of novel, phage-derived lytic agents discovered in our laboratories. In preclinical studies, amurin peptides have shown some features common to lysins, including potent 
 
15 


  bacteriocidality, including antibiotic-resistant strains, the ability to clear biofilms and synergize with conventional antibiotics. However, amurin peptides are further differentiated in their potential ability to exert these actions on the full range of gram-negative ESKAPE pathogens, as well as a range of additional, serious and difficult to treat gram-negative bacteria, including Burkholdaria and Stenotrophomonas, in the context of human serum, without apparent off target effects against gram-negatives. As such, amurin peptides have shown a highly differentiated spectrum of action, and we believe, if successfully developed, would be extremely well suited as potential treatments for patients suffering from polymicrobial gram-negative infections, such as cystic fibrosis, ventilator-associated pneumonia, intra-abdominal infections, and serious burns or certain chronic wound infections. Given their powerful in vitro activity against a broad range of resistant pathogens, we believe that amurin peptides have the potential to become a powerful addition to our armamentarium against strains of gram-negative pathogens which have extreme- or pan- drug resistance to all or almost all currently available antibiotics. 
 We plan to progress our amurin peptide program as quickly as possible through preclinical profiling and into the clinic. We are currently evaluating the in vitro profiles of the amurins as we continue to advance the program. We recently announced an award from CARB-X of up to $6.9 million of funding to support the development of amurin peptides as potential therapeutics to treat serious and potentially life-threatening infections, including those caused by antibiotic-resistant gram-negative ESKAPE pathogens. 
 CF-404: An Antibody Approach for Influenza 
 We intend to develop CF-404, a combination of three human mAbs against influenza, as a potential treatment for seasonal and pandemic influenza infections, which kill as many as 49,000 people annually in the U.S. alone. Our preclinical studies to date have shown that CF-404 may have the following attributes: 
 

 | Broad activity against influenza in one formulation. CF-404 exhibits broad activity against influenza strains, including the three principal strains (H1, H3 and B). By targeting conserved regions on the virus, which are not subject to seasonal mutation, we believe that the efficacy of CF-404 will be robust from season to season. The unique triple mAb formulation, allows (1) our mAbs to neutralize many different influenza strains; (2) for a single therapeutic covering all human seasonal and most pandemic influenza strains; and (3) for an immediate therapeutic effect.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Minimal resistance potential. Our mAbs target the principal hemagglutinin stalk on the surface of influenza which is a genetically conserved region of the virus, and hence, does not vary from one season to another.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Novel inhaled delivery. We intend to develop CF-404 as an inhaled therapy. Inhaled therapy has demonstrated enhanced efficacy at lower doses than systemic administration in animal models. We believe that this delivery route will enable CF-404 to more directly target influenza potentially allowing for increased efficacy, even at low doses.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Preclinical studies 
 In preclinical studies, CF-404 was active against all seasonal strains of influenza, including the three principal strains (H1, H3 and B). These mAbs react with the principal protein, hemagglutinin, on the surface of influenza at a region referred to as the hemagglutinin stalk which is genetically stable and does not vary from one season to another. 
 We have tested our mAbs in standard mouse models which use weight changes to evaluate protection against lethal infection with different strains of influenza (H1N1, H3N2 or B). Control mice treated with buffer all succumbed to viral infection within 7-9 days. By contrast, when we administered a single treatment of CF-404 24 hours post-infection, the infected mice appeared healthy, with weight changes comparable to healthy mice. 
 We are developing CF-404 as an inhaled therapy. We believe that this novel delivery route allows CF-404 to target the influenza virus more directly where it resides, in the respiratory system. We have demonstrated efficacy in animal models even when using low doses of our antibodies administered in an aerosolized form. In 
 
16 


  our inhalation model, control mice treated with buffer all succumbed to viral infection within 10 days. By contrast, when we administered a single inhaled treatment of CF-404 over a range of low doses 24 hours post-infection, the infected mice were protected and fared better with increasing dose (up to 0.82mg/kg) as compared to the 5mg/kg with a systemic dose. 
 We are continuing to develop a formulation of CF-404 that would be suitable for human use. Our in vivo data has shown that our anti-H1 (CF-401), anti-H3 (CF-402) and anti-B (CF-403) mAbs have been able to protect animals from lethal challenge. Importantly, our studies also show that treatment with our mAbs appears to provide greatly enhanced potency compared to treatment with other mAbs. We believe our combination for the treatment of influenza is a novel approach addressing a high unmet medical need and would offer competitive advantages to the only product widely used on the market today if successfully developed and approved. 
 Intellectual Property 
 Our goal is to obtain, maintain and enforce patent protection for our products, formulations, processes, methods and other proprietary technologies, preserve our trade secrets, and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of other parties, both in the United States and in other countries. Our policy is to actively seek to obtain, where appropriate, the broadest intellectual property protection possible for our product candidates, proprietary information and proprietary technology through a combination of contractual arrangements and patents, both in the United States and abroad. However, patent protection may not afford us with complete protection against competitors who seek to circumvent our patents. 
 We also depend upon the skills, knowledge, experience and know-how of our management and research and development personnel, as well as that of our advisors, consultants and other contractors. To help protect our proprietary know-how, which is not patentable, and for inventions for which patents may be difficult to enforce, we currently rely and will in the future rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests. To this end, we will require all of our employees, consultants, and other contractors (including any consultants or contractors we may retain for purposes of any of our ad hoc Clinical Advisory Boards) to enter into confidentiality agreements that prohibit the disclosure of confidential information and, where applicable, require disclosure and assignment to us of the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions important to our business. 
 Our lysin portfolio consists of fifteen (15) U.S. patents, thirty-one (31) foreign patents and one hundred seventeen (117) U.S. and international patent applications that we have licensed from Rockefeller and/or developed in-house. These patents will expire between 2024 and 2033. The patents and patent applications are directed to compositions and methods for the treatment of infections caused by gram-positive bacteria (Group B Streptococci, Staph aureus, Streptococcus pneumonia, Bacillus anthracis (anthrax), Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium) and infections caused by gram-negative bacteria (P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae and E. coli). If patents are granted on our patent applications, which include the patent applications related to exebacase, CF-296 and the gram-negative lysins, they would expire between 2029 and 2039. 
 Our influenza patent portfolio consists of one (1) U.S. patent, eleven (11) foreign patents, and fifty-one (51) U.S. and foreign patent applications, which we have licensed from Trellis and/or developed in-house. The patent applications are directed to compositions relating to influenza antibodies as well as to pharmaceutical compositions for administration to patients and to methods for their use in conferring passive immunity against various influenza strains and clades. If patents are granted on these patent applications they would expire between 2031 and 2036. 
 The U.S. patent system permits the filing of provisional and non-provisional patent applications. A non-provisional patent application is examined by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), and can issue as a patent once the USPTO determines that the claimed invention meets the various standards for 
 
17 


  patentability. A provisional patent application is not examined or prosecuted, and automatically expires 12 months after its filing date if a non-provisional application is not filed based on the provisional application within that 12-month period. Provisional applications are often used, among other things, to establish a priority filing date for the subsequently filed non-provisional patent application. The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are filed. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest filing date of a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, a patents term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the USPTO in granting a patent. Alternatively, a patents term may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over another patent. 
 The term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension (PTE), which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, permits a PTE of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the PTE is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. Patent extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and certain other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our pharmaceutical product candidates receive FDA or other regulatory approval, we may be able to apply for or receive the benefit of PTEs on patents covering those products. 
 License AgreementsThe Rockefeller University 
 We have entered into the following license agreements with Rockefeller: 
 

 | On July 12, 2011, we entered into a license agreement for the worldwide, exclusive right to a provisional patent application, upon which a non-provisional patent application has since been filed, covering the composition of matter for the lysin PlySS2 for the treatment and prevention of diseases caused by gram-positive bacteria (the CF-301 License). We rebranded PlySS2 as CF-301 or exebacase. This license gives us the right to exclusively develop, make, have made, use, import, lease, sell and offer for sale products that would otherwise infringe a claim of this patent application or patent.

  of the first licensed product. Rockefeller may terminate any license agreement in the event of a breach of such agreement by us or if we challenge the validity or enforceability of the underlying patent rights. We may terminate any license agreement at any time on 60 days notice. 
 License AgreementTrellis Bioscience LLC 
 On January 29, 2014, we entered into a license agreement with Trellis that gives us exclusive rights to all Trellis mAbs in the field of influenza discovered from their CellSpot platform. Particularly, the license provides us with three fully human mAbs that bind, neutralize and protect animals from all strains of H1, H3 and B influenza, and that will also cross bind, neutralize and protect animals from other seasonal or pandemic influenza strains that may arise (including H5N1 and H7N9). We have selected our three lead mAbs for the H1, H3, and B influenzas and are currently producing these antibodies at scale using manufacturing-grade expression systems and performing IND-enabling studies. 
 In consideration for the license, we paid Trellis licensing fees in cash and stock and may be required to make specified development and regulatory milestone payments and make additional payments upon the achievement of future sales and a royalty on net sales from products to Trellis. We are allowed to grant sublicenses to third parties. The license agreement terminates upon the earlier of (i) our decision to terminate the agreement at will or for safety reasons, (ii) material breach by either party that is not cured within ninety (90) days, or (iii) either partys insolvency. 
 On August 14, 2014, we amended the license agreement to include research conducted pursuant to a government grant. 
 Collaborative Research AgreementsThe Rockefeller University 
 Beginning in October 2009, we entered into a research agreement with Rockefeller where we provided funding for research focused on producing and testing monoclonal antibodies against proteins of Staph aureus, which is now expired On October 24, 2011, we entered into a second research agreement with Rockefeller, where we provided funding for the research primarily to identify lysins, enzymes or small molecules that will kill gram-negative bacteria, and to identify and characterize lysins from Clostridia difficile to be engineered into gut commensal bacteria. This agreement expired on October 25, 2016. On October 25, 2016, we entered into a third research agreement with Rockefeller, where we provide funding for the identification of novel lysin therapeutic candidates that target gram-negative pathogens. The research collaboration will focus on gram-negative pathogens such as P. aeruginosa, E. coli, and K. pneumoniae, including antibiotic-resistant strains. 
 Our current agreement runs through October 24, 2019. Either party may terminate the agreement upon breach of the agreement, following 30 days written notice and failure to cure such breach. Following the expiration or termination of the agreement, each party will have a non-exclusive license to use for internal research purposes all research results, including joint intellectual property. If Rockefeller or joint intellectual property develops from these programs, we will have the right-of-first refusal to negotiate to acquire a royalty-bearing license to utilize such intellectual property for commercial purposes. 
 Competition 
 The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are intensely competitive. While we believe that our technology and scientific knowledge provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and academic and research organizations in developing therapies to treat diseases. 
 Exebacase is a potential first-in-class drug candidate and we believe it is the first lysin to enter human clinical trials in the U.S. We believe there is currently no clinical competitor to exebacase, which is highly 
 
19 


  differentiated from conventional antibiotics by at least six attributes that no single antibiotic possesses, including: (1) a novel mechanism of action, (2) specificity for a target bacteria (only Staph aureus), (3) rapid speed of action, (4) activity across all drug-sensitive and drug-resistant strains of the target bacteria (including MRSA, VRSA and DRSA), (5) the ability to eradicate biofilms, and (6) synergy with antibiotics. 
 Staph aureus bacteremia is typically treated with oxacillin or other semi-synthetic penicillin or first-generation cephalosporin, or for MRSA strains, daptomycin or vancomycin. We do not see market competition with these drugs, as our strategy is to administer exebacase in addition to these drugs with the goal of achieving clinical superiority over any one of those SOC antibiotics alone. We are aware of several other clinical trials currently being conducted or recently concluded in patients with Staph aureus bacteremia. Depending on the outcomes of those and future trials, exebacase may compete with products in development from Genentech, Inc., iNtRon Biotechnology, Inc., (iNtRon) and XBiotech, Inc. We believe that exebacase has demonstrated synergy in vitro with a broad range of anti-staphylococcal agents of different classes and we believe that exebacase will also be synergistic and non-competitive with newer conventional antibiotics in these classes. 
 We are not aware of any other lysins in clinical development under an IND in the United States. We believe iNtRon, a biotechnology company located in South Korea, is currently conducting a human clinical trial for SAL-200, an endolysin-based drug candidate to evaluate it as a treatment for Staph aureus bacteremia. Additionally, iNtRon recently announced a licensing arrangement with Roivant Sciences with a stated purpose to pursue the global development and commercialization of its endolysin products, including SAL-200. We will continue to monitor the advancement of SAL-200 as data and information become available. 
 CF-404 is intended for the treatment of potentially life-threatening seasonal and pandemic influenza infections. We believe CF-404 has competitive advantages in that it potentially addresses the short-comings of neuraminidase inhibitors and other products in development for the following reasons: (1) it may not be prone to drug-resistance due to targeting conserved regions of the influenza virus, (2) it may provide for an increased time-to-treat window compared to neuraminidase inhibitors, which are indicated to be used within 48 hours of symptom onset, and (3) it may provide complete coverage against all seasonal and most potential pandemic strains of human influenza without the need for annual reformulation, including influenza B. 
 CF-404 may directly or indirectly compete with other products already in development from F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd., Genentech, Inc., Johnson & Johnson, Inc., Theraclone Sciences, Inc., Toyama Chemical Co., Ltd., Romark Laboratories, L.C., Aviragen, Inc., Vectura Group plc, Far East Bio-Tec Co. Ltd, Visterra Inc., MedImmune LLC, Ansun Biopharma, Inc. and others with early stage product candidates. 
 Many of our competitors may have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved medicines than we do. We compete with companies that have products on the market or in development for the same indications as our product candidates. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. 
 The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize medicines that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any medicines that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their medicines more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.

 Manufacturing 
 We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical or clinical manufacturing, testing, as well as for commercial manufacture of any products that we may commercialize. We employ the services of Fujifilm UK to supply the drug substance for exebacase. We do not yet have contracts to produce a commercial supply of the drug substance for exebacase; however, we intend to pursue agreements with Fujifilm UK to do so. We employ the services of various vendors to produce exebacase in its final vialed drug product form. We do not have contracts for the commercial supply of exebacase. We intend to pursue agreements with third party manufacturers regarding commercial supply of vialed drug product at an appropriate future time. We may choose to locate second fill finish third party manufacturers to supply other world regions such as the European Union (the EU) or Asia. 
Sales, Marketing and Distribution 
 We do not currently have an organization for the sales, marketing and distribution of pharmaceutical products. We may rely on licensing and co-promotion agreements with strategic partners for the commercialization of our products in the United States and other territories. If we choose to build a commercial infrastructure to support marketing in the United States, such commercial infrastructure could be expected to include a targeted sales force supported by sales management, internal sales support, an internal marketing group and distribution support. To develop the appropriate commercial infrastructure internally, we would have to invest financial and management resources, some of which would have to be deployed prior to any confirmation that any of our other products will be approved. 
Research and Development Expenses 
 We have invested $22.4 million, $17.3 million, and $22.1 million in research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
 Government Regulation 
 The production, distribution, and marketing of products employing our research and intellectual property or that we may license from third parties are subject to extensive governmental regulation in the United States and in other countries. In the United States, our products will be regulated as biologics and subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended (the FDC Act), the Public Health Service Act, as amended (the PHSA) and the regulations of the FDA, as well as to other federal, state, and local statutes and regulations. These laws, and similar laws outside the United States, govern the research, development, clinical and preclinical testing, manufacture, safety, effectiveness, approval, labeling, distribution, sale, import, export, storage, record-keeping, reporting, advertising, and promotion and marketing of our products. Product development and approval within this regulatory framework, if successful, will require the expenditure of substantial resources and take years to achieve. Violations of regulatory requirements at any stage may result in various adverse consequences, including the FDAs and other health authorities delay in approving or refusal to approve a product and may result in enforcement actions and administrative or judicial sanctions. 
 The following provides further information on certain legal and regulatory requirements that have the potential to affect our operations and the future marketing of our products. 
 FDA Approval Process 
 In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The FDC Act and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-
 
21 


  approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. In addition to regulation under the FDC Act, biological products used for the prevention, treatment, or cure of a disease or condition of a human being are subject to regulation under provisions of the PHSA, and FDA reviews applications for approval of a biologic pursuant to a BLA. FDA review applications for approval of drug products pursuant to a new drug application (NDA). Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs or BLAs, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution. 
 Pharmaceutical product development for a new product or certain changes to an approved product in the United States typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product or disease. 
 Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including good laboratory practices. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. 
 A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin. 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug or biologic to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with good clinical practice (GCP) regulations meant to protect the rights and health of healthy volunteers or patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators, and monitors; as well as (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on healthy volunteers or patients in the U.S. and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. 
 The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The study protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an IRB for approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRBs requirements, or may impose other conditions. 
 Clinical trials to support NDAs or BLAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug or biologic into healthy human subjects or patients, the product is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, early evidence of effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug or biologic for a particular indication, dosage tolerance, and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety 
 
22 


  in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug or biologic and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. In most cases, the FDA typically requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug or biologic. A single Phase 3 trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in some instances where the study is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible. 
 After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA or BLA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA or BLA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The NDA or BLA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical, and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the products pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA or BLA is substantial. The submission of most NDAs and BLAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee. For fiscal year 2019, the application user fee is $2,588,478. The manufacturer and/or sponsor under an approved NDA or BLA are also subject to annual program user fees, currently set at $309,915 per program. These fees are typically adjusted annually. 
 The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA or BLA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agencys threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs and BLAs. The FDA aims to review applications for standard review drugs containing new molecular entities or original biologic products within ten months of the date the application was accepted for filing, and the goal is to review applications for priority review drugs or biologics in six months of the date the application was accepted for filing. Priority review can be applied to applications for drugs containing new molecular entities or biologics that are intended to treat a serious disease or condition and that, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by the FDA to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission. 
 The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug or biologic products, or drug or biologic products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committeetypically a panel that includes clinicians and other expertsfor review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with current good manufacturing practices (cGMPs) is satisfactory and the BLA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the proposed biologic is safe, pure and potent for its intended use, and has an acceptable purity profile. In the case of an NDA, whether the drug is safe and effective for its intended use. 
 After the FDA evaluates the NDA or BLA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDAs satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA or BLA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. 
 An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug or biologic with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA or BLA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS), to help ensure that the benefits of the drug or biologic outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and 
 
23 


  elements to assure safe use (ETASU). ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the products safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. 
 Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or BLA or NDA or BLA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA or BLA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA or BLA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs or BLAs. 
 Post-Approval Requirements 
 Once an NDA or BLA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs and biologics, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Drugs and biologics may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. 
 Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following FDA approval of an NDA or BLA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, REMS, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control, drug manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Drug and biologic manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered. 
 Fast Track Designation and Accelerated Approval 
 The FDA administers a number of programs to facilitate the development, and expedite the review, of drugs or biologics that are intended for the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions. For instance, a sponsor may seek the FDAs designation of its product candidate as a fast track product. Fast track products are those products intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. Drugs that qualify as a qualified infectious disease product, or QIDP, under the Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now, or GAIN Act, are also eligible for fast track designation. Biologics, such as lysins, are not currently eligible for QIDP designation. 
 Under the fast track program, the sponsor of a new drug or biologic candidate may request that the FDA designate the candidate for a specific indication as a fast track drug or biologic concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the candidate. The FDA must determine if the drug or biologic candidate qualifies for fast track designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsors request. If fast track designation is obtained, the FDA may initiate review of sections of the marketing application before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides and the FDA approves a schedule for the remaining information. However, the FDAs time period goal for reviewing an application does not begin until the last section of the NDA or BLA is submitted. Additionally, the fast track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA 
 
24 


  believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process. In addition, a product candidate that receives fast track designation is eligible for more frequent meetings with the FDA to discuss the products development plan and ensure collection of appropriate data needed to support approval and more frequent communications from FDA regarding such things as the design of the proposed clinical trials and use of biomarkers, as applicable. In August 2015, the FDA granted fast track designation to exebacase for the treatment of Staph aureus bacteremia, including endocarditis. 
 In some cases, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug or biological products intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may be eligible for accelerated approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. In clinical trials, a surrogate endpoint is a measurement of laboratory or clinical signs of a disease or condition that substitutes for a direct measurement of how a patient feels, functions, or survives. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. 
 A drug or biologic candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, will allow the FDA to withdraw the drug or biologic from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for drug candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA. Fast track designation, priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. 
 Guidance for Industry: Antibacterial Therapies for Patients With an Unmet Medical Need for the Treatment of Serious Bacterial Diseases  Potential for Streamlined Development 
 The FDA issued guidance for the industry in August 2017, which among other things, discusses the potential for antibacterial drug candidates intended to treat serious bacterial infections in patients who have few or no available therapies to be candidates for a streamlined development pathway. According to the guidance, candidates for a streamlined process would be likely to have (1) a new mechanism of action that preserves antibacterial activity against bacteria that have mechanisms of resistance to other available antibacterial drugs; (2) an added inhibitor that neutralizes a mechanism of resistance; (3) an alteration in the structure of the molecule that makes the drug candidate no longer susceptible to the mechanisms of resistance to existing drugs; or (4) some other characteristic that has a potential to lead to enhanced effectiveness. 
Draft Guidance for Industry: Limited Population Pathway for Antibacterial and Antifungal Drugs (LPAD) 
 As part of the 21st Century Cures Act of 2016, LPAD is intended to permit the approval of new antibiotics on the basis of relatively small clinical data sets studying patients with rare, serious, or life-threatening infections in whom large-scale trials would be infeasible. The FDA issued draft guidance for the industry regarding LPAD in June 2018 which defines the potential for antibacterial and antifungal drug candidates to be approved under a limited population development pathway. According to the draft guidance, candidates for this pathway are agents intended to treat a serious or life-threatening infection in a limited population with unmet needs, have substantial evidence of effectiveness for the drugs intended use and sufficient information to conclude that the drug is safe for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling which is expected to define the limited population for intended use. The FDAs determination of safety and effectiveness must reflect the benefit-risk profile of the antibiotic in the limited population and must take into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the infection the drug is intended to treat and the availability or lack of alternative treatments for that limited population. 
 
25 


 Breakthrough Therapy Designation 
 The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act established a category of drugs and biologics referred to as breakthrough therapies that may be eligible to receive breakthrough therapy designation. A sponsor may seek FDA designation of a product candidate as a breakthrough therapy if the product is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Under the breakthrough therapy program, the sponsor of a new drug candidate may request that the FDA designate the drug candidate for a specific indication as a breakthrough therapy concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the drug candidate. The designation includes all of the fast track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance. The breakthrough therapy designation is a distinct status from both accelerated approval and priority review, which can also be granted to the same drug if relevant criteria are met. If a product is designated as breakthrough therapy, the FDA will work to expedite the development and review of such drug. The FDA may also rescind breakthrough therapy designation for a product candidate if the FDA determines the product candidate no longer meets the criteria for breakthrough therapy designation. 
Pediatric Information 
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA), NDAs or BLAs or supplements to NDAs or BLAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. The FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. 
Additional Controls for Biologics 
 To help reduce the increased risk of the introduction of adventitious agents, the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing controls for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The PHSA also provides authority to the FDA to immediately suspend licenses in situations where there exists a danger to public health, to prepare or procure products in the event of shortages and critical public health needs, and to authorize the creation and enforcement of regulations to prevent the introduction or spread of communicable diseases in the United States and between states. 
 After a BLA is approved, the product may also be subject to official lot release as a condition of approval. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturers tests performed on the lot. The FDA may also perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products, such as viral vaccines, before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of biological products. As with drugs, after approval of biologics, manufacturers must address any safety issues that arise, are subject to recalls or a halt in manufacturing, and are subject to periodic inspection after approval. 
 Biosimilars 
 The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCIA), created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be highly similar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. Biosimilarity sufficient to reference a prior FDA-approved product requires that there be no 
 
26 


  differences in conditions of use, route of administration, dosage form, and strength, and no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency. Biosimilarity must be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and at least one clinical study, absent a waiver by the Secretary. A biosimilar product may be deemed interchangeable with a prior approved product if it meets the higher hurdle of demonstrating that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product and, for products administered multiple times, the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. To date, few biosimilars have been licensed under the BPCIA, and no interchangeable products have been approved under the BPCIA to date. Complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the process by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation which are still being evaluated by the FDA. 
 Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing that companys own preclinical and clinical data from adequate and well-controlled trials to demonstrate the safety, and efficacy of their product. The first biologic product submitted under the abbreviated approval pathway that is determined to be interchangeable with the reference product may also enjoy a period of exclusivity. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed interchangeable by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law. 
 Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information 
 Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including drugs, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed until the new product or new indication being studied has been approved. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs. 
Other Domestic Regulatory Requirements 
 In the United States, the research, manufacturing, distribution, sale, and promotion of drug and biological products are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state, and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, other divisions of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of the Inspector General), the United States Department of Justice and individual United States Attorneys offices within the Department of Justice, and state and local governments. For example, sales, marketing, and scientific/educational grant programs must comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the False Claims Act, the privacy and security provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and similar state laws, each as amended. Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, each as amended. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. All of these activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection, unfair competition, and other laws, and violations of these laws may result in imprisonment, criminal fines, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs.

 In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal laws have been applied to restrict certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry in recent years. These laws include anti-kickback statutes and false claims statutes. The federal healthcare program Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute are punishable by imprisonment, criminal fines, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. 
 Federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also violate false claims laws. The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback law and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. 
 HIPAA also created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. 
 There has also been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and other healthcare providers. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the Affordable Care Act, among other things, imposes new reporting requirements on drug manufacturers for payments made by them to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $165,786 per year (or up to an aggregate of $1,105,241 per year for knowing failures), for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately and completely reported in an annual submission. Drug manufacturers are required to submit reports to the government by the 90th day of each calendar year. Certain states also mandate implementation of compliance programs, impose restrictions on drug manufacturer marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians. 
 We may also be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, impose specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable 
 
28 


  health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAAs privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates, defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
 Moreover, ContraFect is now, and in the future may become, subject to additional federal, state, and local laws, regulations, and policies relating to safe working conditions, laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals, and/or the use, storage, handling, transportation, and disposal of human tissue, waste, and hazardous substances, including radioactive and toxic materials and infectious disease agents used in conjunction with our research work. 
 Physician Drug Samples 
 As part of the sales and marketing process, pharmaceutical companies frequently provide samples of approved drugs to physicians. The Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or the PDMA, imposes requirements and limitations upon the provision of drug samples to physicians, as well as prohibits states from licensing distributors of prescription drugs unless the state licensing program meets certain federal guidelines that include minimum standards for storage, handling and record keeping. In addition, the PDMA sets forth civil and criminal penalties for violations. 
New Legislation and Regulations 
 From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the testing, approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. In addition to new legislation, FDA regulations and policies are often revised or interpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative changes will be enacted or whether FDA regulations, guidance, policies or interpretations changed or what the effect of such changes, if any, may be. 
 For example, in December 2016, the 21st Century Cures act, or Cures Act, was signed into law. The Cures Act, among other things, is intended to modernize the regulation of drugs and biologics and spur innovation, but its ultimate implementation remains unclear. Among other things, the Cures Act provides a new limited population approval pathway for antibacterial and antifungal drugs intended to treat serious or life-threatening infections. 
 Foreign Regulation 
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we may become subject to widely varying foreign regulations, which may be quite different from those of the FDA, governing clinical trials, manufacture, product registration and approval, and pharmaceutical sales. Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, we must obtain a separate approval for a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries prior to the commencement of product marketing in these countries. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. In certain countries, regulatory authorities also establish pricing and reimbursement criteria. In addition, under current United States law, there are restrictions on the export of products not approved by the FDA, depending on the country involved and the status of the product in that country.

 European Medicines Agency (EMA)  Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) Designation 
 The SME designation was established by EMA to promote innovation and the development of new medicinal products by smaller companies. Companies with SME status are eligible to receive financial incentives as well as administrative and regulatory support through national and regional level programs. These benefits include access to dedicated EMA personnel during the clinical development process as well as reductions in fees associated with regulatory procedures such as Scientific Advice, Marketing Authorizations, and inspections. Companies with SME status are also eligible for early application (prior to proof of concept) to the priority medicines (PRIME) scheme. PRIME provides enhanced support for the development of medicines that target an unmet medical need. In August 2016, the EMA granted SME designation to ContraFect. We continue to meet the requirements for the designation and have maintained our SME status. 
Data Privacy and Security Laws 
 We are also subject to data privacy and security laws in jurisdictions outside of the U.S. For example, in the European Union (E.U.) and the European Economic Area (E.E.A.) we are subject to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation or GDPR) in relation to our collection, control, processing, sharing, disclosure and other use of personal data (i.e. data relating to an identifiable living individual). The GDPR is directly applicable in each E.U. and E.E.A. Member State, however, it provides that E.U. and E.E.A. Member States may introduce further conditions, including limitations, which could limit our ability to collect, control, process, share, disclose and otherwise use personal data (including health and medical information), and/or could cause our compliance costs to increase, ultimately having an adverse impact on our business. The GDPR imposes a strict data protection compliance regime including: providing detailed disclosures about how personal data is collected and processed (in a concise, intelligible and easily accessible form); demonstrating that valid consent or another an appropriate legal basis is in place or otherwise exists to justify data processing activities; appointing data protection officers in certain circumstances; granting new rights for data subjects in regard to their personal data (including the right to be forgotten and the right to data portability), as well as enhancing current rights (e.g., data subject access requests); introducing the obligation to notify data protection regulators or supervisory authorities (and in certain cases, affected individuals) of significant data breaches; imposing limitations on retention of personal data; maintaining a record of data processing; defining for the first time pseudonymized (i.e., key-coded) data; and complying with principal of accountability and complying with the obligation to demonstrate compliance through policies, procedures, training and audit. 
 We are also subject to E.U. rules with respect to cross-border transfers of personal data out of the E.U. and E.E.A. These rules are under scrutiny from time to time. For example, there is ongoing litigation challenging the EU Commission approved model clauses (also called standard contractual clauses), which is a commonly used transfer mechanism under the GDPR. It is uncertain whether the model clauses will be invalidated by the European courts. In addition, Brexit will mean that at some point that the United Kingdom (U.K.) will become a third party for the purposes of data transfers under the GDPR. 
 We depend on a number of third parties in relation to the operation of our business (including clinical research organizations), a number of which process personal data on our behalf. There is no assurance that our own privacy and security-related safeguards and/or any contractual measures that we enter into with these providers will protect us from the risks associated with the third-party processing, storage and transmission of such information. Any violation of data or security laws by our third party processors could have a material adverse effect on our business and result in the fines and penalties outlined below. 
 We are subject to the supervision of local data protection authorities in those E.U. and E.E.A. jurisdictions where we are established or otherwise subject to the GDPR. Fines for certain breaches of the GDPR are significant: up to the greater of EUR 20 million or 4% of total global annual turnover. In addition to the foregoing, a breach of the GDPR could result in regulatory investigations, reputational damage, orders to cease/ change our processing of our data, enforcement notices, assessment notices (for a compulsory audit), as well potential civil claims including class action type litigation where individuals suffer harm.

 We are also subject to evolving E.U. privacy laws on cookies, and e-marketing. The E.U. is in the process of replacing the e-Privacy Directive with a new set of rules taking the form of a regulation. The draft e-Privacy Regulation imposes strict opt-in marketing rules with limited exceptions for business-to-business communications, alters rules on third-party cookies, web beacons and similar technology and significantly increases fining powers to the same levels as the GDPR (i.e. the greater of 20 million Euros or 4% of total global annual revenue). While the e-Privacy Regulation was originally intended to be adopted on May 25 2018 (alongside the GDPR), it is still going through the European legislative process and commentators now expect it to be adopted during the second half of 2020 or during 2021 following a transition period. We are likely to be required to expend further capital and other resources to ensure compliance with these changing laws and regulations. 
 Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement 
 Our ability to commercialize our product candidates successfully will depend in part on the extent to which the United States and foreign governmental authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payors establish appropriate coverage and reimbursement levels for our product candidates and related treatments. In many of the markets where we would commercialize a product following regulatory approval, the prices of pharmaceutical products are subject to direct price controls (by law) and to drug reimbursement programs with varying price control mechanisms. Public and private health care payors control costs and influence drug pricing through a variety of mechanisms, including through negotiating discounts with the manufacturers and through the use of tiered formularies and other mechanisms that provide preferential access to certain drugs over others within a therapeutic class. Payors also set other criteria to govern the uses of a drug that will be deemed medically appropriate and therefore reimbursed or otherwise covered. In particular, many public and private health care payors limit reimbursement and coverage to the uses of a drug that are either approved by the FDA or that are supported by other appropriate evidence (for example, published medical literature) and appear in a recognized drug compendium. Drug compendia are publications that summarize the available medical evidence for particular drug products and identify which uses of a drug are supported or not supported by the available evidence, whether or not such uses have been approved by the FDA. 
Healthcare Reform 
 In the United States, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system in ways that could affect our future revenues and profitability and the future revenues and profitability of our potential customers. For example, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (the MMA) revised the payment methodologies for many drugs, which resulted in reduced reimbursement to providers. Additionally, the MMA created an outpatient prescription drug benefit which became effective on January 1, 2006. This benefit is administered by private pharmacy benefit managers and other managed care organizations and is putting increased pressure on the pharmaceutical industry to reduce prices. 
 In March 2010, the Affordable Care Act was passed, which substantially changes the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The Affordable Care Act, among other things, subjects biologic products to potential competition by lower-cost biosimilars, addresses a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, increases the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extends the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, establishes annual fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs, and a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturers outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D.

 The current presidential administration and U.S. Congress have attempted to repeal or repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. Although those efforts did not succeed, the presidential administration may continue to seek to modify, repeal, or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of, the Affordable Care Act. There is still uncertainty with respect to the impact the Presidents administration and the U.S. Congress may have, if any, on the Affordable Care Act, and any changes will likely take time to unfold. Additionally, since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. For example, on December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas, or Texas District Court Judge, ruled that the entire Affordable Care Act is invalid based primarily on the fact that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 repealed the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the Affordable Care Act, on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year, which is commonly referred to as the individual mandate. While the Texas District Court Judge, as well as the current presidential administration and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, have stated that this ruling will have no immediate effect, it is unclear how this decision and subsequent appeals will impact the law and the effect such impact could have on coverage and reimbursement for healthcare items and services covered by plans that were authorized by the Affordable Care Act. 
 In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011 among other things, resulted in aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Further, on January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Recently there has also been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted legislation designed to, among other things, reform government program reimbursement methodologies. For example, the Cures Act changes the reimbursement methodology for infusion drugs and biologics furnished through durable medical equipment in an attempt to remedy over- and underpayment of certain drugs. 
 If additional state and federal healthcare reform measures are adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, we could expect such measures to result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing pressures.
