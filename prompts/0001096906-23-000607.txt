ITEM 1. BUSINESS

Description of the Business of LFTD Partners Inc.

 LFTD Partners was organized under the laws of the State of Nevada on January 2, 1986. Shares of the Company’s common stock are traded on the OTCQB Venture Market under the trading symbol LIFD. 

On May 18, 2021, the Company changed its name to LFTD Partners Inc. from Acquired Sales Corp. On March 15, 2022, the Company changed its stock trading symbol to LIFD. 

After acquiring, operating and then selling businesses involved in the defense sector, our business is currently involved in the development, manufacture and sale of a wide variety of branded, hemp-derived, psychoactive and alternative lifestyle products. We are interested in acquiring rapidly growing, profitable companies that are also involved in the manufacture and sale of branded, hemp-derived, psychoactive and alternative lifestyle products (a “Canna-Infused Products Company”). 

Management of the Company is open-minded to the concept of also acquiring operating businesses and/or assets involving products containing marijuana, distilled spirits, beer, wine, and real estate. In addition, management of the Company is open-minded to the concept of acquiring all or a portion of one or more operating businesses and/or assets that are considered to be “essential” businesses which are unlikely to be shut down by the government during pandemics such as COVID-19. 

On February 24, 2020, we acquired 100% of the ownership interests in one Canna-Infused Products Company called Lifted Liquids, Inc. d/b/a Lifted Made (formerly Warrender Enterprise Inc. d/b/a Lifted Liquids) (www.Urb.shop), Kenosha, Wisconsin (“Lifted Made” or “Lifted”).

On April 30, 2019, we also closed on the acquisition of 4.99% of the common stock of each of CBD-infused beverages maker Ablis Holding Company (“Ablis”) (www.AblisCBD.com), and of distilled spirits manufacturers Bendistillery Inc. (“Bendistillery”) and Bend Spirits, Inc. (“Bend Spirits”), all located in Bend, Oregon.

Obligation to Purchase Headquarters Building

Toward the end of 2020, our Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer Nicholas S. Warrender (“NWarrender”), through his assigned entity 95th Holdings, LLC (“Holdings”), purchased a building located at 5511 95th Avenue in Kenosha, Wisconsin (“5511 Building”) that was immediately leased to us to conduct our expanded operations. The 5511 Building includes office, laboratory and warehouse space. As part of the lease agreement with Holdings, the parties agreed that our wholly owned subsidiary Lifted would eventually purchase the 5511 Building. The purchase price for the 5511 Building was originally subject to valuation based on a formula agreed upon by the parties. Pursuant to an agreement with NWarrender on December 30, 2021, the parties agreed to set the purchase price for the 5511 Building at $1,375,000. Prior to the Acceleration Agreement, Lifted had an obligation to complete the purchase of the 5511 Building on or before December 31, 2022. Pursuant to the Acceleration Agreement, the deadline to purchase the 5511 Building has been extended by one year to December 31, 2023. In addition, the Acceleration Agreement contains a provision that if we raise $5,000,000 of debt or equity capital, then Lifted or our designee shall purchase the 5511 Building from Holdings at the agreed upon $1,375,000 purchase price within two days.

The Lifted Made Business

History 

Our wholly owned subsidiary Lifted was originally incorporated in the state of Wisconsin on September 19, 2014. Lifted was created with a passion to build a culture-based organization focused upon quality products and a healthier lifestyle. 
Products

Under its flagship brands Urb Finest Flowers and Silly Shruum, Lifted manufactures and sells branded hemp-derived products, and other psychoactive and alternative lifestyle products. Lifted may in the future sell nicotine products.

Lifted also manufactures and sells similar hemp-derived products to private label clients. Lifted sells its brands of products and its private label clients’ products online primarily through its website: www.Urb.shop, which replaced www.LiftedMade.com. 

During 2022, Lifted began manufacturing gummies in-house, both for its Urb Finest Flowers brand and for third party customers. Lifted plans to substantially increase its gummy manufacturing in-house. In the fourth quarter of 2022, Lifted purchased a second gummy manufacturing machine from an auction house for $155,000, and anticipated using that machine to manufacture additional gummies in additional space leased by Lifted starting on February 1, 2023. However, this second gummy manufacturing machine is inoperable. The parties are attempting to negotiate a resolution. Unless it is resolved to Lifted’s satisfaction, Lifted expects to file a lawsuit against the auction house. Lifted has purchased a third gummy manufacturing machine, and expects that this third gummy manufacturing machine will be delivered to Lifted some time during second quarter of 2023. It is anticipated that this third gummy manufacturing machine will be producing gummies in either the second or third quarter of 2023.

Officers and Employees

The executives of Lifted have backgrounds in the vaping industry, sales, graphic design, distribution, marketing, accounting, and supply chain management, skills that have helped Lifted distinguish itself from the competition. 

As of March 15, 2023, Lifted has approximately 170 full time and part time employees and independent contractors who are engaged in product formulation, design and branding, website development, private label client management, sales, strategy, distribution, supply chain management, new business development, warehouse management and order fulfillment, operations management, accounting, new product development, trade shows and evaluation of potential acquisitions and joint ventures. Currently, most of Lifted’s employees and independent contractors are based in Kenosha, Wisconsin, and the rest are located in Chicago, Illinois, and Florida. 

Cali Sweets Agreement


On January 11, 2023, Lifted entered into a Manufacturing Sales and Marketing Agreement (“Agreement”) with Cali Sweets, LLC (“Cali”). Cali is headquartered in North Hollywood, California, and currently sells products under the brand name Koko Nuggz. The Agreement entitles Lifted to be the exclusive worldwide manufacturer and distributor of Cali’s disposable vape products (under the brand name Koko Puffz) and gummy products (under the brand name Koko Gummiez). Pursuant to the Agreement, Lifted will manufacture, market, and distribute certain Cali products and brands worldwide. Lifted and Cali will equally share certain production and marketing costs associated with such products on a dollar-for-dollar basis. Revenue from the sale of such Cali products will be divided on a 60/40 basis, net of any returns, discounts, or replacements, with 60% allocated to Lifted, and the remaining 40% to Cali. Under the terms of the Agreement, Lifted will have the right, in its discretion, to add new Cali brands and products as they are developed. Lifted can also set prices for Cali products it supplies or unilaterally discontinue the supply of any Cali product if it no longer makes business sense to Lifted. The parties also agreed that Cali will provide social media marketing services for both Cali products and brands, and for Lifted’s Urb Finest Flowers branded products. The term of the Agreement is five years and may be extended with the mutual consent of the parties. However, after the initial 24 months, the Agreement may be terminated by either party, for any or no reason, upon providing the other party with 180 days written notice. Cali may become subject to early exit payments to Lifted if it early terminates. The exit fee formula is based on estimated profits that Lifted may have enjoyed had Cali not early terminated the relationship. Settlement With Vape Device Manufacturer On December 30, 2022, Lifted was able to reach an agreement for the forgiveness of $630,000 of payables owed to its third-party disposable vape device manufacturer. The agreement also includes credits to Lifted against future purchases from the device manufacturer totaling $370,047. The credit is to be provided by the manufacturer at the rate of $46,255.87 per quarter beginning with the first quarter of 2023 and continuing for the next six consecutive quarters, with a final quarterly credit of $46,255.91 for the fourth quarter of 2024. The agreement is a result of the vape manufacturer agreeing to share a portion of the Company’s prior $2,313,902 write-off of certain 2 mL disposable vapes that were written off due to clogging issues. The payable forgiveness resulted in a net $485,496 improvement to the cost of goods sold and accrued liabilities sections of the Company’s consolidated statements of operations as of December 30, 2022. The $370,047 in credits are booked as an asset as of December 30, 2022 and recognized as other income amortized quarterly at the rate of $46,255.87 per quarter beginning with the first quarter of 2023 and continuing for the next six consecutive quarters, with a final quarterly credit of $46,255.91 for the fourth quarter of 2024.

Sources of Supply

Lifted sources its raw goods from many different suppliers. Lifted’s raw goods are third-party lab tested, and Lifted’s finished goods are also third also third-party lab tested. Lifted does not grow or manufacture its raw goods, nor does Lifted process or extract cannabinoids or other substances from raw goods. However, many of Lifted’s finished goods are made in-house using the raw goods purchased from third party vendors. Some finished goods are purchased from third party vendors, which make products for Lifted in accordance with Lifted’s specifications. Lifted designs the majority of its packaging in-house, and typically employs a third party firm to manufacture that packaging. 

Lifted currently believes that it would be able to find replacement manufacturers with minimal negative impact on its business. However, Lifted’s vape pens and cartridges are sourced exclusively from China. COVID-19 and variants, Chinese holidays, backups at U.S. ports, tariffs imposed on products sourced from China, and potential hostilities involving China, could make it difficult or impossible to source these products cost effectively, or at all, from China. These risks associated with China could drastically increase Lifted’s product costs, all of which could have a serious detrimental impact on Lifted’s sales and profit margins. 

Product Risks

Lifted’s products contain hemp-derived cannabinoids and other psychoactive substances. There is a risk that Lifted could be targeted by regulators or consumers with claims that its products are unsafe. Potential product safety risks, and potential laws and regulations including but not limited to any issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) could have a material adverse effect on Lifted’s financial condition, operating results, liquidity, cash flow and operational performance.
Intellectual Property

Lifted maintains proprietary formulations, other trade secrets, and custom molds for its disposable vapes. Lifted also uses proprietary packaging for its products. Lifted does not currently own any registered patents, but it has applied for one patent and plans to apply for a second patent, both related to packaging.
Trademarks

Lifted has a registered trademark for its “Off-Spectrum” line of products. Lifted has applied for other trademarks, as well.

Research and Development Expenditures

Lifted’s research and development (“R&D”) expenditures consist primarily of compensation and related costs for third parties responsible for the R&D of new products. Research and development costs are expensed as they are incurred. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company reported R&D expenditures of $25,636. During 2022, Lifted for the first time hired an outside laboratory to conduct research and development on a potential new, non-hemp-derived, synthetic psychedelic product (the “New Psychedelic Product”) for a total of $19,800. Such research and development of the New Psychedelic Product has been put on indefinite hold. Lifted has recently successfully purchased from third parties a natural equivalent of the New Psychedelic Product. No guarantee or assurance can be given that in the future Lifted will be able to purchase more of this natural equivalent of the New Psychedelic Product, or a synthesized version thereof. In comparison, during the year ended December 31, 2021, and during the 2020 Stub Year, the Company did not report any R&D expenditures.
Marketing 

Lifted markets itself by networking throughout the industry through word of mouth, through its website, and by attending trade shows. In the past, Lifted has also engaged public relations and search engine optimization firms to improve Lifted’s public relations and search engine optimization efforts. There can be no guarantee or assurance that Lifted’s marketing efforts will be successful or result in any additional sales or profits for Lifted. 
Distribution

Lifted’s distribution is done internally and through third party distributors who distribute throughout the U.S. Lifted has also begun selling its products overseas. Lifted and these distributors distribute Lifted’s products to vape and smoke shops, convenience stores, grocery stores, gyms, natural food stores, wellness stores, and other locations. Lifted believes but cannot guarantee that in the event that Lifted lost its relationship with one or more of its current distributors, that other replacement distributors could be found without significant disruption to Lifted’s business.

Costs and effects of compliance with environmental laws

To Lifted’s knowledge, Lifted does not currently use or generate any hazardous materials in its operations.

OLCC Review of New Directors of the Company

Due to our minority ownership interest in Bendistillery and Bend Spirits, the Oregon Liquor Control Commission (“OLCC”) has jurisdiction over our directors, officers and significant shareholders. If the OLCC were to refuse to approve any of our directors, officers or significant shareholders, it could disrupt our management and corporate governance, which could materially adversely affect our Company and the trading price of our common stock.

Description of Certain Key Provisions of the Transaction Documents Relating to the Lifted Merger Agreement

Registration Rights Agreement

In connection with the Merger, the Company signed a Registration Rights Agreement granting NWarrender, or his assigns, “piggyback” and “demand” registration rights in regard to any and all Company registration statements filed with the SEC on or prior to a termination date set out in the agreement, in order to permit the registration of all 3,900,455 shares of Common Stock issued to NWarrender as Stock Consideration in the Merger (“Registrable Shares”). The Registration Rights Agreement can be summarized as follows:

Subject to certain limitations, NWarrender, or his assigns, may demand registration of all or any portion of the Registrable Shares at any time beginning on the 120th day following the closing of the Merger Agreement. The Company must then file a registration statement within ten days. The Company may postpone for up to 180 days the filing or effectiveness of a registration statement for a demand registration if the board of directors determines in its reasonable good faith judgment that such demand registration would (i) materially interfere with a significant acquisition, corporate organization, financing, securities offering or other similar transaction involving the Company; (ii) require premature disclosure of material information that the Company has a bona fide business purpose for preserving as confidential; or (iii) render the Company unable to comply with requirements under the Securities Act or Exchange Act. The Company may delay a demand registration hereunder only once in any period of 12 consecutive months.

No demand registration shall be required where in the judgment of the Company, its legal counsel, and/or SEC guidance and comments the registration would be deemed a primary offering pursuant to Securities Act Rule 415, which is interpreted by the SEC staff to prohibit registrations of stock for resale where the seller is deemed to be engaged in a primary offering of behalf of the issuer. The registration rights agreement shall terminate when no Registrable Shares remain outstanding.

Repayment of Merger Related Promissory Note

On February 24, 2020, we acquired Lifted as a wholly-owned subsidiary for cash and stock paid to Lifted’s then owner NWarrender. The $7,500,000 money component of the purchase consideration was paid to NWarrender in the form of $3,750,000 in cash at closing and a $3,750,000 promissory note that accrued interest at the rate of 2% per annum (“$3.75M Note”). 

The $3.75M Note was secured by (a) a first lien security interest in all of the assets of the Company and Lifted; and (b) a pledge of: (i) all of the capital stock of Lifted; (ii) all of the common stock of Bendistillery, Bend Spirits and Ablis that is owned by the Company; and (iii) all of the capital stock of any other entity owned by the Company, Lifted or any of their subsidiaries, pursuant to a Collateral Stock Pledge Agreement between NWarrender, as Secured Party, and the Company and Lifted, as Pledgors.

On December 30, 2021, the Company repaid all principal and interest due under the $3.75M Note.

NWarrender kept $1,000,000 of the repayment of the $3.75M Note, plus accrued interest, and on January 3, 2022, reloaned $2,750,000 to LIFD and Lifted (collectively “Payors”) at the rate of 2.5% (the “$2.75M Note”). The $2.75M Note payable jointly by the Company and Lifted to NWarrender was secured by a perfected first lien security interest (the “Security Interest”) that encumbers all of the assets of the Company and Lifted. The Company was obligated to pay off the principal of the $2.75M Note in five semi-annual payments to NWarrender of $458,333 and a sixth and final semi-annual payment to NWarrender of $458,335, in each case plus accrued interest, starting on June 30, 2022.

On June 7, 2022, LFTD Partners prepaid $916,666 of the principal of the $2.75M Note, and $29,384 of related accrued interest through that date, which left $1,833,334 remaining principal on the $2.75M Note. On July 5, 2022, we entered into an agreement (“Acceleration Agreement”) with NWarrender. Under the terms of the Acceleration Agreement, we were obligated to repay the remaining principal balance as follows: $1,374,999 on or before December 31, 2022, and $458,335 on or before December 31, 2024. Then, on July 8, 2022, we prepaid $916,666, along with accrued interest, and then, on July 25, 2022, we prepaid the remaining principal balance of $916,668 and accrued interest in full, and all collateral securing the $2.75M Note was released.

Stockholders Agreement

At the closing of the Merger Agreement, NWarrender, GJacobs, and WJacobs entered into a Stockholders Agreement which can be summarized as follows: each of them will vote all shares of our common stock now or hereafter owned or controlled by him as unanimously agreed upon by all three of them, including as to the following matters: election, removal and filling vacancies on our board of directors; our charter and bylaws; employment agreements, consulting agreements, fee agreements, base salaries, bonuses, management bonus pools amounts and calculations, management bonus pool allocations and payments, future stock options or warrants issuances, and any other direct or indirect compensation or benefits of any nature whatsoever; acquisitions; divestitures; and capital raises.
Executive Employment Agreements

At the closing of the Merger, the Company entered into employment agreements with NWarrender to serve as Co-Founder, Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer of the Company and as Chief Executive Officer of Lifted, with GJacobs to serve as Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Secretary of the Company, and with WJacobs to serve as President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer of the Company (collectively the “Executive Employment Agreements”), which can be summarized as follows:

Each of the Executive Employment Agreements is a “rolling” five year employment agreement wherein the executive’s employment is effective and shall continue until the fifth anniversary of the commencement of such Executive Employment Agreement, unless terminated. Each of the Executive Employment Agreements shall be deemed to be automatically extended, upon the same terms and conditions, for additional periods of one year (extending the term of such Executive Employment Agreement to five years after each such extension date), unless either party provides written notice of such party’s intention not to extend the term of such Executive Employment Agreement at least 90 days’ prior to the applicable extension date.

During the employment term, each executive shall devote substantially all of his business time and attention to the performance of his duties under his Executive Employment Agreement and shall not engage in any other business, profession or occupation for compensation or otherwise which would conflict or interfere with the performance of such services either directly or indirectly without the prior written consent of the board of directors of the Company; provided, that such executive shall be permitted to continue to participate as an officer of any corporation that owns real estate as of the date of his Executive Employment Agreement with the Company and that is owned by a family trust of which such executive is a grantor or beneficiary, and provided further that such executive, with the prior written consent of the board of directors of the Company shall be permitted to act as a director, trustee, committee member or principal of any type of business, civic or charitable organization and to purchase or own less than 5% of the publicly traded securities of any corporation provided, however, that such ownership represents a passive investment and that such executive is not a controlling person of, or a member of a group that controls, such corporation, and that such activities do not interfere with the performance of such executive’s duties and responsibilities to the Company.

Pursuant to an Omnibus Agreement, commencing January 1, 2022, the Base Salary under each of the Executive Employment Agreements to be paid to GJacobs, WJacobs and NWarrender is $250,000 per year. Prior to entering into the Omnibus Agreement, the annual rate of each executive’s base salary under his Executive Employment Agreement was $100,000.

Each executive shall participate in the Company’s annual company-wide management bonus pool, which can be generally described as a cash set-aside for management bonuses of an amount equal to 33% of the amount (if any) by which the Company’s actual annual consolidated EBITDA exceeds an annual consolidated EBITDA target amount that is mutually agreed upon between the Chairman of the Compensation Committee of the board of directors, on the one hand, and NWarrender, GJacobs and WJacobs, on the other hand, with the allocation of such management bonus pool to be determined by unanimous written agreement of such three executives. Pursuant to an Amended Omnibus Agreement, the 2022 company-wide bonus pool shall not be allowed to be accrued or paid by LIFD if and to the extent that doing so would decrease LIFD’s 2022 diluted earnings per share of common stock below $0.56 per share.

Please read the below section “Allocation and Payment of Bonus Pool” for more information about the company-wide bonus pools for 2022 and 2021.

The Company provides to each executive an employee benefits package including fully paid Blue Cross/Blue Shield or equivalent family health, vision and dental insurance, without deductibles. The Company also provides to each executive prompt reimbursement for all documented business-related expenses paid or incurred by such executive in connection with the Company, including but not limited to airfare, rail, taxi, rental cars, parking, tolls, gasoline for business trips, meals, entertainment, hotel, office supplies, mobile phone, internet, hotspot, and postage expenses.

Each executive’s employment may be terminated by either the Company or such executive at any time and for any reason, provided that any termination of such executive’s employment by the Company without cause will trigger significant payment obligations by the Company to such executive. 

Impact of the Merger on GJacobs’ and WJacobs’ Compensation Agreement

The Company entered into a Compensation Agreement dated as of June 19, 2019, with GJacobs and WJacobs. The material terms of the Compensation Agreement, as amended on December 1, 2020, but prior to the Omnibus Agreement and the Amended Omnibus Agreement, can be summarized as follows:

(1) Starting during June 2019 until the closing of the Lifted Merger on February 24, 2020, we paid GJacobs and WJacobs consulting fees of $7,500 and $5,000 per month, respectively. Upon the closing of the Lifted Merger, we entered into Executive Employment Agreements with GJacobs and WJacobs as described in the section above entitled “Executive Employment Agreements”;

(2) The closing of the Lifted Merger triggered obligations of the Company to pay cash bonuses to the Company’s CEO GJacobs and to the Company’s President and CFO WJacobs of $250,000 and $100,000, respectively, of which as of December 31, 2021 only $50,000 had been paid to GJacobs, and which accrued 2% annual interest on and after January 1, 2021, and of which $8,439 of the bonuses due and payable by the Company to GJacobs were allocated and applied to pay for the aggregate cost of GJacobs’ purchasing and exercising certain warrants on August 30, 2021 (see section below titled “Exercise of Warrants by Gerard M. Jacobs”);

(3) Upon demand by GJacobs and WJacobs on or after January 1, 2021, or the first date when we have raised a total of at least $15 million after January 1, 2019, we were obligated to pay GJacobs and WJacobs cash bonuses of $250,000 and $100,000, respectively, plus 2% annual interest accruing on and after January 1, 2021;

(4) Upon the earlier of December 1, 2021, or the first date when we have raised a total of at least $25 million after January 1, 2019, we were obligated to pay GJacobs and WJacobs cash bonuses of $250,000 and $100,000, respectively;

(5) The terms of GJacobs’ stock options granted by us to purchase shares of common stock of the Company which were set to expire (unless previously exercised) during November 2020 or during September 2021, respectively, have been extended so that all of such stock options may be exercised by GJacobs at any time on or before December 31, 2024;

(6) We granted to GJacobs and to WJacobs so-called “tag along” registration rights for all of our shares owned by GJacobs, by WJacobs, or by any of their respective affiliates, and for all of our shares issuable to GJacobs, to WJacobs, or to any of their respective affiliates upon the exercise of his or their options or warrants to purchase shares of common stock of the Company; and

(7) We issued to GJacobs and WJacobs five-year warrants containing a “cashless exercise” feature giving GJacobs and WJacobs (or his designee(s)) the right to purchase 250,000 and 225,000 shares, respectively, of common stock of the Company exercisable at $5.00 per share. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Currently, the Company’s only wholly-owned subsidiary, Lifted, is generating enough free cash flow to allow the Company and Lifted to fund their operations at their current levels and to grow Lifted’s business in a conservative, capital-constrained fashion. However, no guarantee or assurance can be given that Lifted’s current level of free cash flow will continue in the future, especially in light of the continuing COVID-19 pandemic, and U.S. federal, state and local laws, regulations and executive orders that are associated with the pandemic or that otherwise negatively impact the Company’s sales of its products.

The Company and Lifted have aspirations to grow significantly faster than at their current levels, both organically and via acquisitions. But, to do so likely would require the Company to raise many millions of dollars of additional capital. 

Currently, management of the Company is reluctant to raise capital by selling equity securities of the Company (common stock and/or convertible preferred stock) at the current trading price per share of the Company’s common stock or any lower price per share.

Even if the Company is able to raise additional capital via borrowing or the sale of equity securities of the Company: (1) Lifted is obligated to purchase the building leased by Lifted from Holdings, an affiliate of NWarrender, on or before December 31, 2023, for a fixed purchase price equal to $1,375,000; (2) the Company is accruing and paying 3% annual dividends on its Series A and Series B Convertible Preferred Stock; and (3) the Company is accruing for a company-wide bonus pool. Additional capital raised by the Company that is used to pay the aforedescribed company-wide bonus pool, or that is used to buy the building leased by Lifted from Holdings, or that is used to pay dividends on our outstanding Series A and Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, is collectively referred to as the “Allocated Capital”.

If, notwithstanding these impediments, the Company and/or Lifted is able to raise debt or equity capital that is in addition to the Allocated Capital (the “Growth Capital”), then the Growth Capital would likely be used in connection with one or more of the following: (1) stock buybacks; (2) an expansion of the building leased by Lifted from Holdings; or (3) for potential acquisitions. 

While the Company would prefer to engage in 100% stock-for-stock acquisitions, potential acquisition candidates frequently prefer that a significant portion of the acquisition consideration be in cash. Also, the process of conducting a due diligence investigation and audit of potential acquisition candidates can be very expensive and requires cash. Also, some potential acquisitions may only make sense if the Company is in a position to inject cash into the potential acquisition candidates simultaneously with the closing of the acquisitions, in order to pay off accrued liabilities or to provide needed growth capital.

There is no assurance that the Company and Lifted will be able to obtain the additional Growth Capital needed to accelerate our growth beyond current levels. Our ability to obtain Growth Capital will depend on the level of pandemic-related stress on Lifted’s distributors and customers, governmental prohibitions and regulations of hemp-derived cannabinoids such as delta-8-THC, investor demand, our performance and reputation, the price of the Company’s common stock, and other factors beyond our control. 

Our inability to raise additional Growth Capital could result in the delay or indefinite postponement of our growth objectives.

There can be no assurance or guarantee that any additional Growth Capital will be available on acceptable terms and conditions, if at all. The lack of availability of additional Growth Capital could have a material adverse effect on our Company and the trading price of our common stock.

The Market

Delta-8-THC and other cannabinoids can be derived from hemp. On December 20, 2018, President Donald J. Trump signed the Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018, which is more commonly known as the “2018 Farm Bill”. The 2018 Farm Bill legalizes hemp cultivation and declassifies hemp as a Schedule I controlled substance. The US Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) has stated that although hemp is no longer an illegal substance under federal law, the FDA continues to regulate cannabis products under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FD&C Act”) and Section 351 of the Public Health Service Act. In addition, several states have enacted laws and regulations that negatively impact the sale of hemp and hemp-derived products, especially hemp-derived products containing delta-8-THC.

The market for psychoactive products is growing, and during 2022 Lifted began selling various products in this category. Many of these types of products that Lifted sells do not contain any hemp derivatives (such as THC). 

Lifted’s product sales are typically made through distributors, with a limited but growing number of sales online or direct to retail outlets. 

Government Laws and Regulations

Lifted primarily sells hemp-derived products, including products containing delta-8-THC and other cannabinoids. Lifted also sells other psychoactive products, and may in the future sell nicotine products. Lifted is attempting to only conduct business to the extent permitted under applicable laws and regulations. 

While Lifted is optimistic regarding the future of its business selling hemp-derived products and psychoactive products, and potentially products that contain nicotine, the manufacture and sale of these products involve significant risks associated with federal, state and local laws and regulations, and regulatory agencies, that have the potential to bankrupt Lifted and the Company, or at least to negatively impact the trading price of our common stock.

In regard to the sale of hemp-derived products in the United States, despite cannabis having been legalized at the state level for medical use in many states and for adult recreational use in a number of states, cannabis, other than plants of the same genus that meet the definition of industrial hemp, continues to be categorized as a Schedule I controlled substance under the federal Controlled Substances Act (“CSA”), and subject to the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act (“CSIEA”). As of December 20, 2018, the 2018 Farm Bill, formally known as the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (the “Farm Bill”), has reclassified hemp for commercial use by removing it from its Schedule I Status under the CSA, and Lifted seeks to operate in compliance with the legislation. However:

(a) FDA: The US Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) has stated that although hemp is no longer an illegal substance under the Farm Bill, the FDA continues to regulate cannabis products under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FD&C Act”) and Section 351 of the Public Health Service Act. The health and safety impacts of delta-8-THC  and other cannabinoids have not yet been established via traditional scientific and/or clinical studies. The FDA appears to believe that CBD, delta-8-THC and other hemp-derived cannabinoids may or could have significant adverse health impacts upon human beings, especially in regard to potential liver toxicity or liver damage. Furthermore, the FDA sometimes appears to believe that certain cannabinoids are drugs, and that the sale of certain cannabinoid-infused products without FDA approval is illegal. In deference to the FDA’s position, various states and municipalities have similarly declared that the sale of certain hemp-derived cannabinoid-infused products such as delta-8-THC is illegal, or have imposed restrictions or prohibitions upon the sale of certain hemp-derived products. The FDA may in the future impose significant licensing or other requirements, regulations, restrictions and/or prohibitions on the sale of hemp-derived products, which could have a material adverse effect upon Lifted’s business and the trading price of our common stock;

(b) DEA: The US Drug Enforcement Agency (“DEA”) has stated that although hemp is no longer an illegal substance under the Farm Bill, the FDA continues to pursue Schedule I controlled substances as well as certain synthetic substances. In particular: 

(i) Hemp and hemp-derived cannabinoid-infused products which exceed a delta-9-THC concentration of 0.3% by dry weight are illegal under the Farm Bill. Any failure to keep the delta-9-THC concentration in Lifted’s hemp-derived or cannabinoid-infused products below 0.3% by dry weight could subject us to action by the DEA or other regulatory authorities and/or to lawsuits by consumers, which could have a material adverse effect upon our Company’s business and the trading price of our common stock. In addition, certain hemp-derived products may, over time, gradually increase their delta-9-THC concentration, and this may ultimately cause such products to exceed the 0.3% delta-9-THC by dry weight concentration level, making such products illegal in certain jurisdictions. If this happens, we could be subject to regulatory action that could have a material adverse effect upon our Company and the trading price of our common stock. In addition, the approval of medical and recreational marijuana by many states has created a situation in which it may be difficult or impossible for regulators and courts to determine whether the THC levels reflected in consumers’ blood tests are the result of legal hemp-derived products or marijuana-infused products. This may result in regulatory actions or lawsuits against the Company; 

(ii) The DEA has issued a statement that some have interpreted as making hemp-derived delta-8-THC illegal. In deference to the DEA, certain state and local governments have imposed restrictions or prohibitions upon the sale of certain products containing delta-8-THC. Lifted sells significant quantities of products containing hemp-derived delta-8-THC, and any crackdown by the DEA or other regulatory authorities on products containing delta-8-THC may have a material adverse effect upon Lifted’s business and the trading price of our common stock; and

(iii) The DEA has sent a letter saying that delta-9-THCO and delta-8-THCO “do not occur naturally in the cannabis plant and can only be obtained synthetically, and therefore do not fall under the definition of hemp.” Any crackdown by the DEA or other regulatory authorities on products containing delta-9-THCO and/or delta-8-THCO may have a material adverse effect upon Lifted’s business and the trading price of our common stock.

(c) Amended PACT act: The recently amended federal PACT act makes the online sale of certain of Lifted’s products to end users difficult or impossible. The amended federal PACT act may have a material adverse effect upon Lifted’s business and the trading price of our common stock.

In regard to the potential sale of products containing nicotine, products containing nicotine are addictive and are subject to heavy regulation by U.S. federal, state and local governments. The legislative and regulatory landscape surrounding nicotine-containing products has created risks for Lifted’s business. Laws and regulations have been adopted that can impose significant liabilities upon companies operating in the nicotine industry, especially in regard to sales to minors. Existing and future laws and regulations affecting nicotine products may have a material adverse effect upon Lifted’s business and the trading price of our common stock.

Furthermore, the regulation of hemp-derived, psychoactive and nicotine products is evolving. Lifted may become subject to new laws, rules, regulations, moratoriums, prohibitions, or other restrictions or impediments upon nicotine and Canna-Infused Products Companies imposed by the U.S. President pursuant to executive orders, by the U.S. Congress in laws, by U.S. federal agencies such as the FDA and/or the DEA, and/or by state and local governments. For example, Lifted’s business may be impacted by any language relating to hemp-derived or psychoactive products that might be contained in any bill that might federally legalize marijuana, or that might be contained in the next so-called “Farm Bill”, or that might be contained in other legislation at the federal or state level. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, governmental laws, rules and regulations may impose significant new rules, restrictions, limitations, prohibitions and/or taxes on when, where, how and to whom Lifted may sell its products, and these new rules, restrictions, limitations, prohibitions and/or taxes may have a material adverse effect on Lifted’s business and the trading price of our common stock.

Competition

Lifted faces intense competition in the hemp-derived, psychoactive and alternative lifestyle products industries from both existing and emerging companies that offer similar products to Lifted. Some of Lifted’s current and potential competitors may have longer operating histories, more innovative or popular products, greater financial, marketing and other resources and larger customer bases. Given the rapid changes affecting the cannabinoid industry nationally and locally, Lifted may not be able to create and maintain a competitive advantage in the marketplace. Lifted’s success will depend on its ability to keep pace with any changes in local and national markets, especially in light of frequent and rapid legal and regulatory changes. Competition is also based on product innovation, product quality, price, brand recognition and loyalty, effectiveness of marketing and promotional activity, the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences, as well as convenience and service. Lifted’s success will depend on its ability to respond to, among other things, changes in the economy, market conditions and competitive pressures. Any failure to anticipate or respond adequately to such changes could have a material adverse effect on Lifted’s financial condition, operating results, liquidity, cash flow and operational performance.
Receipt of Employee Retention Tax Credits

In August 2022, with the assistance of a third party consulting firm, Lifted applied for Employee Retention Tax Credits (“ERC”) for certain quarters of 2020 and 2021. In the fourth quarter of 2022, gross credits of $233,534 were recovered, and Lifted paid the third party consulting firm a commission of $58,384. The ERC is accounted for as a reduction in payroll expenses in the fourth quarter of 2022. The commission is accounted for as Professional Fees expense. 
Acquisition Process

The structure of the Company’s participation in business opportunities and ventures will continue to be situational.


11


The Company is likely to structure future acquisitions as a purchase of 19.99% or less, or 100%, of a target company’s equity ownership interest, or as a so-called tax-free reorganization, or as an asset purchase. However, in particular situations, the Company is willing to consider alternative deal structures including joint ventures. 

In deals that are structured as tax-free reorganizations, it is expected that the Company will issue a relatively large number of newly issued shares of the Company, and, as a result, substantial additional dilution to the percentage ownership of our current stockholders.

The Company’s present management and shareholders may not have control of a majority of our voting shares following a merger or purchase of stock. It is possible that the shareholders of the acquired entity or the persons who provide the capital to the Company to finance a merger or purchase of stock will gain control of the Company’s voting stock and the Company’s directors may resign and new directors may be appointed without any vote by the shareholders. Those directors are entitled to replace the Company’s officers without stockholder vote.

Closing such purchases of stock or so-called tax-free reorganizations will likely require the Company to raise millions of dollars of capital, in order to pay the cash portion of the transaction consideration. The Company can provide no assurance or guaranty whatsoever that it will be able to raise such millions of dollars of capital on acceptable terms and conditions, if at all.

An Investment Committee appointed by the Company’s Board of Directors, currently consisting of our GJacobs, NWarrender, and WJacobs will review material furnished to it and will vote whether or not the Investment Committee believes a potential acquisition is in the Company’s best interests and the interests of the Company’s shareholders. If the Investment Committee votes unanimously to approve a potential acquisition, then such acquisition will be presented to the Board of Directors of the Company for their review and a vote. The Company does not intend to proceed forward with a potential acquisition without the unanimous approval of the Investment Committee and approval by a majority of the Company’s Board of Directors.

The Company intends to source acquisition opportunities through GJacobs, NWarrender, WJacobs, and directors and their contacts, and in some cases through finders. These contacts include professional advisors such as attorneys and accountants, securities broker dealers, other members of the financial community, other businesses and others who may present solicited and unsolicited proposals. Management believes that business opportunities may become available to us due to a number of factors, including, among others: (1) the Company’s ownership of shares in Lifted and other Canna-Infused Products Companies; (2) management’s historical experience building large public companies; (3) management’s contacts and acquaintances; and (4) the Company’s flexibility with respect to the manner in which the Company may be able to structure, finance, merge with or acquire any business opportunity.

Inasmuch as the Company will have limited funds available to search for business opportunities, the Company will not be able to expend significant funds on a complete and exhaustive investigation of such business or opportunity. The Company will, however, investigate, to the extent believed reasonable by the Investment Committee, such potential business opportunities by conducting a so-called “due diligence investigation”.

In a due diligence investigation, the Company intends to obtain and review materials regarding the business opportunity. Typically, such materials will include information regarding a target business’ products, services, contracts, management, ownership, and financial information. In addition, the Company intends to cause the Investment Committee to meet personally with management and key personnel of target businesses, ask questions regarding the target businesses’ prospects, tour facilities, and conduct other reasonable investigation of the target businesses to the extent of the Company’s limited financial resources and management and technical expertise.

There is no guarantee that the Company can obtain or maintain the funding needed for its operations, including the funds necessary to search for and investigate acquisition candidates, and to close an acquisition including paying the substantial costs of legal, accounting and other relevant professional services. At the present time, due to the facts that billions of dollars of market capitalization have been lost by publicly traded corporations in the cannabis industry, investor sentiment regarding equity or debt capital raises within the cannabis industry is profoundly negative. This negative investor sentiment, combined with many other negative macro factors such as inflation, recessionary pressures, global conflicts, supply chain issues and regulatory pressures associated with the pandemic, and interest rate increases triggered by the U.S. Federal Reserve, has made it extremely difficult for the Company to attract Growth Capital on acceptable terms and conditions. The Company can provide no guarantee or assurance as to whether or when such profoundly negative investor sentiment might improve. 

In connection with the reporting of the Company’s financial results for the second and third quarters of 2022, we mentioned that we were in discussions/negotiations regarding two potential acquisitions, one within our current industry, and the other outside of our current industry and in the process of international expansion. These discussions/negotiations have terminated without any deals being agreed upon, and no guarantee or assurance whatsoever can be given that discussions/negotiations with either of these two potential acquisitions or with any other potential acquisition candidates will result in any letter of intent or definitive acquisition agreement. In light of significant macro-economic risks, and other domestic and international political, regulatory, and military uncertainties, we generally have pursued a conservative “risk off” mentality regarding the potential issuance of additional common stock of the Company, and regarding the pricing, term and other conditions of potential borrowings by the Company.
