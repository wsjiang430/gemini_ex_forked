Item 1. Business.
Overview 
OUTFRONT Media is a real estate investment trust (“REIT”), which provides advertising space (“displays”) on out-of-home advertising structures and sites in the United States (the “U.S.”) and Canada. We are one of the largest providers of advertising space on out-of-home advertising structures and sites across the U.S. and Canada. Our inventory consists of billboard displays, which are primarily located on the most heavily traveled highways and roadways in top Nielsen Designated Market Areas (“DMAs”), and transit advertising displays operated under exclusive multi-year contracts with municipalities in large cities across the U.S. and Canada. We also have marketing and multimedia rights agreements with colleges, universities and other educational institutions, which entitle us to operate on-campus advertising displays, as well as manage marketing opportunities, media rights and experiential entertainment at sports events. In total, we have displays in all of the 25 largest markets in the U.S. and approximately 140 markets in the U.S. and Canada. Our top market, high profile location focused portfolio includes sites such as the Bay Bridge in San Francisco, various locations along Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles, and sites in and around both Grand Central Station and Times Square in New York. The breadth and depth of our portfolio provides our customers with a range of options to address their marketing objectives, from national, brand-building campaigns to hyper-local campaigns that drive customers to the advertiser’s website or retail location “one mile down the road.” 
In addition to providing location-based displays, we also focus on delivering audiences to our customers. Using Geopath, the out-of-home advertising industry’s audience measurement system, we provide advertisers with the size and demographic composition of the audience that is exposed to individual displays or a complete campaign. As part of our ON Smart Media platform, we are developing hardware and software solutions for enhanced demographic and location targeting, and engaging ways to connect with consumers on-the-go. Additionally, our OUTFRONT Mobile Network allows our customers to further leverage location targeting with interactive mobile advertising that uses geofence technology and other data to push mobile ads to consumers within a pre-defined radius around a corresponding billboard display or other designated advertising location. Further, our social influence add-on product allows our customers to leverage location targeting with social sharing amplification.
We believe out-of-home advertising continues to be an attractive form of advertising, as our displays are always viewable and cannot be turned off, skipped, blocked or fast-forwarded. Further, out-of-home advertising can be an effective “stand-alone” medium, as well as an integral part of a campaign to reach audiences using multiple forms of media, including television, radio, print, online, mobile and social media advertising platforms. We provide our customers with a differentiated advertising solution at an attractive price point relative to other forms of advertising. In addition to leasing displays, we provide other value-added services to our customers, such as pre-campaign category research, attribution, consumer insights, creative design support through OUTFRONT Studios, print production and post-campaign tracking and analytics, as well as use of a real-time mobile operations reporting system that facilitates proof of performance to customers for substantially all of our business. 
We generally (i) own the physical billboard structures on which we display advertising copy for our customers, (ii) hold the legal permits to display advertising thereon and (iii) lease the underlying sites. These lease agreements have terms varying between one month and multiple years, and usually provide renewal options. We estimate that approximately 75% of our billboard structures in the United States are “legal nonconforming” billboards, meaning they were legally constructed under laws in effect at the time they were built, but could not be constructed under current laws. These structures are often located in areas where it is difficult or not permitted to build additional billboards under current laws, which enhances the value of our portfolio. We have a highly diversified portfolio of advertising sites. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 20,800 lease agreements with approximately 16,900 different landlords in the U.S. A substantial number of these lease agreements allow us to abate rent and/or terminate the lease agreement in certain circumstances, which may include where the structure is obstructed, where there is a change in traffic flow and/or where the advertising value of the sign structure is otherwise impaired, providing us with flexibility in renegotiating the terms of our leases with landlords in those circumstances. 
We manage our operations through three operating segments—(1) U.S. Billboard and Transit, which is included in our U.S. Media reportable segment, (2) International and (3) Sports Marketing. International and Sports Marketing do not meet the criteria to be a reportable segment and accordingly, are both included in Other (see Item 8., Note 19. Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Prior to April 1, 2016, our International segment included our advertising businesses in Canada and Latin America. On April 1, 2016, we sold all of our equity interests in certain of our subsidiaries (the “Disposition”), which held all of the assets of our outdoor advertising business in Latin America (see Item 8., Note 13. Acquisitions and Dispositions: Dispositions to the Consolidated Financial Statements).
History 
Our corporate history can be traced back to companies that helped to pioneer the growth of out-of-home advertising in the United States, such as Outdoor Systems, Inc., 3M National, Gannett Outdoor and TDI Worldwide Inc. In 1996, a predecessor of CBS Corporation (“CBS”) acquired TDI Worldwide Inc., which specialized in transit advertising. Three years later, a predecessor of CBS acquired Outdoor Systems, Inc., which represented the consolidation of the outdoor advertising assets of large national operators such as 3M National, Gannett Outdoor (and its Canadian assets held in the name Mediacom) and Vendor (a Mexican outdoor advertising company) and many local operators in the United States, Canada and Mexico. In 2008, CBS acquired International Outdoor Advertising Holdings Co., which operated outdoor advertising assets in Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Uruguay. 
On April 2, 2014, the Company completed an initial public offering (the “IPO”) of its common stock under the name “CBS Outdoor Americas Inc.” On July 16, 2014, CBS completed a registered offer to exchange 97,000,000 shares of our common stock that were owned by CBS for outstanding shares of CBS Class B common stock (“the Exchange Offer”). In connection with the Exchange Offer, CBS disposed of all of its shares of our common stock and as of July 16, 2014, we were separated from CBS (the “Separation”) and were no longer a subsidiary of CBS. On July 16, 2014, in connection with the Separation, we ceased to be a member of the CBS consolidated tax group, and on July 17, 2014, we began operating as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
On October 1, 2014, we completed the acquisition of certain outdoor advertising businesses of Van Wagner Communications, LLC, for a total purchase price of approximately $690.0 million in cash, plus working capital adjustments (the “Acquisition”).
On November 20, 2014, the Company changed its legal name to “OUTFRONT Media Inc.”, and its common stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “OUT.”
Acquisition and Disposition Activity
We regularly evaluate potential acquisitions, ranging from small transactions to larger acquisitions. 
On April 1, 2016, we completed the Disposition and received $82.0 million in cash plus working capital, which was subject to post-closing adjustments. 
On June 13, 2017, certain subsidiaries of OUTFRONT Media Inc. acquired the equity interests of certain subsidiaries of All Vision LLC (“All Vision”), which hold substantially all of All Vision’s outdoor advertising assets in Canada, and effectuated an amalgamation of All Vision’s Canadian business with our Canadian business (the “Transaction”). In connection with the Transaction, we paid approximately $94.4 million for the assets, comprised of $50.0 million in cash and $44.4 million, or 1,953,407 shares, of Class A equity interests of a subsidiary of the Company that controls its Canadian business (“Outfront Canada”), subject to post-closing adjustments (upward or downward) for the achievement of certain operating income before depreciation and amortization targets relating to the acquired assets in 2018, which is not expected to be material. 
For additional information regarding our acquisition and disposition activity, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources” and “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” 
Tax Status 
Our qualification to be taxed as a REIT is dependent on our ability to meet various complex requirements under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), related to, among other things, the sources of our gross income, the composition and values of our assets and the diversity of ownership of our shares. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Status as a REIT.” As long as we remain qualified to be taxed as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on REIT taxable income that we distribute to stockholders. To maintain REIT status, we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we annually distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends-paid deduction and excluding any net capital gains. To the extent that we satisfy this distribution requirement and qualify for taxation as a REIT but distribute less than 100% of our REIT taxable income, determined with the above modifications, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our undistributed net taxable income. In addition, we will be subject to a nondeductible 4% excise tax if the amount that we actually distribute to our stockholders in a calendar year is less than a minimum amount specified under U.S. federal tax laws. We intend to pay regular quarterly distributions to our stockholders in an amount not less than 100% of our REIT taxable income (determined before the deduction for dividends paid).
We believe we are organized in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code and that our manner of operation will enable us to continue to meet those requirements. If we fail to qualify to be taxed as a REIT in any taxable year and do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate rates and will be precluded from re-electing REIT status for the subsequent four taxable years. Despite our status as a REIT, we will be subject to certain U.S. federal, state and local taxes on our income or property and the income of our taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRSs”) will be subject to taxation at regular corporate rates. 
Growth Strategy
Continue Increasing the Number of Digital Displays in our Portfolio. Increasing the number of digital displays in prime audience locations is an important element of our organic growth strategy, as digital displays have the potential to attract additional business from both new and existing customers. We believe digital displays are attractive to our customers because they allow for the development of richer and more visually engaging messages, provide our customers with the flexibility both to target audiences by time of day and to quickly launch new advertising campaigns, and eliminate or greatly reduce production and installation costs. In addition, digital displays enable us to run multiple advertisements on each display. Digital billboard displays generate approximately four times more revenue per display on average than traditional static billboard displays. Digital billboard displays also incur, on average, approximately two to four times more costs, including higher variable costs associated with the increase in revenue than traditional static billboard displays. As a result, digital billboard displays generate higher profits and cash flows than traditional static billboard displays. The majority of our digital billboard displays were converted from traditional static billboard displays. In 2017, we commenced deployment of state-of-the-art digital transit displays in connection with several transit franchises and are planning to increase deployments significantly over the coming years. Once the digital transit displays have been deployed at scale, we expect that revenue generated on digital transit displays will be a multiple of the revenue generated on comparable static transit displays. We intend to incur significant equipment deployment costs and capital expenditures in the coming years to continue increasing the number of digital displays in our portfolio. See “—Renovation, Improvement and Development.” 
Drive Enhanced Revenue Management. We focus heavily on inventory management and advertising rate to improve average revenue per display (yield) over time across our portfolio of advertising structures and sites. By carefully managing our pricing on a market-by-market and display-by-display basis, we aim to improve profitability. We believe that closely monitoring pricing and improving pricing discipline will provide strong potential revenue enhancement. We also explore alternative uses of our billboard locations as they arise to drive site profitability, including wireless attachment placement opportunities on our leased and owned assets.
Mobile Technology and Social Media Engagement. We believe there is potential for growth in the reach, effectiveness and amplification of-out-home advertising through mobile technology and social media engagement. For example, the OUTFRONT Mobile Network creates opportunities for advertisers to reach their target audience by enabling them to bundle geofenced mobile advertising with an out-of-home advertising display campaign. Consumer dependence on mobile devices, especially while out-of-home, makes out-of-home advertising displays and mobile advertising a natural fit for advertiser brand messaging, allowing consumer mobile activities such as search, social and e-commerce to be primed by the out-of-home advertising display. Additionally, we offer a social influence add-on product to amplify our out-of-home advertising display campaigns. 
Consider Selected Acquisition Opportunities. As part of our growth strategy, we frequently evaluate strategic opportunities to acquire new businesses and assets. Consistent with this strategy, we regularly evaluate potential acquisitions, ranging from small transactions to larger acquisitions. See “—Acquisition and Disposition Activity.” There can be no assurances that any transactions currently being evaluated will be consummated or, if consummated, that such transactions would prove beneficial to us. Further, our national footprint in the United States and significant presence in Canada provide us with an attractive platform on which to add additional advertising structures and sites. Our scale gives us advantages in driving additional revenues and reducing operating costs from acquired billboards. We believe that there is significant opportunity for additional industry consolidation, and we will evaluate opportunities to acquire additional out-of-home advertising businesses and structures and sites on a case-by-case basis.
Continued Adoption & Refinement of Audience Measurement Systems; Utilization of Data/Analytics. We believe the continued adoption and refinement of the out-of-home advertising industry’s audience measurement system, Geopath, will enhance the value of the out-of-home medium by providing customers with improved audience measurement and the ability to target by gender, age, ethnicity and income. New refinements, including the impact of speed (i.e. how quickly the audience passes an individual billboard unit), and the inclusion of transit metrics, are making the measurement system more robust. Additionally, as part of our ON Smart Media platform, we are developing hardware and software solutions for enhanced demographic and 
location targeting. By providing a consistent and standardized audience measurement metric, and overlaying increasingly available and reliable third-party data, we will be able to help advertisers target increasingly mobile audiences with effective media plans in the out-of-home environment for both static and digital displays.

(a) | Digital display amounts (1) include displays reserved for transit agency use and (2) exclude: (i) all displays under our multimedia rights agreements with colleges, universities and other educational institutions; (ii) 1,649 MetroCard vending machine digital screens in 2018, 1,650 in 2017 and 1,601 in 2016; and (iii) in-train advertising displays of 317 in each of 2017 and 2016 which were scheduled to be taken out of service permanently. Our number of digital displays is impacted by acquisitions, dispositions, management agreements, the net effect of new and lost billboards, and the net effect of won and lost franchises in the period.

Most of our non-maintenance capital expenditures are directed towards new revenue-generating projects, such as the conversion of traditional static billboard displays to digital, the building of new digital displays and the enhancement of our billboard structures to enable us to charge premium rates. In 2017, we commenced deployment of state-of-the-art digital transit displays in connection with several transit franchises and are planning to increase deployments significantly over the coming years. We intend to incur significant equipment deployment costs and capital expenditures in coming years to continue increasing the number of digital displays in our portfolio. See “—Growth Strategy.” 
We have built or converted 57 digital billboard displays in the United States and 26 in Canada in 2018, compared to 65 digital billboard displays in the United States and 21 in Canada in 2017, and 65 digital billboard displays in the United States and 11 in Canada in 2016. Additionally, in 2018, we installed 56 small-format digital displays and entered into marketing arrangements to sell advertising on 18 third-party digital billboard displays in the U.S. with a net decrease of three third-party digital billboard displays in Canada. In 2018, we have built, converted or replaced 1,646 digital transit and other displays in the United States. Our total number of digital displays is impacted by acquisitions, dispositions, management agreements and the net effect of new and lost billboards and the net effect of won and lost franchises. As of December 31, 2018, our average initial investment required for a digital billboard display is approximately $240,000. 
In 2016, we initiated a multi-year project to improve the quality of the illumination of our static billboard displays and to reduce our utility costs through the use of the most current LED lighting technology. As of December 31, 2018, we completed 36 out of 51 locations (metropolitan areas) planned for conversion to the most current LED lighting technology.
We routinely invest capital in the maintenance and repair of our billboard and transit structures. This includes safety initiatives and replaced displays, as well as new billboard components such as panels, sections, catwalks, lighting and ladders. Our maintenance capital expenditures were $18.6 million in 2018, $19.9 million in 2017 and $18.5 million in 2016. 
In the opinion of management, our outdoor advertising sites and structures are adequately covered by insurance.
Contract Expirations 
We derive revenues primarily from providing advertising space to customers on our advertising structures and sites. Our contracts with customers generally cover periods ranging from four weeks to one year and are generally billed every four weeks. Since contract terms are short-term in nature, revenues by year of contract expiration are not considered meaningful. 
Our transit businesses require us to periodically obtain and renew contracts with municipalities and other governmental entities. When these contracts expire, we generally must participate in highly competitive bidding processes in order to obtain or renew contracts. For further information about municipal transit contracts, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” 
For information about the property lease contracts relating to our advertising structures and sites, see “Item 2. Properties.”
Competition
The outdoor advertising industry is fragmented, consisting of a few companies operating on a national basis, including our company, Clear Channel Outdoor, Lamar, JCDecaux and Intersection, as well as hundreds of smaller regional and local companies operating a limited number of displays in a single or a few local geographic markets. We compete with these companies for both customers and structure and display locations. We also compete with other media, including online, mobile and social media advertising platforms and traditional advertising platforms (such as television, radio, print and direct mail marketers). In addition, we compete with a wide variety of out-of-home media, including advertising in shopping centers, airports, movie theaters, supermarkets and taxis. Advertisers compare relative costs of available media, including average cost per thousand impressions or “CPMs”, particularly when delivering a message to customers with distinct demographic characteristics. In competing with other media, the outdoor advertising industry relies on its ability to reach specific markets, geographic areas and/or demographics and its relative cost efficiency.
Seasonality 
Our revenues and profits may fluctuate due to seasonal advertising patterns and influences on advertising markets. Typically, our revenues and profits are highest in the fourth quarter, during the holiday shopping season, and lowest in the first quarter, as advertisers adjust on spending following the holiday shopping season. We expect this trend to continue in the future.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had 2,305 employees, of which 828 were sales and sales-related personnel in the U.S. and 84 were Canadian sales and sales-related personnel. As of December 31, 2018, 2,268 of our employees were full-time employees and 37 were part-time employees. Some of these employees are represented by labor unions and are subject to collective bargaining agreements.
Regulation
The outdoor advertising industry is subject to governmental regulation and enforcement at the federal, state and local levels in the United States and Canada. These regulations have a significant impact on the outdoor advertising industry and our business. The descriptions that follow are summaries and should be read in conjunction with the texts of the regulations described herein, which are subject to change. The descriptions do not purport to describe all present and proposed regulations affecting our businesses.
In the United States, the federal Highway Beautification Act of 1965 (the “HBA”) establishes a framework for the regulation of outdoor advertising on primary and interstate highways built with federal financial assistance. As a condition to federal highway assistance, the HBA requires states to restrict billboards on such highways to commercial and industrial areas, and imposes certain size, spacing and other requirements associated with the installation and operation of billboards. The HBA also requires the development of state standards, promotes the expeditious removal of illegal signs and requires just compensation for takings, on affected roadways. These state restrictions and standards, or their local and municipal counterparts, may be modified over time in response to legal challenges or otherwise, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
Municipal and county governments generally also have sign controls as part of their zoning laws and building codes, and many have adopted standards more restrictive than the federal requirements. Some state and local government regulations prohibit 
construction of new billboards and some allow new construction only to replace existing structures. Other laws and regulations throughout the United States and Canada limit or prohibit the ability to modify, relocate, rebuild, replace, repair, maintain and upgrade advertising structures, particularly those structures that are “legal nonconforming” (i.e., that conformed with applicable regulations when built but which no longer conform to current regulations), and impose restrictions on the construction, repair, maintenance, lighting, operation, upgrading, height, size, spacing and location of outdoor structures generally and/or on the surrounding land and vegetation, as well as on the use of new technologies such as digital signs. In addition, from time to time, third parties or local governments commence proceedings in which they assert that we own or operate structures that are not properly permitted or otherwise in strict compliance with applicable law.
Governmental regulation of advertising displays also limits our installation of additional advertising displays, restricts advertising displays to governmentally controlled sites or permits the installation of advertising displays in a manner that could benefit our competitors disproportionately, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Although state and local government authorities from time to time use the power of eminent domain to remove billboards, U.S. law requires payment of compensation if a state or political subdivision compels the removal of a lawful billboard along a primary or interstate highway that was built with federal financial assistance. Additionally, many states require similar compensation (or relocation) with regard to compelled removals of lawful billboards in other locations, although the methodology used to determine such compensation varies by jurisdiction. Some local governments have attempted to force removal of billboards after a period of years under a concept called amortization. Under this concept the governmental body asserts that just compensation has been earned by continued operation of the billboard over a period of time. In Canada, billboards may be expropriated for public purposes with compensation (or relocation) determined on a case-by-case basis. Thus far, we have generally been able to obtain satisfactory compensation for our billboards purchased or removed as a result of governmental action, although there is no assurance that this will continue to be the case in the future.
A number of federal, state and local governments in the United States and Canada have implemented, or introduced legislation to impose, taxes (including taxes on revenues from outdoor advertising or for the right to use outdoor advertising assets), fees and registration requirements in an effort to decrease or restrict the number of outdoor advertising structures and sites or raise revenues, or both. Several jurisdictions have already imposed taxes based on a percentage of our outdoor advertising revenue in those jurisdictions. In addition, some jurisdictions have taxed our personal property and leasehold interests in outdoor advertising locations using various other valuation methodologies. We expect the United States and Canada to continue to try to impose such laws as a way of increasing their revenue and restricting outdoor advertising.
Further, these laws may affect prevailing competitive conditions in our markets in a variety of ways, including reducing our expansion opportunities, or increasing or reducing competitive pressure on us from other members of the outdoor advertising industry. No assurance can be given that existing or future laws or regulations, and the enforcement thereof, will not materially and adversely affect the outdoor advertising industry. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Operations—Taxes, fees and registration requirements may reduce our profits or expansion opportunities.” However, we contest laws and regulations that we believe unlawfully restrict our constitutional or other legal rights and may adversely impact the growth of our outdoor advertising business.
Restrictions on outdoor advertising of certain products, services and content are or may be imposed by federal, state and local laws and regulations, as well as contracts with municipalities and transit franchise partners. For example, tobacco products have been effectively banned from outdoor advertising in all of the jurisdictions in which we currently do business.
As the owner or operator of various real properties and facilities, we must comply with various federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in the United States and Canada. We and our properties are subject to such laws and regulations related to the use, storage, disposal, emission and release of hazardous and nonhazardous substances and employee health and safety. Historically, with the exception of safety upgrades, we have not incurred significant expenditures to comply with these laws.
We intend to expand the deployment of digital billboards that display digital advertising copy from various advertisers that change up to several times per minute. We have encountered some existing regulations in the United States and Canada that restrict or prohibit these types of digital displays. Furthermore, as digital advertising displays are introduced into the market on a large scale, existing regulations that currently do not apply to digital advertising displays by their terms could be revised to impose specific restrictions on digital advertising displays due to alleged concerns over, among other things, aesthetics or driver safety. 
We are subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules and regulations as well as industry standards and regulations regarding privacy, information security, data and consumer protection, among other things. Many of these laws and industry standards and regulations are still evolving and changes in the nature of the data that we purchase and/or collect, and the ways that data is permitted to be collected, stored, used and/or shared may negatively impact the way that we are able to conduct business.  See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Operations—Changes in regulations and consumer concerns regarding privacy, information security and data, or any failure or perceived failure to comply with these regulations or our internal policies, could negatively impact our business” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Operations—If our security measures are breached, our services may be perceived as not being secure, users and customers may curtail or stop using our services, and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure.”
Policies with Respect to Certain Activities
The following is a discussion of certain of our investment, financing and other policies. We intend to conduct our business in a manner such that we are not treated as an “investment company” under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. In addition, we intend to conduct our business in a manner that is consistent with maintaining our qualification to be taxed as a REIT. These policies may be amended or revised from time to time at the discretion of our board of directors without a vote of our stockholders.
Investment Policies
Investment in Real Estate or Interests in Real Estate. Our investment objective is to maximize after-tax cash flow. We intend to achieve this objective by developing our existing advertising structures and sites, including through the digital modernization of such advertising structures and sites, and by building and acquiring new advertising structures and sites. We currently intend to invest in advertising structures and sites located primarily in major metropolitan areas. Future development or investment activities will not be limited to any specific percentage of our assets or to any geographic area or type of advertising structure or site. While we may diversify in terms of location, size and market, we do not have any limit on the amount or percentage of our assets that may be invested in any one property or any one geographic area. In addition, we may purchase or lease properties for long-term investment, improve the properties we presently own or other acquired properties, or lease such properties, in whole or in part, when circumstances warrant.
We may enter into multi-year contracts with municipalities and transit operators for the exclusive right to display advertising copy on the interior and exterior of rail and subway cars, buses, benches, trams, trains, transit shelters, street kiosks and transit platforms. We may also enter into marketing and multimedia rights agreements with colleges, universities and other educational institutions, which entitle us to operate on-campus advertising displays, as well as manage marketing opportunities, media rights and experiential entertainment at sports events. In addition, we may participate with third parties in property ownership through joint ventures or other types of co-ownership. 
Investments in acquired advertising structures and sites, directly or in connection with joint ventures, may be subject to existing mortgage financing and other indebtedness or to new indebtedness that may be incurred in connection with acquiring or refinancing these properties. We do not currently have any restrictions on the number or amount of mortgages that may be placed on any one advertising site or structure. Debt service on such financing or indebtedness will have a priority over any distributions with respect to our common stock.
Investments in Securities of or Interests in Persons Primarily Engaged in Real Estate Activities and Other Issuers. We have and may in the future invest in securities or interests of other issuers, including REITs and entities engaged in real estate activities, directly or in connection with joint ventures or other strategic transactions. However, because we must comply with various requirements under the Code in order to maintain our qualification to be taxed as a REIT, including restrictions on the types of assets we may hold, the sources of our income and accumulation of earnings and profits, our ability to engage in certain acquisitions, such as acquisitions of C corporations, may be limited. We have not and do not currently anticipate investing in securities of other issuers for the purpose of exercising control over such entities, acquiring any investments primarily for sale in the ordinary course of business, or holding any investments with a view to making short-term gains from their sale, but we may engage in these activities in the future.
Investments in Other Securities. We may in the future invest in additional securities such as bonds, preferred stock and common stock. We have no present intention to make any such investments, except for investments in cash equivalents in the ordinary course of business. Future investment activities in additional securities will not be limited to any specific percentage of our assets or to any specific type of securities or industry group.
Acquisitions and Dispositions. From time to time in the ordinary course of business, we have both acquired and disposed of advertising structures and sites in order to optimize our portfolio, and we intend to continue to do so in the future. See “—Acquisition and Disposition Activity” and “—Growth Strategy.”
Investments in Real Estate Mortgages. We have not invested in, nor do we have any present intention to invest in, real estate mortgages, although we are not prohibited from doing so.
Financing and Leverage Policy
We may, when appropriate, employ leverage and use debt as a means to finance growth in our business, refinance existing debt, to provide additional funds to distribute to stockholders, and/or for corporate purposes. On January 31, 2014, our subsidiaries, Outfront Media Capital LLC (“Finance LLC”) and Outfront Media Capital Corporation (“Finance Corp.” and together with Finance LLC, the “Borrowers”) borrowed $800.0 million under a term loan due in 2021, and entered into a $425.0 million revolving credit facility maturing in 2019. On January 31, 2014, the Borrowers also issued $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.250% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2022 and $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.625% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2024 (together, the “Formation Notes”) in a private placement. In addition, on October 1, 2014, the Borrowers issued $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of additional 5.250% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2022 and $450.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.875% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2025 (together, the “Acquisition Notes”) in a private placement. On March 30, 2015, the Borrowers issued $100.0 million aggregate principal amount of additional 5.625% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2024 (the “Add-on Notes” and, collectively, with the Formation Notes and the Acquisition Notes, the “Notes”) in a private placement. On March 16, 2017, the Company, along with the Borrowers, and other guarantor subsidiaries party thereto, entered into an amendment (the “Amendment”) to its credit agreement and its related security agreement, each dated January 31, 2014 (together, and as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified, the “Credit Agreement”) providing for, among other things, (i) the extension of the maturity date of the Borrowers’ existing revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) from January 31, 2019, to March 16, 2022, (ii) the extension of the maturity date of the Borrowers’ existing term loan (the “Term Loan” and together with the Revolving Credit Facility, the “Senior Credit Facilities”) from January 31, 2021, to March 16, 2024, (iii) an increase to the Revolving Credit Facility by $5.0 million to $430.0 million, and (iv) the incurrence of a $10.0 million incremental term loan primarily to cover transaction fees and expenses. In addition, on June 30, 2017, certain subsidiaries of the Company entered into a $100.0 million three-year revolving accounts receivable securitization facility (the “AR Facility”) and on September 6, 2018, (i) extended the term of the AR Facility for one year so that it will now terminate on June 30, 2021, unless further extended; and (ii) entered into a 364-day $75.0 million structured repurchase facility (the “Repurchase Facility” and together with the AR Facility, the “AR Securitization Facilities”). We have, and from time to time we may, draw funds from the Revolving Credit Facility and/or the AR Securitization Facilities for specific or general corporate purposes. For more information, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources.” Other than as described above, we have not borrowed any money from third parties during the past three years. 
The Company’s Charter (our “charter”) and the Company’s Amended and Restated Bylaws (our “bylaws”) do not limit the amount or percentage of indebtedness that we may incur, nor have we adopted any policies addressing this. The Credit Agreement, the agreements governing the AR Securitization Facilities and the indentures governing the Notes contain, and any future debt agreements may contain, covenants that place restrictions on us and our subsidiaries. Our board of directors may limit our debt incurrence to be more restrictive than our debt covenants allow and from time to time may modify these restrictions in light of then-current economic conditions, relative costs of debt and equity capital, market values of our properties, general conditions in the market for debt and equity securities, fluctuations in the market price of our common stock, growth and acquisition opportunities and other factors. If these restrictions are relaxed, we could become more highly leveraged, resulting in an increased risk of default on our obligations and a related increase in debt service requirements. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Operations.”
Lending Policies
We do not intend to engage in significant lending activities, although we do not have a policy limiting our ability to make loans to third parties. We may consider offering purchase money financing in connection with the sale of properties. Other than loans to joint ventures in which we participate and loans to joint venture partners, subject to applicable laws, which we have made, and may continue to make, we have not made any loans to third parties.
Company Securities Policies
In the future, we may issue debt securities (including senior securities), offer common stock, preferred stock, convertible securities or options to purchase common stock in exchange for property, and/or repurchase or otherwise reacquire our common 
stock or other securities in the open market or otherwise. Except in connection with the Notes and related exchanges of publicly registered Notes for privately issued Notes, equity private placements relating to a license and development agreement, the Transaction, the ATM Program (as defined in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources”) and stock-based employee compensation, in the past four years, we have not offered or issued debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, convertible securities, options to purchase common stock or any other securities in exchange for property or any other purpose. Our board of directors has the authority, without further stockholder approval, to amend our charter to increase the number of authorized shares of our common stock or preferred stock and to authorize us to issue additional shares of common stock or preferred stock, in one or more series, including senior securities, in any manner, and on the terms and for the consideration it deems appropriate, subject to applicable laws and regulations. We have not engaged in trading, underwriting or agency distribution or sale of securities of other issuers and do not intend to do so.
We make available to our stockholders our Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our audited financial statements, and other required periodic reports filed with the SEC. See “—Available Information.”
Conflict of Interest Policies
Policies Applicable to All Directors and Officers. The Company has adopted a Code of Conduct that applies to all executive officers, employees and directors of the Company. In addition, the Company has adopted a Supplemental Code of Ethics applicable to our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer and controller or persons performing similar functions. The Code of Conduct and Supplemental Code of Ethics are designed to promote honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interest between our employees, officers and directors and us. However, there can be no assurance that these policies or provisions of law will always be successful in eliminating the influence of such conflicts.
Interested Director and Officer Transactions. Pursuant to the Maryland General Corporation Law (the “MGCL”), a contract or other transaction between us and any of our directors or between us and any other corporation or other entity in which any of our directors is a director or has a material financial interest is not void or voidable solely on the grounds of such common directorship or interest, the presence of such director at the meeting of the board of directors or committee of the board of directors at which the contract or transaction is authorized, approved or ratified or the counting of the director’s vote in favor thereof, provided that: (1) the fact of the common directorship or interest is disclosed or known to our board of directors or a committee of our board, and our board or committee authorizes, approves or ratifies the transaction or contract by the affirmative vote of a majority of disinterested directors, even if the disinterested directors constitute less than a quorum; (2) the fact of the common directorship or interest is disclosed or known to our stockholders entitled to vote thereon, and the transaction or contract is authorized, approved or ratified by a majority of the votes cast by the stockholders entitled to vote other than the votes of shares owned of record or beneficially owned by the interested director or corporation, firm or other entity; or (3) the transaction or contract is fair and reasonable to us.
