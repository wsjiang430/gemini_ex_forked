•Further develop and commercialize our surgical solutions portfolio. We intend to grow our presence in the surgical solutions market and expand our reach into the operating room in both ambulatory surgical centers (“ASCs”) and hospitals. In the near-term, we plan to maintain and selectively expand our profitable product lines by expanding our direct surgical sales team over time. We intend to launch product line enhancements and invest in the development of next-generation surgical solution therapies to continue to grow our market share. 
•Invest in research and development. We are focused on internal research and development to broaden our portfolio of Pain Treatments, Surgical Solutions and Restorative Therapies. We rely on a team of highly trained individuals to develop new products, conduct clinical investigations and help educate health care providers using our products. We collaborate with academic centers of excellence, leading contract research organizations and other industry groups to complement and expedite execution of our research and development programs and minimize fixed costs. 
•Opportunistically grow our international markets. We intend to focus our international business on markets where our existing portfolio can maintain profitable growth over time, either through direct or distributor based channels. We plan to selectively expand to new markets and intend to pursue further opportunities in the Asia Pacific markets. 
Our products
We offer a diverse portfolio of products to serve physicians spanning the orthopedic continuum, including sports medicine, total joint reconstruction, hand and upper extremities, foot and ankle, podiatric surgery, trauma, spine and neurosurgery, in the physician’s office or clinic, ASCs or in the hospital setting. Our portfolio of products is grouped into three verticals based on clinical use: (i) Pain Treatments, (ii) Surgical Solutions and (iii) Restorative Therapies.
Pain Treatments
Our joint Pain Treatment products include peripheral nerve stimulation (“PNS”) and hyaluronic acid-based (“HA”) products for knee osteoarthritis. Our HA products are designed to work with the body’s biological processes, providing a natural lubricant into the joint, that relieve mild to moderate pain, improves mobility, and helps the patient get back to their normal activities. Our PNS product targets peripheral nerve pain at its source without drugs and its small profile allows the system to be implanted in many locations on the body, depending on patient needs.
Durolane is an FDA-approved sterile, transparent and viscoelastic gel that is a single injection therapy that is indicated in the United States for the symptomatic treatment of OA in the knee in patients who have failed to respond adequately to conservative non-pharmacological therapy and simple analgesics. Durolane is also indicated for the hip, ankle and shoulder, as well as for treatment of other small orthopedic joints outside the United States. Durolane contains high levels of HA and is injected directly into the joints affected by OA to relieve pain and restore lubrication and cushioning. This may improve joint function and help to potentially avoid or delay knee replacement surgery. 
Physicians administer Durolane to the affected knee joint in a single injection and it has been observed to provide a benefit for pain reduction in patients with OA in the knee for up to 26 weeks. Durolane’s injection schedule results in economic advantages and greater patient convenience and compliance compared to other HA viscosupplementation therapies which require weekly injections over a period of three to five weeks. Durolane is highly purified and based upon a natural and patented non-animal stabilized HA (“NASHA”), expanding use to patients who are allergic to animal derived solutions. We currently market Durolane in the United States and Europe.
GELSYN-3™ is an FDA-approved sterile, buffered solution of highly purified sodium hyaluronate that is administered as a three injection HA viscosupplementation therapy. It is indicated for the treatment of pain due to knee OA in patients who have failed to respond adequately to conservative non-pharmacologic therapy and simple analgesics. The solution treats knee OA by providing temporary replacement for the diseased synovial fluid and restoring lubricity of bearing joint surfaces. Physicians administer GELSYN-3 to the affected knee joint once a week for three consecutive weeks. GELSYN-3 provides relief of knee pain and may help delay the need for total knee replacement surgery. GELSYN-3 is derived from bacterial fermentation, is highly purified and does not involve the use of animal products, thereby reducing the potential risk of an immune response following injection. We currently market GELSYN-3 in the United States. 
SUPARTZ™ is an FDA-approved sterile and viscoelastic solution of HA that is administered as a five injection HA viscosupplementation therapy. It is indicated for the treatment of pain in patients with knee OA who failed to adequately respond to conservative nonpharmacological therapy and simple analgesics. The solution treats knee OA by providing temporary replacement for the diseased synovial fluid and restoring the lubricity of the bearing joint surfaces. Physicians administer SUPARTZ FX to the affected knee joint once a week for five consecutive weeks. SUPARTZ FX may also delay the need for total knee replacement. SUPARTZ FX is derived from HA extracted from certified and veterinary inspected chicken combs. We currently market SUPARTZ FX in the United States. 
Our StimRouter® Peripheral Nerve Stimulation (“PNS”) system is a permanent option that provides relief for chronic peripheral pain including: Nerve Pain, Neuroma, Neuropathic Pain, Post-Stroke Shoulder Pain and Neuralgia. StimRouter is implanted during a minimally invasive outpatient procedure performed under local anesthetic and delivers gentle electrical pulses directly to target peripheral nerve pain at its source. Its small profile allows the system to be implanted in many locations around the body, depending on patient needs. StimRouter is ideally suited for patients with chronic pain of a peripheral origin who are unable to find sustained pain relief with other treatment options such as nerve blocks, nerve ablation, and other temporary treatments. StimRouter is programmed with up to eight different stimulation programs from which the patient is able to select, turn off/on and increase or decrease the stimulation intensity.
Developmental and clinical pipeline for Pain Treatments 
The TalisMann® Pulse Generator and Receiver (not yet cleared by FDA) is an accessory to the StimRouter® PNS system and is designed to provide more powerful stimulation to the targeted peripheral nerve, potentially enabling physicians to address chronic pain of a peripheral nerve origin in larger, deeper, or damaged nerves. TalisMann has a small profile and is attached to the StimRouter lead intraoperatively and pocketed under the skin after the StimRouter lead electrodes are placed near the targeted peripheral nerve.
Trice Medical, Inc.
On August 23, 2021, we made a strategic investment in Trice Medical, Inc. (“Trice”). Trice is a privately held company that develops and commercializes minimally invasive technologies for sports medicine and orthopedic surgical procedures. Trice combines its handheld arthroscope and portable ultrasound visualization technologies with its surgical devices to treat a range of sports medicine and orthopedic conditions, including tendinopathy, planter fasciitis and carpel tunnel, in order to improve patient recovery time, reduce pain, minimize scarring and move surgical procedures out of higher cost points of care. Trice’s established and growing presence in sports medicine and orthopedics is directly aligned with our strategy of expanding our offerings.
Our investment resulted in exclusive sales and distribution rights to Trice’s products outside of the U.S. and a seat on the Trice board of directors. We also entered into a co-development arrangement to explore the integration of Trice technologies with our current and future PNS products in order to accelerate the adoption of both of our products.
Surgical Solutions
Our Surgical Solutions product portfolio is comprised of clinically efficacious and cost-effective bone graft solutions to meet a broad range of patient needs and procedures. Bone grafting is a surgical procedure used to fuse spinal vertebrae, replace missing bones, fix bones that are damaged from trauma or problem joints, or to facilitate growing bones around an implanted device, such as a total knee replacement. Our products are designed to improve bone fusion rates following spinal and other orthopedic surgeries, including trauma and reconstructive foot and ankle procedures. Our portfolio is also comprised of surgical ultrasonic systems. These products are used for precise bone sculpting, removal of soft and hard tumors, and tissue debridement, primarily in the areas of neurosurgery, orthopedic surgery, plastic surgery, wound care and maxillo-facial surgery. 
OSTEOAMP® is an allograft-derived bone graft with growth factors used for orthopedic, neurosurgical and reconstructive bone grafting procedures. OSTEOAMP is an allogeneic bone graft that is available in multiple formats (fibers, putty, sponge and granules) that is processed with bone marrow cells to maintain the wide array of growth factors present in native bone. We currently market OSTEOAMP in the United States. We launched OSTEOAMP Flowable in 2021, which is designed to be moldable and easy to use, with a convenient, ready to use syringe. Additionally, a customized cannula-based delivery system is currently in development, which will enhance handling properties of the device further enabling use in minimally invasive surgical procedures. FDA 510K submission for this device is planned for the fourth quarter of 2023.
EXPONENT provides an osteoconductive scaffold with osteoinductive potential while providing optimal handling characteristics indicated for posterolateral spine procedures. EXPONENT is derived from human allograft bone tissue and is combined with a migration-resistant resorbable carrier and formulated into a putty that is ready-to-use out of the syringe. EXPONENT is highly malleable and easy to mold and pack into the surgical defect. Donor bone is sourced from AATB-certified and FDA-registered tissue banks in the United States. All tissues are screened for the standard panel of infectious viruses. We currently market EXPONENT in the United States.
PUREBONE provides a natural osteoconductive scaffold that facilitates cellular ingrowth and revascularization which is indicated for orthopedic, neurosurgical and reconstructive bone grafting procedures. PUREBONE is 100% human bone, and is available as demineralized cortical fibers, demineralized cancellous strips and blocks, and mineralized cancellous chips. Demineralized cortical fibers are easy to mold, shape and pack, and provide osteoinductive potential. The fibers demonstrate high fluid retention and expansion properties, which potentially increases the opportunity for bone-on-bone contact. Demineralized block and strip formats provide interconnected porosity with compressible, sponge-like handling characteristics, and provide osteoinductive potential. Mineralized cancellous chips range from 1-4 mm and 4-10 mm granule size for optimal void packing capabilities. Demineralized PUREBONE formats provide osteoinductive potential to recruit and differentiate bone-forming cells. Donor bone is sourced from AATB-certified and FDA-registered tissue banks in the United States. All tissues are screened for the standard panel of infectious viruses. We currently market PUREBONE in the United States.
SIGNAFUSE contains a synergistic combination of biomaterials that supports new bone formation which is indicated for standalone posterolateral spine, extremities and pelvis, as well as a bone graft extender in the posterolateral spine. SIGNAFUSE is a synthetic bone graft made up of bioglass and a biphasic mineral (60% hydroxyapatite, 40% β-tricalcium phosphate) available in putty and strip formats. Bioactive synthetic bone graft substitute is comprised of a mixture of calcium phosphate granules and bioglass granules suspended in a resorbable polymer carrier that facilitates handling and delivery of the granule components to fill spaces of missing bone. The unique and synergistic combination of biomaterials in SIGNAFUSE is designed to help accelerate cellular activity and kickstart osteogenesis. We currently market SIGNAFUSE in the United States.
INTERFACE is designed to facilitate a rapid biologic response that stimulates the bone healing process and is used for posterolateral spine when mixed with autograft, extremities and pelvis. INTERFACE’s patented particle technology is designed for enhanced bone graft performance through irregularly shaped synthetic bioglass granules that provide an osteoconductive scaffold for new osseous ingrowth and tissue generation. The patented bioglass component stimulates the formation of an apatite layer as early as seven days on the surface of the granules. The apatite surface layer that is formed is equivalent in composition and structure to the hydroxyapatite found in bone and provides an osteoconductive bioactive scaffold that supports the generation of new osseous tissue. New bone infiltrates around the granules, allowing the repair of the defect as the granules are absorbed. The patented INTERFACE Bioactive Bone Graft particle size of 210-420 microns is designed for a faster speed of bone fill than glass particles with a broader particle size distribution of 90-710 microns and smaller particles below 210 microns. INTERFACE features consistent composition without variability inherently found in particle size and porosity of tissue based grafts. INTERFACE Bioactive Bone Graft conforms to ASTM speciﬁcation F1538 for 45S5 bioactive glass. INTERFACE is packed in a sterile, single use vial. We currently market INTERFACE in the United States.
OSTEOMATRIX+ is a synthetic bone graft with exceptional handling, rapid hydration and a biphasic composition for sustained performance used on the posterolateral spine, extremities and pelvis. OSTEOMATRIX+ is a moldable bone graft substitute consisting of biphasic granules designed to produce a reliable, porous scaffold and sustained osteoconductivity throughout bone remodeling. The OSTEOMATRIX+ biphasic granules are composed of 60% hydroxyapatite and 40% beta-tricalcium phosphate (“β-TCP”), a ratio demonstrated to have advantageous bone remodeling properties. The long-term stability of hydroxyapatite and the solubility of β-TCP provide an osteoconductive graft with an optimal resorption profile. Interconnected macropores provide a porous, osteoconductive matrix that mimics a natural scaffold for cellular ingrowth and revascularization. Three-dimensional micropores enhance the flow and circulation of biological fluids. We currently market OSTEOMATRIX+ in the United States.
CELLXTRACT is a bone marrow aspirate without dilution or centrifugation. CELLXTRACT provides high levels of cells and their associated signals to deliver optimum clinical results. Independently reviewed clinical data shows the number of stem cells collected by CELLXTRACT, as counted by fibroblast-like colony-forming units (“CFU-f”), were greater than aspirations from a standard needle of similar volumes and was comparable or greater than final products after centrifugation. Autologous bone marrow aspirate (“BMA”) contains the needed cells and growth factors to enhance bone healing. There is no waste of biologic material or discard of viable cells compared to inherent inefficiencies in centrifuge-based systems. We believe potential savings can be realized as compared to the centrifuge-based competitors. Generally, the cost of CELLXTRACT is less than the disposable kit associated with those systems. No additional personnel is needed to operate equipment as no centrifugation is required. The aspirated fluid is not required to leave the sterile field for centrifugation, creating less risk for contamination or infection. Traditional needles require repositioning via an additional insertion point(s) or angling in order to access a fresh channel of BMA increasing the risk of infection, blood loss, and operative time. CELLXTRACT, on the other hand, only requires one insertion point minimizing the risks to the patient. We currently market CELLXTRACT in the United States.

EXTRACTOR is a complementary and cost-effective solution designed to add needed cells and signals to aid in bone healing. EXTRACTOR provides a six-ported cannula with a simplistic design for more flexible positioning and enhanced marrow extraction. The large side port design of EXTRACTOR allows for better access and retrieval of the bone marrow aspirate which contains the cells and signals needed for solid bone formation. The “twin peaks” tip design allows for easy insertion through the hard wall of the cortical bone. An ergonomically designed handle allows the clinician to apply consistent pressure for greater control. We currently market EXTRACTOR in the United States.
Reficio Demineralized Bone Matrix (“Reficio DBM”) is a putty comprised of human demineralized bone matrix and a biocompatible bioabsorbable carrier, carboxymethylcellulose, mixed into a putty-like consistency for ease in surgical use. Reficio DBM is indicated for use as a bone void filler and bone graft substitute for voids or gaps that are not intrinsic to the stability to the bony structure, specifically for the treatment of surgically created osseous defects or osseous defects from traumatic injury to the bone. Reficio DBM can be used for extremities, posterolateral spine and pelvis. 
The neXus Ultrasonic Surgical System (“neXus”) is a next generation integrated ultrasonic surgical platform that combines all the features of our existing solutions, including BoneScalpel, SonicOne and SonaStar, into a single fully integrated system that serves to power future solutions. The neXus platform is driven by a proprietary digital algorithm that results in more power, efficiency, and control for the surgeon. The device incorporates technology that allows for intuitive setup and use. The neXus system allows for safe and efficient resection of hard and soft tissue, limiting collateral damage to adjacent tissue than conventional surgical instruments, and can be used in a variety of different surgical specialties. In addition, neXus’ ease of use enables physicians to fully leverage neXus’ capabilities via its digital touchscreen display and smart system setup. Our current ultrasonic applications, which include BoneScalpel, BoneScalpel Access™, Sonastar and SonicOne, all work on the neXus generator. This allows a hospital to access all of our product offerings on this all-in-one console. The neXus Ultrasonic Aspirator System has been commercialized successfully in the United States, Canada, Europe and Australia.

The BoneScalpel® is a state of the art, ultrasonic surgical system capable of enabling precise cutsin hard tissue (e.g. bone). The device is also capable of preserving surrounding soft tissue structures because of its ability to differentiate soft tissue from rigid bone. This device can make precise linear or curved cuts, on any plane, with precision not normally associated with powered instrumentation. We believe that BoneScalpel offers the speed and convenience of a powered instrument without the dangers associated with conventional rotary devices. The effect on surrounding soft tissue is limited due to the elastic and flexible structure of healthy tissue. We believe this is a significant advantage in anatomical regions like the spine where patient safety is of primary concern. In addition, the linear motion of the blunt, tissue-impacting tips avoids accidental ‘trapping’ of soft tissue while largely eliminating the high-speed spinning and tearing associated with rotary power instruments. We believe the BoneScalpel allows surgeons to improve on existing surgical techniques by creating new approaches to bone cutting, sculpting, and removal, leading to substantial time-savings and increased operation efficiencies.
In addition to BoneScalpel, the Company received 510(k) clearance for its neXus® BoneScalpel® Access™ system in December 2021. Specifically, the BoneScalpel Access handpiece and its accessories provides surgeons with a new option for confined spaces during minimally invasive surgery, enabling safe and powerful bone removal with maximum visualization. In addition, BoneScalpel Access allows for en-bloc resection and the shaving and sculpting of bone, with built-in irrigation and aspiration with improved ergonomics for the end user. The BoneScalpel Access handpiece represents best-in-class among ultrasonic surgical platforms, and surgeon feedback following the U.S. market roll out has been positive.

The SonaStar System provides powerful and precise aspiration following the ultrasonic ablation of soft tissue. The SonaStar has been used for a wide variety of surgical procedures applying both open and minimally invasive approaches, including neurosurgery and general surgery. The SonaStar may also be used with OsteoSculpt® probe tips, which enable the precise shaping or shaving of bony structures that prevent open access to partially or completely hidden soft tissue masses.
In addition to SonaStar, the Company received FDA 510K approval in July 2022 for its neXus® SonaStar Elite® handpiece and accessories, which combines all the features of soft and hard (including bone) tissue removal into a single fully integrated platform capable of operating at multiple frequencies, including the newly approved 36 kHz SonaStar Elite Handpiece. While the neXus system can be used in many clinical applications including neurosurgery, the SonaStar Elite handpiece has been cleared for resection of tumors with varying consistencies ranging from soft to firm, including the removal of malignant and benign brain and spinal tumors. The SonaStar Elite handpiece represents the latest innovation in our neXus ultrasonic surgical pipeline. Launch of the product is planned for the fourth quarter of 2023.
Developmental and clinical pipeline for Surgical Solutions (including investments)
As we build the body of clinical evidence supporting our products, we continue to look for and execute on opportunities to innovate in our Surgical Solution portfolio. To meet growing market demand and specifically the needs of surgeons, we continue to develop product extensions on all of our surgical technology platforms, including OsteoAmp and the neXus platform.

Our Restorative Therapies product portfolio is also comprised of Advanced Rehabilitation devices designed to help patients regain leg or hand function due to stroke, multiple sclerosis or other central nervous system disorders.
EXOGEN® is an ultrasound bone healing system for the non-invasive treatment of established nonunion fractures and certain fresh fractures. A nonunion fracture is considered to be established when the fracture site shows no visibly progressive signs of healing. EXOGEN has been sold commercially for over 25 years and is FDA-approved for the accelerated healing of fresh, closed posteriorly displaced distal fractures of the radius and fresh, closed or grade I open long bone fractures. EXOGEN utilizes low-intensity pulsed ultrasound technology to stimulate the body’s natural bone healing process. EXOGEN is used to administer treatment in a location of convenience with an easy to use interface that tracks treatment use and promotes compliance. EXOGEN is indicated in the United States. for the non-invasive treatment of established nonunions, excluding skull and vertebra, and for accelerating the time to a healed fracture for fresh, closed, posteriorly displaced distal radius fractures and fresh, closed or Grade I open long bone fractures in skeletally mature individuals when these fractures are orthopedically managed by closed reduction and cast immobilization. EXOGEN is marketed in the United States., Canada, Europe and Japan. EXOGEN is also approved for marketing in Australia, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the UAE.
TheraSkin® is a biologically active human skin allograft that has all of the relevant characteristics of human skin needed to heal wounds, including living cells, growth factors, and a collagen matrix. TheraSkin is derived from human skin tissue and is an HCT/P. LifeNet processes and supplies TheraSkin to us under a supply and distribution agreement that gives us exclusive rights to sell TheraSkin in the United States. TheraSkin is used on all external skin tissue wounds, including but not limited to difficult to heal diabetic foot ulcers, venous leg ulcers, dehisced surgical wounds, necrotizing fasciitis, burns, Mohs and wounds with exposed structures.
TheraGenesis® is a Bilayer Wound Matrix and Meshed Bilayer Wound Matrix consisting of a porcine collagen sponge layer and a silicone film layer that provides a scaffold for cellular invasion and capillary growth for management of wounds including partial and full-thickness wounds, chronic wounds, surgical wounds, trauma wounds and draining wounds. We obtain TheraGenesis under an exclusive supply and distribution agreement with Gunze Limited that gives us exclusive rights to distribute the product in the United States.
The SonicOne Ultrasonic Cleansing and Debridement System is a highly innovative, tissue specific approach for the removal of devitalized or necrotic tissue and fibrin deposits while sparing viable, surrounding cellular structures. The tissue specific capability is, in part, due to the fact that healthy and viable tissue structures have a higher elasticity and flexibility than necrotic tissue and are more resistant to destruction from the impact effects of ultrasound. The ultrasonic debridement process separates devitalized tissue from viable tissue layers, allowing for a more defined treatment and, usually, a reduced pain sensation. We believe that SonicOne establishes a new standard in wound bed preparation, the essential first step in the healing process, while contributing to a faster patient healing.

L300 GO is a functional electrical stimulation that produces measurable mobility improvements for patients living with foot drop and thigh weakness. A 3-axis gyroscope and accelerometer are embedded in the Stimulator to monitor user movement in all three kinematic planes and deploy stimulation in 0.01 seconds of detecting a valid gait event. Through an adaptive, learning algorithm, the L300 Go is designed to detect gait events, providing stimulation precisely when needed making it easier for users to clear their foot at different walking speeds, on stairs, ramps, and while navigating uneven terrain.
H200 Wireless is a hand rehabilitation system that supports the wrist in a functioning position, allowing the fingers and thumb to move efficiently while reaching, grasping and pinching. H200 Wireless has two main parts that communicate wirelessly with each other: the functional stimulation support (“orthosis”) and the control unit (“microprocessor”). These designed to increase hand function, increase or maintain hand range of motion, reduce muscle spasms, prevent muscle loss, reeducate muscles and/or increase blood circulation. H200 Wireless is programmed by a clinician to stimulate the appropriate nerves and muscles of the forearm and hand. We believe this helps to reeducate electrical brain signals, stimulating weak or paralyzed muscles.
Vector is a body weight support system designed to accelerate physical rehabilitation of patients with severe gait and/or balance impairment. The system unloads a programmed amount of weight to enable the patient to practice walking with less than his or her full body weight. Vector is designed to alleviate the risk of falling and provides a feeling of security, instilling confidence in patients and empowering clinicians to develop effective and challenging rehabilitation regimens. Vector is designed to reduce safety risks so clinicians can remain focused on their patient’s execution of an activity. Designed for both physical and occupational therapy, Vector is designed to provide a safe environment and real-world experience for adult and pediatric patients recovering from stroke, amputations, and orthopedic, brain and spinal cord injuries.
The Bioness Integrated Therapy System (“BITS”®) is an affordable and versatile solution for vision, motor and balance training for individuals, including those with deficits resulting from traumatic injuries and movement disorders as well as competitive athletes.

The U.S. patents are expected to expire between 2033 and 2038, and the foreign patents are expected to expire between 2034 and 2036. The pending patent applications, if issued, are expected to expire between 2033 and 2038, without accounting for potential patent term extensions and adjustments.
We also own one issued U.S. patent, one issued foreign patent in Australia and one pending foreign application in Canada directed to our Bioness Integrated Therapy System (“BITS”). The U.S. patent is expected to expire in 2037, and the foreign patent is expected to expire in 2036. The pending patent application, if issued, is expected to expire in 2036, without accounting for potential patent term extensions and adjustments.
We also own one issued U.S. patent and one pending U.S. patent application and four pending foreign patent applications directed to our TalisMann product, including foreign patent applications in Australia, Canada, Europe, Japan and one pending Patent Cooperation Treaty application. The U.S. patent is expected to expire in 2039. The pending patent applications, if issued, are expected to expire between 2039 and 2040, without accounting for potential patent term extensions and adjustments. We also own twenty-four issued U.S. patents and four pending U.S. patent applications directed to our BoneScalpel product.

Trademarks
We own registered trademarks for Bioventus, Bioness, BITS, Bonescalpel, BoneScalpel Access, Cellxtract, Durolane, Exogen, Exponent, Gelsyn-3, LiveOn, L300 Go, Misonix, Ness, Ness L300, neXus, OsteoAMP, Osteofuse, Prohesion, PureBone, SAFHS, Signafuse, Sonastar, SonaStar Elite, StimRouter, TheraSkin, Therion and Vector Gait and Safety System in the United States.
Trade secrets
We may rely on trade secret law to protect some of our technology. Trade secrets, however, can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and manufacturing process, in part, by confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with employees, consultants scientific advisors and contractors, under which they are bound to assign to us certain inventions that are made during the course of performing work for us and relate to our business. These agreements further restrict the use and disclosure of proprietary information belonging to any third-party. These agreements further prohibit our employees from using, disclosing, or bringing onto the premises any proprietary information belonging to any third-party.
In addition to patents, trademarks, and trade secrets, we also rely on assignment and license agreements, pursuant to which we may license rights under patents held by third-parties, and non-disclosure agreements, to protect our proprietary intellectual property. We obtain assignments or licenses of varying durations for certain of our products from third-parties. We typically acquire rights under such assignments or licenses in exchange for lump-sum payments or arrangements under which we pay a percentage of sales to the licensor. However, while assignments or licenses to us generally are irrevocable, no assurance can be given that these arrangements will continue to be made available to us on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. The terms of our license and assignment agreements vary in length from a specified number of years to the life of product patents or the economic life of the product. These agreements generally provide for royalty payments and termination rights in the event of a material breach.
We will continue to seek patent, trademark, and copyright protection as we deem advisable to protect the markets for our products and to support our research and development efforts.
Manufacturing and supply
We largely manufacture and assemble our medical device products at our production facilities located in Cordova, TN, Farmingdale, NY, Valencia, CA and Hod Hasharon, Israel. We believe our manufacturing operations are in compliance with regulations mandated by the FDA. We are an FDA-registered medical device manufacturer. Our manufacturing facilities and processes are subject to periodic inspections and audits by various federal, state and foreign regulatory agencies. Our products include components manufactured by other companies in the United States and elsewhere.
Some of our products and product components are manufactured exclusively by single-source third-party manufacturers, pursuant to multi-year supply agreements and may include minimum order volumes. We work closely with each of our manufacturing partners and provide them with a forecast, which enables them to better capacity plan and sequence their production efficiently. 
We may encounter difficulty in obtaining materials, supplies and components adequate for our anticipated short-term needs. In addition, supply disruptions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic may increase the price of, and make more difficult to obtain, materials, supplies or components. We intend to maintain sufficient supplies of the products and components from these single-source suppliers in the event that one or more of these suppliers were to encounter certain interruptions in supply.
Government regulation
Our products and operations are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other federal and state authorities in the United States, as well as comparable authorities in foreign jurisdictions. In the United States, our products and product candidates are regulated as either medical devices under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”), and its implementing regulations, or as drugs or biological products under the FDCA and the Public Health Service Act (“PHSA”), and their implementing regulations, each as amended and enforced by the FDA. The FDA regulates the development, design, non-clinical and clinical research, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, installation, servicing, recordkeeping, premarket clearance or approval, adverse event reporting, advertising, promotion, marketing and distribution, and import and export of medical devices and biological products to ensure that such products distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses and otherwise meet the applicable requirements of the FDCA and PHSA. 
U.S. Regulation of Medical Devices
The majority of our products are regulated by the FDA as medical devices in the United States. Unless an exemption applies, each medical device commercially distributed in the United States requires either FDA clearance of a 510(k) premarket notification, or approval of a PMA application. Under the FDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes—Class I, Class II or Class III—depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of manufacturer and regulatory control needed to ensure its safety and effectiveness. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risks, such as life sustaining, life supporting or some implantable devices, or devices that have a new intended use, or use advanced technology that is not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed device, are placed into Class III.
While most Class I devices are exempt from the 510(k) premarket notification requirement, manufacturers of most Class II devices are required to submit to the FDA a premarket notification under Section 510(k) of the FDCA requesting permission to commercially distribute the device. The FDA’s permission to commercially distribute a device subject to a 510(k) premarket notification is generally known as 510(k) clearance. Class III devices require approval of a premarket approval application, or PMA, evidencing safety and effectiveness of the device.
To obtain 510(k) clearance, a manufacturer must submit a premarket notification demonstrating to the FDA’s satisfaction that the proposed device is “substantially equivalent” to another legally marketed device that itself does not require PMA approval (a predicate device). A predicate device is a legally marketed device that is not subject to premarket approval, i.e., a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976 (pre-amendments device) and for which a PMA is not required, a device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or I, or a device that was found substantially equivalent through the 510(k) process. The FDA’s 510(k) clearance process usually takes from three to twelve months, but often takes longer. The FDA may require additional information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence. In addition, the FDA collects user fees for certain medical device submissions and annual fees for medical device establishments.
If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent to a lawfully marketed predicate device, it will grant 510(k) clearance to authorize the device for commercialization. If the FDA determines that the device is “not substantially equivalent,” the device is automatically designated as a Class III device. The device sponsor must then fulfill more rigorous PMA requirements, or can request a risk-based classification determination for the device in accordance with the de novo classification process, which is a route to market for novel medical devices that are low to moderate risk and are not substantially equivalent to a predicate device. 
After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change or modification in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or, depending on the modification, PMA approval or de novo classification. The FDA requires each manufacturer to determine whether the proposed change requires submission of a 510(k), de novo classification request or a PMA in the first instance, but the FDA can review any such decision and disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination not to seek a new 510(k) or other form of marketing authorization for the modification to the 510(k)-cleared product, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or request the recall of the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA approval is obtained or a de novo classification is granted.
The PMA process is more demanding than the 510(k) premarket notification process. In a PMA, the manufacturer must demonstrate that the device is safe and effective, and the PMA must be supported by extensive data, including data from preclinical studies and human clinical trials. All clinical investigations of devices to determine safety and effectiveness must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s investigational device exemption (“IDE”), regulations which govern investigational device labeling, prohibit promotion of the investigational device, and specify an array of recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators. If the device presents a “significant risk,” to human health, as defined by the FDA, the FDA requires the device sponsor to submit an IDE application to the FDA, which must become effective prior to commencing human clinical trials. A significant risk device is one that presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety or welfare of a patient and either is implanted, used in supporting or sustaining human life, substantially important in diagnosing, curing, mitigating or treating disease or otherwise preventing impairment of human health, or otherwise presents a potential for serious risk to a subject. In addition, the study must be approved by, and conducted under the oversight of, an Institutional Review Board (“IRB”), for each clinical site. The IRB is responsible for the initial and continuing review of the IDE, and may pose additional requirements for the conduct of the study. If the device presents a non-significant risk to the patient, a sponsor may begin the clinical trial after obtaining approval for the trial by one or more IRBs without separate approval from the FDA, but must still follow abbreviated IDE requirements, such as monitoring the investigation, ensuring that the investigators obtain informed consent, and labeling and record-keeping requirements. 
In addition to clinical and preclinical data, the PMA must contain a full description of the device and its components, a full description of the methods, facilities, and controls used for manufacturing, and proposed labeling. Following receipt of a PMA, the FDA determines whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. If the FDA accepts the application for review, it has 180 days under the FDCA to complete its review of a PMA, although in practice, the FDA’s review often takes significantly longer, and can take up to several years. An advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. The FDA may or may not accept the panel’s recommendation. In addition, the FDA will generally conduct a pre-approval inspection of the applicant or its third-party manufacturers’ or suppliers’ facilities to ensure compliance with the QSR.
The FDA will approve the new device for commercial distribution if it determines that the data and information in the PMA constitute valid scientific evidence and that there is reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended use(s). The FDA may approve a PMA with post-approval conditions intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution, and collection of long-term follow-up data from patients in the clinical study that supported PMA approval or requirements to conduct additional clinical studies post-approval. The FDA may condition PMA approval on some form of post-market surveillance when deemed necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and efficacy data for the device in a larger population or for a longer period of use. In such cases, the manufacturer might be required to follow certain patient groups for a number of years and to make periodic reports to the FDA on the clinical status of those patients. Failure to comply with the conditions of approval can result in material adverse enforcement action, including withdrawal of the approval. Certain changes to an approved device, such as changes in manufacturing facilities, methods, or quality control procedures, or changes in the design performance specifications, which affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, require submission of a PMA supplement, or in some cases a new PMA. 
After a device is cleared or approved or otherwise authorized for marketing, numerous pervasive regulatory requirements continue to apply unless explicitly exempt. These include:
•establishment registration and device listing with the FDA;
•QSR requirements, which require manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the design and manufacturing process;
•labeling and marketing regulations, which require that promotion is truthful, not misleading, fairly balanced and provide adequate directions for use and that all claims are substantiated, and also prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or “off-label” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling; FDA guidance on off-label dissemination of information and responding to unsolicited requests for information;
•clearance or approval of product modifications to 510(k)-cleared devices that could significantly affect safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in intended use of one of our cleared devices;
•medical device reporting regulations, which require that a manufacturer report to the FDA if a device it markets may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned and the device or a similar device that it markets would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, if the malfunction were to recur;
•correction, removal and recall reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health;
•complying with requirements governing Unique Device Identifiers on devices and also requiring the submission of certain information about each device to the FDA’s Global Unique Device Identification Database;
•the FDA’s recall authority, whereby the agency can order device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulations; and
•post-market surveillance activities and regulations, which apply when deemed by the FDA to be necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device.
HCT/Ps
Certain of our products are regulated as HCT/P. Section 361 of the PHSA authorizes the FDA to issue regulations to prevent the introduction, transmission or spread of communicable disease. HCT/Ps regulated as “Section 361” HCT/Ps are subject to requirements relating to registering facilities and listing products with the FDA, screening and testing for tissue donor eligibility, current Good Tissue Practices (“cGTPs”), when processing, storing, labeling and distributing HCT/Ps, including required labeling information, stringent record keeping and adverse event reporting, among other applicable requirements and laws. Section 361 HCT/Ps do not require 510(k) clearance, PMA approval, BLAs, or other premarket authorization from the FDA before marketing. However, to be regulated as a Section 361 HCT/P, the product must, among other things, be “minimally manipulated,” which for structural tissue products means that the manufacturing processes do not alter the original relevant characteristics of the tissue relating to the tissue’s utility for reconstruction, repair, or replacement and for cells or nonstructural tissue products, means that the manufacturing processes do not alter the relevant biological characteristics of cells or tissues. A Section 361 HCT/P must also be intended for “homologous use,” which refers to use in the repair, reconstruction, replacement, or supplementation of a recipient’s cells or tissues with an HCT/P that performs the same basic function or functions in the recipient as in the donor. HCT/Ps that do not meet the criteria of Section 361 are regulated under Section 351 of the PHSA. Unlike 361 HCT/Ps, HCT/Ps regulated as “351” HCT/Ps are subject to premarket review and/or approval by the FDA, as required. 
In November 2017, the FDA released a guidance document entitled “Regulatory Considerations for Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue—Based Products: Minimal Manipulation and Homologous Use—Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff.” The guidance outlined the FDA’s position that all lyophilized amniotic products are more than minimally manipulated and would therefore require a BLA to be lawfully marketed in the United States. The guidance also indicated that the FDA would exercise enforcement discretion, using a risk-based approach, with respect to the IND application and pre-market approval requirements for certain HCT/Ps that had been marketed without marketing authorization, including, among others, lyophilized amniotic products, for a period of 36 months from the issuance date of the guidance to allow manufacturers to pursue INDs and/or seek marketing authorizations. Under this approach, the FDA indicated that high-risk products and uses could be subject to immediate enforcement action. In July 2020, the FDA extended its period of enforcement discretion to May 31, 2021. The FDA resumed enforcement of IND and premarket approval requirements with respect to these products as of June 1, 2021.
U.S. Regulation of Drugs and biological products
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the FDCA, and its implementing regulations, and biologics under the FDCA and the PHSA and their implementing regulations. The process required by the FDA before a drug or biologic may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
•completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies performed in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice requirements;
•submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin;
•approval by an IRB or ethics committee at each clinical site before the trial is commenced;
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety, efficacy, purity and potency of the proposed product candidate for its intended purpose;
•preparation of and submission to the FDA of a BLA for biologics or New Drug Application (NDA) for small molecule drugs after completion of all pivotal clinical trials;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable;
•a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA or NDA to file the application for review;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the proposed product is produced to assess compliance with cGMPs and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s continued safety, purity and potency, and of selected clinical investigation sites to assess compliance with Good Clinical Practices (“GCPs”); and
•FDA review and approval of the BLA or NDA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the United States.
Prior to beginning clinical trials of a new drug or biologic product in the United States, an IND must be submitted to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The BLA or NDA must include all relevant data available from preclinical and clinical studies, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. The submission of a BLA or NDA requires payment of a substantial application user fee to the FDA, unless a waiver or exemption applies.
After the FDA evaluates a BLA or NDA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or its drug substance will be produced and of select clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter (“CRL”). An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A CRL will describe all of the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the BLA or NDA, except that where the FDA determines that the data supporting the application are inadequate to support approval, the FDA may issue the CRL without first conducting required inspections, testing submitted product lots, and/or reviewing proposed labeling. In issuing the CRL, the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the BLA or NDA in condition for approval, including requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of a BLA or NDA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product.
If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may include limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may require one or more post-market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies.
Any drugs or biologics manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual program fees for any marketed products. Biologic and drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
Post-market Enforcement
The FDA may withdraw marketing authorizations for drugs, biologics (including Section 361 HCT/Ps) or medical devices if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks, or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions. Other potential consequences include, among other things: complete withdrawal of the product from the market, product recalls, fines, warning letters, untitled letters, clinical holds on clinical studies, refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, product seizures or detention, refusal to permit the import or export of products, consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs, the issuance of corrective information, injunctions, or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
In addition, the FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of drugs, biologics (including Section 361 HCT/Ps) and medical devices. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are cleared or approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the authorized label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. 
International regulation of medical devices 
Sales of medical devices outside the United States are subject to foreign government regulations, which vary substantially from country to country. In order to market our products in other countries, we must obtain regulatory approvals or certifications and comply with extensive safety and quality regulations in other countries. The time required to obtain approval or certification by a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval and the requirements may differ significantly. 
EU regulation of medical devices
The European Union (“EU”) has adopted specific directives and regulations regulating the design, manufacture, clinical investigation, conformity assessment, labeling and adverse event reporting for medical devices. 
Until May 25, 2021, medical devices were regulated by Council Directive 93/42/EEC (the “EU Medical Devices Directive”), which has been repealed and replaced by Regulation (EU) No 2017/745 (the “EU Medical Devices Regulation”). The majority of our current certificates have been granted under the EU Medical Devices Directive described below. However, as of May 26, 2021, some of the EU Medical Devices Regulation requirements apply in place of the corresponding requirements of the EU Medical Devices Directive with regard to registration of economic operators and of devices, post-market surveillance and vigilance requirements. Pursuing marketing of medical devices in the EU will notably require that all of our devices not currently certified under the new requirements set forth in the EU Medical Devices Regulation receive such certification when the current certificates expire. 
Medical Devices Directive
Under the EU Medical Devices Directive, all medical devices placed on the market in the EU must meet the relevant essential requirements laid down in Annex I to the EU Medical Devices Directive, including the requirement that a medical device must be designed and manufactured in such a way that it will not compromise the clinical condition or safety of patients, or the safety and health of users and others. In addition, the device must achieve the performance intended by the manufacturer and be designed, manufactured, and packaged in a suitable manner. The European Commission has adopted various standards applicable to medical devices. These include standards governing common requirements, such as sterilization and safety of medical electrical equipment and product standards for certain types of medical devices. There are also harmonized standards relating to design and manufacture. While not mandatory, compliance with these standards is viewed as the easiest way to satisfy the essential requirements as a practical matter as it creates a rebuttable presumption that the device satisfies that essential requirement.
To demonstrate compliance with the essential requirements laid down in Annex I to the EU Medical Devices Directive, medical device manufacturers must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its (risk) classification. As a general rule, demonstration of conformity of medical devices and their manufacturers with the essential requirements must be based, among other things, on the evaluation of clinical data supporting the safety and performance of the products during normal conditions of use. Specifically, a manufacturer must demonstrate that the device achieves its intended performance during normal conditions of use, that the known and foreseeable risks, and any adverse events, are minimized and acceptable when weighed against the benefits of its intended performance, and that any claims made about the performance and safety of the device are supported by suitable evidence. Except for low-risk medical devices (Class I non-sterile, non-measuring devices), where the manufacturer can self-declare the conformity of its products with the essential requirements (except for any parts which relate to sterility or metrology), a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a notified body. Notified bodies are independent organizations designated by EU member states to assess the conformity of devices before being placed on the market. A notified body would typically audit and examine a product’s technical dossiers and the manufacturers’ quality system (the notified body must presume that quality systems which implement the relevant harmonized standards – which is ISO 13485:2016 for Medical Devices Quality Management Systems – conform to these requirements). If satisfied that the relevant product conforms to the relevant essential requirements, the notified body issues a certificate of conformity, which the manufacturer uses as a basis for its own declaration of conformity. The manufacturer may then apply the CE mark to the device, which allows the device to be placed on the market throughout the EU.
Throughout the term of the certificate of conformity, the manufacturer will be subject to periodic surveillance audits to verify continued compliance with the applicable requirements. In particular, there will be a new audit by the notified body before it will renew the relevant certificate(s).
Medical Device Regulation
The regulatory landscape related to medical devices in the EU continues to evolve. On April 5, 2017, the EU Medical Devices Regulation was adopted with the aim of ensuring better protection of public health and patient safety. The EU Medical Devices Regulation establishes a uniform, transparent, predictable and sustainable regulatory framework across the EU for medical devices and ensure a high level of safety and health while supporting innovation. Unlike the EU Medical Devices Directive, the EU Medical Devices Regulation is directly applicable in EU member states without the need for member states to implement into national law. This aims at increasing harmonization across the EU.
The EU Medical Devices Regulation became effective on May 26, 2021. The new Regulation among other things:
•strengthens the rules on placing devices on the market (e.g. reclassification of certain devices and wider scope than the EU Medical Devices Directive) and reinforces surveillance once they are available;
•establishes explicit provisions on manufacturers’ responsibilities for the follow-up of the quality, performance and safety of devices placed on the market;
•establishes explicit provisions on importers’ and distributors’ obligations and responsibilities; 
•imposes an obligation to identify a responsible person who is ultimately responsible for all aspects of compliance with the requirements of the new regulation;
•improves the traceability of medical devices throughout the supply chain to the end-user or patient through the introduction of a unique identification number, to increase the ability of manufacturers and regulatory authorities to trace specific devices through the supply chain and to facilitate the prompt and efficient recall of medical devices that have been found to present a safety risk;
•sets up a central database (Eudamed) to provide patients, healthcare professionals and the public with comprehensive information on products available in the EU; and
•strengthens rules for the assessment of certain high-risk devices, such as implants, which may have to undergo a clinical evaluation consultation procedure by experts before they are placed on the market.
Devices lawfully placed on the market pursuant to the EU Medical Devices Directive prior to May 26, 2021 may generally continue to be made available on the market or put into service until their EU Medical Devices Directive certificate expires, provided that the requirements of the transitional provisions are fulfilled. In particular, the certificate in question must still be valid. However, even in this case, manufacturers must comply with a number of new or reinforced requirements set forth in the EU Medical Devices Regulation, in particular the obligations described below.
The EU Medical Devices Regulation requires that before placing a device, other than a custom-made device, on the market, manufacturers (as well as other economic operators such as authorized representatives and importers) must register by submitting identification information to the electronic system (“Eudamed”), unless they have already registered. The information to be submitted by manufacturers (and authorized representatives) also includes the name, address and contact details of the person or persons responsible for regulatory compliance. The new Regulation also requires that before placing a device, other than a custom-made device, on the market, manufacturers must assign a unique identifier to the device and provide it along with other core data to the unique device identifier (“UDI”) database. These new requirements aim at ensuring better identification and traceability of the devices. Each device – and as applicable, each package – will have a UDI composed of two parts: a device identifier (“UDI-DI”) specific to a device, and a production identifier (“UDI-PI”) to identify the unit producing the device. Manufacturers are also notably responsible for entering the necessary data on Eudamed, which includes the UDI database, and for keeping it up to date. The obligations for registration in Eudamed will become applicable at a later date (as Eudamed is not yet fully functional). Until Eudamed is fully functional, the corresponding provisions of the EU Medical Devices Directive continue to apply for the purpose of meeting the obligations laid down in the provisions regarding exchange of information, including, and in particular, information regarding registration of devices and economic operators.
All manufacturers placing medical devices into the market in the EU must comply with the EU medical device vigilance system. Under this system, serious incidents and Field Safety Corrective Actions (“FSCAs”) must be reported to the relevant authorities of the EU member states. Manufacturers are required to take FSCAs defined as any corrective action for technical or medical reasons to prevent or reduce a risk of a serious incident associated with the use of a medical device that is made available on the market. An FSCA may include the recall, modification, exchange, destruction or retrofitting of the device. 
The advertising and promotion of medical devices is subject to some general principles set forth in EU legislation. According to the EU Medical Devices Regulation, only devices that are CE marked may be marketed and advertised in the EU in accordance with their intended purpose. Directive 2006/114/EC concerning misleading and comparative advertising and Directive 2005/29/EC on unfair commercial practices, while not specific to the advertising of medical devices, also apply to the advertising thereof and contain general rules, for example, requiring that advertisements are evidenced, balanced and not misleading. Specific requirements are defined at a national level. EU member states’ laws related to the advertising and promotion of medical devices, which vary between jurisdictions, may limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of products to the general public and may impose limitations on promotional activities with healthcare professionals. 
Many EU member states have adopted specific anti-gift statutes that further limit commercial practices for medical devices, in particular vis-à-vis healthcare professionals and organizations. Additionally, there has been a recent trend of increased regulation of payments and transfers of value provided to healthcare professionals or entities and many EU member states have adopted national “Sunshine Acts” which impose reporting and transparency requirements (often on an annual basis), similar to the requirements in the United States, on medical device manufacturers. Certain countries also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs.
The aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) which consists of the 27 EU member states plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland. Legislation has been approved to extend the transition dates for the EU MDR to 2027/2028. Despite the extension, the notified bodies that are responsible for implementing the EU MDR guidelines must still adopt these changes into their current framework of procedures, which could take additional time.
Other countries
Many other countries have specific requirements for classification, registration and post marketing surveillance that are independent of the countries already listed. We obtain what we believe are the appropriate clearances for our products and conduct our business in accordance with the applicable laws of each country. This landscape is constantly changing, and we could be found in violation if we interpret the laws incorrectly or fail to keep pace with changes. In the event of either of these occurrences, we could be instructed to recall products, cease distribution and/or be subject to civil or criminal penalties. 
Anti-kickback, false claims and other healthcare laws 
We are subject to a number of U.S. laws regulating healthcare fraud and abuse including the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the federal Physician Self-Referral Law (known as the Stark Law), the Civil False Claims Act, and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), as well as numerous state laws regulating healthcare and insurance. These laws are enforced by, without limitation, CMS, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), the U.S. Department of Justice and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, as well as state and local governments. Among other things, these laws and others generally (1) prohibit the provision of anything of value in exchange for the referral of patients or for the purchase, order, or recommendation of any item or service reimbursed by a federal healthcare program, (including Medicare and Medicaid); (2) require that claims for payment submitted to federal healthcare programs be truthful; and (3) require the maintenance of certain government licenses and permits.
Many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payer, in addition to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs. 
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute (“AKS”) prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under federal and state healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Several courts have interpreted the AKS’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the AKS has been violated. The AKS includes statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors that protect certain arrangements. Failure to meet the requirements of an applicable AKS safe harbor, however, does not render an arrangement illegal. Rather, the government may evaluate such arrangements on a case-by-case basis, taking into account all facts and circumstances, including the parties’ intent and the arrangement’s potential for abuse, and may be subject to greater scrutiny by enforcement agencies.
The Stark Law prohibits a physician who has a financial relationship, or who has an immediate family member who has a financial relationship, with entities providing designated health services (“DHS”) from referring Medicare and Medicaid patients to such entities for the furnishing of DHS, unless an exception applies. The Stark Law also prohibits the entity from billing for any such prohibited referral. Unlike the AKS, the Stark Law is violated if the financial arrangement does not meet an applicable exception, regardless of any intent by the parties to induce or reward referrals or the reasons for the financial relationship and the referral.
The Federal False Claims Act (“FCA”) prohibits a person from knowingly presenting, or caused to be presented, a false or fraudulent request for payment from the federal government, or from making a false statement or using a false record to have a claim approved. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the United States government. Moreover, the government may assert that a claim including items and services resulting from a violation of the AKS or the Stark Law constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act. Penalties for a violation of the FCA include fines for each false claim, plus up to three times the amount of damages caused by each false claim. Private individuals also have the ability to bring actions under these false claims laws in the name of the government alleging false and fraudulent claims presented to or paid by the government (or other violations of the statutes) and to share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. 
Further, the Civil Monetary Penalties Statute authorizes the imposition of civil monetary penalties, assessments and exclusion against an individual or entity based on a variety of prohibited conduct, including, but not limited to offering remuneration to a federal healthcare program beneficiary that the individual or entity knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary to order or receive healthcare items or services from a particular provider. Moreover, in certain cases, providers who routinely waive copayments and deductibles for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries can also be held liable under the AKS and civil FCA. One of the statutory exceptions to the prohibition is non-routine, unadvertised waivers of copayments or deductible amounts based on individualized determinations of financial need or exhaustion of reasonable collection efforts. The Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General emphasizes, however, that this exception should only be used occasionally to address special financial needs of a particular patient. Although this prohibition applies only to federal healthcare program beneficiaries, the routine waivers of copayments and deductibles offered to patients covered by commercial payers may implicate applicable state laws related to, among other things, unlawful schemes to defraud, excessive fees for services, tortious interference with patient contracts and statutory or common law fraud.
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”) also established federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payers, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the AKS, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
We also participate in state government-managed Medicaid programs as well as certain other qualifying federal and state government programs where discounts and mandatory rebates are provided to participating state and local government entities. In connection with several of these government programs, we are required to report prices to various government agencies. Pricing calculations vary among programs. The calculations are complex and are often subject to interpretation by the reporting entities, government agencies and the courts. Government agencies may also make changes in program interpretations, requirements or conditions of participation, some of which may have implications for amounts previously estimated or paid. By way of example, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (“MMA”), requires that manufacturers report data to CMS on pricing of covered drugs reimbursed under Medicare Part B. These are generally drugs and biologicals, such as injectable products, that are administered “incident to” a physician service and in general are not self-administered. Effective January 1, 2005, ASP became the basis for reimbursement to physicians and suppliers for drugs and biologicals covered under Medicare Part B, replacing the average wholesale price (“AWP”), provided and published by pricing services. In general, we must comply with all reporting requirements for any drug that is separately reimbursable under Medicare. Our SUPARTZ FX, Gelsyn-3 and Durolane products are reimbursed under Medicare Part B and, as a result, we provide ASP data on this product to CMS on a quarterly basis. Several states in which we operate have also adopted similar fraud and abuse laws as described above. The scope of these laws and the interpretations of them vary from state to state and are enforced by state courts and regulatory authorities, each with broad discretion. Some state fraud and abuse laws apply to items or services reimbursed by any payer, including patients, employers and commercial insurers, not just those reimbursed by a federally funded healthcare program.
Violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that apply may result in significant penalties, including, without limitation, administrative civil and criminal penalties, damages, disgorgement, fines, additional reporting requirements and compliance oversight obligations, in the event that a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement is required to resolve allegations of noncompliance with these laws, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs and/or individual imprisonment.
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
We are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (“FCPA”). The FCPA prohibits U.S. companies and their representatives from processing, offering, or making payments of money or anything of value to foreign officials with the intent to obtain or retain business or seek a business advantage. In certain countries, the health care professionals we or our distributors regularly interact with may meet the definition of a foreign government official for the purposes of the FCPA. Our international activities create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by our employees, consultants and agents, including distributors, even though they may not always be subject to our control. Our existing safeguards may prove to be less than effective, and our employees, consultants, and agents may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible. A determination that our operations or activities are not, or were not, in compliance with U.S. or foreign laws or regulations could result in the imposition of substantial fines, interruptions of business, loss of suppliers, vendor or other third-party relationships, termination of necessary licenses or permits, and legal or equitable sanctions. Other internal or governmental investigations or legal or regulatory proceedings, including lawsuits brought by private litigants, may also follow as a consequence.
ISO Standards
We also operate and maintain a Quality Management System that is designed to comply with the requirements of International Standards ISO 13485: 2016 Medical Devices – Quality Management Systems. This system encompasses the principles of enhancing customer satisfaction through the effective application of processes for control, monitoring, and continual improvement, which is designed to ensure that we consistently meet or exceed customer expectations and applicable statutory/regulatory requirements
Privacy and data protection laws
We are subject to a number of federal, state and foreign laws and regulations that govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information, including health information privacy and security laws, data breach notification laws, and consumer protection laws and regulations (e.g., Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act). For example, HIPAA imposes obligations on “covered entities,” including certain healthcare providers, such as us, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, and their respective “business associates” that create, receive, maintain or transmit individually identifiable health information for or on behalf of a covered entity, as well as their covered subcontractors with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Entities that are found to be in violation of HIPAA, whether as the result of a breach of unsecured protected health information (“PHI”), a complaint about privacy practices, or an audit by HHS, may be subject to significant civil, criminal, and administrative fines and penalties and/or additional reporting and oversight obligations if required to enter into a resolution agreement and corrective action plan with HHS to settle allegations of HIPAA non-compliance.
In addition, certain state and foreign laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and the United Kingdom General Data Protection Regular (“UK GDPR”) govern the privacy and security of personal information, including health-related information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties and private litigation. Privacy and security laws, regulations, and other obligations are constantly evolving, may conflict with each other to complicate compliance efforts, and can result in investigations, proceedings, or actions that lead to significant civil and/or criminal penalties and restrictions on data processing.
Coverage and reimbursement 
Our products may be reimbursed by third-party payors, such as government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, or private insurance plans and healthcare networks. As a result, demand for our products is and will continue to be dependent in part on the coverage and reimbursement policies of these payors. The manner in which reimbursement is sought and obtained varies based upon the type of payor involved and the setting in which the product is furnished and utilized. Reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid and other third-party payors may be subject to periodic adjustments as a result of legislative, regulatory and policy changes, as well as budgetary pressures. Possible reductions in, or eliminations of, coverage or reimbursement by third-party payors, or denial of, or provision of uneconomical reimbursement for new products may affect our customers’ revenue and ability to purchase our products. Any changes in the healthcare regulatory, payment or enforcement landscape relative to our customers’ healthcare services have the potential to significantly affect our operations and revenue. The Medicare program is expected to continue to implement a new payment mechanism for certain durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics, and supplies (“DMEPOS”) items via the implementation of its competitive bidding program. Bone growth therapy devices are currently exempt from this competitive bidding process.
Outside of the United States, the pricing of medical devices and prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control in many countries. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular therapy to currently available therapies or so called health technology assessments, in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. Other countries may allow companies to fix their own prices for products, but monitor and control prescription volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. 
Consolidated Appropriations Act
In July 2022, in connection with the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (“CAA”), the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) began utilizing new pricing information the Company reported to it pursuant to the newly adopted reporting obligations to adjust the Medicare payment to healthcare providers using our Durolane and Gelsyn-3 products.
Employee and Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 1,120 employees, none of whom were covered by collective bargaining agreements. Most of these employees are located in the United States with approximately 125 located outside the United States. We believe that our relations with our employees are generally good. 
We value our employees and regularly benchmark total rewards we provide, such as short and long term compensation, 401(k) contributions, health, welfare and quality of life benefits, paid time off and personal leave, against our industry peers to ensure we remain competitive and attractive to potential new hires. We seek to create a workplace environment that fosters personal and business successes by offering training and development programs, which further assist our current employees in meeting and exceeding our established standards of performance, and a leadership development program specially designed to help our new leaders be successful in their expanded roles. 
Additionally, to build on our culture of treating all individuals fairly and respectfully, we have established a Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (“DE&I”) Council and formed several Employee Resource Groups (“ERGs”). The DE&I Council and ERGs are voluntary, employee-led groups of employees who come together in their workplace based on shared characteristics or life experiences. The stated mission of the DE&I Council is to foster a culture and identity that drives diversity, equity and inclusion as we engage and develop current employees and recruit future talent, all working together to build a transformative work environment. Our ERGs are generally intended to provide support, enhance career development, and contribute to personal development in the work environment. The goals of these and other similar initiatives is to encourage broad and diverse viewpoints to achieve the best outcomes for the patients, healthcare providers, and employees we serve.
Our Organizational Structure
Bioventus Inc. is a Delaware corporation formed on December 22, 2015 and functions as a holding company with no direct operations and our principal asset is the equity interest in BV LLC. We are headquartered in Durham, North Carolina. On February 16, 2021, we closed an initial public offering (“IPO”). Our IPO was conducted through what is commonly referred to as an umbrella partnership C corporation (“UP-C”) structure. In connection with the IPO and the UP-C structure, we completed a series of organizational transactions including, without limitation, the following:
•the limited liability company agreement of BV LLC was amended and restated (“Bioventus LLC Agreement”) to, among other things, (i) provide for a new single class of common membership interests in BV LLC (“LLC Interests”), (ii) exchange all of the then existing membership interests of the holders of BV LLC membership interests (“Original LLC Owners”) for LLC Interests and (iii) appoint Bioventus Inc. as the sole managing member of BV LLC; and
•the acquisition, by merger, of certain members of BV LLC (“Former LLC Owners”), for which we issued shares of Class A common stock as merger consideration (“Merger”). 
•We amended and restated its certificate of incorporation to authorize Class A common stock, Class B common stock and undesignated preferred stock. Class B common stock has voting rights but no economic rights.
We have a majority economic interest, the sole voting interest in, and control the management of, BV LLC. As a result, we will consolidate the financial results of BV LLC and reports a non-controlling interest representing the LLC Interests held by Smith & Nephew, Inc. (“Continuing LLC Owner”). Refer to Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 1. Organization of this Annual Report for additional information about the organizational transactions completed as part of the IPO.
