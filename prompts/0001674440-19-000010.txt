DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
 We are an operating company which provides travel consulting and tour guide services. Our main function can be described as to consult with customers and help them to arrange the itinerary, by building a route, which includes breweries in the region of their choice. We provide customers with information concerning transportation, the cost of it and how it operates. Whenever needed, we provide additional services on orientation, for instance, provide information concerning medical facilities, food stores, car repairs or additional entertainments, transportation and ways of using it in the cases mentioned above. We also provide tour guide services specializing in arranging brewery tours for tourists visiting the Czech Republic. The highest rate of the beer consumption per capita in the world is in the Czech Republic. There are many breweries and beer museums in the Czech Republic. Our president and director has agreements with majority of them regarding our service delivery. We provide information on accommodations suitable for our customers in terms of prices and location. We also alter the route of the itinerary depending on the longevity of the desired tour and the money our customers expect to spend. Expecting our customers to face difficulties in negotiating with locals, we may offer to provide assistance in either negotiating or provide the service of an interpreter. For instance, if clients accept it, we negotiate booking of apartments, details of car rental on behalf of our customers and in their interest, or we expect to be at service in any other case when customers might need assistance in negotiating. We generate a route based on the following criteria listed in an application form: 1) regions the customers would like to visit 2) period of their stay in the country 3) amount of money they expect to spend on a tour. We pay attention to local craft breweries, bars and pubs. We expect to continue working with worldwide famous craft breweries.
