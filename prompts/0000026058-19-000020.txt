Item 1.  Business
CTS Corporation ("CTS", "we", "our", "us" or the "Company") is a global manufacturer of sensors, electronic components, and actuators. CTS was established in 1896 as a provider of high-quality telephone products and was incorporated as an Indiana corporation in February 1929. Our principal executive offices are located in Lisle, Illinois.
We design, manufacture, and sell a broad line of sensors, electronic components, and actuators primarily to original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs") for the aerospace and defense, industrial, information technology, medical, telecommunications, and transportation markets. Our vision is to be a leading provider of sensing and motion devices as well as connectivity components, enabling an intelligent and seamless world. These devices are categorized by their ability to Sense, Connect or Move. Sense products provide vital inputs to electronic systems. Connect products allow systems to function in synchronization with other systems. Move products ensure required movements are effectively and accurately executed. We are committed to achieving our vision by continuing to invest in the development of products and technologies within these categories.
We operate manufacturing facilities in North America, Asia, and Europe. Sales and marketing are accomplished through our sales engineers, independent manufacturers' representatives, and distributors.
See the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for financial information regarding the Company.

MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION
Sales and marketing to OEMs is accomplished through our sales engineers, independent manufacturers' representatives, and distributors. We maintain sales offices in China, Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, India, Japan, Scotland, Singapore, Taiwan, and the United States. Approximately 89% of 2018 net sales were attributable to our sales engineers.
Our sales engineers generally service our largest customers with application-specific products. The sales engineers work closely with major customers in designing and developing products to meet specific customer requirements.
We utilize the services of independent manufacturers' representatives for customers not serviced directly by our sales engineers. Independent manufacturers' representatives receive commissions from us. During 2018, approximately 5% of net sales were attributable to independent manufacturers' representatives. We also use independent distributors. Independent distributors purchase products from us for resale to customers. In 2018, independent distributors accounted for approximately 6% of net sales.
RAW MATERIALS
We utilize a wide variety of raw materials and purchased parts in our manufacturing processes. The following are the most significant raw materials and purchased components:
Conductive inks and contactors, passive electronic components, integrated circuits and semiconductors, certain rare earth elements ("REEs"), ceramic powders, plastic components, molding compounds, printed circuit boards and assemblies, quartz blanks and crystals, wire harness assemblies, copper, brass, silver, gold, platinum, lead, aluminum, and steel-based raw materials and components.
These raw materials and parts are purchased from a number of suppliers, and we generally do not believe we are dependent upon one or a limited number of suppliers. Although we purchase all of our semiconductors, REEs, conductive inks, and silver pastes from a limited number of suppliers, alternative sources are available.
CTS CORPORATION 3

We do not currently anticipate any significant raw material shortages that would limit production. However, the lead times between the placement of orders for certain raw materials and purchased parts and actual delivery to us may vary. Occasionally, we may need to order raw materials in greater quantities and at higher prices to compensate for the variability of lead times for delivery.
PATENTS, TRADEMARKS, AND LICENSES
We maintain a program of obtaining and protecting U.S. and non-U.S. patents relating to products that we have designed and manufactured, as well as processes and equipment used in our manufacturing technology. We were issued 10 new U.S. patents and 19 non-U.S. patents in 2018 and currently hold 147 U.S. patents and 159 non-U.S. patents. We have 9 registered U.S. trademarks, 20 registered foreign trademarks and 4 international trademark registrations. We have licensed the right to use several of our patents. In 2018, license and royalty income was less than 1% of net sales.
MAJOR CUSTOMERS
Sales to our 15 largest customers as a percentage of total net sales were as follows:

 | Years Ended December 31,
 | 2018 | 2017 | 2016 
Total of 15 largest customers / net sales | 63.7% | 64.4% | 63.1%

Our net sales to significant customers as a percentage of total net sales were as follows:

 | Years Ended December 31,
 | 2018 | 2017 | 2016 
Cummins Inc. | 15.2% | 13.4% | 9.9% 
Honda Motor Co. | 10.5% | 11.2% | 10.7%
Toyota Motor Corporation | 10.5% | 10.2% | 10.4%

We sell automotive parts to these three customers for certain vehicle platforms under purchase agreements that have no volume commitments and are subject to purchase orders issued from time to time.
No other customer accounted for 10% or more of total net sales during these periods.
We continue to broaden our customer base. Changes in the level of our customers' orders have, in the past, had a significant impact on our operating results. If a major customer reduces the amount of business it does with us, or substantially changes the terms of that business, there could be an adverse impact on our operating results.
We expect to continue to depend on sales to our major customers. Because our customers are under no obligation to continue to do business with us on a long-term basis, it is possible that one or more customers may choose to work with a competitor and reduce its business with us. Customers may also reduce or delay their business with us because of economic or other conditions or decisions that reduce their need for our products or services. Since it is difficult to replace lost business on a timely basis, it is likely that our operating results would be adversely affected if one or more of our major customers were to cancel, delay, or reduce a large amount of business with us in the future. If one or more of our customers were to become insolvent or otherwise unable to pay for our products and/or services, our operating results, financial condition, and cash flows could be adversely affected.
ORDER BACKLOG
Order backlog is comprised of firm open purchase orders we have received from our customers and generally represents 1 to 2 months of sales for certain products. Our business is a mix of purchase order based business, shorter-term contracts, and multi-year awards, such as with customers who serve the automotive end market. As such, order backlog does not provide a meaningful indication of future sales.

COMPETITION
We compete with many domestic and foreign manufacturers principally on the basis of product features, technology, price, quality, reliability, delivery, and service. Most of our product lines encounter significant global competition. The number of competitors varies from product line to product line. No one competitor competes with us in every product line, but many competitors are larger and more diversified than we are.
Some customers have reduced or plan to reduce their number of suppliers, while increasing their volume of purchases. Customers demand lower cost and higher quality, reliability, and delivery standards from us as well as from our competitors. These trends create opportunities for us, but also increase the risk of loss of business to competitors. We are subject to competitive risks that are typical within the electronics industry, including in some cases short product life cycles and technical obsolescence.
We believe we compete most successfully in custom engineered products manufactured to meet specific applications of major OEMs.
NON-U.S. REVENUES AND ASSETS
Our net sales to customers originating from our non-U.S. operations as a percentage of total net sales were as follows:

 | Years Ended December 31,
 | 2018 | 2017 | 2016
Net sales from non-U.S. operations | 33% | 32% | 30% 

Our percentages of total assets at non-U.S. locations were as follows:

 | Years Ended December 31,
 | 2018 | 2017 | 2016
Total assets at non-U.S. operations | 46% | 49% | 48% 

A substantial portion of these assets, other than cash and cash equivalents, cannot readily be liquidated. We believe the business risks to our non-U.S. operations, though substantial, are normal risks for global businesses. These risks include currency controls and changes in currency exchange rates, longer collection cycles, political and transportation risks, economic downturns and inflation, government regulations, and expropriation. Our non-U.S. manufacturing facilities are located in China, Czech Republic, Denmark, India, Mexico, and Taiwan.
EMPLOYEES
We employed 3,230 people at December 31, 2018, with 81% of these employees located outside the U.S. We employed 3,222 people at December 31, 2017. Approximately 11 employees at one location in the United States were covered by two collective bargaining agreements as of December 31, 2018. Both agreements are scheduled to expire upon completion of our 2016 Restructuring Plan activities.
