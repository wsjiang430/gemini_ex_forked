ITEM 1.     BUSINESS
 
Hooker Furniture Corporation, incorporated in Virginia in 1924, is a designer, marketer and importer of casegoods (wooden and metal furniture), leather furniture and fabric-upholstered furniture for the residential, hospitality and contract markets. We also domestically manufacture premium residential custom leather and custom fabric-upholstered furniture. We are ranked among the nation’s top five largest publicly traded furniture sources, based on 2017 shipments to U.S. retailers, according to a 2018 survey by a leading trade publication.
 
We believe that consumer tastes and channels in which they shop for furniture are evolving at a rapid pace and we continue to change to meet these demands.
 
Our strategy is to leverage the financial strength afforded us by Hooker’s slower-growing but highly profitable traditional businesses in order to boost revenues and earnings both organically and by acquiring companies selling in faster-growing channels of distribution in which our traditional businesses are under-represented. Consequently, Hooker acquired Home Meridian on February 1, 2016 and Shenandoah Furniture on September 29, 2017.
 
We believe our acquisition of Home Meridian has better positioned us in some of the fastest growing and advantaged channels of distribution, including e-commerce, warehouse membership clubs and contract furniture. While growing faster than industry average, these channels tend to operate at lower margins. This acquisition has provided the Home Meridian segment’s leadership with greater financial flexibility by virtue of Hooker’s strong balance sheet and, consequently, has afforded it greater operational focus.
 
We also believe our acquisition of Shenandoah Furniture, a North Carolina-based domestic upholsterer, has better positioned us in the “lifestyle specialty” retail distribution channel. For that channel, domestically-produced, customizable upholstery is extremely viable and preferred by the end consumers who shop at retailers in that channel.
 
Reportable Segments
 
Furniture sales account for all of our net sales. For financial reporting purposes and as described further below, we are organized into two reportable segments, Hooker Branded and Home Meridian. Our other businesses are aggregated into “All Other”. See Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements for additional financial information regarding our operating segments.

Sourcing
 
Imported Products
 
We have sourced products from foreign manufacturers for nearly thirty years, predominantly from Asia. Imported casegoods and upholstered furniture together accounted for approximately 84% of our net sales in fiscal 2019, 87% of our net sales in fiscal 2018, and 90% of our net sales in fiscal 2017. The decrease in imported casegoods and upholstered furniture sales as a percentage of total sales is primarily due to the Shenandoah acquisition on September 29, 2017, as that business’ products are entirely domestically manufactured.
 
Our imported furniture business is subject to inherent risks in importing products manufactured abroad, including, but not limited to, supply disruptions and delays, currency exchange rate fluctuations, transportation-related issues, economic and political developments and instability, as well as the laws, policies and actions of foreign governments and the United States. These laws, policies and actions may include regulations affecting trade or the application of tariffs, much like the current U.S. administration’s imposition of a 10% tariff on certain goods imported into the United States from China, including almost all furniture and furniture components manufactured in China during fiscal 2019. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors” for additional information on our risks related to imported products.
 
Because of the large number and diverse nature of the foreign suppliers from which we source our imported products, we have flexibility in the sourcing of products among any particular supplier or country. However, a disruption in our supply chain from a major supplier or from Vietnam or China in general, could significantly compromise our ability to fill customer orders for products manufactured at that factory or in that country. We believe we could, most likely at higher cost, source most of the products currently sourced in Vietnam or China from factories in other countries and could produce certain upholstered products domestically at our own factories. However, supply disruptions and delays on selected items could occur for up to six months. If we were to be unsuccessful in obtaining those products from other sources or at a comparable cost, then a disruption in our supply chain from a major furniture supplier, or from Vietnam or China in general, could decrease our sales, earnings and liquidity. Given the sourcing capacity available in China, Vietnam and other low-cost producing countries, we believe the risks from these potential supply disruptions are manageable.
 
For imported products, we generally negotiate firm pricing with foreign suppliers in U.S. Dollars, typically for a term of at least one year. We accept the exposure to exchange rate movements beyond these negotiated periods. We do not use derivative financial instruments to manage this risk but could choose to do so in the future. Since we transact our imported product purchases in U.S. Dollars, a relative decline in the value of the U.S. Dollar compared to the currencies from which we obtain our imported products could increase the price we pay for imported products beyond the negotiated periods. We generally expect to reflect substantially all of the effects of any price increases from suppliers in the prices we charge for imported products. However, these price changes could adversely impact sales volume and profit margin during affected periods. Conversely, a relative increase in the value of the U.S. Dollar compared to the currencies from which we obtain our imported products could decrease the cost of imported products and favorably impact net sales and profit margins during affected period. However, due to other factors, such as inflationary pressure in China and other countries, we may not fully realize savings when exchange rates fall. Therefore, lower exchange rates may only have a tempering effect on future price increases by merely delaying cost increases on imported products.

Raw Materials
 
Significant materials used in manufacturing our domestic upholstered furniture products include leather, fabric, foam, wooden and metal frames and electronic mechanisms. Most of the leather is imported from Italy, South America and China, and is purchased as full hides and cut and sewn in our facilities or is purchased as pre-cut and sewn kits processed by our vendors to our pattern specifications. We believe our sources for raw materials are adequate and that we are not dependent on any one supplier. Our five largest domestic upholstery suppliers accounted for approximately 28% of our raw materials purchases for domestic upholstered furniture manufacturing operations in fiscal 2019. One supplier accounted for 7.5% of such raw material purchases in fiscal 2019. Should disruptions with this supplier occur, we believe we could successfully source these products from other suppliers without significant disruption to our operations.
Customers
 
Our home furnishings products are sold through a variety of retailers including independent furniture stores, department stores, mass merchants, national chains, warehouse clubs, catalog merchants, interior designers and e-commerce retailers. No customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated sales in fiscal 2019. Our top five customers accounted for nearly one-third of our fiscal 2019 consolidated sales. The loss of any one or more of these customers would have a material adverse impact on our business. 1.2% of our sales in fiscal 2019 were to international customers, which we define as sales outside of the United States and Canada.
Competition
 
The furniture industry is highly competitive and includes a large number of foreign and domestic manufacturers and importers, none of which dominates the market in our price points. While the markets in which we compete include a large number of relatively small and medium-sized manufacturers, certain competitors have substantially greater sales volumes and financial resources than we do. U.S. imports of furniture produced overseas, such as from Vietnam and China, have stabilized in recent years. The primary competitive factors for home furnishings in our price points include price, style, availability, service, quality and durability. Competitive factors in the hospitality and contract furniture markets include product value and utility, lead times, on-time delivery and the ability to respond to requests for special and non-standard products. We believe our design capabilities, ability to import and/or manufacture upholstered furniture, product value, longstanding customer and supplier relationships, significant sales, distribution and inventory capabilities, ease of ordering, financial strength, experienced management and customer support are significant competitive advantages.
Warehousing and Distribution 
 
We distribute furniture to retailers directly from factories and warehouses in Asia via our container direct programs and from our distribution centers in Virginia, North Carolina and California, and in limited cases, from customer operated warehouses in strategic locations. It is our policy and industry practice to allow order cancellation for casegoods up to the time of shipment or, in the case of container direct orders, up until the time the container is booked with the ocean freight carrier, therefore, customer orders for casegoods are not firm. However, domestically produced upholstered products are predominantly custom-built and consequently, cannot be cancelled once the leather or fabric has been cut. Additionally, our hospitality products are highly customized and are generally not cancellable.
Working Capital Practices
 
Inventory: We generally import casegoods inventory and certain upholstery items in amounts that enable us to meet the delivery requirements of our customers, our internal in-stock goals and minimum purchase requirements from our sourcing partners. However, during fiscal 2019 we accelerated the delivery and subsequently increased inventory levels of some imported products from China due to the threat of the 10% tariff on those products and the threat of subsequent increased tariffs. However, a large percentage of products sold are not warehoused by us but ship directly to our customers and thus not included as inventory. We do not carry significant amounts of domestically produced upholstery inventory or hospitality products, as most of these products are built to order and are shipped shortly after their manufacture.

Accounts receivable: Substantially all of our trade accounts receivable are due from retailers and dealers that sell residential home furnishings or commercial purchasers of our hospitality and senior living products, which consist of a large number of entities with a broad geographic dispersion. We perform credit evaluations of our customers and generally do not require collateral. For qualified customers, we offer payment terms, generally requiring payment 30 days from shipment. However, we may offer extended payment terms in certain circumstances, including to promote sales of our products. We purchase accounts receivable insurance on certain customers if their risk profile warrants it and the insurance is available. Due to the highly-customized nature of our hospitality products, we typically require a 50% deposit with order, a 40% deposit before goods reach a U.S. port and the remaining 10% balance due within 30 days of the receipt of goods by the customer.
 
Accounts payable: Payment for our imported products warehoused first in Asia is due ten to fourteen days after our quality audit inspections are complete and the vendor invoice is presented. Payment for goods which are shipped to our US warehouses or container direct to our customers FOB Origin is generally due upon proof of lading onto a US-bound vessel and invoice presentation; however, payment terms, depending on supplier, can stretch up to 45 days from invoice date. Payment terms for domestic raw materials and non-inventory related charges vary but are generally 30 days from invoice date.
 
Order Backlog
 
At February 3, 2019, our backlog of unshipped orders was as follows:
 

 | Order Backlog | 
-----------------+-------------------+--------
 | (Dollars in 000s) | 
 | February 3, 2019 | | January 28, 2018
Reporting Entity | Dollars | | Weeks | | Dollars | | Weeks 
Hooker Branded | $ | 11,259 | | 3.3 | | $ | 15,189 | 4.7 
Home Meridian | | 79,024 | | 10.8 | | | 76,563 | 10.9
All Other | | 13,677 | | 6.2 | | | 14,527 | 8.5 
Consolidated | $ | 103,960 | | 8.1 | | $ | 106,279 | 8.9 

 
For the Hooker Branded segment and All Other, we consider unshipped order backlogs to be one helpful indicator of sales for the upcoming 30-day period, but because of our relatively quick delivery and our cancellation policies (discussed under Warehousing and Distribution, above), we do not consider order backlogs to be a reliable indicator of expected long-term sales. We consider the Home Meridian segment’s backlog to be one helpful indicator of that segment’s sales for the upcoming 90-day period. Due to (i) Home Meridian’s sales volume, (ii) the average sales order sizes of its mass, club and mega account channels of distribution, (iii) the custom nature of many of its products and (iv) the project nature of its hospitality business, that segment’s average order sizes tend to be larger and consequently, its order backlog tends to be larger.
 
Seasonality
 
Generally, sales in our fiscal first quarter are lower than our other fiscal quarters due to the post-Chinese New Year shipping lag and sales in our fiscal fourth quarter are generally stronger due to the pre-Chinese New Year surge in shipments from Asia and the product introduction schedule of a major customer.
Environmental Matters
 
As a part of our business operations, our manufacturing sites generate both non-hazardous and hazardous wastes; the treatment, storage, transportation and disposal of which are subject to various local, state and national laws relating to environmental protection. Our policy is to record monitoring commitments and environmental liabilities when expenses are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The costs associated with our environmental responsibilities, compliance with federal, state and local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or costs otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, have not had and are not expected to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, capital expenditures or competitive position.

Employees
 
As of February 3, 2019, we had 1,263 full-time employees, of which 235 were employed in our Hooker Branded segment, 387 were employed in our Home Meridian segment and 641 were employed in All Other. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
Patents and Trademarks 
 
The Hooker Furniture, Bradington-Young, Sam Moore, Pulaski Furniture, Samuel Lawrence Furniture, Samuel Lawrence Hospitality, Room Gear, Right2Home, Home Meridian International, Prime Resources International, Accentrics Home, Shenandoah, H Contract, and MARQ trade names represent many years of continued business.  We believe these trade names are well-recognized and associated with quality and service in the furniture industry.  We also own a number of patents and trademarks, both domestically and internationally, none of which is considered to be material. 
Governmental Regulations
 
Our company is subject to U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations in the areas of safety, health, employment and environmental pollution controls, as well as U.S. and international trade laws and regulations. We are also subject to foreign laws and regulations. In the past, compliance with these laws and regulations has not had any material effect on our earnings, capital expenditures, or competitive position in excess of those affecting others in our industry; however, the effect of compliance in the future cannot be predicted. We believe we are in material compliance with applicable U.S. and international laws and regulations.
