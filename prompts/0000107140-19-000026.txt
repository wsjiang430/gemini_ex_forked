Research:
 
Research’s mission is to support researchers, professionals and learners in the discovery and use of research knowledge to help them achieve their goals in research, learning and practice.  Research provides scientific, technical, medical, and scholarly journals, as well as related content and services, to academic, corporate, and government libraries, learned societies, and individual researchers and other professionals. Journal publishing areas include the physical sciences and engineering, health sciences, social sciences and humanities and life sciences. Research also includes Atypon Systems, Inc. (“Atypon”), a publishing software and service provider that enables scholarly and professional societies and publishers to deliver, host, enhance, market, and manage their content on the web through the Literatum platform. 
 
Research’s customers include academic, corporate, government, and public libraries, funders of research, researchers, scientists, clinicians, engineers and technologists, scholarly and professional societies, and students and professors. Research’s products are sold and distributed globally in digital and print formats through multiple channels, including research libraries and library consortia, independent subscription agents, direct sales to professional society members, and other customers. Publishing centers include Australia, China, Germany, India, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Research’s revenue accounted for approximately 52% of our consolidated revenue in the year ended April 30, 2019.
 
Research’s major products are: Journal Subscriptions, Licensing, Reprints, Backfiles, and Other, Open Access and Publishing Technology Services (Atypon). The graphs below present Research revenue by product type for the years ended April 30, 2019 and 2018:
 

Key growth strategies for the Research business include evolving and developing new licensing models for our institutional customers, developing new open access products and revenue streams, focusing resources on high-growth and emerging markets, and developing new digital products, services, and workflow solutions to meet the needs of researchers, authors, societies, and corporate customers.
    Journal Subscriptions
 
We publish approximately 1,700 academic research journals. We sell journal subscriptions directly through our sales representatives, indirectly through independent subscription agents, through promotional campaigns, and through memberships in professional societies for those journals that are sponsored by societies. Journal subscriptions, making up approximately 37% of our consolidated 2019 total company revenue, are primarily licensed through contracts for digital content available online through Wiley Online Library, which we migrated to our Literatum platform in March 2018, acquired as part of our purchase of Atypon. Contracts are negotiated by us directly with customers or their subscription agents. Subscription periods typically cover calendar years. Print journals are generally mailed to subscribers directly from independent printers. We do not own or manage printing facilities. Subscription revenue is generally collected in advance.
 
Approximately 50% of Journal Subscription revenue is derived from publishing rights owned by us. Publishing alliances also play a major role in Research’s success. Approximately 50% of Journal Subscription revenue is derived from publication rights that are owned by professional societies and published by us pursuant to a long-term contract (generally 5–10 years) or owned jointly with a professional society. These society alliances bring mutual benefit, with the societies gaining Wiley’s publishing, marketing, sales, and distribution expertise, while Wiley benefits from being affiliated with prestigious societies and their members. Societies that sponsor or own such journals generally receive a royalty and/or other financial consideration. We may procure editorial services from such societies on a pre-negotiated fee basis. We also enter into agreements with outside independent editors of journals that define the duties of the editors and the fees and expenses for their services. Contributors of articles to our journal portfolio transfer publication rights to us or a professional society, as applicable. We publish the journals of many prestigious societies, including the American Cancer Society, the American Heart Association, the British Journal of Surgery Society, the European Molecular Biology Organization, the American Anthropological Association, the American Geophysical Union, and the German Chemical Society.

Literatum, our online publishing platform for our Research segment, delivers integrated access to over 7 million articles from 1,700 journals, as well as 19,000 online books and hundreds of multi-volume reference works, laboratory protocols and databases. Wiley Online Library, which is delivered through our Literatum platform, provides the user with intuitive navigation, enhanced discoverability, expanded functionality, and a range of personalization options. Access to abstracts is free and full content is accessible through licensing agreements or as individual article purchases. Large portions of the content are provided free or at nominal cost to nations in the developing world through partnerships with certain non-profit organizations. Our online publishing platforms provide revenue growth opportunities through new applications and business models, online advertising, deeper market penetration, and individual sales and pay-per-view options. The Literatum platform hosts over 40% of the world’s English language journals.
 
In 2018, Wiley saw an increase in impact factors across more than half of its indexed titles. An Impact Factor is an industry measure of the importance of a journal within its field and is determined based on the number of citations received by the journal, from other journals. According to the 2017 Journal Citation Reports (“JCR”), re-released in October 2018 by Clarivate Analytics, 58% of Wiley journals increased their impact factor between 2016 and 2017.  Wiley had 1,221 journals indexed (72% of the Wiley portfolio), with 13 Wiley titles receiving their first impact factor in this year’s JCR release. In addition, 25 Wiley journals achieved a top-category rank, including CA:A Cancer Journal for Clinicians (Impact Factor of 244.585, ranked #1 in Oncology), World Psychiatry (Impact Factor of 30.000, ranked #1 in Psychiatry – the first Social Sciences title to reach an Impact Factor of 30) and Journal of Cachexia, Sarcopenia and Muscle (Impact Factor of 12.511, ranked #1 in Geriatrics & Gerontology). The Clarivate Analytics index is a barometer of journal influence across the research community.
 
Licensing, Reprints, Backfiles, and Other
 
Licensing, Reprints, Backfiles, and Other includes advertising, backfile sales, the licensing of publishing rights, journal and article reprints, and individual article sales. We generate advertising revenue from print and online journal subscription products, our online publishing platform, Literatum, online events such as webinars and virtual conferences, community interest Web sites such as spectroscopyNOW.com, and other Web sites.  A backfile license provides access to a historical collection of Wiley journals, generally for a one-time fee. We also engage with international publishers and receive licensing revenue from photocopies, reproductions, translations, and other digital uses of our content. Journal and article reprints are primarily used by pharmaceutical companies and other industries for marketing and promotional purposes. Through the Article Select and PayPerView programs, we provide fee-based access to non-subscribed journal articles, content, book chapters, and major reference work articles. The Research business is also a provider of content and services in evidence-based medicine (“EBM”). Through our alliance with The Cochrane Collaboration, we publish The Cochrane Library, a premier source of high-quality independent evidence to inform healthcare decision-making. EBM facilitates the effective management of patients through clinical expertise informed by best practice evidence that is derived from medical literature.
Open Access
 
Under the Author-Funded Access business model, accepted research articles are published subject to payment of Article Publication Charges ("APCs"). All Author-Funded articles are immediately free to access online. Contributors of Author-Funded Access articles retain many rights and typically license their work under terms that permit re-use.
 
Author-Funded Access offers authors choices in how to share and disseminate their work, and it serves the needs of researchers who may be required by their research funder to make articles freely accessible without embargo. APCs are typically paid by the individual author or by the author’s funder, and payments are often mediated by the author’s institution. We provide specific workflows and infrastructure to authors, funders, and institutions to support the requirements of the Author-Funded Access model.
 
We offer two Open Access publishing models. The first of these is Hybrid Open Access where, upon payment of an APC, authors publishing in the majority of our paid subscription journals are offered, after article acceptance, the opportunity to make their individual research article openly available through the OnlineOpen service.
 
The second offering of the Open Access model is a growing portfolio of fully open access journals, also known as Gold Open Access Journals, in which all accepted articles are published subject to receipt of an APC. All Open Access articles are subject to the same rigorous peer-review process applied to our subscription-based journals. As with our subscription portfolio, a number of the Gold Open Access Journals are published under contract for, or in partnership with, prestigious societies, including the American Geophysical Union, the American Heart Association, the European Molecular Biology Organization and the British Ecological Society. The Open Access portfolio spans life, physical, medical and social sciences and includes a choice of high impact journals and broad-scope titles that offer a responsive, author-centered service.
 
In January 2019, Wiley announced a new contractual arrangement in support of Open Access, a countrywide partnership agreement with Projekt DEAL, a representative of nearly 700 academic institutions in Germany. This transformative three-year agreement provides all Projekt DEAL institutions with access to read Wiley’s academic journals back to the year 1997, and researchers at Projekt DEAL institutions can publish articles open access in Wiley’s journals. The partnership will better support institutions and researchers in advancing open science, driving discovery, and developing and disseminating knowledge. We are compensated primarily through a fee per article published.

Communities served include business, finance, accounting, workplace learning, management, leadership, technology, behavioral health, engineering/ architecture, science and medicine, and education.  Products are developed in print and digitally for worldwide distribution through multiple channels, including chain and online booksellers, libraries, colleges and universities, corporations, direct to consumer, Web sites, distributor networks and other online applications. Publishing centers include Australia, Germany, India, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Publishing accounted for approximately 32% of our consolidated revenue in the year ended April 30, 2019.
    Publishing revenue by product type are: STM (Scientific, Technical and Medical) and Professional Publishing, Education Publishing, Test Preparation and Certification, Courseware (WileyPLUS), and Licensing, Distribution, Advertising and Other. The graphs below present Publishing revenue by product type for the years ended April 30, 2019 and 2018:
 
Key growth strategies for the Publishing business include developing and acquiring products and services to drive corporate development and professional career development, developing leading brands and franchises, executing strategic acquisitions and partnerships, and innovating digital book formats while expanding their global discoverability and distribution. We continue to implement strategies to manage declines in print revenue through cost improvement initiatives and focusing our efforts on growing its digital lines of business. We are continuing to perform portfolio reviews and workforce realignment, restructuring, and operational excellence initiatives. In certain areas, we will explore new formats or promote digital-only, and in other areas, we may rationalize our portfolio. Our approach is to continue to realign our cost structure to help mitigate the market changes that are contributing to revenue decline, and to sharpen our focus on high performing areas and digital opportunities, while improving operating efficiency.
 
Publishing
 
Book products accounted for approximately 24% of our consolidated fiscal year 2019 revenue. Categories include STM, Professional, and Education Publishing.
 
STM books are sold and distributed globally in digital and print formats through multiple channels, including research libraries and library consortia, independent subscription agents, direct sales to professional society members, bookstores, online booksellers, and other customers.
 
Professional books, which include business and finance, technology, and other professional categories, as well as the For Dummies brand, are sold to bookstores and online booksellers serving the general public, wholesalers who supply such bookstores, warehouse clubs, college bookstores, individual practitioners, industrial organizations and government agencies. We employ sales representatives who call upon independent bookstores, national and regional chain bookstores, and wholesalers. Sales of professional books also result from direct mail campaigns, telemarketing, online access, advertising, and reviews in periodicals.

Education textbooks and related supplementary material and digital products are sold primarily to bookstores and online booksellers serving both for-profit and nonprofit educational institutions (primarily colleges and universities), and direct-to-students. We employ sales representatives who call on faculty responsible for selecting books to be used in courses, and on the bookstores that serve such institutions and their students. The textbook business is seasonal, with the majority of textbook sales occurring during the July-through- October and December-through-January periods. There are active used and rental print textbook markets, which adversely affect the sale of new textbooks. We are exploring opportunities to expand into the print rental market.
 
Book sales for STM, Professional and Education Publishing are generally made on a returnable basis with certain restrictions. We provide for estimated future returns on sales made during the year based on historical return experience and current market trends.
 
Materials for book publications are obtained from authors throughout most of the world, utilizing the efforts of an editorial staff, outside editorial advisors, and advisory boards. Most materials are originated by the authors themselves or as a result of suggestion or solicitations by editors and advisors. We enter into agreements with authors that state the terms and conditions under which the materials will be published, the name in which the copyright will be registered, the basis for any royalties, and other matters. Most of the authors are compensated with royalties, which vary depending on the nature of the product. We may make advance royalty payments against future royalties to authors of certain publications. Royalty advances are reviewed for recoverability and a reserve for loss is maintained, if appropriate.
 
We continue to add new titles, revise existing titles, and discontinue the sale of others in the normal course of our business, and we also create adaptations of original content for specific markets based on customer demand. Our general practice is to revise our textbooks approximately every three years, if warranted, and to revise other titles as appropriate. Subscription-based products are updated on a more frequent basis.
 
We generally contract with independent printers and binderies globally for their services. Management believes that adequate printing and binding facilities and sources of paper and other required materials are available to it, and that it is not dependent upon any single supplier.
 
In fiscal year 2016, we entered into an agreement to outsource our US-based book distribution operations to Cengage Learning, with the continued aim of improving efficiency in our distribution activities and moving to a more variable cost model. As of April 30, 2019, we had one global warehousing and distribution facility remaining, which is in the United Kingdom.
 
We develop content in a digital format that can be used for both digital and print products, resulting in productivity and efficiency savings, and enabling print-on-demand delivery. Book content is available online through Wiley Online Library (delivered through our Literatum platform), WileyPLUS, Wiley Custom Select, and other proprietary platforms. Digital books are delivered to intermediaries, including Amazon, Apple, Google and Ingram/Vital-Source, for re-sale to individuals in various industry-standard formats, which are now the preferred deliverable for licensees of all types, including foreign language publishers. Digital books are also licensed to libraries through aggregators. Specialized formats for digital textbooks go to distributors servicing the academic market, and digital book collections are sold by subscription through independent third-party aggregators servicing distinct communities. Custom deliverables are provided to corporations, institutions, and associations to educate their employees, generate leads for their products, and extend their brands. Content from digital books is also used to create online articles, mobile apps, newsletters, and promotional collateral. This continual re-use of content improves margins, speeds delivery, and helps satisfy a wide range of customer needs. Our online presence not only enables us to deliver content online, but also to sell more books. The growth of online booksellers benefits us because they provide unlimited virtual “shelf space” for our entire backlist.
 
Publishing alliances and franchise products are important to our strategy. Professional publishing alliance partners include the AICPA, the CFA Institute, ACT (American College Test), IEEE, American Institute of Chemical Engineers, and many others.  Education publishing alliance partners include Microsoft®, Blackboard, Instructure, and the Culinary Institute of America. The ability to join Wiley’s product development, sales, marketing, distribution, and technology with a partner’s content, technology, and/or brand name has contributed to our success.
 
We also promote active and growing custom professional and education publishing programs. Our custom professional publications are used by professional organizations for internal promotional or incentive programs and include digital and print books written specifically for a customer and customizations of existing publications to include custom cover art, such as imprints, messages, and slogans. More specific are customized For Dummies publications, which leverage the power of this well-known brand to meet the specific information needs of a wide range of organizations around the world. Our custom education publishing program offers an array of tools and services designed to put the creation of customized content in instructors’ hands to create high-quality, affordable education solutions tailored to meet individual classroom needs. Through Wiley Custom Select, an online custom textbook system, instructors can build print and digital materials tailored to their specific course needs and add their own content to create a customized solution.

Education Services include market research, marketing, student recruitment, enrollment support, proactive retention support, academic services to design courses, faculty support, and access to the Engage Learning Management System, which facilitates the online education experience. Graduate degree programs include Business Administration, Finance, Accounting, Healthcare, Engineering, Communications, and others.
