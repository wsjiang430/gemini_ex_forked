ITEM 1 – BUSINESSOVERVIEW 
 We are a clinical stage biotechnology company focused on translating ground-breaking science into genomic medicines with the potential to transform patients’ lives using our platform technologies in genome editing, gene therapy, gene regulation and cell therapy. We are focused on three therapeutic areas:  inherited metabolic diseases, or IMDs, central nervous system diseases and inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.
 We are a leader in the research and development of zinc finger proteins, or ZFPs, a naturally occurring class of proteins found in humans. We have used our knowledge and expertise to develop a proprietary technology platform in both genome editing and gene regulation. ZFPs can be engineered to make zinc finger nucleases, or ZFNs, proteins that can be used to specifically modify DNA sequences by adding or knocking out specific genes, or genome editing, and ZFP transcription factors, or ZFP TFs, proteins that can be used to increase or decrease gene expression, or gene regulation. In the process of developing this platform, we have accrued significant scientific, manufacturing and development capabilities and know-how that are generally applicable in the broader field of gene therapy and have capitalized this knowledge into a conventional gene therapy platform.
 Our strategy is to maximize the value and therapeutic use of our technology platforms. In certain therapeutic areas we intend to capture the value of our proprietary genome editing and gene therapy products by forward integrating into manufacturing, development and commercial operations. In other therapeutic areas we intend to partner with biopharmaceutical companies to develop products as appropriate. Decisions to partner product candidates or not will be based on the best way to bring new medicines to patients and on an evaluation of our capacity to bring such products to commercial stage rapidly and efficiently on our own.
 
In August 2018, we announced positive preliminary data from the Alta Study, a Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating SB-525, a complementary DNA, or cDNA, gene therapy candidate for hemophilia A. SB-525 is being developed as part of a global collaboration between us and Pfizer Inc., or Pfizer, for the development and commercialization of potential gene therapy programs for hemophilia A. In October 2018, the independent safety monitoring committee, or SMC, of the Alta Study reviewed accumulated safety and efficacy data from the six patients enrolled in three dose cohorts. The SMC recommended that the study continue with escalation to an additional dose. We plan to present safety and efficacy data from the Alta Study in 2019 after dose escalation is complete and the clinical trial has progressed to the cohort expansion phase.
 
In September 2018 we announced preliminary safety and efficacy data from the Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating SB-913 for the treatment of MPS II, or the CHAMPIONS Study. In October 2018, the SMC of the CHAMPIONS Study reviewed accumulated safety and efficacy data from all three cohorts. In February 2019, we announced interim results from the CHAMPIONS Study. SB-913 showed preliminary evidence of in vivo genome editing in patients with MPS 
II and was generally well-tolerated with no treatment-related serious adverse events.
 
We have an ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating SB-318 for the treatment of MPS I, or the EMPOWERS Study. In October 2018, the SMC reviewed accumulated safety and efficacy data from the EMPOWERS Study. In accordance with the recommendation of the SMC, the second patient enrolled in the EMPOWERS Study received the 5e13 vg/kg dose, or the highest dose. In February 2019, we announced interim results from the EMPOWERS Study. SB-318 demonstrated a dose-dependent increase in leukocyte alpha-L-iduronidase, or IDUA, enzyme activity in patients with MPS I and was generally well-tolerated with no treatment related serious adverse events.
 
We are also evaluating SB-FIX in a Phase 1/2 open-label, ascending dose clinical trial which is designed to assess the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of SB-FIX in adults with severe hemophilia B. The study is currently screening subjects in the United States and the United Kingdom. Recently, we announced the treatment of the first patient in this trial and expect to announce preliminary safety and efficacy data in 2019.
 We are evaluating ST-400 in a Phase 1/2 open-label, single arm clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy in up to six adult subjects with beta-thalassemia. Our IND submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, for ST-400 became effective in September 2017. The clinical trial was initiated in March 2018 and the first patient was enrolled in August 2018 and dosed in January 2019. 
 In the fourth quarter of 2018, we acquired 98.2% of the outstanding share capital and voting rights of TxCell S.A., or TxCell, which we refer to in this report as the TxCell Acquisition, for aggregate purchase consideration of approximately $80.4 million. As of December 31, 2018 the fair value of the remaining outstanding free shares was approximately $1.3 million. The total fair value of the net assets acquired was approximately $81.7 million (see Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements – Acquisition of TxCell, S.A.).

With the TxCell Acquisition, we can now accelerate our research and development of innovative, personalized T-cell immunotherapies for the treatment of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases with high unmet medical need. In this regard, we expect that the TxCell Acquisition will accelerate our entry into the clinic with a CAR-Treg (which is a regulatory T cell, or Treg, genetically modified with a chimeric antigen receptor, or CAR) therapy. We are evaluating the potential of the TxCell platform in solid organ transplantation as well as a range of autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel diseases and inflammatory skin diseases. In addition, we intend to use our ZFN gene editing technology to potentially develop next-generation autologous and allogeneic CAR-Treg cell therapies for use in treating autoimmune diseases
 We have a substantial intellectual property position including the design, selection, manufacture, composition and use of engineered ZFPs, CAR Tregs and cell therapies to support our research and development activities. We continue to license and file new patent applications that strengthen our patent portfolio. We believe that our intellectual property position is a critical element in our ability to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize products and services based on genome editing, gene therapy, gene regulation and cell therapy.
 INTRODUCTION TO TECHNOLOGY
 ZFPs are Naturally Occurring Transcription Factors in Humans
 A transcription factor recognizes and binds to a specific DNA sequence within or near a particular gene and causes expression of that gene to be “turned on” (activated) or “turned off” (repressed). ZFPs are the most common class of naturally occurring transcription factors in organisms from yeast to humans. To these naturally occurring transcription factors, we have added functional domains which enable genome editing at the site determined by the ZFP DNA-binding domain. 
Figure 1:
 
Schematic of the two-domain structure of a ZFP and its therapeutic functional domain
 ZFNs can be designed for genome editing and ZFP TFs can be designed for gene regulation 
 Consistent with the modular structure of natural ZFPs, we take a modular approach to the design of the proteins that we engineer. The ZFP portion of our engineered proteins, the DNA-recognition domain, is typically composed of four to six zinc fingers. Each individual finger recognizes and binds to a three or four base pair sequence of DNA and multiple fingers can be linked together to recognize longer stretches of DNA, thereby improving specificity. By modifying the amino acid sequence of a ZFP, we can engineer novel ZFPs capable of recognizing the DNA sequences of a chosen genomic target. We use the engineered ZFP DNA-binding domain to link to a functional domain. The ZFP DNA-binding domain brings the functional domain to the target of interest. Our ability to use our highly specific ZFP technology to precisely target a DNA sequence in a gene of interest provides us with a range of genome editing and gene regulation functions that we believe can be applied in many different cell types. 
 5

Our engineered ZFPs can be attached to a cleavage domain of a restriction endonuclease, an enzyme that cuts DNA, creating a ZFN. When a pair of ZFNs is bound to the DNA in the correct orientation and spacing, the DNA sequence is cut between the ZFP binding sites. DNA binding by both ZFNs is necessary for cleavage, and both nuclease of the restriction endonuclease must be present in the correct orientation to interact with each other, in order to mediate DNA cleavage. This break in the DNA triggers a natural process of DNA repair in the cell. The repair process can be harnessed to achieve one of several outcomes that may be therapeutically useful (Figure 2). If cells are simply treated with ZFNs alone, the repair process joins the two ends of the broken DNA together and frequently results in the loss or addition of a small amount of genetic material at the site of the break. This disrupts the original DNA sequence and can result in the expression of a truncated or non-functional protein from the targeted gene, effectively “knocking out” the gene function. ZFN-mediated genome editing can be used to disrupt genes that are involved in disease pathology. We are using ZFN-mediated genome editing of the BCL11A erythroid enhancer in hematopoietic stem progenitor cells, or HSPCs, which is designed to be a single long-lasting treatment for beta-thalassemia (ST-400) and sickle cell disease, or SCD (BIVV-003). 
 
Figure 2: 
 Schematic of ZFP genome editing and gene regulation
 In contrast, if cells with a mutation in a particular gene are treated not only with ZFNs, but also with a DNA sequence that encodes the correct gene sequence (referred to as a “donor” DNA) and with ZFNs that recognize and bind to sequences flanking the mutation, the cell’s repair machinery can use the donor as a template to correct the mutated gene. This ZFN-mediated gene correction enables the corrected gene to be expressed in its natural chromosomal context and may provide a novel approach for the precise repair of DNA sequence mutations responsible for certain monogenic diseases. In addition to providing a donor sequence that encodes a complete gene, a new copy of a gene can also be precisely added into the genome at a specific location. The ability to precisely place a gene-sized segment of DNA specifically into a pre-determined location in the genome broadens the range of mutations of a gene that can be corrected in a single step. It also reduces the insertional mutagenesis concerns associated with traditional integrating gene replacement approaches such as lentiviruses, in which the insertion of a new corrective copy of the gene typically occurs at random locations in the genome. Our ZFN technology is used to insert a gene encoding a therapeutic protein into a location such as the Albumin gene, is an approach that we are investigating for the treatment of hemophilia B (SB-FIX) and MPS I and MPS II (SB-318 and SB-913), which we believe may potentially provide a single and potentially curative treatment for these diseases. 
 6

We are also evaluating ZFP TFs with the potential to control or regulate the expression of a target gene in the desired manner (Figure 2). For instance, attaching an activation domain to a ZFP will cause a target gene to be expressed at enhanced levels, relative to expression in an untreated cell. Alternatively, a repression domain causes the gene to be downregulated or completely turned off. Pursuant to a collaboration agreement with Shire International GmbH, or Shire, a wholly owned subsidiary of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, or Takeda, we have a preclinical program for Huntington’s disease in which we are evaluating a ZFP TF designed to differentially down regulate the mutated disease-causing Huntingtin, or HTT, gene, while leaving expression of the normal gene unchanged. 
 ZFPs provide the Opportunity to Develop a New Class of Human Therapeutics 
 We believe that our ZFP technology provides a unique and proprietary basis for a broad new class of drugs that have differential technical advantages over small-molecule drugs, protein pharmaceuticals, RNA-based therapeutics, conventional gene therapy approaches and other genome editing platforms, potentially enabling us to develop therapies for a broad range of unmet medical needs. 
 We can generate highly specific ZFNs for genome editing and ZFP TFs for gene regulation and have developed multiple delivery strategies to administer these therapeutics, including using mRNA, AAV, adenovirus, plasmid, and lipid nanoparticles. As more genes and DNA sequences are linked to specific diseases, we believe that the clinical breadth and scope of our ZFP applications will continue to expand. 
 New ZFN Architectures
 
In 2017, our scientists reported on platform advancements that substantially enhanced the precision, efficiency and specificity of ZFNs for therapeutic genome editing. We believe these advances enable rapid development of ZFNs to target chosen genomic sites with high levels of targeted modification and with no detectable off-target activity. These advances include the development of new linkers that enable base skipping between adjacent zinc finger modules as well as a reconfiguring of the ZFN architecture to allow optional placement of the Fok1 nuclease domain at either the carboxy terminal or the amino terminal end. The enhancements also include the identification of key amino acid substitutions that can be used to tune biochemical properties and remove non-specific binding contacts between the ZFN and the DNA backbone. 
 
In February 2019, we announced our development of second generation, potentially more potent ZFN constructs designed to increase editing efficiency. In vitro data of these second-generation ZFNs were reviewed by the FDA. The in vitro data showed three potential advantages for use in the clinic: (1) a five to thirty-fold improvement in efficiency and potency due to structural changes; (2) the ability to function equally well in the patients who have a single nucleotide polymorphism in the target locus in the albumin gene (approximately 20% of the population); (3) improvements in specificity. The second-generation ZFNs are being manufactured and we expect to have them available for use in the clinic later this year. Additional data from our in vivo genome editing programs will be assessed before potential integration plans for the second-generation ZFNs are finalized.
 
Advancements in T Cell Editing Capabilities 
 
In May 2018, we presented preclinical data demonstrating our ability to accomplish highly efficient multiplex genome editing of T cells. Efficient multiplex editing, the ability to make multiple genetic changes in a single step, enables simultaneous disruption of certain genes to prevent the body from rejecting the treatment and integration of new genes to equip the modified T cells with targeted antitumor functions. In the presented data, we described a T cell with four edits achieved in a single step. The four simultaneous edits included triple knockout of TCR (93% efficiency), b2 microglobulin, or B2M, (96% efficiency), CISH, a checkpoint gene (93% efficiency), and targeted insertion of green fluorescent protein, or GFP, (91% efficiency), resulting in 76% of the modified T cells with all four edits. 
 
Our T cell engineering capabilities have advanced rapidly in the last two years with improvements in our ZFN design capabilities. These novel architectural enhancements have resulted in a 300-fold increase in potential design options for a given genetic sequence, yielding higher on-target modification activity in preclinical testing, with ex vivo editing efficiencies now reaching as high as 99.5%, and off-target cleavage consistently below the level of detection. We believe these improvements potentially allow for the use of substantially reduced doses of mRNA and AAV, enabling a highly efficient gene editing process that maintains T cell phenotypes, functions and proliferative capacity during ex vivo cell expansion.
 TxCell - Regulatory T Cells
           With the TxCell Acquisition, we can now accelerate our research and development of platforms for innovative, personalized T-cell immunotherapies for the treatment of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases with high unmet medical need. Through our 
 7

subsidiary, TxCell, we believe we will accelerate our entry into the clinic with a CAR-Treg. We are evaluating the potential of the TxCell platform in solid organ transplantation as well as a range of autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel diseases and inflammatory skin diseases. In addition, we intend to use our ZFN gene editing technology to potentially develop next-generation autologous and allogeneic CAR-Treg cell therapies for use in treating autoimmune diseases.
 
Our CAR Tregs are composed of Tregs engineered with a CAR. The antigen specificity comes from the CAR receptor as shown below.

After their isolation from the blood of patients, Tregs are genetically modified by transduction with CAR. The CAR introduced into Tregs is designed to allow Treg activation and immuno-modulation through in vivo recognition of a protein present in inflamed areas in patients suffering from autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases.
 

THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT 
 Our Product Development Programs


Hemophilia A and B 
 Hemophilia is a rare bleeding disorder in which the blood does not clot normally. It is also a monogenic disease, or a disease that is caused by a genetic defect in a single gene. There are several types of hemophilia caused by mutations in genes that encode factors which help the blood clot and stop bleeding when blood vessels are injured. Individuals with hemophilia experience bleeding 
 8

episodes after injuries and spontaneous bleeding episodes that often lead to joint disease such as arthritis. The most severe forms of hemophilia affect males. The standard treatment for individuals with hemophilia is replacement of the defective clotting factor with regular infusion of recombinant clotting factors or plasma concentrates. These therapies are expensive and sometimes stimulate the body to produce antibodies against the factors that inhibit the benefits of treatment. In these situations, other clotting factors such as Factor VII and X may be used to treat patients. 
 The most prevalent form of the disease, hemophilia A, is caused by a defect in the clotting Factor 8 gene. According to the National Hemophilia Foundation and the World Federation of Hemophilia, hemophilia A occurs in about one in every 5,000 male births in the United States, with approximately 16,000 males currently affected. Defects in clotting Factor 9 gene lead to hemophilia B. Hemophilia B occurs in about one in every 25,000 male births in the United States, with approximately 4,000 males currently affected. 
 SB-525 – Hemophilia A 
 We are developing SB-525, a gene therapy product candidate utilizing an AAV carrying a clotting Factor 8 gene construct that is driven by our proprietary synthetic liver specific promoter, as part of a global collaboration between us and Pfizer for the development and commercialization of potential gene therapy programs for hemophilia A (See “—Collaborations—Pfizer Inc.”). 
 In 2017, we initiated the Alta Study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of SB-525 in adults with severe hemophilia A. The Alta Study is an open-label, ascending-dose clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of SB-525 in up to 20 adults with severe hemophilia A. In August 2017, we announced that the first subject was treated in our Alta Study. In August 2018, we announced positive preliminary data from the Alta Study. In October 2018, the SMC of the Alta Study reviewed accumulated safety and efficacy data from the six patients enrolled in three dose cohorts. As of that review, SB-525 exhibited dose dependent efficacy on serum factor levels and was generally well-tolerated with no treatment-related serious adverse events and no use of tapering courses of oral steroids. The SMC recommended that the study continue with escalation to an additional dose. We plan to present safety and efficacy data from the Alta Study in 2019 after dose escalation is complete and the clinical trial has progressed to the cohort expansion phase.
 SB-525 has been granted Orphan Drug and Fast Track designations by the FDA as well as Orphan Medicinal Product designation by the European Medicines Agency, or EMA. 
 SB-FIX – Hemophilia B

 We are developing SB-FIX, an in vivo genome editing product candidate, to treat hemophilia B. Utilizing our ZFN genome editing technology, we are adding a new therapeutic copy of the Factor 9 gene precisely into the Albumin gene locus in liver cells, and using the strong endogenous Albumin promoter to drive expression of the newly inserted gene. We believe the potential of this approach to provide a permanent correction for a patient may be optimal for a pediatric population by potentially reducing or eliminating the need for chronic infusions of replacement proteins or clotting factor products. We have published data demonstrating the potential utility of this approach for several different monogenic disease applications in addition to hemophilia B.
 In 2016, we initiated a Phase 1/2, open-label, ascending dose clinical trial, the FIXtendz Study, to evaluate safety and efficacy of SB-FIX in adult males with severe hemophilia B. The FIXtendz Study is designed to enroll up to 12 subjects across three dose cohorts. In February 2018, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, of the United Kingdom granted Clinical Trial Authorisation, or CTA, for enrollment of subjects into the FIXtendz Study. The CTA permits evaluation of SB-FIX in adults. Recently, we announced the treatment of the first adult patient in this study and expect to announce safety and efficacy data in 2019.
 SB-FIX has been granted Orphan Drug and Fast Track designations by the FDA.
 Inherited Metabolic Diseases, or IMDs
 IMDs are a heterogeneous group of rare inherited metabolic disorders including: MPS I, MPS II, Fabry disease, Gaucher disease; and many others. These disorders are caused by defects in genes that encode proteins known as enzymes, which break down and eliminate unwanted substances in cells. These enzymes are found in structures called lysosomes which act as recycling sites in cells, breaking down unwanted material into simple products. A defect in a lysosomal enzyme leads to the accumulation of toxic levels of the substance that the enzyme would normally eliminate. These toxic levels may cause cell damage which can lead to serious health problems.
 MPS I is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the alpha-L-iduronidase, or IDUA, enzyme, resulting in a deficiency of IDUA enzyme, which is required for the degradation of the glycosaminoglycans, or GAGs, dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate. The inability to degrade GAGs leads to their accumulation within the lysosomes throughout the body. Individuals with this mutation experience multi-organ dysfunction and damage. Depending on the severity of the mutations and degree of residual enzyme activity, 
 9

affected individuals may develop enlarged internal organs, joint stiffness, skeletal deformities, corneal clouding, hearing loss and cognition impairments. Three forms of MPS I, in order of increasing severity, include Scheie, Hurler-Scheie and Hurler syndromes. According to the National Organization for Rare Disorders, one in 500,000 births in the United States will result in Scheie syndrome, one in 115,000 births will result in Hurler/Scheie, and one in 100,000 births will result in Hurler syndrome. There are approximately 1,000 MPS I patients in the United States. 
 MPS II is an X-linked disorder primarily affecting males and caused by mutations in the gene encoding the IDS enzyme. This results in a deficiency of IDS enzyme, which is required for the degradation of GAGs. Similar to MPS I, the inability to degrade GAGs leads to their accumulation within the lysosomes throughout the body. Individuals with this mutation experience multi-organ dysfunction and damage. Children with MPS II appear normal at birth but begin showing symptoms of developmental delay by age 2 – 3 years. Depending on the severity of the mutations and degree of residual enzyme activity, affected individuals may develop delayed development, enlarged internal organs, cardiovascular disorders, stunted growth and skeletal abnormalities and hearing loss. The disorder is progressive, and symptoms range from mild (normal cognitive function) to severe (cognitively impaired). According to the National MPS Society, approximately one in 100,000 to one in 170,000 births, primarily male births, in the United States will result in MPS II. There are approximately 500 MPS II patients in the United States. 
 Fabry disease is an X-linked disorder primarily affecting males and caused by a mutation in the gene encoding the alpha-galactosidase A, or alpha-Gal A, enzyme, resulting in a deficiency of alpha-Gal A enzyme, which is required for the degradation of the ganglioside globotriaosylceramide, a particular type of fatty substance. The inability to degrade this fatty substance leads to its accumulation within the lysosomes throughout the body. Individuals with this mutation experience multi-organ dysfunction and damage. Depending on the severity of the mutations and degree of residual enzyme activity, affected individuals may develop progressive kidney damage, heart attack, stroke, gastrointestinal complications, corneal opacity, tinnitus and hearing loss. Milder forms of the disorder present later in life and affect only the heart or kidneys. According to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, U.S. National Library of Medicine, one in 40,000 to one in 60,000 male births in the United States will result in Fabry disease. There are approximately 2,200 males with Fabry disease in the United States. This mutation can also occur in females, however, is less common and the frequency is unknown.
 There are limited treatments currently available for MPS I, MPS II and Fabry disease. For individuals with MPS I, there are only two options: hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, or HSCT, for those with the most severe form of the disease (Hurler) and ERT for patients with the attenuated forms of the disease (Hurler-Scheie, Scheie). However, the reported mortality rate after HSCT is approximately 15% and the survival rate with successful engraftment is 56%. Most patients with milder forms of the disease receive weekly ERT, usually in a doctor’s office. These IDUA enzyme infusions take on average four to six hours to administer. Weekly and bi-weekly ERT infusions are the only available approved treatment options for MPS II and Fabry disease, respectively. Because of the availability of few approved treatment options that effectively and safely treat these diseases, there remains significant unmet medical need.
 SB-318 – MPS I
 We are developing SB-318, an in vivo genome editing product candidate, to treat MPS I. Using the same approach as our hemophilia B product candidate, SB-FIX, we are adding a new therapeutic copy of the IDUA gene precisely into the Albumin gene locus in the genome of liver cells, using the strong endogenous Albumin promoter to drive expression of the newly inserted gene. We believe the potential of this approach to provide a permanent correction for a patient may be optimal for a pediatric population by potentially reducing or eliminating the need for chronic ERT infusions. 
 In 2017, we initiated the EMPOWERS Study to evaluate SB-318 in adult subjects with attenuated MPS I. The EMPOWERS Study is designed to enroll up to nine subjects across three ascending dose cohorts.

In October 2018, the SMC reviewed accumulated safety and efficacy data from the EMPOWERS Study. In accordance with the recommendation of the SMC, the second patient enrolled in the EMPOWERS Study received the 5e13 vg/kg dose, the highest dose. 
 
In February 2019, we announced the interim results of the EMPOWERS Study. SB-318 demonstrated increased leukocyte IDUA activity in patients with MPS I. One patient has been dosed with 1e13 vector genomes per kilogram body weight (vg/kg) of SB-318 and two patients have been dosed with 5e13 vg/kg of SB-318. The interim results suggest a dose-dependent increase in leukocyte IDUA activity, with activity levels rising above baseline and in the normal range (normal range is 6.0-71.4 nmol/hr/mg). However, plasma IDUA activity was unchanged from baseline in all three patients. Baseline urine GAG measurements for the three patients in the EMPOWERS Study were in a range considered to be at or slightly above normal. Urine GAG measurements showed no meaningful change at the time of the announcement. Safety data were collected and analyzed for the three patients. Administration of SB-318 was generally well-tolerated. No treatment related serious adverse events have been reported. Of the six total adverse events reported, all were mild or moderate and consistent with ongoing MPS I disease, and none were considered related to SB-318 treatment. The clinical relevance of the biochemical changes observed following administration of SB-318 will be assessed as clinical data and patient outcomes are analyzed following a trial of withdrawal from ERT. ERT withdrawal is expected for these patients later in 2019. We expect to report analyses of liver biopsies later in 2019. 
 10


We have developed second generation albumin locus ZFN constructs for potential use in the ongoing in vivo genome editing development programs. We plan to initiate a clinical trial this year using these second-generation ZFNs that should enable a Phase 3 decision for the MPS II program in 2020.
 SB-318 MPS I has been granted Orphan Drug, Rare Pediatric Disease and Fast Track designations by the FDA, as well as Orphan Medicinal Product designation by the EMA.
 SB-913 – MPS II
 We are developing SB-913, an in vivo genome editing product candidate, to treat MPS II. Similar to SB-318, we are using our ZFN genome editing technology to add a new therapeutic copy of the IDS gene precisely into the Albumin gene locus in the genome of liver cells, using the strong endogenous Albumin promoter to drive expression of the newly inserted gene. 
 In 2017, we initiated an open-label, dose-ascending Phase 1/2 clinical trial, the CHAMPIONS Study, to evaluate the safety and efficacy of SB-913 in adult male subjects with attenuated MPS II, designed to enroll up to nine subjects across three ascending dose cohorts. In November 2017, we announced that the first subject had been treated in the CHAMPIONS Study. Two patients are currently enrolled in each of cohort 1 (low-dose), cohort 2 (mid-dose) and cohort 3 (high-dose), along with an additional three patients, all of which have received the high dose, in an expanded cohort.
 In February 2018, we presented preliminary six-week safety data from the first subject enrolled in the CHAMPIONS Study. The data demonstrated that the subject tolerated the infusion well. Mild (Grade 1) adverse events related to the study drug were reported on the fourth day after dosing. These were dizziness, weakness and frequent urination, all of which resolved within one day without treatment. No other adverse events related to the study drug have been observed. Liver function tests have remained within normal limits for the patient since the infusion. In September 2018 we announced updated preliminary safety and efficacy data from the CHAMPIONS Study. In cohort 2 of the CHAMPIONS study, at 16 weeks post-dosing, mean reductions were observed in total urinary GAGs (which is a key biomarker of MPS II disease pathophysiology), dermatan sulfate, and heparan sulfate of 51%, 32%, and 61%, respectively. In October 2018, the SMC of the CHAMPIONS Study reviewed accumulated safety and efficacy data from all three cohorts and made the following three recommendations: 1) proceed to the cohort expansion phase of the clinical trial with the dose used at the third dose cohort (5e13 vg/kg); 2) initiate screening and enrollment of adolescent subjects (12 to 17 years of age); and 3) initiate the withdrawal of ERT when appropriate. 
 In February 2019, we announced interim study results from the CHAMPIONS Study. SB-913 showed preliminary evidence of in vivo genome editing in patients with MPS II. Small increases in IDS enzyme activity compared to baseline were recorded in one patient in cohort 1 (low-dose) and two patients in cohort 2 (mid-dose) of the CHAMPIONS Study. At 24 weeks these measurements remained within the expected range for baseline values (less than 10 nmol/hour/mL, as compared to the normal range which is estimated at greater than 82 nmol/hour/mL). A more substantial increase in plasma IDS activity was measured in the second patient in cohort 3 (high-dose), with levels rising to approximately 50 nmol/hour/mL by week 6 following SB-913 administration. The plasma IDS activity levels subsequently decreased in the context of the development of a mild transaminitis – a known risk of AAV-based therapies – due to a suspected immune response. Grade 1 elevations in liver function tests were measured at Day 62, 111 and 128. The patent was hospitalized on Day 121 for an incarcerated umbilical hernia considered unrelated to the SB-913. As of the date of our February 2019 announcement, the patent’s plasma IDS activity measured 14 nmol/hour/mL, above the baseline value but below the normal range. Baseline GAG measurements for all six patients were in a range considered at or slightly above normal, except for heparan sulfate which was elevated in all patients at baseline. At 24 weeks post-dosing, urine GAG results did not show a meaningful change. Safety data on eight patients were collected and analyzed. Administration of SB-913 was generally well-tolerated in all eight patients. Of the 18 total adverse events reported as related to SB-913, 16 were mild (Grade 1), two were moderate (Grade 2) and all adverse events resolved. There were no treatment-related serious adverse events reported. The clinical relevance of the biochemical changes observed following administration of SB-913 will be assessed as clinical data and patient outcomes are analyzed following a trial of withdrawal from ERT. Two mid-dose and one high-dose patients have initiated ERT withdrawal. One mid-dose patient was recommended to resume ERT approximately three months after initiation of ERT withdrawal due to fatigue and increasing GAG measurements. Analyses from these withdrawals will be available later this year.
 SB-913 has been granted Orphan Drug, Rare Pediatric Disease and Fast Track designations by the FDA, as well as Orphan Medicinal Product designation by the EMA.
 ST-920 — Fabry Disease
 We are developing ST-920 for Fabry disease, a gene therapy product candidate utilizing an AAV, carrying a galactosidase alpha, or GLA, gene construct, coding for the alpha-Gal A enzyme, driven by our proprietary synthetic liver specific promoter. Our IND submitted to the FDA for ST-920 became effective in January 2019 and we expect to initiate a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in 2019. 
Hemoglobinopathies: Beta-thalassemia and Sickle Cell Disease 
 11

Mutations in the gene encoding beta-globin, the oxygen carrying protein of red blood cells, lead to hemoglobinopathies such as beta-thalassemia and SCD. Both diseases manifest in the months after birth, when patients switch from producing functional fetal gamma-globin to a mutant form of adult beta-globin, which results in their condition. Naturally occurring increased levels of fetal hemoglobin have been shown to reduce the severity of both beta-thalassemia and SCD.
 Beta-thalassemia is a rare disorder that results in greatly impaired production of healthy red blood cells despite bone marrow over activity, leading to life-threatening anemia, enlarged spleen, liver and heart, and bone abnormalities. We are focused on Beta-thalassemia major, which is a severe form of thalassemia that requires regular, often monthly, blood transfusions and subsequent iron-chelation therapy to treat iron overload. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, estimates that 1,000 people have beta-thalassemia major in the United States, and an unknown number carry the genetic trait and can pass it on to their children. 
 In SCD, the mutation causes the red blood cells to form an abnormal sickle or crescent shape. The cells are fragile and deliver less oxygen to the body’s tissues. They can also get stuck more easily in small blood vessels and break into pieces that can interrupt healthy blood flow which further decreases the amount of oxygen flowing to body tissues. Almost all patients with SCD experience these painful vaso-occlusive crises, which can last from hours to days and may cause irreversible organ damage. Current standard of care is to manage and control symptoms, and to limit the number of crises. Treatments include administration of hydroxyurea, blood transfusions, iron-chelation therapy, pain medications and antibiotics. The CDC estimates that there are 90,000 to 100,000 Americans living with SCD, which occurs in approximately one out of every 365 African-American births and one out of every 16,300 Hispanic-American births.
 ST-400 – Beta-thalassemia; BIVV-003 — SCD
 We are developing ST-400 for the treatment of beta-thalassemia and our collaboration partner, Bioverativ, Inc., or Bioverativ, a wholly owned subsidiary of Sanofi Genzyme Corporation, or Sanofi Genzyme, is developing BIVV-003 for the treatment of SCD. Both ST-400 and BIVV-003 are genome-edited cell therapies that use our ZFN genome editing technology to modify a patient’s own, or autologous, HSPCs to produce functional red blood cells using fetal hemoglobin. Our genome editing technology can be used in HSPCs to precisely disrupt regulatory sequences that control the expression of key transcriptional regulators, such as the BCL11A erythroid enhancer sequence, to reverse the switch from expression of the mutant adult beta-globin back to the production of functional fetal gamma-globin. 
 The current standard of care for beta-thalassemia includes chronic blood transfusions, while the standard of care for SCD is a bone marrow transplant, or BMT, of HSPCs from a “matched” related donor, or an allogeneic BMT. However, these therapies are limited due to the risk of iron overload with blood transfusions, requiring subsequent iron chelation therapy, and the scarcity of matched donors and the significant risk of Graft versus Host Disease, or GvHD, with BMTs after transplantation of the foreign cells. By performing genome editing in HSPCs that are isolated from and subsequently returned to the same patient (i.e., an autologous HSPC transplant), our approach has the potential to address these limitations. The goal of this approach is to develop a one-time long-lasting treatment for beta-thalassemia and SCD.
 Preclinical data from clinical-scale in vitro studies have demonstrated that ST-400 and BIVV-003 can be manufactured by reproducible, high-level, ZFN-mediated modification in HSPCs mobilized in peripheral blood at clinical production scale (>108 cells), with an on-target modification efficiency of greater than 80%. Furthermore, erythroid differentiation of enhancer targeted cells showed modification of both BCL11A erythroid enhancer alleles in more than 50% of the erythroid colonies and resulted in a greater than four-fold increase in gamma globin mRNA and protein production, compared to controls. Preclinical specificity studies of ST-400 and BIVV-003 revealed no detectable off-target activity using state-of-the art, unbiased, highly sensitive oligo-capture assays. Preclinical data from in vivo studies in immune-deficient mice demonstrated robust long-term (19 weeks) engraftment and that targeted gene modification was maintained through multi-lineage differentiation in the bone marrow and peripheral blood.
 Our IND submitted to the FDA for ST-400 became effective in September 2017, and we have designed an open-label, single arm Phase 1/2 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ST-400 in up to six adult subjects with beta-thalassemia. This trial was initiated in February 2018 and the first patient was enrolled in June 2018 and dosed in January 2019. 
 Bioverativ is our partner for ST-400 and is responsible for the clinical development of BIVV-003 for sickle cell disease, or SCD. The Phase 1/2 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of BIVV-003 in up to eight adult subjects with SCD was initiated in August 2018 and patients are currently being screened in the United States. For more information relating to our collaboration with Bioverativ, see “—Collaborations—Bioverativ, Inc.”
 CAR-Treg
 
With the TxCell Acquisition, we can now accelerate our research and development of innovative, personalized T-cell immunotherapies for the treatment of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases with high unmet medical need. In this regard, we expect 
 12

that the TxCell Acquisition will accelerate our entry into the clinic with a CAR-Treg (which is a regulatory T cell, or Treg, genetically modified with a chimeric antigen receptor, or CAR) therapy. We are evaluating the potential of the TxCell platform in solid organ transplantation as well as a range of autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel diseases and inflammatory skin diseases. In addition, we intend to use our ZFN gene editing technology to potentially develop next-generation autologous and allogeneic CAR-Treg cell therapies for use in treating autoimmune diseases. We plan to initiate a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of for TX-200, our first CAR-Treg investigational product candidate for solid organ transplant, in 2019. 
 
Engineered Cell Therapies 
 
In February 2018, we entered into a worldwide collaboration with Kite Pharma, Inc., or Kite, a wholly owned subsidiary of Gilead Sciences, Inc., or Gilead, using our ZFN technology platform for the development of next-generation ex vivo cell therapies in oncology.
 Central Nervous System
 Tauopathies
 
We are using our ZFP TF gene regulation platform to develop potential gene therapies for tauopathy disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease and other neurodegenerative diseases. We believe a reduction in tau protein levels can help reduce intracellular tau protein aggregation and the formation of neurofibrillary tangles in neurons, potentially ameliorating or reversing disease progression. We believe this approach may have a significant advantage compared to monoclonal antibody-based approaches to Alzheimer’s disease and other tauopathy disorders because it is designed to selectively down-regulate the tau gene in neurons with the goal of reducing all forms of the tau protein globally across the central nervous system, or CNS. In contrast, monoclonal antibody-based approaches are limited in that they can only bind to certain forms of tau proteins.
 
Preclinical studies in wildtype mice demonstrated that a single administration of tau-targeting ZFP TFs resulted in up to 70% reduction of tau mRNA and protein expression across the entire CNS, as well as sustained and well-tolerated ZFP TF expression with minimal impact on inflammatory markers. Additional preclinical studies in amyloid mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease demonstrated up to 80% reduction of tau protein levels in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid, as well as significantly reduced neuritic dystrophy after a single administration of ZFP TFs in mice with established disease pathology.
 
We are currently conducting preclinical studies in NHPs to evaluate our ZFP TFs in larger mammalian species. We intend to seek a partner with disease area expertise for the clinical development and commercialization of this program.
 C9ORF72–linked ALS/FTLD 
 In December 2017, we entered into a research collaboration and license agreement with Pfizer to develop and commercialize gene therapy products that use our ZFP TFs to treat ALS and FTLD linked to mutations of the C9ORF72 gene. ALS and FTLD are part of a spectrum of neurodegenerative disorders caused by mutations in the C9ORF72 gene that involve hundreds of additional repetitions of a six base pair sequence of DNA. This ultimately leads to the deterioration of motor neurons, in the case of ALS, or neurons in the frontal and temporal lobes, in the case of FTLD. Currently, there are no cures to halt or reverse the progression of ALS or FTLD. The C9ORF72 mutation is linked to approximately one-third of cases of familial ALS. We and Pfizer plan to investigate allele-specific ZFP-TFs with the potential to differentiate the mutant C9ORF72 allele from the wildtype allele and to specifically down-regulate expression of the mutant form of the gene.
 We also have research stage programs in other monogenic diseases, immunology and cancer immunotherapy. See “—Collaborations—Pfizer Inc.” for more information relating to this agreement.
 Huntington’s Disease 
 Huntington’s disease is an inherited, progressive neurologic disease for which there is no treatment or cure. The disease is caused by a particular type of mutation in a single gene, the HTT gene. Most patients inherit one normal and one defective or mutant copy of the HTT gene, which causes Huntington’s disease. The mutation is characterized by expansion of a repeated stretch of DNA sequence within the gene called a “CAG repeat.” A normal copy of the HTT gene usually has 10 to 29 of these CAG repeats but a defective copy has many more — generally greater than 39 repeats. While the protein produced by the normal copy of the gene appears to be essential for development (mice lacking the gene do not survive to birth), the product of the mutated gene is damaging to cells. Symptoms, which include deterioration of muscle control, cognition and memory, usually develop between 35 and 44 years of age. It is known that the greater the number of CAG repeats, the earlier the onset. Huntington’s disease is usually fatal within 15 to 20 years after the onset of symptoms. The disease has a high prevalence for an inherited disorder. According to the Huntington’s Disease Society of America, approximately 30,000 people in the United States have Huntington’s disease. In addition, it is estimated that approximately 200,000 people in the United States are at risk of developing the disease. 
 13

Research in animal models of the disease has shown that lowering the levels of the mutant HTT protein can prevent, or even reverse, disease progression. However, to date most “HTT-lowering” methods decrease levels of both the normal and mutant forms of HTT, raising potential safety concerns given the importance of normal HTT protein. In collaboration with Shire, we are developing ZFP TFs that can selectively repress the expression of the mutant disease-causing form of HTT while leaving expression levels of the normal gene unchanged. Preclinical studies in animal models of the disease are ongoing and Shire is responsible for all clinical development activities including filing the IND application. For more information on our collaboration with Shire, see “—Collaborations—Shire International GmbH.”
 Legacy Clinical Research Programs
 Human Immunodeficiency Virus, or HIV, and Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome, or AIDS 
 HIV infection results in the death of immune system cells, particularly CD4+ T-cells, and thus leads to AIDS, a condition in which the body’s immune system is depleted to such a degree that the patient is unable to fight off common infections. Ultimately, these patients succumb to opportunistic infections or cancers. 
Current Treatments and Unmet Medical Need 
 Currently, there are over 30 antiretroviral drugs approved by the FDA to treat people infected with HIV. While these drugs can suppress virus in the blood to undetectable levels, they cannot eliminate the reservoir of cells containing genomically-integrated HIV from the body. Hence, individuals infected with HIV need to take antiretroviral drugs continuously. The drugs are expensive and can have significant side effects over time. There is no therapeutic approach available that protects CD4+ T-cells, suppresses viral load, reduces the viral reservoir and does not require daily dosing. 
SB-728 – HIV/AIDS 
 SB-728 uses our ZFN-mediated genome editing technology to disrupt the CCR5 gene in cells of a patient’s immune system to make these cells permanently resistant to HIV infection. CCR5 is a co-receptor for HIV entry into T-cells and if CCR5 is not expressed on the cell surface HIV cannot infect them or infects them with lower efficiency. The aim of this approach is to provide the patient with a population of HIV-resistant cells that can fight HIV and opportunistic infections, by mimicking the naturally occurring CCR5 delta-32 mutation that renders a population of individuals largely resistant to infection by the most common strains of HIV. We are evaluating this genome editing approach to disrupt the CCR5 gene in both T cells and HSPCs as two potential therapeutic candidates, SB-728-T and SB-728-HSPC, respectively.
  We have conducted several clinical trials with SB-728-T, which were designed to evaluate safety and tolerability of SB-728-T, as well as the effect of SB-728-T on subjects’ CD4 T-cell counts, levels of CCR5-modified T-cells, viral burden during a treatment interruption (TI) from anti-retroviral therapy, or ART, and measure of the viral reservoir. The data to date have demonstrated an ability to efficiently knock out the CCR5 gene in T-cells by ZFN-driven genome editing and grow the cells ex vivo, that a single infusion of SB-728-T led to proven engraftment, expansion and persistence of T-cells in vivo, sustained increases in CD4 T-cell counts, a significant and continuous decay of the HIV reservoir and the ability of certain subjects to control their viral loads for prolonged periods in the absence of ART. Over 100 subjects have been treated to date and the treatment appears to be well-tolerated.
 In addition, we have an ongoing investigator-sponsored Phase 1/2 clinical trial (SB-728mR-HSPC) to investigate SB-728-HSPC as a self-renewable and potentially lifelong source of HIV-resistant immune cells.
 We plan to advance the SB-728 program through potential future externally-funded collaborations.
 COLLABORATIONS 
 We have established collaborative and strategic partnerships for several of our therapeutic programs and also for several non-therapeutic applications of our technology. We will continue to pursue further partnerships when appropriate with selected pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to fund internal research and development activities and to assist in product development and commercialization. Our partnering decisions will be based on the best way to bring new medicines to patients and on an evaluation of our capacity to bring such products to commercial stage rapidly and efficiently on our own. We are applying our ZFN technology platform to several commercial applications in which our products provide us and our strategic partners and collaborators with potential technical, competitive and economic advantages. 
Kite Pharma, Inc.
 In February 2018, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Kite, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Gilead, for the research, development and commercialization of potential engineered cell therapies for cancer. Kite will be responsible for all 
 14

clinical development and commercialization of any resulting products. The Kite agreement became effective on April 5, 2018, when the waiting periods under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and other customary closing conditions were completed.
 Subject to the terms of this agreement, we granted Kite an exclusive, royalty-bearing, worldwide, sublicensable license, under our relevant patents and know-how, to develop, manufacture and commercialize, for the purpose of treating cancer, specific cell therapy products that may result from the research program and that are engineered ex vivo using selected ZFNs and AAVs developed under the research program, to express CARs, TCRs or NKRs directed to candidate targets. 
 During the research program term and subject to certain exceptions, except pursuant to this agreement, we will be prohibited from researching, developing, manufacturing and commercializing, for the purpose of treating cancer, any cell therapy product that, as a result of ex vivo genome editing, expresses a CAR, TCR or NKR that is directed to a target expressed on or in a human cancer cell. After the research program term concludes and subject to certain exceptions, except pursuant to this agreement, we will be prohibited from developing, manufacturing and commercializing, for the purpose of treating cancer, any cell therapy product that, as a result of ex vivo genome editing, expresses a CAR, TCR or NKR that is directed to a candidate target. 
 We received a $150 million upfront payment from Kite when the Kite agreement became effective in April 2018. In addition, Kite will reimburse our direct costs to conduct the joint research program, and Kite will be responsible for all subsequent development, manufacturing and commercialization of any licensed products. We are also eligible to receive contingent development- and sales-based milestone payments that could total up to $3.01 billion if all the specified milestones set forth in this agreement are achieved. Of this amount, approximately $1.26 billion relates to the achievement of specified research, clinical development, regulatory and first commercial sale milestones, and approximately $1.75 billion relates to the achievement of specified sales-based milestones if annual worldwide net sales of licensed products reach specified levels. Each development- and sales-based milestone payment is payable (i) only once for each licensed product, regardless of the number of times that the associated milestone event is achieved by such licensed product, and (ii) only for the first ten times that the associated milestone event is achieved, regardless of the number of licensed products that may achieve such milestone event. In addition, we will be entitled to receive escalating, tiered royalty payments with a percentage in the single digits based on potential future annual worldwide net sales of licensed products. These royalty payments will be subject to reduction due to patent expiration, entry of biosimilar products to the market and payments made under certain licenses for third-party intellectual property. 
 Kite has the right to terminate this agreement, in its entirety or on a per licensed product or per candidate target basis, for any reason after a specified notice period. Each party has the right to terminate this agreement on account of the other party’s bankruptcy or material, uncured breach. 
 
Pfizer Inc. 
 
We have two separate collaboration agreements with Pfizer. In May 2017, we entered into an exclusive, global collaboration and license agreement with Pfizer, pursuant to which we established a collaboration for the research, development and commercialization of SB-525, our gene therapy product candidate for hemophilia A, and closely related products. 
 
Under this agreement, we are responsible for conducting the Phase 1/2 clinical trial and certain manufacturing activities for SB-525, while Pfizer is responsible for subsequent worldwide development, manufacturing, marketing and commercialization of SB-525. We may also collaborate in the research and development of additional AAV-based gene therapy products for hemophilia A. 
 
We received an upfront fee of $70.0 million and are eligible to receive development milestone payments contingent on the achievement of specified clinical development, intellectual property, regulatory and first commercial sale milestones for SB-525 and potentially other products. The total amount of potential clinical development, intellectual property, regulatory, and first commercial sale milestone payments, assuming the achievement of all specified milestones in this agreement, is $475.0 million, which includes up to $300.0 million for SB-525 and up to $175.0 million for other products that may be developed under the agreement, subject to reduction on account of payments made under certain licenses for third party intellectual property. In addition, Pfizer agreed to pay us royalties for each potential licensed product developed under the agreement that are an escalating tiered, double-digit percentage of the annual net sales of such product and are subject to reduction due to patent expiration, entry of biosimilar products to the market and payment made under certain licenses for third party intellectual property. 
 
Subject to the terms of the agreement, we granted Pfizer an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license, with the right to grant sublicenses, to use certain technology controlled by us for the purpose of developing, manufacturing and commercializing SB-525 and related products. Pfizer granted us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty free, fully paid license, with the right to grant sublicenses, to use certain manufacturing technology developed under the agreement and controlled by Pfizer to manufacture our products that utilize the AAV delivery system. During a specified period, neither we nor Pfizer will be permitted to clinically develop or commercialize, outside of the collaboration, certain AAV-based gene therapy products for hemophilia A.

Unless earlier terminated, the agreement has a term that continues, on a per product and per country basis, until the later of (i) the expiration of patent claims that cover the product in a country, (ii) the expiration of regulatory exclusivity for a product in a country, and (iii) fifteen years after the first commercial sale of a product in a country. Pfizer has the right to terminate the agreement without cause in its entirety or on a per product or per country basis. The agreement may also be terminated by either party based on an uncured material breach by the other party or the bankruptcy of the other party. Upon termination for any reason, the license granted by us to Pfizer to develop, manufacture and commercialize SB-525 and related products will automatically terminate. Upon termination by us for cause or by Pfizer any country or countries, Pfizer will automatically grant us an exclusive, royalty-bearing license under certain technology controlled by Pfizer to develop, manufacture and commercialize SB-525 in the terminated country or countries. 
 In December 2017, we entered into a separate exclusive, global collaboration and license agreement with Pfizer for the development and commercialization of potential gene therapy products that use ZFP-TFs to treat ALS and FTLD linked to mutations of the C9ORF72 gene. Pursuant to this agreement, we agreed to work with Pfizer on a research program to identify, characterize and preclinically develop ZFP-TFs that bind to and specifically reduce expression of the mutant form of the C9ORF72 gene.
 We received a $12.0 million upfront payment from Pfizer and are eligible to receive up to $60.0 million in development milestone payments from Pfizer contingent on the achievement of specified preclinical development, clinical development and first commercial sale milestones, and up to $90.0 million commercial milestone payments if annual worldwide net sales of the licensed products reach specified levels. In addition, Pfizer will pay us royalties based on an escalating tiered, mid- to high-single digit percentage of the annual worldwide net sales of the licensed products. These royalty payments are subject to reduction due to patent expiration, entry of biosimilar products to the market and payments made under certain licenses for third party intellectual property. Each party will be responsible for the cost of its performance of the research program. Pfizer will be operationally and financially responsible for subsequent development, manufacturing and commercialization of the licensed products.
 Subject to the terms of the agreement, we granted Pfizer an exclusive, royalty-bearing, worldwide, license under our relevant patents and know-how to develop, manufacture and commercialize gene therapy products that use resulting ZFP-TFs that satisfy pre-agreed criteria. During a specified period, neither our company nor Pfizer will be permitted to research, develop, manufacture or commercialize outside of the collaboration any ZFPs that specifically bind to the C9ORF72 gene.
 Unless earlier terminated, the agreement has a term that continues, on a per licensed product and per country basis, until the later of (i) the expiration of patent claims that cover the licensed product in a country, (ii) the expiration of regulatory exclusivity for a licensed product in a country, and (iii) fifteen years after the first commercial sale of a licensed product in a major market country. Pfizer has the right to terminate the agreement without cause in its entirety or on a per product or per country basis. The agreement may also be terminated by either party based on an uncured material breach by the other party or the bankruptcy of the other party. The agreement will also terminate if we are unable to identify any lead candidates for development within a specified period of time or if Pfizer elects not to advance a lead candidate beyond a certain development milestone within a specified period of time. Upon termination for any reason, the license granted by us to Pfizer to develop, manufacture and commercialize licensed products under the agreement will automatically terminate. Upon termination by us for cause or by Pfizer without cause for any licensed product or licensed products in any country or countries, we will have the right to negotiate with Pfizer to obtain a non-exclusive, royalty-bearing license under certain technology controlled by Pfizer to develop, manufacture and commercialize the licensed product or licensed products in the terminated country or countries. 
 Following termination by us for Pfizer’s material breach, Pfizer will not be permitted to research, develop, manufacture or commercialize ZFPs that specifically bind to the C9ORF72 gene for a period of time. Following termination by Pfizer for our material breach, we will not be permitted to research, develop, manufacture or commercialize ZFPs that specifically bind to the C9ORF72 gene for a period of time.
 
Bioverativ Inc. 
 In January 2014, we entered into an exclusive worldwide collaboration and license agreement with Bioverativ, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sanofi Genzyme, to develop therapeutics for hemoglobinopathies, focused on beta-thalassemia and SCD. Under the agreement, we are jointly conducting two research programs: the beta-thalassemia program and the SCD program. In the beta-thalassemia program, we are responsible for all discovery, research and development activities through the first human clinical trial. In the SCD program, both parties are responsible for research and development activities through the submission of an IND application for ZFP therapeutics intended to treat SCD. Bioverativ reimburses us for agreed upon internal and external program-related costs. 
 Under both programs, Bioverativ is responsible for subsequent worldwide clinical development, manufacturing and commercialization of licensed products developed under the agreement. At the end of the specified research terms for each program or under certain specified circumstances, Bioverativ has the right to step in and take over any of our remaining activities. Furthermore, we have an option to co-promote in the United States any licensed products to treat beta-thalassemia and SCD developed under the agreement, and Bioverativ will compensate us for such co-promotion activities. Subject to the terms of the agreement, we have 
 16

granted Bioverativ an exclusive, royalty-bearing license, with the right to grant sublicenses, to use certain ZFP and other technology controlled by us for the purpose of researching, developing, manufacturing and commercializing licensed products developed under the agreement. We have also granted Bioverativ a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, fully paid license, with the right to grant sublicenses, under our interest in certain other intellectual property developed pursuant to the agreement. During the term of the agreement, we are not permitted to research, develop, manufacture or commercialize, outside of the agreement, certain gene therapy products that target genes relevant to the licensed products. 
 Under the agreement, we received an upfront license fee of $20.0 million and are eligible to receive development and sales milestone payments upon the achievement of specified regulatory, clinical development and sales milestones. The total amount of potential regulatory, clinical development, and sales milestone payments, assuming the achievement of all specified milestones in the agreement, is $276.3 million. In addition, we will receive royalty payments for each licensed product that are a tiered double-digit percentage of annual net sales of each product. 
 The agreement may be terminated by (i) us or Bioverativ for the uncured material breach of the other party, (ii) us or Bioverativ for the bankruptcy or other insolvency proceeding of the other party; (iii) Bioverativ, upon 180 days’ advance written notice to us and (iv) Bioverativ, for certain safety reasons upon written notice to, and after consultation with, us. As a result, actual future milestone payments could be lower than the amounts stated above. 
 Shire International GmbH 
 In January 2012, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Shire, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Takeda, to research, develop and commercialize human therapeutics and diagnostics for monogenic diseases based on our ZFP technology. We received an upfront license fee of $13.0 million in 2012 and recognized a $1.0 million milestone payment in 2014. In September 2015, we amended and restated our agreement with Shire. Pursuant to the amended and restated agreement, Shire retained its exclusive, worldwide license to ZFP therapeutics for treating Huntington’s disease and returned to us the worldwide, exclusive rights to gene targets for the development and commercialization of ZFP therapeutics for hemophilia A and B. 
 Under the amended and restated agreement, Shire has full control over, and full responsibility for the costs of, the Huntington’s disease program retained by Shire, subject to certain obligations, including the obligation to retain us to perform ZFP design, optimization and assessment services and to reimburse us for the costs of such services. Shire does not have any milestone payment obligations but is required to pay single digit percentage royalties to us, up to a specified maximum cap, on the commercial sales of ZFP therapeutic products for Huntington’s disease. During the term of the amended and restated agreement, we are not permitted to research, develop or commercialize, outside of the agreement, certain products that target the HTT gene.
 Under the amended and restated agreement, we have full control over, and full responsibility for the costs of, the hemophilia A and B programs returned to us by Shire, subject to certain diligence obligations. We also granted Shire a right of first negotiation to obtain a license to such programs under certain circumstances. We are required to pay single digit percentage royalties to Shire, up to a specified maximum cap, on commercial sales of therapeutic products from the programs returned to us by Shire. 
 The amended and restated agreement may be terminated by (i) us or Shire, in whole or in part, for the uncured material breach of the other party, (ii) us or Shire for the bankruptcy or other insolvency proceeding of the other party and (iii) Shire, in its entirety, effective upon at least 90 days’ advance written notice. 
 Other Partnerships 
 In addition to our partnerships for the development of human therapeutic applications, we have also licensed our technology in several other areas, such as plant agriculture and research reagents, including the production of transgenic animals and cell-line engineering. These license partners include Dow AgroSciences LLC, Sigma-Aldrich Corporation, Genentech, Inc., Open Monoclonal Technology, Inc. and F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd and Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
 Patents and licenses are important to our business. Our strategy is to file or license patent applications to protect technology, inventions and improvements to inventions that we consider important for the development of our genome editing and gene regulation technology. We seek patent protection and licenses that relate to our technology and candidates in our pipeline and/or may be important to our future. We have filed numerous patents and patent applications with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or U.S. PTO, and foreign jurisdictions. This proprietary intellectual property includes methods relating to the design of zinc finger, Transcription Activator-Like Effector, or TALE, proteins and Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats, or CRISPR/Cas editing systems, therapeutic applications of genome editing technology, enabling technologies related to our platform and the use of genome editing across a variety of applications. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, proprietary 
 17

know–how, continuing technological innovations, trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality agreements, materials transfer agreements, research agreements and licensing agreements, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. 
 In-Licensed Technology 
 We have exclusively licensed intellectual property directed to the design, selection, and use of ZFPs, ZFNs and ZFP TFs for genome editing and gene regulation from the California Institute of Technology, or Cal Tech, and the University of Utah, or Utah. These licenses grant us exclusive rights to make, use and sell ZFPs, ZFNs and ZFP TFs under three families of patent filings. As of February 15, 2019, these patent filings have resulted in over nine issued U.S. patents and over 26 granted foreign patents and are still active, with one pending U.S. patent application and 2 pending applications in foreign patent offices. 
 Our license agreement with CalTech granted us a worldwide exclusive license to certain patents related to chimeric nucleases for genome targeting for all fields of use, which expire in September 2023. Our license agreement with Utah granted us a worldwide exclusive license to technology and patents relating to the use of ZFNs for all fields of use, which expires in May 2025. 
 We have also entered into licenses potentially useful for specific therapeutic uses of our genome editing technologies with the Regents of the University of California or UC, and the Children's Medical Center Corporation or CMCC. The patents included in these licenses relate to CNS disorders and hemoglobinopathies, respectively. These licenses include three patent families, including three issued U.S. patents, 12 allowed or granted foreign patents, over 25 pending foreign patent applications and three pending U.S. patent applications. The UC patents expire in May of 2021, the first CMCC family expires in September 2029, and the second expires in November 2033. 
 Our subsidiary, TxCell has a license agreement with the University of British Columbia pursuant to which it exclusively licensed the right to the CAR for use in TX-200. This license includes one patent family which expires in September 2038. 
 Our Intellectual Property 
 In addition to our in-licensed patent portfolio, we have numerous issued patents and pending patent filings directed to the design, composition and use of ZFPs, ZFNs, ZFP TFs, TALE proteins and CRISPR/Cas systems and other technology related to our program. 
 Some of the earliest zinc finger patents in our portfolio began expiring in 2015, with the average expiration of our currently issued patents expiring being late-2026. However, we have continued to build on this patent portfolio and have been issued additional patents and have applications pending that provide protection for our ZFP technology. These patents in our portfolio may be subject to Patent Term Adjustment (due to delays in patent prosecution by the USPTO), Patent Term Extension (due to review of a patented product by a regulatory agency) or terminal disclaimer. Additionally, patents that may be issued from our pending applications will extend the patent exclusivity of our patent estate. 
 We believe that our licensed patents and patent applications, as well as our issued patents and pending patent applications, in the aggregate, will provide us with a substantial intellectual property position in our commercial development of our genome editing, gene therapy, cell therapy and gene regulation programs. In this regard, patents issued to us, applied for by us, or exclusively and non-exclusively licensed to us, cover the following types of inventions, processes and products:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms, including our patent position, are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal tenets are largely unresolved and are subject to interpretation and refinement by the court system. Patent applications may not result in the issuance of patents and the coverage claimed in a patent application may be significantly reduced before a patent is issued. Although we have filed for patents on some aspects of our technology, we cannot provide assurances that patents will be issued as a result of these pending applications or that any patent that has been or may be issued will be upheld. The laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. For example, our issued European patents EP2171052 and EP2527435 have been opposed in Europe. Our EP2281050 case was revoked during Opposition in November 2016. EP2126054, which is exclusively licensed to TxCell, was revoked during Opposition in November 2018. Similarly, EP2171052 and EP2527435 underwent Opposition hearings in early 2017. Although these cases emerged from the Opposition hearings, the opponent filed appeals that are currently underway, and we do not know what the outcome of these procedures will be. The claims of these patents may be amended such that claim scope is reduced or the patents may be revoked as a result of these procedures. 
 In the future, third parties may assert patent, copyright trademark, and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to our business. For example, TxCell has exclusively licensed the rights to technology related to redirected Treg cells from the Yeda Research and Development Company, or Yeda. A patent included in this exclusive license agreement with Yeda was granted in Europe in July 2016. Subsequent to this grant, the patent was opposed by several parties in May 2017 and revoked in November 2018. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. Any claims asserting that our products infringe or may infringe proprietary rights of third parties, if determined adversely to us, could significantly harm our business. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Intellectual Property”.
 COMPETITION 
 We, and our licensed partners, are the leaders in the research, development, and commercialization of DNA binding proteins for genome editing and regulation of gene expression. We are aware of several companies focused on other methods for editing genes and regulating gene expression and a limited number of commercial and academic groups pursuing the development of ZFP gene regulation and genome editing technology. The field of applied gene regulation and genome editing is highly competitive and we expect competition to persist and intensify in the future from a number of different sources, including pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies; academic and research institutions; and government agencies that will seek to develop ZFPs as well as technologies that will compete with our ZFP technology platform, such as TALE proteins and the CRISPR/Cas9 system. 
 Accordingly, our competitors may succeed in obtaining patent protection, receiving FDA approval, or commercializing competitive products before us. If we commence commercial product sales, we may be competing against companies with greater marketing, sales, distribution and manufacturing capabilities, areas in which we have limited or no experience. In addition, any product candidate that we successfully develop may compete with existing products that have long histories of safe and effective use. 
 Although we are in the clinical development phase of operations and have no current therapeutic product sales, we believe the following companies, products and/or technologies may potentially be competitive with our technology or our product candidates under development: 
  
• | Protein pharmaceuticals under development at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies such as Pfizer, Bayer AG, Novo Nordisk A/S, Genzyme Corp., Shire, BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc., Biogen Inc., Acceleron Pharma Inc., ArmaGen, Inc., Protalix Biotherapeutics, Inc., F.

• | Monoclonal antibody companies and product candidates from certain biotechnology firms such as Genentech, Inc. and Amgen Inc.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We expect to face intense competition from other companies for collaborative arrangements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for establishing relationships with academic and research institutions, for licenses to proprietary technology and for subjects in our clinical trials of treatments for rare diseases. These competitors, either alone or with their collaborative partners, may succeed in developing technologies or products that are more effective or less costly than ours. 
 Our ability to compete successfully will depend, in part, on our ability to:

• | develop and maintain products that reach the market first and are technologically superior to or are of lower cost than other products in the market; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | recruit subjects into our clinical trials in a timely fashion.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------

MANUFACTURING 
 We rely on contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, to produce our preclinical and clinical product candidates in accordance with FDA and EMA mandated regulations, also known as current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs. We employ a technical operations staff in the areas of process development, analytical development, quality control, quality assurance, project management, and manufacturing to facilitate appropriate oversight of our CMOs, support of our regulatory filings and execution of clinical trials. In 2017, we expanded our services agreement with Brammer Bio MA, LLC to provide dedicated capacity to supply our preclinical and clinical programs. Additionally, we plan to build a cGMP manufacturing facility in our new building in Brisbane, CA for which we are currently occupying the 2nd and 3rd floors. This facility will be designed to manufacture Phase 1/2 clinical trial supplies for our pipeline programs. We believe this balanced approach to manufacturing, investing in internal capacity/capabilities while strengthening our commitment to external capacity, will enable us to meet our anticipated pipeline needs.
 We currently leverage three distinct manufacturing platforms: AAV vector production for our genome editing and gene therapy product candidates, HSPC modification for our cell therapy product candidates and engineered T cell therapies. We use a commercial scale baculovirus manufacturing platform to manufacture AAV vectors for genome editing and gene therapy, with each AAV vector packaging a different transgene specific to the target indication or ZFN. The manufacturing process for our HSPC cell therapy product candidates utilizes the patient’s own HSPCs. These HSPCs are transfected using mRNA to produce ZFNs that target specific DNA sites, resulting in modified HSPCs. The third platform utilizes our ZFN technology to transform CAR-Tregs for autologous and 
 20

allogeneic cell therapies. With the acquisition of TxCell, we also added capabilities to manufacture regulator T-cells in therapeutic quantities to be used to treat auto-immune disorders. 
 
GOVERNMENT REGULATION 
 We operate within the heavily regulated pharmaceutical framework and much of our operations, including nonclinical and clinical trials, development, manufacturing, commercialization, marketing and reimbursement are subject to regulatory approvals. Relevant regulatory authorities include, but are not limited to, the FDA, the EMA, Commission of the European Union, or EU member state agencies, including the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA.
 In the United States, the FDA regulates biologic products including gene therapy and human cellular therapy products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, the Public Health Service Act, or the PHSA, and regulations and guidance implementing these laws. The FDCA, PHSA and their corresponding regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, distribution, reporting, advertising and other promotional practices involving biologic products. Applications to the FDA are required before conducting human clinical testing of biologic products and in the European Union approval must be obtained from the EMA. FDA approval also must be obtained before marketing of biologic products. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources and we may not be able to obtain the required regulatory approvals.
 Accelerated Assessment
 A number of agencies, including the FDA and the EMA, have accelerated approval programs, including for innovative products and in areas of high unmet medical need, such as PRIME in the EU. These programs require a certain level of evidence demonstrating safety and efficacy in patients from early stage clinical trials. Entry into one of these accelerated schemes may result in assistance with the scientific opinion and faster approval timelines. Some of these programs may offer joint approval and reimbursement advice. It is noted that even applications in an accelerated assessment scheme may be assessed under standard timelines, where the regulatory authority deems it necessary to address more questions.
U.S. Biologic Products Development Process 
 Our product candidates must be approved by the FDA before they may be legally marketed in the United States. The process required by the FDA before a biologic product candidate may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests and in vivo studies in accordance with the FDA’s current Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an application for an IND exemption, which allows human clinical trials to begin unless FDA objects within 30 days;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, reviewing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well‑controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s GCP regulations, and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed biologic product candidate for its intended use;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | preparation and submission to the FDA of a biologics license application, or BLA, for marketing approval that includes substantial evidence of safety, purity and potency from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | review of the product by an FDA advisory committee, if applicable;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biologic product candidate is produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biologic product candidate’s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | potential FDA audit of the nonclinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 21

 
• | payment of user fees and FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Before testing any biologic product candidate in humans, including a gene therapy product candidate, the product candidate must undergo preclinical testing. Preclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as in vivo studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate and to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs.
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually must complete some long‑term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the drug in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 Human gene transfer protocols are subject to the FDA’s oversight and other clinical trial regulations, and oversight at the local level as set forth in NIH Guidelines. Specifically, under the NIH Guidelines, supervision of human gene transfer trials includes evaluation and assessment by an institutional biosafety committee, or IBC, a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees research utilizing recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules at that institution. The IBC assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk to public health or the environment, and such review may result in some delay before initiation of a clinical trial. Compliance with the NIH Guidelines is mandatory for investigators at institutions receiving NIH funds for research involving recombinant DNA. However, many companies and other institutions, not otherwise subject to the NIH Guidelines, voluntarily follow them. 
 The clinical trial sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA also may impose clinical holds on a biologic product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non‑compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, trials may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical studies to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such studies.
 EU Drug Development Process
 Similar to the United States, the EU regulatory framework sets both EU-wide and national, Member State-specific requirements for the development and approval of medicinal products. Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC sets out the contents of a marketing authorization, or MA, application and all the information that must be submitted for the evaluation of a medicinal product. Certain preclinical (also termed “non-clinical”) data is required in order to enable clinical trials and later be used in dossier for a marketing authorization application. All studies should take place in accordance with GLP and all applicable EMA, Commission and European Pharmacopoeia guidelines on preclinical studies, including guidance on quality, non-clinical and clinical aspects of medicinal products containing genetically modified cells.
 The requisite amount of preclinical data enables the design of a clinical trial, from Phase I (first-in-human clinical trials) through to Phases II and III, which are safety and efficacy and dosing studies and similar restrictions and requirements apply as in the US regarding preclinical data, approvals for trials using vectors. The preclinical tests should establish parameters such as toxicity, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetic properties, the quality of gene transfer medicinal products. Due to the particular nature of gene therapy medicinal products, it is recognized that that it may not always be possible for the non-clinical safety studies to be in conformity with the principles of GLP and a proper justification should be submitted where a pivotal non-clinical safety study has not been conducted under GLP rules.
 Clinical studies are crucial to obtaining the required data and the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials are further analyzed below. 
 All medicinal products and advanced therapy medicinal products, or ATMPs, must be manufactured in accordance with the guidelines on GMP, and in a GMP licensed facility, which can be subject to GMP inspections.
 22

Human Clinical Trials Under an IND
Clinical trials involve the administration of the biologic product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators which generally are physicians not employed by, or under, the control of the trial sponsor. Clinical trials are conducted under written study protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDA’s regulations comprising the GCP requirements, including the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent.
 Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers items such as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical trial subject, or their legal representative, reviews and approves the study protocol, and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. 
 Human clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
  
• | Phase 1. The biologic product candidate initially is introduced into a small number of human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early understanding of its effectiveness. Phase 1 clinical trials of gene therapies are typically conducted in patients rather than healthy volunteers.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2. The biologic product candidate is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product candidate for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3. Phase 3 clinical trials are commonly referred to as “pivotal” studies, which typically denotes a study which presents the data that the FDA or other relevant regulatory agency will use to determine whether or not to approve a biologic product. In Phase 3 studies, the biologic product candidate is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites in adequate and well‑controlled clinical trials to generate sufficient data to statistically confirm the potency and safety of the product for approval. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product candidate and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Post‑approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long‑term safety follow‑up. Sometimes approval for a product is conditional upon the completion of post-marketing clinical studies.
 During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies (such as the FDA, the EMA and other comparable regulatory agencies) require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA.
 Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA, the NIH and the investigators for: serious and unexpected adverse events; any findings from other trials, in vivo laboratory tests or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects; or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life‑threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information.
 The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the biologic product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 The FDA usually recommends that sponsors observe subjects for potential gene therapy‑related delayed adverse events for a 15‑year period, including a minimum of five years of annual examinations followed by 10 years of annual queries, either in person or by questionnaire.
 23

In the EU, clinical trials almost always require approval from a national competent authority of the relevant Member State and an approval from an Ethics Committee. If the medicinal product is considered to be a genetically modified organism, or GMO, then GMO approval must also be obtained. There is no harmonization between Member States regarding the approach to and timelines of GMO approval, which results in significant challenges and time restrictions.
 The conduct of clinical trials should follow the approved clinical trial protocol and be in accordance with the principles of GCP.  Gene therapy medicinal products are in addition subject to the rules of GCP for ATMPs (currently in draft form), which outline specific additional safeguards and requirements. Record retention requirements are increased for ATMPs and there are relevant long-term follow up and human safety and traceability requirements.
 Compliance with cGMP Requirements 
 Manufacturers of biologics must comply with applicable cGMP regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. Manufacturers and others involved in the manufacture and distribution of such products also must register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Both domestic and foreign manufacturing establishments must register and provide additional information to the FDA upon their initial participation in the manufacturing process. Any material changes to the manufacturing equipment, process or location of the approved manufacturing site must be reported to the relevant agency/authority. Establishments may be subject to periodic, unannounced inspections by government authorities (including regulatory agencies) to ensure compliance with cGMP requirements and other laws. Discovery of problems may result in a government entity placing restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved BLA, and may extend to requiring withdrawal of the product from the market, issue warning or similar letters or seeking civil, criminal or administrative sanctions against the company. The FDA will not approve a BLA unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specification.
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional preclinical studies and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biologic product candidate as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product candidate in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents or of causing other adverse events with the use of biologic products, the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other requirements, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biologic product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biologic product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 U.S. Review and Approval Processes 
 The results of the preclinical tests and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s CMC and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications.
 Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each BLA must be accompanied by a significant user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. The PDUFA also imposes an annual program fee for approved biologics. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. 
 The FDA reviews a BLA within 60 days of submission to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In that event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in‑depth, substantive review of the BLA.
 The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product candidate is safe and potent, or effective, for its intended use, has an acceptable purity profile and whether the product candidate is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product candidate’s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel biologic products or biologic products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, is necessary to assure the safe use of the product candidate. REMS use risk minimization strategies beyond the professional labeling to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the 
 24

potential risks. To determine whether a REMS is needed, the FDA will consider the size of the population likely to use the product, seriousness of the disease, expected benefit of the product, expected duration of treatment, seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the product is a new molecular entity. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans and elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the BLA without a REMS, if required.
 Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product candidate is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product candidate unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product candidate within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA typically will inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND trial requirements and GCP requirements.
 On the basis of the BLA and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the biologic product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the BLA, the FDA will issue an approval letter.
 If a product candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing or dispensing in the form of a REMS, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post‑marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, designed to further assess a biologic product’s safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.
 The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review of BLAs under the PDUFA. One such goal is to review standard BLAs in 10 months after the FDA accepts the BLA for filing, and priority BLAs in six months, whereupon a review decision is to be made. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority BLAs and its review goals are subject to change from time to time. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or the BLA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA goal date.
 EU Review and Approval Process 
 Before a medicinal product can be placed on the market in the EU, it must have received an MA. This could either be at national or EU level under a mutual recognition, decentralized or centralized procedure. Our product candidates are innovative treatments, which will bear the classification of ATMP and/or orphan status. As such, the appropriate authorization procedure is the centralized procedure, which involves an MA being granted by the European Commission following a positive opinion by the EMA. A centralized MA is simultaneously valid in all EU Member States and the European Economic Area, or EEA, (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway). A centralized MA also results in a single set of product information (patient information leaflet, labelling and summary of product characteristics) for all EU Member States.
 The timeline for the grant of a centralized MA since the time of the application is 210 days for the assessment of the application (including “clock stops” for the applicant to prepare answers to the questions from the EMA). The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or the CHMP, may either provide a positive or negative opinion. Following a positive opinion, the European Commission will usually issue its legally binding MA after 67 days. A negative opinion may be appealed by the applicant who must submit a request for re-examination within 60 days. There is the possibility for accelerated timelines of drug applications for eligible applicants, which can reduce the timeline to 150 days, if the applicant can produce sufficient justification.
 If the MA application contains less comprehensive than the required standard as at the time of the application, when there are public health grounds and often in the case of orphan medicinal products, the EMA may recommend to the European Commission that it issues a different type of an MA, as follows: (a) a Conditional MA (valid for one year and renewable), when the medicinal product shows a positive benefit-risk balance and targets an unmet medical need and it is expected that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data in due course; or (b) an MA under ‘exceptional circumstances’, when it is not expected that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive efficacy and safety data (often for very rare indications).

Post‑approval Requirements
 Rigorous and extensive FDA regulation of biologic products continues after approval, particularly with respect to cGMP requirements. Manufacturers are required to comply with applicable requirements in the cGMP regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. Other post‑approval requirements applicable to biologic products include reporting of cGMP deviations that may affect the identity, potency, purity and overall safety of a distributed product, record‑keeping requirements, reporting of adverse effects, reporting updated safety and efficacy information and complying with electronic record and signature requirements. After a BLA is approved, the product also may be subject to official lot release. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA, together with a release protocol, showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all tests performed on the lot. The FDA also may perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products before releasing the lots for distribution. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency and effectiveness of biologic products.
 A sponsor also must comply with the FDA’s or appropriate national authority’s advertising and promotion requirements, such as the prohibition on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved labeling (known as “off‑label use”). Discovery of previously unknown problems or the failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process or facility generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.
 Orphan designation 
 We maintain product candidates that have obtained FDA and EU orphan designation (see “Therapeutic Product Development” section above). These products are intended for treating rare conditions that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S., or that affect more than 200,000 persons but are not expected to recover the costs of developing and marketing a treatment drug. In the EU, these rare conditions are defined as having a prevalence of no more than five in every 10,000 people in the EU. Once a medicinal product with orphan designation obtains a marketing approval, it can benefit from a marketing exclusivity period in respect of the specific orphan indication for which the drug has been approved for a period of seven years in the U.S. and for up to ten years in the EU. This measure is intended at incentivizing the development of medicines for rare diseases. The product must be able to maintain its orphan designation, by reference to the criteria of (a) prevalence of the condition and (b) significant benefit of the product over competing products. If the manufacturer is no longer able to assert that the product meets the orphan designation criteria or is not able to provide sufficient quantities, it may lose the orphan market exclusivity.

 Clinical Trial Data Disclosure 
 Many jurisdictions have mandatory clinical trial information obligations on sponsors. In the EU this is under the Transparency Regulation No. 1049/ 2001, EMA Policy 0043, EMA Policy 0070, as well as the new Clinical Trials Regulation No. 536/2014, all of which impose on sponsors the obligation to make publicly available certain information stemming from clinical studies. In the EU, the transparency framework provides for a wide right for (EU-based at the moment) interested parties to submit an access to documents request to the EMA for information included in the marketing authorization application dossier for approved medicinal products. Only very limited information is exempted from disclosure, i.e. commercially confidential information (which is construed increasingly narrowly) and protected personal data. It is possible for competitors to access and use this data in their own research and development programs anywhere in the world, once this data is in the public domain.
Additional Regulation
 Although we currently do not have any products on the market, we may be subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud, anti-bribery and abuse, false claims, privacy and security and physician transparency laws and regulations, many of which may become more applicable if our product candidates are approved and we begin commercialization. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, individual imprisonment, suspension or withdrawal of our marketing and commercialization in respect of our commercially approved products, and additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. See “Risk Factors—Our relationships with customers and third-party payors will be subject to applicable anti-

kickback, fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings.”
 The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering enacting or have enacted a number of additional legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our product candidates profitably, if approved. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts, which include major legislative initiatives, such as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, to reduce the cost of care through changes in the healthcare system, including limits on the pricing, coverage, and reimbursement of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, especially under government-funded health care programs, and increased governmental control of drug pricing. See “Risk Factors—Recently enacted and future legislation, including potentially unfavorable pricing regulations or other healthcare reform initiatives, may increase the difficulty and cost for us to obtain regulatory approval of and commercialize our product candidates and affect the prices we may obtain.”
 Pricing and reimbursement of a therapeutic product will largely determine the affordability of the product, and whether the product is prescribed and supplied to patients and private insurance companies may take into account government reimbursement methodologies. Due to these proposed and enacted laws, as well as other actions, significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval, particularly for novel products. In both domestic and foreign markets, sales and reimbursement of any approved products will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels, for such products. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Additionally, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products. If third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other therapies, these payors may not cover our products after approved as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of reimbursement may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis. See “Risk Factors—Even if we are able to commercialize our product candidates, the products may not receive coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors in the United States and in other countries in which we seek to commercialize our products, which could harm our business.”
 In the EU, pricing and reimbursement are the prerogative of Member States. Therefore, the requirements around reimbursement of medicinal products can vary widely. Each Member State can follow its own approach, subject to common rules of transparency, competition, and freedom of trade and movement in the EU. Many Member States, including France, Germany and the United Kingdom, follow a health technology assessment, or HTA, procedure for medicinal products in order to assess the cost-effectiveness of a product which could then be recommended for reimbursement under the national health services. There is increasingly exchange of information concerning HTAs on a voluntary basis among EU Member States. In the United Kingdom, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence is the body which conducts HTAs and issues guidance to be followed by the regional health bodies called clinical commissioning groups.
