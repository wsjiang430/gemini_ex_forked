 We were founded in 1978 in Dallas, Texas as The Container Store, Inc. In 2007, The Container Store, Inc. was sold to The Container Store Group, Inc. In November 2013, we completed the initial public offering of our common stock (the “IPO”). Our common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the symbol “TCS.” In fiscal 2018, we generated net sales of $895.1 million. Today our operations consist of two operating segments:

· | The Container Store (“TCS”), which consists of our retail stores, website and call center (which includes business sales), as well as our installation and organizational services business. We operate 92 stores with an average size of approximately 25,000 square feet (19,000 selling square feet) in 33 states and the District of Columbia. Our stores present our products in a unique and engaging atmosphere. Our visual merchandising team works to ensure that all of our merchandise is appropriately showcased to show solutions to accomplish our customer’s projects, highlighting the value and functionality of our products, and to maximize the appeal of our image and brand. We maintain a relatively consistent store layout which creates a familiar shopping experience across our store base. Our stores are clean and spacious with orderly merchandising and strategic product solutions to optimize our selling space and increase productivity. We offer our customers their choice of how to shop—in-store, online or through our in-home services. Our stores receive substantially all of our products directly from our distribution center co‑located with our corporate headquarters and call center in Coppell, Texas and we are currently in the process of opening a second distribution center in Aberdeen, Maryland, which is expected to be fully operational in late fiscal 2019. In fiscal 2018, TCS had net sales of $829.6 million, which represented approximately 93% of our total net sales.

· | Elfa, The Container Store, Inc.’s wholly owned Swedish subsidiary, Elfa International AB (“Elfa”), designs and manufactures component‑based shelving and drawer systems and made‑to‑measure sliding doors. Elfa was founded in 1948 and is headquartered in Malmö, Sweden. Elfa’s shelving and drawer systems are customizable for any area of the home, including closets, kitchens, offices and garages. Elfa operates three manufacturing facilities with two located in Sweden and one in Poland. The Container Store began selling elfa® products in 1978 and acquired Elfa in 1999. Today our TCS segment is the exclusive distributor of elfa® products in the U.S. and represented approximately 47% of Elfa’s total sales in fiscal 2018. Elfa also sells its products on a wholesale basis to various retailers in approximately 30 countries around the world, with a concentration in the Nordic region of Europe. In fiscal 2018, the Elfa segment had $65.5 million of third party net sales, which represented approximately 7% of our total consolidated net sales.

  Our Key Differentiators
 The Container Store Custom Closets:
 Our growing focus on The Container Store Custom Closets, inclusive of elfa® Classic, elfa® Décor, Avera™ and Laren™ closet lines, full complementary space completion products, and installation and in-home services, provides a unique opportunity to drive comparable store sales through higher average ticket while differentiating the Company from other brick and mortar and online, items-based retailers. Our highly-trained and experienced sales force has been selling proprietary, custom-designed elfa® and other closet solutions for over 40 years. We believe there is no other comparable retailer executing this holistic approach to custom closets. We offer the complete custom closet solution—not just our full line custom closets, but the full array of closet organization products that accompany those closets, as well as a national footprint with millions of customers coming through the door and visiting our online site each year. We design and sell The Container Store Custom Closets in-store, in-home, online, through our call center, as well as through our Contained Home® in-home organization service.
 Our elfa® Classic and elfa® Décor closet lines as well as other elfa® products continue to be an ever important, highly profitable and differentiating component in the growth of our Company and our commitment to dominating the custom closet market, accounting for approximately 28% of our TCS retail sales. We expect our new Elfa-manufactured closet line, Avera™, to add to this differentiation and grow the percentage of our TCS retail sales coming from Elfa-produced products. Due to our vertical integration with Elfa, we have control over the sourcing and availability of elfa® Classic, elfa® Décor, and Avera™, our best selling and highest margin products. We are the exclusive distributor of Elfa-

manufactured products in the United States. Approximately 20% of our fiscal 2018 TCS segment purchases were attributed to intercompany purchases from our Elfa segment.
 Our Unique Product Collection—Accomplishing Projects in Every Area of the Home:
 Our merchandising philosophy is to provide a carefully curated, one-of-a-kind collection of storage and organization solutions for every area of the home, at a variety of price points. We offer over 10,000 products designed to help our customers accomplish projects, maximize space and make the most of their homes. Each year, we introduce approximately 2,000 new SKUs. Our solutions-based selling approach (versus items-based) is delivered by our highly trained salespeople. We believe helping customers accomplish their organizational projects by selling solutions primarily consisting of exclusive, proprietary products differentiates us from other retailers. In fact, over half of our annual sales come from exclusive or proprietary products.
 Currently, our stores are typically organized into 16 distinct lifestyle departments. The types of products sold in each department are as follows:

      In order to offer our unique collection of products and to execute a competitive merchandising and business strategy, we work to form meaningful, long-lasting relationships with vendors from around the world. We believe these relationships benefit us in a number of ways, including providing us with an increased number of exclusive products and competitive pricing. We believe that by creatively crafting mutually beneficial vendor relationships we foster a unique sense of loyalty among our more than 800 product vendors. In fact, 19 of our top 20 vendors have been with us for at least 10 years and several of those vendors have been with us since our inception in 1978. For the TCS segment, our top 10 vendors, excluding Elfa, accounted for 30% of our total purchases in fiscal 2018. In order to maximize our purchasing flexibility, we generally do not enter into long-term contracts with our vendors.
 Our Shopping Experience:
 We strive to create an Air of Excitement® in each of our stores across the country. You can experience the Air of Excitement® through our employees’ smiling faces and their genuine interest in a customer’s organizational projects and in the bright visual displays of products and solutions.
 This is coupled with our highly personalized approach to customer service. Our employees are trained to ask questions to understand our customers’ needs. We believe that if we discover the underlying storage and organization challenges of our customers, we truly help them and make them happy. Service and selling are synonymous at The Container Store. We believe we can best serve our customers by astonishing them with personalized service and providing the solutions they most need to accomplish their organizational projects.
 We are a multi‑channel retailer, with a fully‑integrated website, responsive mobile site, and call center to complement our physical stores. Our website, containerstore.com, is intended to replicate the store experience offering virtually the same product assortment and providing real time inventory information for our stores, as well as certain products found exclusively online. We enhance the customer’s experience and deepen loyalty by creating consistent, relevant messages, regardless of which channel is being used. We offer free shipping on orders over $75 and our customers are able to purchase online and pick up at a store, with curbside pick‑up in most markets, or request same‑day home delivery in select markets. The website, mobile site, and call center sales channels accounted for an aggregate of approximately 19% of TCS net sales in fiscal 2018.
 Our Stores:
 We have adopted a disciplined expansion strategy designed to leverage the strength of our business model and nationally recognized brand name to successfully develop new stores in an array of markets that are primed for growth, including new, existing, small and large markets. Our current footprint of 92 stores extends to 33 states and the District of Columbia. We opened a total of four new stores (including two relocations) in fiscal 2018 and we expect to open two new stores (including one relocation) in fiscal 2019. While our current expansion focus is on domestic markets, we believe international expansion may provide additional growth opportunities for us in the future.
 We have a strong base of profitable stores and believe that our expansion opportunities in the United States are significant. We plan to continue to seek out strategic and profitable real estate expansion via a variety of store formats and sizes. In fiscal 2018, three of the four stores opened were designed as reduced‑sized footprint stores, located in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, Cherry Creek, Denver and Tysons Corner, Virginia, and both of our anticipated new stores in fiscal 2019 are being designed as reduced‑sized footprint stores as well. Our typical new store opening includes a 

 
  6
 
strategic marketing plan inclusive of public relations and comprehensive training for our store employees that includes product education, solution-selling education, operational education and company culture understanding – all of which we believe enables our new stores to deliver strong sales volume more quickly.
 Our Employees and Culture
 The Container Store has been helping its customers accomplish their projects and solve their organizational challenges for over 40 years, and since 1978, we have also been running our business guided by our values‑based set of principles. We are proud to be one of the founding companies in a movement called Conscious Capitalism®, which includes a group of like‑minded businesses, thought leaders, authors and academics all working together to change the way business is done in America and around the world. We have a firm belief that creating value for and optimizing relationships between all of the stakeholders of our business—employees, customers, vendors, communities and shareholders—is just simply the right thing to do.
 Consistent with our commitment to Conscious Capitalism, we believe that valued and happy employees result in better performance and higher profits. We believe in putting employees first and staying true to our seven Foundation Principles®—simple business philosophies that guide each decision we make. One of those Foundation Principles is 1 Great Person = 3 Good People® in terms of business productivity—that’s our hiring philosophy. In fact, in fiscal 2018, we hired only 6% of job applicants. Our employee‑first culture includes a tremendous commitment to communication, training and career development that helps deliver a differentiated experience to our customers, which we believe results in a higher average ticket, repeat visits and frequent referrals to other potential customers. We provide extensive formal training to full‑time store employees, especially during their first year of employment. Our stores offer flexible work schedules, comprehensive benefits and above retail industry average compensation to both full‑time and part‑time employees. As a result, our full‑time employee voluntary turnover rate was approximately 17% on average over the past two years, significantly below the retail average. It is for these reasons that The Container Store was named by FORTUNE Magazine to its annual list of 100 Best Companies to Work For® every year from 2000 through 2018.
 As of March 30, 2019, we had approximately 5,110 employees, of which approximately 4,600 were TCS employees and approximately 510 were Elfa employees. Of the approximately 4,600 TCS employees, approximately 2,900 were part‑time employees.  
 You can learn about our Foundation Principles and Conscious Capitalism on our blog, www.whatwestandfor.com. The information contained on our blog is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10‑K.
 Distribution
 In the TCS segment, substantially all of our merchandise flows through a centralized distribution center prior to transport to our retail stores. Our distribution center is co‑located with our corporate offices in Coppell, Texas. The approximately 1.1 million square foot facility was designed and constructed specifically for The Container Store and is comprised of approximately 93,000 square feet of corporate office space and approximately 1 million square feet of warehouse space.
 Our Coppell, Texas distribution center is utilized for retail store replenishment and direct‑to‑customer orders. With the exception of the Dallas / Fort Worth market, we utilize third party truckload carriers to transport all of our products to our stores. We utilize best in class logistics technology to optimize operations and current processes for picking, packing and shipping while providing a strong foundation for future growth. We continue to strengthen our distribution center with ongoing process and material handling improvements, as well as automation, in order to achieve even greater efficiencies in service levels and the management of our inventory.
 Within our distribution operations, we have a culture of safety and efficiency, with a robust metric program and a commitment to continuous improvement. All processes, teams and individuals are held to high efficiency and performance standards. After assessing our distribution and supply chain operations to ensure we are operating the most efficient and cost‑effective distribution network, we believe that opening a second distribution center will significantly improve service levels to our customers while at the same time reduce our supply chain and distribution costs. We are

currently in the process of opening a second distribution center in Aberdeen, Maryland, which is expected to be fully operational in late fiscal 2019. We also continue to invest in supply chain system enhancements for increased logistics network support.
 Elfa utilizes a broad network of third‑party carriers to deliver products from its manufacturing facilities to customers worldwide.
 Intellectual Property
 Our “The Container Store®,” “Contain Yourself!®,” “Foundation Principles®,” “POP! Perfectly Organized Perks®,” “Laren™,” “Avera™,” “Contained Home®,” and “elfa®” trademarks and certain variations thereon, such as our “The Container Store” logo and many trademarks used for our product lines and sales campaigns are registered or are the subject of pending trademark applications with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and with the trademark registries of many foreign countries. In addition, we own many domain names, including “www.containerstore.com,” “www.whatwestandfor.com” and others that include our trademarks. We own several elfa® utility and design patents protecting Elfa’s closet and shelving systems, and a utility patent for TCS’ proprietary retail shopping computer systems, along with copyrights in our catalogs, websites, and other marketing material. We believe that our trademarks, product designs and copyrighted works have significant value and we vigorously protect them against infringement. Competition
 We operate within the storage and organization category which extends across many retail segments including custom closets, housewares, office supplies and travel, among others. However, we are the only national retailer solely devoted to it. Storage and organization products are sold by a variety of retailers, including mass merchants, specialty retail chains, and internet‑based retailers, but they devote a smaller portion of their overall merchandise assortment to storage and organization. One of our biggest differentiators is that we sell solutions, not items. Some of our competitors are larger and may have greater financial, marketing and other resources than The Container Store. However, we compete based on our customer service, product selection and quality, price, convenience, consumer marketing and promotional activities, ability to identify and satisfy emerging consumer preferences, vendor relationships, and brand recognition, among other things. In addition, we believe that the strength of our solutions‑based selling with highly trained employees, exclusive offerings and vendor relationships, our passionate and loyal customer base and the quality, differentiation and breadth of our product assortment compare favorably to those of our competitors. Seasonality
 Our storage and organization product offering makes us less susceptible to holiday season shopping patterns than many retailers. Historically, our business has realized a higher portion of net sales, operating income and cash flows from operations in the fourth fiscal quarter, attributable primarily to the impact of Our Annual elfa® Sale, which traditionally starts in late December and runs into February. As such, our business has historically realized greater leverage on our selling, general and administrative expenses during our fiscal fourth quarter. In fact, over half of our adjusted net income was derived in the fiscal fourth quarter in fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016. For more information regarding our use of adjusted net income, and a reconciliation of adjusted net income to the generally accepted accounting principles financial measure of net income, see “Item 6. Selected Financial and Operating Data.” Regulation and Legislation
 We are subject to labor and employment laws, laws governing truth‑in‑advertising, privacy laws, safety regulations and other laws, including tax and trade policies and consumer protection regulations, such as the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008, that regulate retailers and govern the promotion and sale of merchandise and the operation of stores and warehouse facilities. We monitor changes in these laws and believe that we are in material compliance with applicable laws. Any legal or regulatory changes that impose additional restrictions or requirements on us or on our potential customers, such as the imposition of potential additional tariffs or retaliatory trade restrictions in connection with recently enacted U.S. tariffs, could adversely affect us by increasing our operating costs or decreasing demand for our products or services, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

 We source a significant portion of our products from outside the United States. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and other similar anti‑bribery and anti‑kickback laws and regulations generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non‑U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our policies and our vendor compliance agreements mandate compliance with applicable law, including these laws and regulations.

(“Kip”) Tindell, III will retire from his role as Chairman of our Board of Directors, and Sharon Tindell will retire from her roles as our President and Chief Merchandising Officer at the conclusion of our 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders (the “Annual Meeting”) and will resign from her role on the Board of Directors on or prior to the conclusion of our Annual Meeting.
