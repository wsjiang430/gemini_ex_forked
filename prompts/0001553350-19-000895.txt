ITEM 1.
BUSINESS

Background
 
Intelligent Buying, Inc. was incorporated in the State of California on March 22, 2004. On March 22, 2004, the Company issued 10,000 shares of the Companys common stock (an aggregate of 20,000 shares) to its founders, Eugene Malobrodsky and David Gorodyansky for a cash consideration of $200. On March 22, 2006, the Company issued 1,250,000 shares of its Preferred Stock to each of Messrs. Malobrodsky and Gorodyansky (2,500,000 Preferred Shares in the aggregate) in exchange for the 20,000 shares of the Companys common stock which had been previously issued. Both prior to the exchange and at the time of the exchange, Messrs. Malobrodsky and Gorodyansky owned 100% of the stock of the Company. The decision to exchange their common shares for preferred shares was intended to enable them to maintain a particular percentage holding of the Company and enable them to maintain voting control over the Company. On September 16, 2010, all 2,500,000 shares of preferred stock were converted into 5,000,000 shares of common stock. Thereafter, no shares of preferred stock remained issued and outstanding.
 
On January 28, 2015, we filed a Report with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Form 8-K, which announced that (a) our principal shareholders had sold their shares of common stock to AMS Encino Investments, Inc., a California corporation controlled by Hector Guerrero. That change of control was completed on February 9, 2015.

As of May 31, 2018, AMS Encino Investments, Inc. AMS) entered into a Common Stock Purchase Agreement (the Stock Purchase Agreement) pursuant to which AMS agreed to sell to Bagel Hole, Inc. (the Purchaser), the 5,753,333 shares of common stock (the Shares) of the Company owned by AMS, constituting approximately 79.3% of the Companys 7,256,600 issued and outstanding common shares, for $90,000. The transaction was consummated on June 15, 2018; and as a result of the sale there was a change of control of the Company. The Purchaser transferred 100,000 of those shares to unaffiliated persons. There is no family relationship or other relationship between AMS and the Purchaser.
 
As a result of the sale under the Stock Purchase Agreement, Hector Guerrero, who was CEO of AMS and was the Companys sole officer and director, resigned as the Companys sole officer and director, and appointed Philip Romanzi, who is the owner of the Purchaser, as the sole director of the Company. Mr. Romanzi is now the Companys sole officer and director.
 
Our Business Generally
 
The Company was engaged from 2004 in the business of asset management and sales of high-end computerized networking equipment to emerging high technology companies. Commencing in 2011, the Company began providing advertising services to promote products and services of third parties (primarily a related company, Anchorfree Wireless, Inc.) to the Companys customer base. Under this business model, third parties pay the Company a fee to disseminate their advertising to the Companys customer base.
 
The Company maintained its business model and operations described above, since the change of control on February 9, 2015, until October, 2016, when management discontinued operations. Since then, management has explored other business opportunities, in an effort to enhance shareholder value. 

On March 13, 2019, we entered into a Reorganization Agreement (the Reorganization Agreement) pursuant to which the Company agreed to acquire Jaguaring Company d/b/a Cannavolve (Cannavolve), a Washington corporation.

Cannavolve, based in Seattle, is a privately-owned accelerator serving the cannabis and hemp industry. Cannavolve has three operating divisions: Green Ambrosia Jamaica; Consumer Products Group; and Seattle Development Group. The business plan calls for (a) taking majority stakes, (b) acquiring companies in their entirety, and/or (c) conducting joint ventures within the global cannabis and hemp space. Cannavolves strategy is to develop these portfolio positions for the purpose of selling them or spinning them off as their own public companies, with the objective of maximizing shareholder value.
