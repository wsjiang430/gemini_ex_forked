Overview
 
We are a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing differentiated products to address unmet medical needs. We have a late-stage proprietary product pipeline focused on the treatment of diseases of the Central Nervous System, or CNS. We believe that the characteristics of these patient populations and shortcomings of available treatment options create opportunities for the development and commercialization of meaningfully differentiated medicines. In December 2018, we commercially launched the first of our CNS products, SympazanTM (clobazam) Oral Film, for use as an adjunctive therapy for seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome, or LGS in patients two years and older. Our most advanced proprietary product candidates, which we plan on commercializing ourselves, include (i) Libervant, a buccal soluble film formulation of diazepam for the treatment of recurrent epileptic seizures, for which we expect to complete certain additionally-requested clinical studies and submit a New Drug Application, or NDA, in the second half of 2019, and for which orphan drug and fast track designations have been granted; and (ii) Exservan, formerly known as AQST-117, an oral soluble film formulation of riluzole for the treatment of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, or ALS, for which orphan drug designation has been granted and for which the Company has started the NDA filing process. We have also developed a proprietary pipeline of complex molecule products addressing large market opportunities beyond CNS indications, which include (i) AQST-108, a sublingual film formulation of epinephrine for the treatment of anaphylaxis, for which we expect to begin our next Phase 1 proof of concept study with our enhanced prototype in the first half of 2019, with completion planned within this year, and (ii) AQST-305, a sublingual film formulation of octreotide for the treatment of acromegaly and neuroendocrine tumors, for which we began a human proof of concept study in Canada during the third quarter of 2018, and, based on anticipated enhancements that may be indicated by that study, we are planning additional human proof of concept trials in the second half of 2019.

In addition to these product candidates, we have a portfolio of commercialized and development-stage partnered products. These products include Suboxone®, a sublingual film formulation of buprenorphine and naloxone, which is the market leader for the treatment of opioid dependence. We manufacture all our partnered and proprietary products at our FDA and Drug Enforcement Agency, or DEA, inspected facilities and anticipate that our current manufacturing capacity is sufficient for commercial quantities of our products and product candidates currently in development. We have produced approximately 2 billion doses of Suboxone since its launch in 2010. Our products are developed using our proprietary PharmFilm® technology and know-how. Our patent portfolio currently comprises at least 200 issued patents worldwide, of which at least 40 are U.S. patents, and more than 90 pending patent applications worldwide.
 
Our Product Portfolio and Pipeline
 
The following table outlines our pipeline of products and product candidates:
 

Proprietary CNS Product Portfolio

We have initially focused our proprietary product pipeline on certain difficult to treat CNS diseases. Our PharmFilm® technology allows us to develop medicines that offer non-invasive delivery, customized suitability for patients with dysphagia, or trouble swallowing, can be administered without water and ensure consistent therapeutic dosing. We believe that these characteristics will allow us to achieve the desired patient outcomes, while potentially reducing the total cost of patient care.
 
The three most advanced assets within our proprietary CNS portfolio are as follows:

· | Sympazan – an oral soluble film formulation of clobazam, a benzodiazepine used as an adjunctive therapy for seizures associated with LGS. We developed Sympazan as an alternative to Onfi brand and clobazam generic, which were previously only available in either tablet form or liquid suspensions. LGS patients often have difficulty swallowing pills and large volume suspensions leading to uncertain and inconsistent dosing. These challenges increase the burden of care, particularly for patients that have difficulty swallowing or who may be combative or resistant during treatment administration. We believe that Sympazan addresses these treatment obstacles because it is mucoadhesive, dissolves rapidly in existing saliva and is swallowed along with a patient’s natural saliva production, and therefore cannot be easily spit out. In clinical trials, Sympazan has demonstrated bioequivalence to Onfi. Following approval by the FDA, we launched Sympazan in December 2018.

· | Libervant – a buccally, or inside of the cheek, administered soluble film formulation of diazepam, a benzodiazepine intended for rapid treatment of acute uncontrolled seizures in selected, refractory patients with epilepsy on stable regimens of AEDs who require intermittant use of diazapam to control bouts of increased seizure activity. Libervant has received orphan drug designation from the FDA. We are developing Libervant as an alternative to Diastat (diazepam rectal gel), the current standard of care rescue therapy for patients with refractory epilepsy, which as a rectal gel, is invasive, inconvenient, and difficult to administer. As a result, a large portion of the patient population does not receive adequate treatment or foregoes treatment altogether. We believe that Libervant will enable a larger share of patients to receive more appropriate treatment by providing consistent therapeutic dosing in a non-invasive and innovative treatment form for epileptic seizures. Certain epilepsy monitoring unit studies were completed for Libervant in 2018, we expect to complete additional clinical studies during the year and commence a rolling NDA submission. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Exservan, formerly AQST-117 – an oral soluble film formulation of riluzole, a small molecule glutamate antagonist used as an adjunctive therapy in the treatment of ALS, which has been shown to slow disease progression, increase lifespan and improve quality of life. However, because ALS patients typically have difficulty swallowing, tablet and liquid administration is challenging. Exservan has received orphan drug designation from the FDA. We are developing Exservan as an alternative to Rilutek and Tiglutik (riluzole), which is currently available only in tablet or liquid form in order to achieve an easier, more reliable and accurate dosing. This may allow patients to continue therapy even after their ability to swallow has become compromised. Exservan addresses these treatment obstacles because it is mucoadhesive and dissolves easily on the tongue without the need for water and without a substantial increase in salivary flow. In clinical trials, Exservan has demonstrated bioequivalence to Rilutek. We began the NDA submission process for Exservan in January 2019.

Proprietary Complex Molecule Portfolio
 
We are utilizing our technology and know-how to target acceptable market opportunities by developing orally-administered complex molecule therapies as alternatives to invasively-administered standard of care injectable therapeutics. We currently have two active complex molecule programs in clinical development. The first is focused on the oral delivery of the hormone epinephrine. The second is focused on the delivery of a peptide known as octreotide. Octreotide would be the first peptide delivered orally using our technology and may create other opportunities for peptides and biologics.
 
The two active programs in our complex molecule portfolio are:
 
  
· | AQST-108 – a sublingual film formulation of epinephrine that we are developing for the treatment of anaphylaxis, a severe and potentially life-threatening allergic reaction, and potentially for treatment of allergic reactions in patients at risk of anaphylaxis. Epinephrine is the standard of care in the treatment of anaphylaxis and is currently administered via intramuscular injection. The current market leader is EpiPen, a single-dose, pre-filled automatic injection device. As a result of its administration via intra-muscular injection, many patients and their caregivers are reluctant to use currently available products, resulting in increased hospital visits and overall cost of care to treat anaphylactic events. We are designing AQST-108 to be the first oral delivery form of epinephrine used to treat anaphylaxis as well as other acute allergic reactions. We believe that, as a result of its sublingual administration, AQST-108 will improve patient compliance and lower the total cost of care. AQST-108 has shown promising results in early human proof of concept trials. We are currently expecting to begin our next Phase 1 proof of concept study with our enhanced prototype in the first half of 2019, with completion planned within this year. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | AQST-305 – a sublingual film formulation of octreotide, a small peptide that has a similar pharmacological profile to natural somatostatin, for the treatment of acromegaly, as well as severe diarrhea and flushing associated with carcinoid syndrome. Acromegaly is a hormone disorder that results from the overproduction of growth hormone in middle-aged adults. Octreotide is the standard of care for the treatment of acromegaly. The current market leader, Sandostatin, is administered via deep subcutaneous or intramuscular injections once a month. This monthly treatment regimen can result in loss of efficacy towards the end of the monthly treatment cycle. We are developing AQST-305 as a non-invasive, pain-free alternative to Sandostatin to reduce treatment burden, healthcare costs and the potential loss of efficacy over the treatment cycle. AQST-305 has shown promising preclinical results. We began a human proof of concept study in Canada during the third quarter of 2018, and, based on anticipated enhancements that may be indicated by that study, we are planning to start additional human proof of concept trials late in 2019.

· | APL-130277 – a sublingual film formulation of apomorphine, which is a dopamine agonist in development to treat episodic off-periods in Parkinson’s disease. APL-130277 is being developed by our licensee as a sublingual alternative to injectable form of apomorphine. We licensed intellectual property for APL-130277 to Cynapsus Therapeutics, Inc., a company that was acquired by Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc., or Sunovion. Sunovion received a complete response letter on January 29, 2019 and announced that no additional clinical trials were necessary to submit a revised NDA. Assuming FDA approval for this product candidate, we intend to explore royalty monetization opportunities for the expected royalty and milestone revenue streams from this product which, if successful, could lead to additional non-dilutive capital for the Company.

PharmFilm® – Our Oral Film Technology
 
We are presently the worldwide leader in oral film drug delivery and manufacturing, having historically supplied the substantial majority of the world’s oral films for prescription pharmaceutical use, and we have the capability to produce more than one billion commercial doses a year. We developed our PharmFilm® technology to provide meaningful clinical and therapeutic advantages over other existing dosage forms and, in turn, to improve the lives of patients and caregivers. PharmFilm® is protected by our patent portfolio, which currently includes at least 200 issued patents worldwide, of which at least 40 are U.S. patents, and more than 90 pending patent applications worldwide. Several of the patents in this intellectual property portfolio are utilized in each of our proprietary pipeline products. We are continuing to develop additional intellectual property and know-how related to the applications and engineering of PharmFilm® alone or in combination with other technologies to create product capabilities that have compelling value propositions.
 
PharmFilm® is comprised of proprietary polymer compositions that serve as film formers to hold active pharmaceutical ingredients, or APIs, and excipients in place. Proprietary and patent-protected compositions, formulation and manufacturing techniques and technology are employed to ensure that the API is distributed uniformly throughout the film and that target absorption levels are achieved. Our proprietary technology and manufacturing processes ensure that PharmFilm® can be engineered to fit a variety of target product profiles in order to best address the unmet patient need present within specific disease states. PharmFilm®, which is similar in thickness and size to a postage stamp, can be administered via buccal, sublingual or lingual oral delivery.

We believe the innovative nature of our drug delivery platform has the potential to offer a number of meaningful advantages to patients, caregivers and physicians compared to current standard of care therapies, including:
   
 
· | preferred alternative to more invasive drug administration methods such as injection, rectal or nasal applications; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | faster, or at least equivalent, onset of action;
--+-------------------------------------------------


· | ease of administration and availability (no device required, no gel to transport);
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | direct absorption into the bloodstream reducing or avoiding “first pass” effects in the liver;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | reduced gastrointestinal, or GI, side effects;
--+-----------------------------------------------


· | positive dosing outcomes, especially for patients with physical (e.g., dysphagia) or psychological barriers to other methods of drug administration;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | stable, durable, portable and quick-dissolving (with or without water);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | customizable delivery routes for tailored pharmacokinetic, or PK, profiles (buccal, sublingual or lingual); and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | customizable taste profiles.
--+-----------------------------



We chose to initially focus our development efforts on the CNS market because we believe the application of PharmFilm® is particularly valuable and relevant to patients suffering from certain CNS disorders where there are unmet patient needs or shortcomings in current standards of care. We believe there remains significant opportunity to develop additional products in the CNS market. Additionally, our know-how and proprietary position have broad application beyond CNS, and we plan to explore the applications of PharmFilm® in other disease areas.
 
Our Management Team
 
Our management team is a critical component to the development of our business model and the execution of our strategy. We are led by executives with an average of over 18 years of relevant senior leadership experience, including developing and commercializing branded and generic pharmaceuticals at large multinational pharmaceutical companies such as Johnson & Johnson, GlaxoSmithKline PLC, Novartis AG and AstraZeneca. Additionally, our team has significant experience in the commercialization of pharmaceutical products, translational science, drug evaluation, clinical development, regulatory affairs and business development. Our management team is supervised and supported by a board of directors with expertise in finance, strategy, medicine and drug development.

Our Strategy
 
We are a patient-centric pharmaceutical company developing and commercializing products that address unmet needs and improve the lives of patients and their caregivers. We focus on developing medicines for patient populations suffering from the shortcomings of available treatment options, which can create an opportunity for differentiated medicines. Our pipeline is initially focused on developing treatments for CNS diseases, as well as orally administered complex molecules that we believe can be alternatives to invasively-administered standard of care therapies. Our strategy leverages our global intellectual property portfolio, know-how, demonstrated research and development capabilities and proprietary manufacturing platform.
 
To achieve these goals, our strategy includes the following key elements:
 
  
· | Advance our late stage proprietary portfolio of CNS product candidates to solve critical healthcare problems and make a meaningful improvement in the lives of patients and caregivers. We have focused development efforts on three proprietary CNS product candidates. These product candidates address treatment challenges associated with epilepsy and ALS. We have received FDA approval and subsequently began, in December 2018, distribution and sales of Sympazan. We expect to submit an NDA for Libervant during 2019. We began the NDA submission process for Exservan in January 2019. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Scale our commercial platform to maximize the value of our proprietary product candidates. In order to maximize the value of our proprietary product candidates, we are continuing our plan to self-commercialize our late stage CNS and other proprietary product candidates through a dedicated and focused commercial organization. We have recently built expertise in marketing, sales, payor and market access management and medical affairs in anticipation of multiple product launches, the first of which began in December 2018. Based on overlapping prescriber call points for our initial CNS product candidates, we believe an efficient and dedicated sales force can effectively cover the vast majority of targeted prescribers. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Exploit our technology and know-how to develop oral versions of more complex injectable drugs to address unmet patient needs. Based on promising preclinical and early clinical results, we intend to continue to develop oral transmucosal versions of epinephrine and octreotide, products that are currently available only in injectable form. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



We believe the success of these efforts may lead to additional high value opportunities in developing oral transmucosal versions of some proteins, peptides and other complex molecule drugs, which have historically been administered by means other than oral intake, such as injection or infusion.
 
  
· | Continue to identify product opportunities within CNS and other markets to expand our proprietary product pipeline. We intend to identify additional product candidates that provide clinical differentiation and solve unmet needs. In the CNS space, we will leverage our relationships with key stakeholders including patients, caregivers, key opinion leaders and patient advocacy groups to identify new product opportunities. Additionally, we will continue to evaluate other therapeutic areas, indications and products where we believe that our expertise and know-how can create differentiation and value. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Acquire and market products, or establish licensing relationships to develop and manufacture products, utilizing new chemical entities. We intend to continue to strategically expand our product portfolio by developing products that incorporate new chemical entities to treat disorders with high unmet need. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Continue to expand and solidify our intellectual property portfolio for our products, product candidates and manufacturing processes. Our global intellectual property portfolio is a significant source of competitive advantage, the strength of which has been demonstrated through multiple successful patent defenses. We have built a two-tier patent estate consisting of composition-of-matter and method of manufacture patents and patent applications. We intend to expand our intellectual property estate as we advance our PharmFilm® and other technologies and as we develop new and existing product candidates.

 Market Overview
 
CNS Market
 
CNS diseases affect the brain or spinal cord and cause neurological and psychiatric disorders. Driven by an increase in mental health awareness and an aging population, the global market for therapeutics indicated for CNS disorders was estimated by EvaluatePharma to be $81 billion in 2018, with anticipated growth to $118 billion by 2024.
Epilepsy
 
Epilepsy is a chronic CNS disorder characterized by recurrent seizure activity. There are several million people in the United States suffering from epilepsy. According to recent IQVIA data, antiepileptic medications generated billions of dollars of sales in the United States in 2017. The direct (medical) and indirect (lost wages and productivity) annual costs associated with epileptic patients in the United States are significant.
 
Epilepsy treatment regimens typically consist of chronic and acute management therapies. Chronic medicines are used on a daily basis to suppress seizure activity. Approximately 1.2 million of those 3.4 million people suffering from epilepsy will continue to suffer with breakthrough seizures and require an acute (rescue) management strategy. Patients are routinely prescribed antiepileptic drugs, or AEDs, as “maintenance” therapy to control chronic seizure activity. Most AEDs specifically target neuronal excitation or neuronal inhibitory pathways. There are currently more than 20 AEDs approved for use in the United States, and therapeutic choice depends on the epileptic syndrome being considered. Patients are routinely prescribed benzodiazepines as “rescue” therapy for the management of acute seizure emergencies.
 
Rescue therapies are administered as needed in the event of an acute seizure to rapidly terminate seizure activity. One of the most effective benzodiazepines currently available for the treatment of acute seizures is diazepam. Diazepam is currently marketed as Diastat, a product administered rectally. Although Diastat is the preferred drug prescribed by physicians, due to its rectal administration, Diastat presents a particular challenge for patients. As a result, only approximately 100,000 patients out of 1.2 million sufferers currently use this therapy. The remaining sufferers either pursue less effective treatments or forego treatment altogether. We are developing our lead product candidate, Libervant, to reduce the burden associated with administering this rescue therapy, thereby improving patient outcomes, compliance and lowering the overall cost to the healthcare system for these epileptic patients.
 
There are multiple epileptic syndromes including LGS, which is a rare, intractable form of epilepsy and affects approximately 55,000 patients in the United States. Patients with LGS are often drug resistant, predisposing them to recurrent seizures, and are typically prescribed a combination of antiepileptic medications, which often includes clobazam. Clobazam (branded name Onfi) is available in both a tablet and suspension formulation. Clobazam generated combined sales revenue of $810 million with more than 550,000 prescriptions filled in 2018 and lost patent protection in October 2018. Sympazan was developed and recently marketed to reduce the burden associated with drug administration and cost.
    Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis
 
ALS is a progressive neurodegenerative disease affecting nerve cells responsible for controlling voluntary muscle movement. Patients suffering from ALS have progressive degeneration of motor neurons, which ultimately leads to death, primarily due to respiratory failure. Diagnosis of ALS typically occurs between the ages of 40 and 60, with more than 13,000 patients diagnosed in the U.S. each year, which corresponds to a prevalence of four cases per 100,000 people.
 
There are currently no treatments available that reverse the damage caused by ALS. However, there are two treatment molecules that have been shown to slow disease progression, riluzole, marketed as Rilutek or Tiglutik and edaravone marketed as Radicava.
 
In addition to therapeutics aimed at slowing disease progression, patients are often prescribed multiple medications and receive additional therapies, including breathing care, physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, nutritional support, and psychological and social support, to ease the burden of the disease.
 
As a result of the degenerative muscle function associated with ALS, patients eventually lose the ability to swallow. Because riluzole may slow disease progression and delay the need for a tracheotomy, dysphagia represents a barrier to treatment for many of these patients. We are developing Exservan to allow patients to remain on riluzole therapy for extended periods of time, delaying the need for procedures like tracheotomies, prolonging the quality of life for those patients and lowering the overall cost of treatment.
 

9
 

Other Therapeutic Areas
 
In addition to products to treat CNS conditions, we are developing a number of product candidates in other therapeutic areas, such as anaphylaxis and acromegaly to address those unmet needs.
Anaphylaxis
 
Anaphylaxis is a systemic allergic reaction caused by a wide range of allergen exposure, estimated to affect one in 50 people in the United States. Anaphylaxis typically occurs quickly once allergen exposure has occurred, and if untreated, can lead to death via airway restriction.
 
Treatment of anaphylaxis typically consists of an intramuscular injection of epinephrine administered at the earliest opportunity, followed by additional intramuscular or intravenous injections as needed. While generic versions of epinephrine are currently available, they are provided as a vial of medication administered via syringes. Due to the inconvenience of this dosing mechanism, a branded form of epinephrine known as the EpiPen, which utilizes a proprietary auto-injector device administered through a deep intramuscular injection, dominates the market. In addition, recent manufacturing issues that resulted in injector malfunctions have led to significant patient concern regarding the reliability of auto-injectors. EpiPen, which is marketed by Mylan Pharmaceuticals, Inc., represents over 70% of the current market on a prescription volume basis. Proper dosing and the ability to effectively administer epinephrine in a timely, reliable manner is critical for patients experiencing anaphylaxis as well as other acute allergic reactions. However, the inability to administer complex molecules via oral administration has limited the development of treatments that have the potential to provide significant patient benefit. We designed AQST-108 to offer a more convenient and cost-effective oral form of epinephrine as an alternative to the current standard of care.
 
Acromegaly
 
Acromegaly is a hormone disorder that results from the overproduction of growth hormone in middle-aged adults. The condition is typically caused by a benign tumor present in the pituitary gland that excretes excessive amounts of growth hormone and leads to exaggerated bone growth over time. Due to the gradual progression of the disorder, patients are often not diagnosed for years. The prevalence of acromegaly is estimated to be 78 cases per million people, indicating approximately 25,000 diagnosed patients within the United States.
 
Depending on the placement and size of the tumor, patients may be eligible for endoscopic trans nasal transsphenoidal surgery, a procedure in which pituitary tumors are removed through the nose and sphenoid sinus. However, surgeons may be unable to completely remove the tumor, leading to persistently elevated growth hormone levels post-surgery. The standard of care for post-surgery patients includes the use of somatostatin analogues to lower production or block the action of growth hormones. The somatostatin analogues currently available, octreotide and lanreotide, are administered by deep subcutaneous or intramuscular injections once a month, or subcutaneous injections three times daily.
 
The market leading product for acromegaly is octreotide, which is marketed as Sandostatin LAR by Novartis, and is administered monthly via depot injections.
 
Ease of administration has been identified as an unmet patient need within this market, with at least one other company pursing an oral formulation of octreotide. Our PharmFilm® formulation has the potential to reduce treatment burden and healthcare costs for patients and improve clinical differentiation.
 
Proprietary CNS Product Candidates
 
Libervant (Diazepam)
 
Product Overview
 
Libervant is a buccal soluble film formulation of diazepam in development that is intended for rapid treatment of acute uncontrolled seizures and for administration in the management of selected, refractory patients with epilepsy on stable regimens of AEDs who require intermittant use of diazapam to control bouts of increased seizure activity. We expect to submit an NDA for Libervant in 2019. Libervant has been granted both orphan drug and fast track designations.

Limitations of Current Therapies 
Approximately 1.2 million of the 3.4 million people suffering from epilepsy will continue to suffer with breakthrough seizures and require an acute (rescue) management strategy. Many patients who suffer from severe epilepsy and experience refractory or breakthrough seizures are managed sub-optimally with current therapies, and in some cases chose not to be prescribed any therapies due to the limitations of the currently marketed rectal product. The standard of care therapy, Diastat, is particularly difficult to administer and presents challenges for both patients and caregivers. Difficulties associated with rectal administration of Diastat include patient dignity and respect, inaccurate dosing due to leakage of rectal gel, invasiveness of treatment, inconvenience, time required to administer the drug, and ability of non-primary caregivers to effectively administer Diastat in the event a primary caregiver is not present. As a result of these challenges, only about 250,000 prescriptions of Diastat are dispensed per year, despite a much larger population of patients suffering from epilepsy who would potentially benefit from a rescue therapy.
 
Additionally, there is a population of epilepsy patients who do not achieve adequate blood plasma concentration of diazepam following administration of Diastat. We refer to these patients as Diastat “non-responders”. There is no way to proactively identify these patients which represents a significant clinical challenge.
 
Our Solution
 
We are developing Libervant as an alternative to Diastat. As an easily administered buccal film product that quickly dissolves when applied to the buccal mucosa, Libervant has a rapid onset of action and provides a consistent therapeutic dosing. We believe Libervant has the potential to address many of the dosing and administration issues facing patients who are currently prescribed Diastat and to become the standard of care therapy for patients. We believe Libervant has the potential to expand the population of epilepsy patients who are prescribed rescue therapies to include high functioning teens and adults who otherwise chose not to use Diastat and instead manage their symptoms with extra maintenance doses of their oral therapies before or after they experience a seizure. An oral product with fast onset of action could be a better rescue therapy option to these patients. In market research studies we have performed, patients, caregivers, and physicians have all indicated high receptivity to an oral alternative to Diastat.
 
We also believe that Libervant has the potential to be effective in the Diastat “non-responders” population. In studies to date, Libervant has shown consistent blood plasma concentrations in volunteers that did not obtain expected diazepam levels using Diastat.
 

Exservan, formerly referred to as AQST-117 (Riluzole)
 
Product Overview
 
Exservan is an oral soluble film formulation of riluzole, a small molecule glutamate antagonist used as an adjunctive therapy in the treatment of ALS, which has been shown to slow disease progression, increase lifespan and improve quality of life.
Limitations of Current Therapies
 
ALS is a neurodegenerative disorder that involves gradual breakdown of motor neurons leading to muscle weakness, disability, and ultimately death. The U.S. prevalence of ALS is 4 cases per 100,000 persons, though higher prevalence rates are seen among specific age and ethnic groups. Disease progression leads to muscle atrophy, including loss of ability to swallow. Riluzole is currently marketed as tablets by Covis Pharma under the brand name Rilutek, and as liquid suspension by ITF Pharma under the brand name Tiglotik TM has been subject to generic competition since June 2013.
 
As a result of the degenerative muscle function associated with ALS, patients eventually lose the ability to swallow. Dysphagia represents a barrier to treatment for many of these patients, with medication administration resulting from dysphagia representing a significant unmet need for ALS caregivers and patients. The longer patients are able to remain on riluzole therapy, which has been shown to slow the progression of ALS, more invasive and costly treatments, such as tracheotomies, can be delayed, thus improving patients’ quality of life.
 
Our Solution
 
We have developed Exservan as an alternative to the existing riluzole therapies (Rilutek and Tiglutik), which is currently available only in tablet form. Exservan allows ALS patients, who suffer dysphagia as a core symptom of their progressing disease, to achieve more reliable and accurate dosing and to continue therapy even after their ability to swallow is compromised. We believe this improved administration may lead to improved outcomes in ALS patients.

Clinical Development
   We have completed a pilot PK and pivotal PK study for Exservan. In addition, we have completed a food effect study. All of these studies have successfully shown bioequivalence to the reference listed drug, Rilutek. We have completed a swallowing safety study in subjects with ALS after receiving the FDA’s permission to shorten the study based on available results. We compared the pharmacokinetic profile of a 50mg dose of riluzole oral soluble film, or ROSF, with a 50mg dose of Rilutek (riluzole) tablets when administered to healthy volunteers in a fasted state. We believe that ROSF, which has demonstrated bioequivalence to Rilutek, can fulfill a critical need for ALS patients, due to its ability to be administered twice daily without the need for water. We began the NDA submission process for Exservan in January 2019.
Proprietary Complex Molecule Candidates
 
AQST-108 (Epinephrine)
 
Product Overview
 
AQST-108 is a sublingual film formulation of epinephrine that we are developing for the treatment of anaphylaxis, a severe and potentially life-threatening allergic reaction. AQST-108 has progressed thru its initial Phase 1 clinical development, and with learnings from that study we expect to begin our next Phase 1 proof of concept study with an enhanced prototype in 2019.
Limitations of Current Therapies
 
Anaphylaxis is a severe systemic allergic reaction that can be triggered by certain foods, insect stings, certain medications and latex, among other allergens. Signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis typically occur within seconds or minutes of exposure and may include low blood pressure, skin rash or itching, constriction of the airway and difficulty breathing and nausea and vomiting. If not treated immediately, anaphylaxis can lead to death due to airway restriction or cardiac arrest. Anaphylaxis affects an estimated one in fifty people in the United States across a range of allergens.
 
The standard of care for anaphylaxis is epinephrine, a non-selective adrenergic agonist, which is administered via intramuscular injection. Because anaphylaxis can progress quickly, the ability to administer a reliable and accurate dose of epinephrine as quickly as possible following a reaction is critical for patient recovery and survival. Epinephrine is typically administered in a single-dose, pre-filled automatic injection device, or an auto-injector. People with known allergies and who are at risk for anaphylaxis are advised to carry an auto-injector with them at all times and self-administer at the first signs of an anaphylactic reaction. The EpiPen and similar products can be inconvenient to transport and many patients and caregivers dislike injections as a delivery method. Additionally, injector malfunction issues and user administration errors may prevent successful and timely dosing which can result in danger to patients.
 
Our Solution
 
We are developing AQST-108 as an alternative to the currently marketed intramuscular injections. We believe there is a market opportunity for a non-injectable, easier to administer product with a fast onset of action. A product with this profile would enable patients to conveniently and rapidly self-administer a reliable and accurate dose of epinephrine during an anaphylactic reaction, which we believe would result in greater patient compliance. We believe AQST-108 has the potential to reduce the treatment burden currently associated with intramuscular injections and may lower costs to the healthcare system associated with anaphylaxis, such as hospitalizations due to inaccurate or untimely dosing.
Clinical Development
 
We have conducted proof-of-concept studies to demonstrate our ability to deliver epinephrine via a non-invasive sublingual film. We evaluated AQST-108 in a one dose escalation studies, each with six patients, in which there were no severe adverse events. In addition, we completed a Phase 1 near-term 3-way crossover study in healthy male subjects comparing the pharmacokinetic profile of 30mg dose of epinephrine sublingual soluble film to an EpiPen intramuscular injection (0.3mg epinephrine) when administered to healthy volunteers. We believe that this proof of concept study in humans provides proof of our ability to deliver epinephrine via the oral cavity.
 
Based on the results of the initial Phase 1 study, we are optimizing the formulation of AQST-108. We are currently testing our new formulation in preclinical studies and expect to initiate a second Phase 1 study with the new formulation during 2019. Upon the completion of our second Phase 1 study, we plan to request a pre-IND meeting with the FDA to discuss our clinical development program.

AQST-305 (Octreotide)
 
Product Overview
 
AQST-305 is a sublingual film formulation of octreotide, an 8 amino acid peptide that has a similar pharmacological profile to natural somatostatin, for the treatment of acromegaly. We began a human proof of concept study in Canada during the third quarter of 2018, and, based on anticipated enhancements that may be indicated by that study, we are planning human dosing during the second half of 2019.
Limitations of Current Therapies
 
Acromegaly is a hormone disorder that results from the overproduction of growth hormone in middle-aged adults. The condition is typically caused by a benign tumor present in the pituitary gland that excretes excessive amounts of growth hormone and leads to exaggerated bone growth over time.
 
First-line treatment of acromegaly usually involves surgery to remove the tumor. Some patients are not eligible for surgery depending on the placement and size of the tumor, and in some cases, surgery does not completely remove the tumor, leading to persistently elevated growth hormone levels. The standard of care for post-surgery patients includes the chronic use of somatostatin analogues to lower production or block the action of growth hormones. The somatostatin analogues currently on the market, octreotide and lanreotide, are administered by deep subcutaneous or intramuscular injections once a month, which are invasive and painful and can represent a treatment burden for patients. Such treatment burdens associated with the somatostatin analogues currently on the market include injection site reactions, sub-optimal symptom control and adverse emotional impact. We believe there is a market opportunity for a non-injectable, easier to administer product that delivers a reliable and consistent dose of octreotide.
 
Our Solution
 
We have designed AQST-305 for twice daily administration, which we believe will reduce the burden of monthly depot intramuscular injections and address the potential loss of efficacy over the treatment life cycle with currently marketed products. AQST-305 can be administered by the patient, rather than having to receive monthly injections in a physician’s office. Additionally, because AQST-305 is administered twice-daily, patients will receive a consistent dose of octreotide and will not need to be concerned with the potential loss of efficacy that may otherwise result when receiving only a monthly dosage administered via injection. We believe AQST-305 will reduce the burden for patients who are looking for a non-invasive, pain-free, easier to administer product.
Clinical Development
 
After completing a number of preclinical development programs, we began a human proof of concept study in Canada during the third quarter of 2018 and, based on anticipated enhancements that were indicated from the results of that study, we are working on a reformulated version of the product, and are planning to conduct additional proof of concept studies in the second half of 2019.
Licensed Products and Product Candidates
 
Suboxone (Buprenorphine and Naloxone)
 
Suboxone is a sublingual film formulation of buprenorphine and naloxone. Buprenorphine and naloxone are opioid antagonists that, when combined, are effective for treating opioid addiction. Suboxone reduces the potential for abuse and improves safety, clinical differentiation, dissolution, taste and texture for patients suffering from opioid addiction. According to the American Society of Addiction Medicine, drug overdose is the leading cause of accidental death in the United States, with opioid addiction driving this epidemic. Opioid dependence is estimated to affect several million people in the United States. Patients overcoming opioid addiction can experience painful withdrawal symptoms, which can be mitigated with the use of opioid antagonists.
 
Suboxone Sublingual Film was launched in partnership with Indivior in 2010 to treat opioid dependence pursuant to a commercialization agreement. We have granted Indivior an exclusive worldwide license to this product. Suboxone Sublingual Film is the market leader for buprenorphine based opioid abuse disorder treatment, capturing over 50% of total prescriptions in 2018, despite generic competition. Since the launch of the product in 2010, approximately 2 billion doses have been delivered to patients. We are the sole and exclusive manufacturer of Suboxone Sublingual Film worldwide for Indivior. See “Material Agreements – Commercial Exploitation Agreement with Indivior.” Recently, on February 20, 2019, Dr. Reddy’s Labs and Alvogen, Inc. launched competing generic formulations of this product, and on February 22, 2109, Mylan Pharmaceuticals, Inc. announced its launch of a similar generic formulation.

Zuplenz (Ondansetron)
 
Zuplenz is an oral soluble film formulation of ondansetron, a 5-HT3 antagonist approved for the treatment of nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy and post-operative recovery. Ondansetron is available as intravenous injections, intramuscular injections, orally dissolving tablets, oral solution, tablets, and film. Generic and branded products are available, with the branded product marketed as Zofran by GlaxoSmithKline. We licensed commercial rights for Zuplenz to Midatech Pharma in the United States, Canada, and China. Midatech launched Zuplenz in the United States in 2015. We are the sole and exclusive manufacturer of Zuplenz for Midatech.
APL-130277 (Apomorphine)
 
APL-130277 is a sublingual film using apomorphine, a dopamine agonist indicated as an intermittent therapy to overcome episodic off periods in Parkinson’s disease. Parkinson’s disease affects approximately 500,000 patients in the United States. APL-130277 is designed to address an unmet need in patients who suffer from dysphagia and/or patients who have discontinued or avoided use of the existing injectable product due to site irritation. We licensed intellectual property rights for PharmFilm® technology associated with APL-130277 to Cynapsus Therapeutics, Inc., which was acquired by Sunovion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Sunovion). If approved, we will earn royalties and other milestone payments contingent upon worldwide sales of APL-130277. See “Material Agreements – License Agreement with Sunovion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.” In January 2019, we learned that Sunovion received a complete response letter (a CRL) from the FDA in response to its submission of an NDA for APL-130277. In a subsequent press release, Sunovion advised that additional information and analyses are required, but that no new clinical studies are specified. Assuming FDA approval for this product candidate, we intend to explore royalty monetization opportunities for the expected royalty and milestone revenue streams from this product, which, if successful, could lead to additional non-dilutive capital for the Company.
AQST-119 (Tadalafil)
 
AQST-119 is an oral soluble film formulation of tadalafil, a vasodilator that is used to treat erectile dysfunction, or ED. ED affects men primarily between the ages of 40 and 70, with approximately 10% having severe or complete ED, and 25% having moderate or intermittent erectile difficulties. AQST-119 is designed to provide patients a discreet product with increased ease of use. We submitted an NDA to the FDA in November 2016 and were provided with a complete response letter in September 2017, which was followed in May 2018 by the re-submission of our NDA.  On November 16, 2018, we announced our receipt of a complete response letter from the FDA and are currently working to establish a path to resubmission and approval. We are currently seeking a commercialization licensee for AQST-119.
 
With FDA approval, we launched Sympazan in December 2018. In consideration of our NDA filing for Exservan in January 2019, we anticipate FDA review to conclude within customary timeframes, with the launch of Exservan to follow any such FDA approval as that may be granted. Our proprietary Libervant product is expected to follow a similar pathway, which we will launch after approval from the FDA.
 
We intend to similarly develop commercialization strategies for AQST-305 and AQST-108 in advance of their respective NDA submissions, including a combination of company and licensee resources.
 
 Commercialization Strategy
 
We plan to focus our commercial strategy for our proprietary CNS product portfolio on building awareness through healthcare provider education, with a particular focus on neurologists and their treatment teams, as well as patient caregivers.
 
We have recently built a commercial team with significant experience earned from multiple product launches prior to joining our Company, including several in the CNS space. We intend to continue adding relevant experience in sales leadership, regulatory and medical affairs, marketing, and payor and market access management to supplement our capabilities in these areas. Based on the number of treatment specialists, target patients and overlap of our initial CNS product candidates, we believe that we will be able to leverage a sales force effectively across these areas. We plan to engage up to 50 dedicated sales representatives in anticipation of multiple product launches through 2020. The launch and marketing of our products will be focused in the United States, with any ex-U.S. commercialization efforts likely out-licensed to other companies.

Manufacturing and Product Supply
 
We operate two redundant manufacturing and primary packaging facilities located in Portage, Indiana, where we currently manufacture our licensed products, Suboxone, its authorized generic, and Zuplenz, on an exclusive basis. These facilities are expected to have a combined capacity to accommodate the production of our two marketed products and both our near-term and long-term pipeline of proprietary and licensed products, without any current need for additional infrastructure. We will continue to consider our anticipated facilities and infrastructure needs as our product development grows. We have produced over 1.1 billion doses in the last four years. As a company, our research and development laboratories are registered with the DEA, for Schedule II-V drugs.
 
We are subject to various regulatory requirements, such as the regulations of the FDA, the DEA, and other foreign health authorities such as the Australian Government Department of Health’s Therapeutics Goods Administration, or TGA. We are required to register our facilities and adhere to cGMP standards. These standards require manufacturers to follow elaborate design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures throughout the entire manufacturing process. Our facilities have undergone inspections by the FDA, DEA, TGA, and several quality assurance inspections by pharmaceutical companies for cGMP compliance. In each case, the facilities have passed inspection and are subject to periodic re-inspection. Failure to comply with these and other statutory and regulatory requirements subjects a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, including warning letters, the seizure or recall of products, injunctions, consent decrees placing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations and civil and criminal penalties. Adverse experiences with the product or product complaints must be reported and could result in the imposition of market restrictions through labeling changes or in product removal. Product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems concerning safety or efficacy of the product occur following approval.

We purchase our raw materials, including Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients, from qualified, approved vendors both domestically and internationally. While we typically source raw materials from the lowest cost provider whenever possible and continue to pursue a multi-supplier strategy for all of our critical raw materials, our product packaging foil is supplied by a single manufacturer. Such manufacturer utilizes multiple manufacturing facilities for production of our packaging foil. We expect that we will enter into more formal supply agreements in the future as production volumes increase and are more predictive.
 
Subject to the supervision of our internal clinical development staff, we use third-party Contract Research Organizations, or CROs, to administer and conduct many aspects of our planned clinical trials including monitoring and managing data, and we will rely upon such CROs, as well as medical institutions, clinical investigators and consultants, to conduct our trials in accordance with our clinical protocols. We intend for such CROs to play a significant role in the subsequent collection and analysis of data from such trials.  Additionally, we intend to continue to outsource secondary packaging and third-party logistics for our proprietary products.
 
Competition
 
We compete with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that develop and commercialize therapeutics for the treatment of a broad range of disease areas and indications. Additionally, we compete with companies that utilize advanced drug administration platforms, such as oral, injectable, intranasal, transdermal patch and pulmonary delivery, to create improved therapeutics over current standards of care. This industry is highly competitive and new products and technologies evolve and come to market at a rapid pace. The companies operating in this market include multinational organizations, established biotechnology companies, single product pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, and generic drug companies. Many of the larger, established organizations currently have commercialization capabilities in-house, and may have partnership or license agreements in place with smaller companies for commercialization rights. These companies may develop new drugs to treat the indications that we target or seek to have existing drugs approved for the treatment of the indications that we target.
 
We will compete with commercialized products in all markets for which we are seeking approval. For outpatient treatment of emergency breakthrough seizures, Diastat (diazepam rectal gel, Bausch Health Companies, Inc.) remains the only currently commercialized product. Several marketed products are approved for the treatment of LGS, including Epidiolex (GW Pharma), Onfi (clobazam, Lundbeck A/S) and clobazam generic tablets and liquids and Banzel (rufinamide, Eisai Co.). For ALS, generic riluzole tablets are considered the standard of care. Radicava (edaravone, Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation), which launched in the United States in 2017, is also expected to be used as part of a comprehensive treatment plan that may also include riluzole. Commercialized products for anaphylaxis include epinephrine autoinjectors such as EpiPen (Mylan Pharmaceuticals, Inc.), among others. In acromegaly, marketed products include short- and long-acting somatostatin analogues, such as Sandostatin (octreotide acetate, Novartis AG), as well as the growth hormone receptor antagonist Somavert (pegvisomant, Pfizer Inc.).
 
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapid evolution and advancements of technologies, intense competition and strong defense of intellectual property.  Any products and product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize may compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.  Key product features that would affect our ability to effectively compete with other therapeutics include the efficacy, safety and convenience of our products and the ease of use and effectiveness of any companion diagnostics.  The level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors will also significantly affect the pricing and competitiveness of our products.
 
Material Agreements
 
Commercial Exploitation Agreement with Indivior
 
In August 2008, we entered into a Commercial Exploitation Agreement with Reckitt Benckiser Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or the Indivior License Agreement. Indivior, Inc. is the successor in interest to Reckitt Benckiser Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Pursuant to the Indivior License Agreement, we have agreed to manufacture and supply Indivior’s requirements of Suboxone for both United States and international markets on an exclusive basis.

The level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors will also significantly affect the pricing and competitiveness of our products.
 
Under the terms of the Indivior License Agreement, we are required to manufacture Suboxone in accordance with cGMP standards and according to the specifications and processes set forth in the related quality agreements with Indivior. Additionally, we are required to obtain API for the manufacture of Suboxone directly from Indivior. The Indivior License Agreement specifies a minimum annual threshold quantity of Suboxone that we are obligated to fill and requires Indivior to provide us with a forecast of its requirements at various specified times throughout the year.
 
The Indivior License Agreement provides for payment by Indivior of a purchase price per unit that is subject to adjustment based on our ability to satisfy minimum product thresholds. Additionally, in the event Indivior purchases certain large quantities of Suboxone during a specified period, Indivior will be entitled to scaled rebates on its purchases.
 
In addition to the purchase price for the Suboxone supplied, under the Indivior License Agreement, we are to be paid low single digit percentage royalty payments tied to net sales value, subject to annual maximum amounts and limited to the life of related United States or international patents. Indivior exercised its right to buy out its future royalty obligations based on sales in the United States in 2012. Indivior remains obligated to pay royalties for all sales outside the United States.
 
The Indivior License Agreement contains customary contractual termination provisions for breach or in the event of bankruptcy or corporate dissolution, the intellectual property surrounding Suboxone is found to be invalid, or either party commits a material breach of the Indivior License Agreement. Additionally, Indivior may terminate this license agreement if the FDA or other applicable regulatory authority declares our manufacturing site to no longer be suitable for the manufacture of Suboxone or Suboxone is no longer suitable to be manufactured due to health or safety reasons. The initial term of the Indivior License Agreement was seven years from the commencement date. Thereafter, the Indivior License Agreement has automatically renewed for successive one-year periods. One-year renewals are expected to continue in the absence of Indivior’s written notice of its intent not to renew at least one year prior to the expiration of any prior renewal term.
 
Supplemental Agreement with Indivior
 
On September 24, 2017, we entered into an agreement with Indivior, or the Indivior Supplemental Agreement. Pursuant to the Indivior Supplemental Agreement, we conveyed to Indivior all of our existing and future rights in the settlement of various ongoing patent enforcement legal actions and disputes related to the Suboxone product. We also conveyed to Indivior the right to sublicense manufacturing and marketing capabilities to enable an Indivior licensed generic buprenorphine product to be produced and sold by parties unrelated to Indivior or us. Under the Indivior Supplemental Agreement, we are entitled to receive certain payments from Indivior commencing on the date of the agreement through January 1, 2023. Once paid, all payments made under the Indivior Supplemental Agreement are non-refundable. Through February 20, 2019, the date of launch of the competing generics of Dr. Reddy’s Labs and Alvogen, we received an aggregate of $40,750 from Indivior under the Indivior Supplemental Agreement. Further payments under this agreement are suspended until adjudication of related patent infringement litigation occurs. If such litigation is successful, in addition to the amounts already received as described in the foregoing, we may receive up to an additional $34,250 consisting of (i) up to $33,000 in the aggregate from any combination of (a) performance or event-based milestone payments and (b) single digit percentage royalties on net revenue earned by Indivior on sales of Suboxone and (ii) the aforementioned additional $1,250 that was earned through the issuance of additional process patent rights to us. The aggregate payments under this Indivior Supplemental Agreement are capped at $75,000.
 
All payments made by Indivior to us pursuant to the Indivior Supplemental Agreement are in addition to, and not in place of, any amounts owed by Indivior to us pursuant to the Indivior License Agreement. Indivior’s payment obligations under the Indivior Supplemental Agreement are subject to certain factors affecting the market for Suboxone and may terminate prior to January 1, 2023 in the event certain contingencies relating to such market occur.
 

16
 

Indivior is our largest customer and the combined revenue received from Indivior pursuant to the Indivior License Agreement and the Indivior Supplemental Agreement represented 89% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 88% of the total revenue in 2017.
 
License Agreement with Sunovion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
 
In April 2016, we entered into a license agreement with Cynapsus Therapeutics Inc. (which was later succeeded to in interest by Sunovion Pharmaceuticals, Inc, or Sunovion), referred to as the Sunovion License Agreement, pursuant to which we granted Sunovion an exclusive, worldwide license (with the right to sub-license) to certain intellectual property, including existing and future patents and patent applications, covering all oral films containing APL-130277 (apomorphine) for the treatment of off episodes in Parkinson’s disease patients, as well as two other fields. Our licensee, Sunovion, as sponsor of APL-130277, submitted an NDA to the FDA on March 29, 2018; following PDUFA date in January 2019, Sunovion received a CRL which is discussed in greater detail in preceding sections of this report.
 
In consideration for the rights granted to Sunovion under the Sunovion License Agreement, we received aggregate payments totaling $18,000 to date. In addition to the upfront payment of $5,000 we have also earned an aggregate of $13,000 in connection with specified regulatory and development milestones in the United States and Europe (the “Initial Milestone Payments”) all of which of which has been received to date. We are also entitled to receive certain contingent one-time milestone payments related to product availability and regulatory approval in the United States and Europe, certain one-time milestone payments based on the achievement of specific annual net sales thresholds of APL-130277, and ongoing mid-single digit percentage royalty payments related to the net sales of APL-130277 (subject to reduction to low-single digit percentage royalty payments in certain circumstances), subject to certain minimum payments. The maximum aggregate milestone payments that may be paid to us pursuant to the Sunovion License Agreement is equal to $45 million. With the exception of the Initial Milestone Payments, there can be no guarantee that any such milestones will in fact be met or payable. This Sunovion License Agreement will continue until terminated by us or Sunovion in accordance with the termination provisions of the Sunovion License Agreement.
 
As more fully described in the Sunovion License Agreement, we may terminate the Sunovion License Agreement if (i) Sunovion fails to make any payments required under the Sunovion License Agreement when due and after receiving certain notices from us; (ii) Sunovion fails to commercialize APL-130277 in at least one Major Market (as defined in the Sunovion License Agreement) by January 1, 2020; (iii) Sunovion pays us not more than the minimum royalty payment due for any 30 consecutive months from the date of first commercial sale; (iv) Sunovion fails a primary endpoint of its Phase 3 studies (CTH-300 and CTH-301) and either fails to start another Phase 3 study within six months after such failed primary endpoint, or fails a primary endpoint of any subsequent Phase 3 study; (v) Sunovion publicly challenges the validity or enforceability of the Licensed Patents (as defined in the Agreement); or (vi) no further royalty payments are due and payable to us.
 
As more fully described in the Sunovion License Agreement, Sunovion generally may terminate the Sunovion License Agreement if (i) we fail to use commercially reasonable efforts to defend the Licensed Patents in response to a Patent Infringement Claim (as defined in the Sunovion License Agreement); (ii) we are in material breach of the Sunovion License Agreement, which breach is not remedied after receiving notice thereof; (iii) prior to commercialization of APL-130277, upon certain notice to us, if Sunovion has abandoned further development of APL-130277; or (iv) at any time after December 31, 2024, for any reason upon certain notice to us. Sunovion may also terminate the Sunovion License Agreement if it can establish that a Material Decline (as defined in the Agreement) has occurred in a jurisdiction as a result of us licensing to a third-party any Licensed Patents to develop or commercialize apomorphine either alone or in combination with another active agent, for any human use, solely with respect to such jurisdiction(s) that have suffered a Material Decline, upon certain notice to us.
 
Additionally, either party may terminate the Sunovion License Agreement (i) in connection with certain bankruptcy events; or (ii) in connection with certain material misrepresentations; breach of representations, warranties or covenants; or breach of exclusivity or confidentiality provisions, as set forth in the Sunovion License Agreement. The Sunovion License Agreement also contains, without limitation, customary representations, warranties and covenants of the parties, as well as provisions relating to confidentiality, indemnification and other matters.
 
Agreement to Terminate CLA with KemPharm
 
In March 2012, the Company entered into an agreement with KemPharm, Inc., or KemPharm, to terminate a Collaboration and License Agreement entered into in April 2011. Under this termination arrangement, we have the right to participate in any and all value that KemPharm may derive from the commercialization or any other monetization of KP 415 and KP 484 compounds or their derivatives. Among these monetization transactions are those related to any business combinations involving KemPharm and collaborations, royalty arrangements, or other transactions from which KemPharm may realize value from these compounds. The Company has not received payments under this arrangement in 2018 or 2017.

Intellectual Property
 
We currently seek, and intend to continue seeking, patent protection whenever commercially reasonable for any patentable aspects of our product candidates and related technology or any new products or product candidates we acquire in the future. Where our intellectual property is not protected by patents, we may seek to protect it through other means, including maintenance of trade secrets and careful protection of our proprietary information.
 
In addition, we intend to seek orphan drug exclusivity in jurisdictions in which it is available. A prerequisite to orphan drug exclusivity in the United States and in the European Union is orphan drug designation. An orphan drug designation may be granted where a drug is developed specifically to treat a rare or uncommon medical condition. If a product which has an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first regulatory approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan exclusivity, meaning that the applicable regulatory authority may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication, except in certain very limited circumstances, for a period of seven years in the United States and 10 years in the European Union. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent competitors from developing or marketing different drugs for the indication protected by exclusivity, or the same drug for a different indication.
 
Patents
 
Our patent portfolio currently comprises at least 200 issued patents worldwide, of which at least 40 are U.S. patents, and more than 90 pending patent applications worldwide. These issued patents and pending patent applications provide both process of making and composition of matter protection for our PharmFilm® technology and products and product candidates, including Suboxone and our PharmFilm formulations of tadalafil, diazepam, clobazam, riluzole, epinephrine and octreotide. These patents and, if issued as patents, pending patent applications will likely expire between 2022 and 2037. The pending patent applications filed in 2017 will provide composition of matter and process of making protection for our PharmFilm® dosage formulations of diazepam, epinephrine and octreotide, and if issued as patents, will likely expire by 2037. The projected expiration dates exclude any patent term adjustment or patent term extension.
PharmFilm® – Our Oral Film Technology
 
Our PharmFilm® technology is covered by at least 8 patent families. These patent families provide process, composition of matter protection for our PharmFilm® technology, and comprise at least 50 issued patents worldwide, of which at least 19 are U.S. patents, and related pending patent applications worldwide. The patents and pending patent applications, if issued as patents, will likely expire between 2022 and 2037, excluding any patent term adjustment or patent term extension.
 
The PharmFilm® technology patents also generically and specifically protect the technology utilized in the products and product candidates in our CNS programs, our Complex Molecule Programs, as well as our Partner Programs. For example, encompassed within our platform technology patents is specific coverage directed to PharmFilm dosage formulations of CNS molecules such as diazepam. Also encompassed within our platform technology is coverage for our complex molecule program which includes molecules such as epinephrine. Our platform technology patents further cover the products Suboxone and Zuplenz, as well as our formulations of the molecules apomorphine and tadalafil, which are part of our partnered programs. The expiration dates for patents covering these products and product candidates, and for pending applications if issued as patents, extend from 2022 to 2037, excluding any patent term adjustment or patent term extension.
 
We note that several of our issued patents are or have been involved in administrative proceedings, such as reexamination and inter partes review at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO and opposition at the European Patent Organization, or EPO. Four of our European patents are under opposition proceedings at the appeal stage. These patents include one European patent which relates to our early process technology, and two European patents which relate to our taste-masking technology, all three of which are included in our PharmFilm® technology. Divisional applications relating to our early process technologies are also in the process of being filed. We also note that several of our issued patents are involved in litigations. For more information, please see Item 3. Legal Proceedings.

Certain of our patents and patent applications, if granted, will be published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential generic competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA. If any of these potential generic competitors claim that their product will not infringe our listed patents, or that such patents are invalid, then they must send notice to us once the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. We may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification, which would automatically prevent the FDA from approving the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant.

The rest of our patent portfolio largely relates to patents and applications owned by us and directed to our product development portfolio and other product candidates and related compositions and/or manufacturing processes.
 
Trade Secrets and Other Proprietary Information
 
We seek to protect our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and proprietary know-how, by requiring our employees, consultants and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of their employment or engagement. These agreements generally provide that all confidential information developed or made known during the relationship with us be kept confidential and not be disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances, nor used outside the scope of their employment. In the case of our employees, the agreements also typically provide that all inventions resulting from work performed for us, utilizing our property or relating to our business and conceived or completed during employment shall be our exclusive property to the extent permitted by law. Where appropriate, agreements we obtain with our consultants also typically contain similar assignment of invention provisions. Further, we generally require confidentiality agreements from business partners and other third parties that receive our confidential information. There can be no assurance, however, that these agreements will provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies for our trade secrets in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information.
Trademarks
 
We also rely on trademarks to develop and maintain our competitive position. Our trademarks or registered trademarks are filed in the United States and other select geographical areas.
Regulatory
 
FDA Approval Process
 
In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending applications, clinical holds, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, withdrawal of product from the market, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and criminal prosecution.
 
FDA approval is required before any new drug or dosage form, including a new use of a previously approved drug, can be marketed in the United States. The process required by the FDA before a new drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves:
 
  
· | completion of preclinical laboratory and animal testing and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s current good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug, or IND, application for human clinical testing which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin in the United States; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with current good clinical practices, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each intended use; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | submission to the FDA of an NDA;
--+---------------------------------

 

19
 

  
· | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the facility or facilities at which the product is manufactured to assess compliance with the FDA’s cGMP regulations to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | satisfactory completion of a potential review by an FDA advisory committee, if applicable; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | FDA review and approval of the NDA.
--+------------------------------------



The preclinical and clinical testing and approval process takes many years and the actual time required to obtain approval, if any, may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease.
 
Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation and toxicity, as well as animal studies to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLPs. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND application along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND application is submitted.
 
The IND application automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions relating to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. A separate submission to an existing IND application must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. Further, an independent IRB, covering each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and informed consent information for subjects before the trial commences at that site and it must monitor the study until completed. The FDA, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions. Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator in accordance with GCP requirements, which includes the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Sponsors of clinical trials generally must register and report, at the NIH-maintained website ClinicalTrials.gov, key parameters of certain clinical trials. For purposes of an NDA submission and approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in the following sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:
 
 
Phase 1: | In Phase 1, through the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or patients, the drug is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness. 
---------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Phase 2: | Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication, dosage tolerance and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. 
---------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Phase 3: | Phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. A single Phase 3 trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in rare instances where the study is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible. 
---------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The NDA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture and controls. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is subject to a substantial application user fee, and applicant under an approved NDA is also subject to an annual program fee for each prescription drug product, which beginning in Fiscal Year 2018 replaced the product and establishment fees.
 

20
 

The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information and is subject to payment of additional user fees. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. Under PDUFA the FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs through a two-tiered classification system, Standard Review and Priority Review. Priority Review designation, or fast track status, is given to drugs that offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. The FDA endeavors to review applications subject to Standard Review within ten to twelve months, whereas the FDA’s goal is to review Priority Review applications within six to eight months.
 
The FDA may refer applications for proprietary drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions.
 
Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing process and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and are adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications and the NDA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied.
 
After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the NDA and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA may ultimately decide that an application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If, or when, the deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
 
As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a REMS, or Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. If the FDA determines a REMS is necessary during review of the application, the drug sponsor must agree to the REMS plan at the time of approval. A REMS may be required to include various elements, such as a medication guide or patient package insert, a communication plan to educate healthcare providers of the drug’s risks, limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the drug, or other elements to assure safe use, such as special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patient registries. In addition, the REMS must include a timetable to periodically assess whether the REMS plan is effective. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of a drug.
 
Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy, and the FDA has the authority to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label, and, even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product or impose other conditions, including labeling or distribution restrictions or other risk-management mechanisms.
 
Further changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented, which may require us to develop additional data or conduct additional preclinical studies and clinical trials. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses similar procedures in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs.
 
Post-Approval Requirements
 
Once an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to drug listing and registration, recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, adverse event reporting and advertising, marketing and promotion, including standards and regulations for direct to consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. While physicians may prescribe for off-label uses, manufacturers may only promote for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
 

21
 

In addition, quality-control, drug manufacturing, packaging and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced and announced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered. The FDA may also impose a REMS requirement on a drug already on the market if the FDA determines, based on new safety information, that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the drug’s benefits outweigh its risks. In addition, regulatory authorities may take other enforcement action, including, among other things, warning letters, the seizure of products, injunctions, consent decrees placing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations, refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, civil penalties and criminal prosecution.
 
The FDA may require post-approval studies and clinical trials if the FDA finds that scientific data, including information regarding related drugs, deem it appropriate. The purpose of such studies would be to assess a known serious risk or signals of serious risk related to the drug or to identify an unexpected serious risk when available data indicate the potential for a serious risk. The FDA may also require a labeling change if it becomes aware of new safety information that it believes should be included in the labeling of a drug.
 
In addition, any distribution of prescription drug products and pharmaceutical samples must comply with the U.S. Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, a part of the FDCA. In addition, Title II of the Federal Drug Quality and Security Act of 2013, known as the Drug Supply Chain Security Act or the DSCSA, has imposed new “track and trace” requirements on the distribution of prescription drug products by manufacturers, distributors, and other entities in the drug supply chain. These requirements are being phased in over a ten-year period. The DSCSA ultimately will require product identifiers (i.e., serialization) on prescription drug products in order to establish an electronic interoperable prescription product system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs distributed in the United States. The DSCSA replaced the prior drug “pedigree” requirements under the PDMA and preempts existing state drug pedigree laws and regulations. The DSCSA also establishes new requirements for the licensing of wholesale distributors and third-party logistic providers. These licensing requirements preempt states from imposing licensing requirements that are inconsistent with, less stringent than, directly related to, or otherwise encompassed by standards established by the FDA pursuant to the DSCSA. Until the FDA promulgates regulations to address the DSCSA’s new national licensing standard, current state licensing requirements typically remain in effect.
 
The Hatch-Waxman Amendments
 
ANDA Approval Process
 
The Hatch-Waxman Amendments established abbreviated FDA approval procedures for drugs that are shown to be equivalent to drugs previously approved by the FDA through its NDA process. Approval to market and distribute these drugs is obtained by submitting an ANDA to the FDA. An ANDA is a comprehensive submission that contains, among other things, data and information pertaining to the active pharmaceutical ingredient, drug product formulation, specifications and stability of the generic drug, as well as analytical methods, manufacturing process validation data and quality control procedures. Premarket applications for generic drugs are termed abbreviated because they generally do not include preclinical and clinical data to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Instead, a generic applicant must demonstrate that its product is bioequivalent to the innovator drug. In certain situations, an applicant may obtain ANDA approval of a generic product with a strength or dosage form that differs from a referenced innovator drug pursuant to the filing and approval of an ANDA Suitability Petition. The FDA will approve the generic product as suitable for an ANDA application if it finds that the generic product does not raise new questions of safety and effectiveness as compared to the innovator product. A product is not eligible for ANDA approval if the FDA determines that it is not equivalent to the referenced innovator drug, if it is intended for a different use, or if it is not subject to an approved Suitability Petition. However, such a product might be approved under an NDA, with supportive data from clinical trials.
 

22
 

505(b)(2) NDAs
   As an alternative path to FDA approval for modifications to formulations or uses of products previously approved by the FDA, an applicant may submit an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. Section 505(b)(2) was enacted as part of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments and permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by, or for, the applicant. If the 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on FDA’s previous findings of safety and effectiveness is scientifically appropriate, it may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical studies of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements, including clinical trials, to support the change from the approved branded reference drug. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all, or some, of the label indications for which the branded reference drug has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the 505(b)(2) applicant.
 
Orange Book Listing
 
In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, including a 505(b)(2) NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA certain patents with claims that cover the applicant’s product. Upon approval of an NDA, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the Orange Book. Any applicant who files an ANDA seeking approval of a generic equivalent version of a drug listed in the Orange Book or a 505(b)(2) NDA referencing a drug listed in the Orange Book must certify to the FDA that (i) no patent information on the drug product that is the subject of the application has been submitted to the FDA; (ii) such patent has expired; (iii) the date on which such patent expires; or (iv) such patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. This last certification is known as a paragraph IV certification. A notice of the paragraph IV certification must be provided to each owner of the patent that is the subject of the certification and to the holder of the approved NDA to which the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application refers. The applicant may also elect to submit a “section viii” statement certifying that its proposed label does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent.
 
If the reference drug NDA holder and patent owners assert a patent challenge directed to one of the Orange Book listed patents within 45 days of the receipt of the paragraph IV certification notice, the FDA is prohibited from approving the application until the earlier of 30 months from the receipt of the paragraph IV certification expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the applicant. The ANDA or 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the branded reference drug has expired as described in further detail below.
 
Non-Patent Exclusivity
 
In addition to patent exclusivity, the holder of the NDA for the listed drug may be entitled to a period of non-patent related exclusivity, during which the FDA cannot review, or in some cases, approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application that relies on the listed drug. For example, a company may obtain five years of non-patent exclusivity upon NDA approval of an NCE which is a drug that contains an active moiety that has not been approved by the FDA in any other NDA. An “active moiety” is defined as the molecule or ion responsible for the drug substance’s physiological or pharmacologic action. During the five-year exclusivity period, the FDA cannot accept for filing any ANDA seeking approval of a generic version of that drug or any 505(b)(2) NDA for the same active moiety and that relies on the FDA’s findings regarding that drug, except that FDA may accept an application for filing after four years if the follow-on applicant makes a paragraph IV certification.
 
A drug, including one approved under Section 505(b)(2), may obtain a three-year period of exclusivity for a particular condition of approval, or change to a marketed product, such as a new formulation of a previously approved product, if one or more new clinical studies (other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies) was essential to the approval of the application and was conducted/sponsored by the applicant. Should this occur, the FDA would be precluded from approving any ANDA or 505(b)(2) application for the protected modification until after that three-year exclusivity period has run. However, unlike NCE exclusivity, the FDA can accept an application and begin the review process during the exclusivity period.
 
Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
 
The Orphan Drug Act provides incentives for the development of products intended to treat rare diseases or conditions. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug or biological product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. If a sponsor demonstrates that a drug is intended to treat rare diseases or conditions, the FDA will grant orphan designation for that product for the orphan disease indication. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan product designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation, however, does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.

 Table of Contents

Orphan drug designation provides manufacturers with research grants, tax credits and eligibility for orphan drug exclusivity. If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval of the active moiety for that disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which for seven years prohibits the FDA from approving another product with the same active ingredient for the same indication, except in limited circumstances. If a drug designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than the orphan indication for which it received the designation, it will not be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan exclusivity will not bar approval of another product under certain circumstances, including if a subsequent product with the same active ingredient for the same indication is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care, or if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand. Further, the FDA may approve more than one product for the same orphan indication or disease as long as the products contain different active ingredients. Moreover, competitors may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. As a result, even if one of our product candidates receives orphan exclusivity, we may still be subject to competition. Orphan exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same drug or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease.
Anti-Kickback and False Claims Laws and Other Regulatory Matters
 
In the United States, we are subject to complex laws and regulations pertaining to healthcare “fraud and abuse,” including, but not limited to, the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the Federal False Claims Act, and other state and federal laws and regulations. The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf) to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer, or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce the referral of business, including the purchase, order, or prescription of a particular drug, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Violations of this law are punishable by up to five years in prison, criminal fines, administrative civil money penalties, and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. In addition, many states have adopted laws similar to the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Some of these state prohibitions apply to the referral of patients for healthcare services reimbursed by any insurer, not just federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.
 
The Federal False Claims Act prohibits anyone from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to federal programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for items or services, including drugs, that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Although we would not submit claims directly to payors, manufacturers can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. In addition, our future activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our products, are subject to scrutiny under this law. For example, pharmaceutical companies have been found liable under the Federal False Claims Act in connection with their off-label promotion of drugs. Penalties for a False Claims Act violation include three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties of between $10,000 and $25,000 for each separate false claim, the potential for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, and, although the Federal False Claims Act is a civil statute, conduct that results in a False Claims Act violation may also implicate various federal criminal statutes. In addition, private individuals can bring actions under the Federal False Claims Act and certain states have enacted laws modeled after the Federal False Claims Act.
 
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, which we refer to collectively as HIPAA, also created several additional federal crimes, including healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation, or making or using any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.

 Table of Contents

There are also an increasing number of state laws with requirements for manufacturers and/or marketers of pharmaceutical products. Some states require the reporting of expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of drug products and the reporting of gifts and payments to individual healthcare practitioners in these states. Other states prohibit various marketing-related activities, such as the provision of certain kinds of gifts or meals. Still other states require the reporting of certain pricing information, including information pertaining to and justification of price increases, or prohibit prescription drug price gouging. In addition, states such as California, Connecticut, Nevada, and Massachusetts require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs and/or marketing codes. Many of these laws contain ambiguities as to what is required to comply with the laws. In addition, as discussed below, a similar federal requirement requires manufacturers to track and report to the federal government certain payments made to physicians and teaching hospitals made in the previous calendar year. These laws may affect our sales, marketing and other promotional activities by imposing administrative and compliance burdens on us. In addition, given the lack of clarity with respect to these laws and their implementation, our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent state, and soon federal, authorities.
 
The Physician Payments Sunshine Act, implemented as the Open Payments Program, and its implementing regulations, requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies that are reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to report annually to CMS information related to certain payments made in the previous calendar year and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
 
In addition, HIPAA, and its implementing regulations impose certain obligations on entities subject to the law, such as health plans and most healthcare providers, and their business associates who provide certain services involving the use or disclosure of HIPAA protected health information on their behalf, with respect to the privacy and security of such protected health information. Further, most states have enacted laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts in certain circumstances, such as specific disease states.
 
Compliance with such laws and regulations will require substantial resources. Because of the breadth of these various fraud and abuse laws, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. Such a challenge could have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In the event governmental authorities conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations, they may impose sanctions under these laws, which are potentially significant and may include civil monetary penalties, damages, exclusion of an entity or individual from participation in government health care programs, criminal fines and individual imprisonment, additional reporting requirements if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other settlement to resolve allegations of violations of these laws, as well as the potential curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Further, we may be subject to contractual damages and reputational harm as result of such non-compliance. Even if we are not determined to have violated these laws, government investigations into these issues typically require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative publicity.
 
International Regulation
 
In addition to regulations in the United States, we are and will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations regarding development, approval, commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and can involve additional product testing and additional review periods, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required to obtain FDA approval. The requirements governing, among other things, the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution. In the European Union, or EU, we may seek marketing authorization under either the centralized authorization procedure or national authorization procedures.
 
Centralized procedure. The European Medicines Agency, or EMA, implemented the centralized procedure for the approval of human medicines to facilitate marketing authorizations that are valid throughout the EU. This procedure results in a single marketing authorization issued by the European Commission following a favorable opinion by the EMA that is valid across the European Union, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The centralized procedure is compulsory for human medicines that are: derived from biotechnology processes, such as genetic engineering, contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders or autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions, and officially designated orphan medicines. For medicines that do not fall within these categories, an applicant has the option of submitting an application for a centralized marketing authorization to the EMA, as long as the medicine concerned is a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or if its authorization would be in the interest of public health.

National authorization procedures. There are also two other possible routes to authorize medicinal products in several European Union countries, which are available for investigational medicinal products that fall outside the scope of the centralized procedure: the decentralized procedure and the mutual recognition procedure. Under the decentralized procedure, an applicant may apply for simultaneous authorization in more than one EU country for medicinal products that have not yet been authorized in any EU country and that do not fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. Under the mutual recognition procedure, a medicine is first authorized in one EU Member State, in accordance with the national procedures of that country. Following a national authorization, the applicant may seek further marketing authorizations from other EU countries under a procedure whereby the countries concerned agree to recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization.
 
In the EU, medicinal products designated as orphan products benefit from financial incentives such as reductions in marketing authorization application fees or fee waivers and 10 years of marketing exclusivity following medicinal product approval. For a medicinal product to qualify as orphan: (i) it must be intended for the treatment, prevention or diagnosis of a disease that is life-threatening or chronically debilitating; (ii) the prevalence of the condition in the EU must not be more than five in 10,000 or it must be unlikely that marketing of the medicine would generate sufficient returns to justify the investment needed for its development; and (iii) no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition concerned can be authorized, or, if such a method exists, the medicine must be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition.
 
United States Healthcare Reform
 
Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or, collectively, the PPACA, substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers and significantly impacts the pharmaceutical industry. Changes that may affect our business include those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement changes, benefits for patients within a coverage gap in the Medicare Part D prescription drug program, or commonly known as the donut hole, rules regarding prescription drug benefits under the health insurance exchanges, changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate program, expansion of the Public Health Service’s 340B drug pricing discount program, or 340B program, fraud and abuse, and enforcement. These changes impact existing government healthcare programs and are resulting in the development of new programs, including Medicare payment for performance initiatives and improvements to the physician quality reporting system and feedback program.
 
Some states have elected not to expand their Medicaid programs to individuals with an income of up to 133% of the federal poverty level, as is permitted under the PPACA. For each state that does not choose to expand its Medicaid program, there may be fewer insured patients overall, which could impact our sales of products for which we receive regulatory approval, business and financial condition. Where new patients receive insurance coverage under any of the new Medicaid options made available through the PPACA, the possibility exists that manufacturers may be required to pay Medicaid rebates on drugs used under these circumstances, a decision that could impact manufacturer revenues.
 
Some of the provisions of the PPACA have yet to be implemented, and there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the PPACA, some of which have been successful, as well as recent efforts by the Trump administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the PPACA. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two Executive Orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the PPACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the PPACA. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the PPACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the PPACA have been signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the PPACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate”. Additionally, on January 22, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain PPACA-mandated fees, including the so-called “Cadillac” tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices. Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, amends the PPACA, effective January 1, 2019, to increase from 50% to 70% the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D and to close the Medicare Part D donut hole. Congress will likely consider other legislation to replace elements of the PPACA.

Moreover, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the PPACA was enacted. In August 2011, then President Obama signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals for spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, including the BBA, will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Further, in January 2013, then President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
 
In addition, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny in the United States of pharmaceutical pricing practices in light of the rising cost of prescription drugs and biologics. Such scrutiny has resulted in several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. At the federal level, the Trump administration’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2019 contains further drug price control measures that could be enacted during the 2019 budget process or in other future legislation, including, for example, measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part B, to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid, and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for low-income patients. Further, the Trump administration released a “Blueprint”, or plan, to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase drug manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products, and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. The Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, has already started the process of soliciting feedback on some of these measures and, at the same time, is immediately implementing others under its existing authority. While some proposed measures will require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that they will continue to peruse new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, legislatures are increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
 
We expect that the PPACA, as currently enacted or as it may be amended or replaced in the future, and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future could have a material adverse effect on our industry generally and on our ability to maintain or increase sales of products for which we receive regulatory approval or to successfully commercialize our product candidates, if approved.
 
Coverage and Reimbursement
 
Payor coverage uncertainty exists for all pharmaceutical products that are launched. This uncertainty exists as to the coverage of any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval. Sales of any of our products and product candidates, if approved, will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of the products will be covered by third-party payors, including government healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, and private payors, such as commercial health insurers and managed care organizations. Third-party payors determine which drugs they will cover. In the United States, there is no uniform system among payors for making coverage decisions. Decisions regarding the extent of coverage for any product candidates that we develop will be made on a payor-by-payor basis. Each payor determines whether or not it will provide coverage for a therapy, what amount it will pay the manufacturer for the therapy, and on what tier of its formulary it will be placed. The position on a payor’s formulary, or a payor’s list of covered drugs, generally determines the co-payment that a patient will need to make to obtain the therapy and can strongly influence the adoption of such therapy by patients and physicians. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. A decision by a payor to not cover our product candidates could reduce physician adoption of our product candidates, once approved, and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition.
 
So that we may secure coverage for our products, if approved for sale, we may need to conduct pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the studies required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. Even if we conduct such pharmacoeconomic studies, our products and product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective by payors.

We intend to pursue a reasonable and credible approach to the pricing of our products, in order to avoid such products being categorized as specialty products. Determination of responsible pricing will be based on the value proposition of our products, a full therapeutic category review, competitive pricing analysis and a strategic review of the payor landscape and payor dynamics. The payor type (business mix), will determine net pricing. Payor type by product (e.g., Medicaid, Medicare, Commercial) will vary and therefore require varying discount levels. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, surveys and publishes retail pharmacy acquisition cost information in the form of National Average Drug Acquisition Cost, or NADAC, files to provide state Medicaid agencies with a basis of comparison for their own reimbursement and pricing methodologies and rates.
 
Participation in the Medicaid Drug Rebate program would require us to pay a rebate for each unit of drug reimbursed by Medicaid. The amount of the “basic” portion of the rebate for each product is set by law as the larger of: (i) 23.1% of quarterly Average Manufacturer Price, or AMP, or (ii) the difference between quarterly AMP and the quarterly best price available from us to any commercial or non-governmental customer, or Best Price. AMP must be reported on a monthly and quarterly basis and Best Price is reported on a quarterly basis only. In addition, the rebate also includes the “additional” portion, which adjusts the overall rebate amount upward as an “inflation penalty” when the drug’s latest quarter’s AMP exceeds the drug’s AMP from the first full quarter of sales after launch, adjusted for increases in the Consumer Price Index-Urban. The upward adjustment in the rebate amount per unit is equal to the excess amount of the current AMP over the inflation-adjusted AMP from the first full quarter of sales. The rebate amount is recomputed each quarter based on our report to CMS of current quarterly AMP and Best Price for our drug. The terms of our participation in the program would impose a requirement for us to report revisions to AMP or Best Price within a period not to exceed 12 quarters from the quarter in which the data was originally due. Any such revisions could have the impact of increasing or decreasing our rebate liability for prior quarters, depending on the direction of the revision. This “inflation penalty”, also known as the Medicaid CPI Penalty, results from price increases in excess of the Consumer Price Index.
 
Federal law requires that any manufacturer that participates in the Medicaid Drug Rebate program also participate in the 340B program in order for federal funds to be available for the manufacturer’s drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. The 340B program requires participating manufacturers to agree to charge statutorily defined covered entities no more than the 340B “ceiling price” for the manufacturer’s covered outpatient drugs. These 340B covered entities include a variety of community health clinics and other entities that receive health services grants from the Public Health Service, as well as hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income patients. The 340B ceiling price is calculated using a statutory formula, which is based on the AMP and rebate amount for the covered outpatient drug as calculated under the Medicaid Drug Rebate program. Any changes to the definition of AMP and the Medicaid rebate amount under the PPACA or other legislation could affect our 340B ceiling price calculations and negatively impact our results of operations.
 
In the United States Medicare program, outpatient prescription drugs may be covered under Medicare Part D. Medicare Part D is a voluntary prescription drug benefit, through which Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities for coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Part D plans include both stand-alone prescription drug benefit plans and prescription drug coverage as a supplement to Medicare Advantage plans provided for under Medicare Part C.
 
Coverage for covered outpatient drugs under Part D is not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Although Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, they have some flexibility to establish those categories and classes and are not required to cover all of the drugs in each category or class. Medicare Part D prescription drug plans may use formularies to limit the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class and/or impose differential cost sharing or other utilization management techniques.
 
The availability of coverage under Medicare Part D may increase demand for products for which we receive marketing approval. However, in order for the products that we market to be included on the formularies of Part D prescription drug plans, we likely will have to offer net pricing that is lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Changes to Medicare Part D that give plans more freedom to limit coverage or manage utilization, and other cost reduction initiatives in the program could decrease the coverage and price that we receive for any approved products and could harm our business.
 
Pricing and rebate calculations, which vary across products and programs, are complex, and are often subject to interpretation by manufacturers, third-party intermediaries such as pharmacy benefit managers, governmental or regulatory agencies, and the courts. Civil monetary penalties can be applied if a manufacturer is found to have knowingly submitted any false price information to the government or fails to submit the required price data on a timely basis. Such conduct also could be grounds for CMS to terminate the manufacturer’s Medicaid drug rebate agreement, in which case federal payments may not be available under Medicaid. In addition, claims submitted to federally-funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, for drugs priced based on incorrect pricing data provided by a manufacturer can implicate the federal Civil False Claims Act. In addition, any patient assistance program sponsored by a manufacturer must meet strict requirements to avoid running afoul of state or federal anti-kickback laws.

The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. The United States government, state legislatures, and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement, and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. For example, the PPACA expanded manufacturers’ rebate liability under the Medicaid program from fee-for-service Medicaid utilization to include the utilization of Medicaid managed care organizations as well, increased the minimum Medicaid rebate due for most innovator drugs, and capped the total rebate amount for innovator drugs at 100% of AMP. The PPACA and subsequent legislation also changed the definition of AMP. In addition, the PPACA requires pharmaceutical manufacturers of branded prescription drugs (excluding orphan drugs) to pay a branded prescription drug fee to the federal government. Each such manufacturer pays a prorated share of the branded prescription drug fee of $4.0 billion in 2017, based on the dollar value of its branded prescription drug sales to certain federal programs identified in the law. The PPACA also expanded the Public Health Service’s 340B program to include additional types of covered entities. Substantial new provisions affecting compliance have also been enacted, which may affect our business practices with healthcare practitioners, and a significant number of provisions are not yet, or have only recently become, effective. It appears likely that the PPACA will continue the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs.
 
Legislative changes to and regulatory changes under the PPACA and other healthcare statutes remain possible in the United States Congress and under the Trump administration, as discussed above under the heading “United States Healthcare Reform.” In addition, there likely will continue to be proposals by legislators at both the federal and state levels, regulators, and third-party payors to contain healthcare costs. Thus, even if we obtain favorable coverage for any products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies may be implemented in the future.
 
Additional information regarding these programs is discussed under the heading “If we are unable to achieve and maintain adequate levels of coverage and reimbursement for our products or product candidates, if approved, their commercial success may be severely hindered” in the “Risk Factors” section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
Other Regulation
 
We are also subject to various laws and regulations regarding laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals, and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances in connection with our research. While we believe we are in compliance with applicable environmental and other regulations, in each of these areas, as above, the FDA and other government agencies have broad regulatory and enforcement powers, including, among other things, the ability to levy fines and civil penalties, suspend or delay issuance of approvals, seize or recall products, and withdraw approvals, any one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on us.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had 277 employees (including contract and temporary workers). All of these employees are located in the U.S. Of these employees, 30 are directly involved in research and development, 141 are involved in manufacturing operations, 46 are involved in commercialization and sales activities and the remainder are within General and Administration.
 
We are subject to local labor laws and regulations with respect to our employees in those jurisdictions. These laws principally concern matters such as paid annual vacation, paid sick days, length of the workday and work week, minimum wages, pay for overtime, and insurance for workers’ compensation.
 
Our employees are not represented by a labor union. We do not have written employment contracts with most of our employees, and it is our understanding that our relations with our employees are satisfactory.
