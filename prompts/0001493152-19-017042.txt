Item 1. Business.
General
 
Non-Invasive Monitoring Systems, Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the “Company,” “NIMS,” “we,” “us” or “our”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Florida on July 16, 1980. The Company’s offices are located at 4400 Biscayne Boulevard, Miami, Florida, 33137 and its telephone number is (305) 575-4207.
Company Overview
 
Prior to 2002, our primary business was the development of computer-assisted, non-invasive diagnostic monitoring devices and related software designed to detect abnormal respiratory, cardiac and other medical conditions from sensors placed externally on the body’s surface.
 
In 2002, we began focusing on the research, development, manufacturing, marketing and sales of non-invasive, motorized, whole body periodic acceleration (“WBPA”) platforms. These therapeutic acceleration platforms are intended as aids to temporarily increase local circulation for temporary relief of minor aches and pains, produce local muscle relaxation and reduce morning stiffness.
 
Our operations of WBPA platforms began to slow down in recent years. We have not had any material sales for the years 2019 and 2018. We previously written off the value of our inventory and on May 3, 2019 we exchanged our inventory for forgiveness of $15,000 of accrued unpaid rent. In May 2019, we effectively discontinued operations. The Company is a shell company as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act.
 
Products
 
We currently have no inventory and do not have any of our products available for sale.
 
Equity Exchange Agreement
 
As previously reported, on December 3, 2018, Non-Invasive Monitoring Systems, Inc., a Florida corporation (the “Company”), entered into an Equity Exchange Agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) with IRA Financial Trust Company, a South Dakota trust corporation (“IRA Trust”), IRA Financial Group LLC, a Florida limited liability company (“IRAFG” and, together with IRA Trust, “IRA Financial”), and their respective equity holders (together, the “Equityholders”). Upon the terms and subject to the conditions contained in the Exchange Agreement, the Company had agreed to issue to the Equityholders shares of a newly-designated series of its convertible preferred stock in exchange for 100% of the issued and outstanding equity in IRA Financial (the “Exchange”). The Company, IRA Financial and the Equityholders subsequently amended the Exchange Agreement on three occasions to extend the outside date for consummation of the Exchange, with the last such extension expiring on July 3, 2019 (the “Outside Date”). A description of the material terms of the Exchange Agreement is contained in the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 4, 2019, which description is incorporated by reference in this Item 1.02 of this Current Report on Form 8-K.
 
On August 4, 2019, IRAFG delivered to the Company notice of termination of the Exchange Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(i) thereof due to the failure of the Exchange to have closed on or prior to the Outside Date. No termination fees, penalties or other amounts are payable by the Company in respect of such termination.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We currently hold four United States patents with respect to both overall design and specific features of our present and proposed products, with corresponding foreign patents issued or pending in multiple jurisdictions. No assurance can be given as to the scope of protection afforded by any patent issued, whether patents will be issued with respect to any pending or future patent application, that patents issued will not be designed around, infringed or successfully challenged by others, that we will have sufficient resources to enforce any proprietary protection afforded by our patents or that our technology will not infringe on patents held by others. We believe that in the event our patent protection is materially impaired, an adverse effect could result as we believe these patents maintain value for a possible future business transaction. The following table lists our patents, along with their expiration dates (each of which is 20 years from the filing date):
