 Item 1.      Description of Business
 General
 Southern Missouri Bancorp, Inc. ("Company") is a bank holding company and the parent company of Southern Bank (“Bank”). The Company changed its state of incorporation to Missouri on April 1, 1999, and was originally incorporated in Delaware on December 30, 1993 for the purpose of becoming the holding company for the Bank, which was known as Southern Missouri Savings Bank upon completion of its conversion from a state chartered mutual savings and loan association to a state chartered stock savings bank. As part of the conversion in April 1994, the Company sold 1.8 million shares of its common stock to the public. The Company's Common Stock is quoted on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol "SMBC".
 Southern Missouri Savings Bank was originally chartered by the state of Missouri as a mutual savings and loan association in 1887. On June 20, 1995, it converted to a federally chartered stock savings bank and took the name Southern Missouri Savings Bank, FSB. On February 17, 1998, Southern Missouri Savings Bank converted from a federally chartered stock savings bank to a Missouri chartered stock savings bank and changed its name to Southern Missouri Bank & Trust Co. On June 4, 2004, Southern Missouri Bank & Trust Co. converted from a Missouri chartered stock savings bank to a Missouri state chartered trust company with banking powers ("Charter Conversion"). On June 1, 2009, the institution changed its name to Southern Bank.
 The primary regulator of the Bank is the Missouri Division of Finance. The Bank is a member of the Federal Reserve, and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System ("Federal Reserve Board" or "FRB") is the Bank’s primary federal regulator. The Bank's deposits continue to be insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund ("DIF") of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC"). With the Bank's conversion to a trust company with banking powers, the Company became a bank holding company regulated by the FRB.
 The principal business of the Bank consists primarily of attracting retail deposits from the general public and using such deposits along with wholesale funding from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines ("FHLB"), and, to a lesser extent, brokered deposits, to invest in one- to four-family residential mortgage loans, mortgage loans secured by commercial real estate, commercial non-mortgage business loans, and consumer loans. These funds are also used to purchase mortgage-backed and related securities ("MBS"), U.S. Government Agency obligations, municipal bonds, and other permissible investments.
 At June 30, 2019, the Company had total assets of $2.2 billion, total deposits of $1.9 billion and stockholders' equity of $238.4 million. The Company has not engaged in any significant activity other than holding the stock of the Bank. Accordingly, the information set forth in this report, including financial statements and related data, relates primarily to the Bank. The Company's revenues are derived principally from interest earned on loans, debt securities, MBS, CMOs and, to a lesser extent, banking service charges, bank card interchange fees, gains on sales of loans, loan late charges, increases in the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance, and other fee income.
 Acquisitions
 On November 21, 2018, the Company completed its acquisition of Gideon Bancshares Company (“Gideon”) and its wholly owned subsidiary, First Commercial Bank (“First Commercial”), in a stock and cash transaction. At closing, Gideon held total assets of $217 million, loans, net, of $144 million, and deposits of $171 million. The Company acquired Gideon primarily for the purpose of conducting commercial banking activities in markets where it believes the Company’s business model will perform well, and for the long-term value of its core deposit franchise. The goodwill of $1.0 million arising from the acquisition consists largely of synergies and economies of scale expected from combining the operations of the Bank and First Commercial. Goodwill from this transaction was assigned to the acquisition of First Commercial, and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
 
On February 23, 2018, the Company completed its acquisition of Southern Missouri Bancshares, Inc. (“Bancshares”), and its wholly owned subsidiary, Southern Missouri Bank of Marshfield (“SMB-Marshfield”), in a stock and cash transaction. SMB-Marshfield was merged into the Bank at acquisition. At closing, Bancshares held

total assets of $86.2 million, loans, net, of $68.3 million, and deposits of $68.2 million. The Company acquired SMB-Marshfield primarily for the purpose of conducting commercial banking activities in markets where it believes the Company’s business model will perform well, and for the long-term value of its core deposit franchise. The goodwill of $4.4 million arising from the acquisition consists largely of synergies and economies of scale expected from combining the operations of the Bank and SMB-Marshfield. Goodwill from this transaction was assigned to the acquisition of the bank holding company, and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
 
On June 16, 2017, the Company completed its acquisition of Tammcorp, Inc. (Tammcorp), and its subsidiary, Capaha Bank (Capaha), Tamms, Illinois, in a stock and cash transaction. Capaha was merged into the Bank at acquisition. At closing, Tammcorp held total assets of $187 million, loans, net, of $153 million, and deposits of $167 million. The Company acquired Capaha primarily for the purpose of expanding its commercial banking activities to markets where it believes the Company’s business model will perform well, and for the long-term value of its core deposit franchise. A Tammcorp note payable of $3.7 million was contractually required to be repaid in conjunction with the acquisition. The goodwill of $4.1 million arising from the acquisition consists largely of synergies and economies of scale expected from combining the operations of the Bank and Capaha. Goodwill from this transaction was assigned to the acquisition of the bank holding company, and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
 On August 5, 2014, the Company completed its acquisition of Peoples Service Company (PSC) and its subsidiaries, Peoples Banking Company (PBC) and Peoples Bank of the Ozarks (Peoples), Nixa, Missouri, in a stock and cash transaction (the “Peoples Acquisition”). Peoples was merged into the Bank in early December, 2014, in connection with the conversion of Peoples’ data system. At closing, PSC held total assets of $267 million, loans, net, of $193 million, and deposits of $221 million. The Company acquired Peoples primarily for the purpose of expanding its commercial banking activities to markets where it believes the Company’s business model will perform well, and for the long-term value of its core deposit franchise. Notes payable of $2.9 million were contractually required to be repaid on the date of acquisition. The goodwill of $3.0 million arising from the acquisition consists largely of synergies and economies of scale expected from combining the operations of the Bank and Peoples. Goodwill from this transaction was assigned to the acquisition of the bank holding company, and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
 The Company completed its acquisition of Ozarks Legacy Community Financial, Inc. (Ozarks Legacy), and its subsidiary, Bank of Thayer, headquartered in Thayer, Missouri, in October 2013. At closing, Ozarks Legacy had total assets of approximately $81 million, loans, net, of $38 million, and deposits of $68 million. The Company completed its acquisition of Citizens State Bankshares of Bald Knob, Inc. (Citizens), and its subsidiary, Citizens State Bank, headquartered in Bald Knob, Arkansas, in February 2014. At closing, Citizens had total assets of approximately $72 million, loans, net, of $12 million, and deposits of $64 million. (The Ozarks Legacy and Citizens acquisitions are referred to as the “Fiscal 2014 Acquisitions” collectively.)
 On December 17, 2010, the Bank entered into a Purchase and Assumption Agreement with the FDIC, as receiver, to acquire certain assets and assume certain liabilities of the former First Southern Bank, with headquarters in Batesville, Arkansas, and one branch location in Searcy, Arkansas (the “Fiscal 2011 Acquisition”). As a result of the transaction, the Company acquired loans recorded at a fair value of $115 million and assumed deposits recorded at a fair value of $131 million, at December 17, 2010.
 Capital Raising Transactions
 On June 20, 2017, the Company completed an at-the-market common stock issuance. A total of 794,762 shares of the Company’s common stock were sold at a weighted-average price of approximately $31.46 per share, representing gross proceeds to the Company of approximately $25.0 million. The proceeds from the transaction have been used for general corporate purposes, including working capital to support organic growth at Southern Bank, and to support acquisitions to the extent available.
 On November 22, 2011, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of 1,150,000 shares of common stock at a price to the public of $19.00 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds of $21.9 million. The proceeds from the offering have been used for general corporate purposes, including the funding of loan growth and the purchase of securities.

Market Area
 The Bank provides its customers with a full array of community banking services and conducts its business from its headquarters in Poplar Bluff, as well as 44 full service branch offices and two limited service branch offices located in Poplar Bluff (4), Van Buren, Dexter (2), Kennett, Doniphan, Sikeston, Qulin, Matthews, Springfield (3), Thayer (2), West Plains, Alton, Clever, Forsyth, Fremont Hills, Kimberling City, Ozark, Nixa, Rogersville, Marshfield, Cape Girardeau (2), Jackson, Gideon, Chaffee, Benton, Advance, Bloomfield, and Essex Missouri; Jonesboro (2), Paragould, Batesville, Searcy, Bald Knob and Bradford, Arkansas; and Anna, Cairo, and Tamms, Illinois.
 For purposes of management and oversight of its operations, the Bank has organized its facilities into three regional markets. The Bank’s east region includes 24 of its facilities, one of which is limited service, which are situated in Butler, Cape Girardeau, Carter, New Madrid, Ripley, Scott, and Stoddard counties in Missouri, and Alexander and Union counties in Illinois. These counties have a total population of approximately 250,000, and included within this market area is the Cape Girardeau, Missouri, Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), which has a population of approximately 98,000. The Bank’s south region includes 12 of its facilities, one of which is limited service, which are situated in Dunklin, Howell, and Oregon counties in Missouri, and Craighead, Greene, Independence, and White counties in Arkansas. These counties have a total population of approximately 350,000, and included within this market area is the Jonesboro, Arkansas, MSA, which has a population of approximately 131,000. The Bank’s west region includes 11 of its facilities, which are situated in Christian, Greene, Stone, Taney, and Webster counties in Missouri. These counties have a total population of approximately 501,000, and included within this market area is the Springfield, Missouri, MSA, which has a population of approximately 461,000. Each of these markets also serves a few communities just outside these county borders which do not have a notable impact on the demographics of the market area.
 The Bank’s east and south regions are generally rural in nature with economies supported by manufacturing activity, agriculture (livestock, dairy, poultry, rice, timber, soybeans, wheat, melons, corn, and cotton), healthcare, and education. Large employers include hospitals, manufacturers, school districts, and colleges. In the west region, the Bank’s operations are generally more concentrated in the Springfield, Missouri, MSA, and major employers include healthcare providers, educational institutions, federal, local, and state government, retailers, transportation and distribution firms, and leisure, entertainment, and hospitality interests. For purposes of the Bank’s lending policy, the Bank’s primary lending area is considered to be the counties where the Bank has a branch facility, and any contiguous county.
 Competition
 The Bank faces strong competition in attracting deposits (its primary source of lendable funds) and originating loans. At June 30, 2019, the Bank was one of 26 bank or saving association groups located in its east region competing for approximately $5.7 billion in deposits at FDIC-insured institutions, one of 34 bank or saving association groups located in its south region (eight of these institutions overlap with the Bank’s east region) competing for $7.8 billion in deposits, and one of 39 bank or savings association groups located in its west region (12 of these overlap with the Bank’s east or south regions) competing for $10.6 billion in deposits.
 Competitors for deposits include commercial banks, credit unions, money market funds, and other investment alternatives, such as mutual funds, full service and discount broker-dealers, equity markets, brokerage accounts and government securities. The Bank's competition for loans comes principally from other financial institutions, mortgage banking companies, mortgage brokers and life insurance companies. The Bank expects competition to continue to increase in the future as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes within the financial services industry. Technological advances, for example, have lowered barriers to market entry, allowed banks to expand their geographic reach by providing services over the Internet and made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally have been provided by banks. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which permits affiliation among banks, securities firms and insurance companies, also has changed the competitive environment in which the Bank conducts business.

Lending Activities
 General. The Bank's lending activities consist of originating loans secured by mortgages on one- to four-family and multi-family residential real estate, commercial and agricultural real estate, construction loans on residential and commercial properties, commercial and agricultural business loans and consumer loans. The Bank has also occasionally purchased loan participation interests originated by other lenders which are secured by properties generally located in the States of Missouri or Arkansas.
 Supervision of the loan portfolio is the responsibility of our Chief Lending Officer, Rick Windes, Regional President Justin G. Cox, and our Chief Credit Officer, Mark E. Hecker. The Chief Lending Officer and Regional President are responsible for oversight of loan production.  The Chief Credit Officer is responsible for oversight of underwriting, loan policy, and administration.  Loan officers have varying amounts of lending authority depending upon experience and types of loans. Loans beyond their authority are presented to the next level of authority, which may include one of three Regional Small Business Loan Committees, one of three Regional Senior Loan Committees, an Agricultural Loan Committee, or a Senior Agricultural Loan Committee.
 The Regional Small Business Loan Committees each consists of lenders selected by the Chief Lending Officer, Regional President, and Chief Credit Officer (our “Senior Lending and Credit Officers”), and is authorized to approve lending relationships up to $1.5 million. The Regional Senior Loan Committees each consists of one director appointed by the Board of Directors, and senior lenders selected by our Senior Lending and Credit Officers. Each Regional Senior Loan Committee is authorized to approve lending relationships up to $3.0 million. The Bank’s Agricultural Loan Committee consists of several lending officers with agricultural lending experience selected by our Senior Lending and Credit Officers, and is authorized to approve agricultural lending relationships up to $1.5 million. The Senior Agricultural Loan Committee consists of our Chief Credit Officer, as well as several senior lending officers with agricultural lending experience selected by our Senior Lending and Credit Officers. The Senior Agricultural Loan Committee is authorized to approve agricultural lending relationships up to $3.0 million.
 Lending relationships above $3.0 million require approval of our Bank Senior Loan Committee, comprised of our Senior Lending and Credit Officers, and an additional senior lender from each region, or the approval of our Executive Loan Committee, comprised of our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Lending Officer, Chief Credit Officer, and Regional President. In addition to the approval of the Bank Senior Loan Committee or the Executive Loan Committee, lending relationships in excess of $4.0 million require the approval of the Discount Committee, which is comprised of all Bank directors. All loans are subject to ratification by the full Board of Directors.
 The aggregate amount of loans that the Bank is permitted to make under applicable federal regulations to any one borrower, including related entities, or the aggregate amount that the Bank could have invested in any one real estate project, is based on the Bank's capital levels. See "Regulation - Loans to One Borrower." At June 30, 2019, the maximum amount which the Bank could lend to any one borrower and the borrower's related entities was approximately $63.7 million. At June 30, 2019, the Bank's ten largest credit relationships, as defined by loan to one borrower limitations, ranged from $28.7 million to $16.2 million, net of participation interests sold. As of June 30, 2019, the majority of these credits were commercial real estate, multi-family real estate, or commercial business loans, and all of these relationships were performing in accordance with their terms.

Residential Mortgage Lending. The Bank actively originates loans for the acquisition or refinance of one- to four-family residences. These loans are originated as a result of customer and real estate agent referrals, existing and walk-in customers and from responses to the Bank's marketing campaigns. At June 30, 2019, residential loans secured by one- to four-family residences totaled $351.0 million, or 20.4% of net loans receivable.
 The Bank currently offers both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgage ("ARM") loans. During the year ended June 30, 2019, the Bank originated $35.9 million of ARM loans and $39.4 million of fixed-rate loans that were secured by one- to four-family residences, for retention in the Bank’s portfolio. An additional $30.8 million in fixed-rate one- to four-family residential loans were originated for sale on the secondary market. Substantially all of the one- to four-family residential mortgage originations in the Bank's portfolio are located within the Bank's market area.
 The Bank generally originates one- to four-family residential mortgage loans for retention in its portfolio in amounts up to 90% of the lower of the purchase price or appraised value of residential property. For loans originated in excess of 80% loan-to-value, the Bank generally charges an additional 50-100 basis points, but does not require private mortgage insurance. At June 30, 2019, the outstanding balance of loans originated with a loan-to-value ratio in excess of 80% was $76.0 million. For fiscal years ended June 30, 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016, and 2015, originations of one- to four-family loans in excess of 80% loan-to-value have totaled $23.3 million, $26.3 million, $25.0 million, $16.5 million, and $24.3 million, respectively, totaling $115.4 million. The outstanding balance of those loans at June 30, 2019, was $61.2 million. Originating loans with higher loan-to-value ratios presents additional credit risk to the Bank. Consequently, the Bank limits this product to borrowers with a favorable credit history and a demonstrable ability to service the debt. The majority of new residential mortgage loans originated by the Bank for retention in its portfolio conform to secondary market underwriting standards, however, documentation of loan files may not be adequate to allow for immediate sale. The interest rates charged on these loans are competitively priced based on local market conditions, the availability of funding, and anticipated profit margins. Fixed and ARM loans originated by the Bank are amortized over periods as long as 30 years, but typically are repaid over shorter periods.
 Fixed-rate loans secured by one- to four-family residences have contractual maturities up to 30 years, and are generally fully amortizing with payments due monthly. These loans normally remain outstanding for a substantially shorter period of time because of refinancing and other prepayments. A significant change in the interest rate environment can alter the average life of a residential loan portfolio. The one- to four-family fixed-rate loans do not contain prepayment penalties. At June 30, 2019, one- to four-family loans with a fixed rate totaled $169.8 million, and had a weighted-average maturity of 95 months.
 The Bank currently originates one- to four-family adjustable rate mortgage (“ARM”) loans, which adjust annually, after an initial period of one to seven years. Typically, originated ARM loans secured by owner occupied properties reprice at a margin of 2.75% to 3.00% over the weekly average yield on United States Treasury securities adjusted to a constant maturity of one year (“CMT”). Generally, ARM loans secured by non-owner occupied residential properties reprice at a margin of 3.75% over the CMT index. Current residential ARM loan originations are subject to annual and lifetime interest rate caps and floors. As a consequence of using interest rate caps, initial rates which may be at a premium or discount, and a "CMT" loan index, the interest earned on the Bank's ARMs will react differently to changing interest rates than the Bank's cost of funds. At June 30, 2019, one- to four-family loans tied to the CMT index totaled $144.8 million. One- to four-family loans tied to other indices totaled $37.7 million.
 In underwriting one- to four-family residential real estate loans, the Bank evaluates the borrower's ability to meet debt service requirements at current as well as fully indexed rates for ARM loans, and the value of the property securing the loan. Most properties securing real estate loans made by the Bank during fiscal 2019 had appraisals performed on them by independent fee appraisers approved and qualified by the Board of Directors. The Bank generally requires borrowers to obtain title insurance and fire, property and flood insurance (if indicated) in an amount not less than the amount of the loan. Real estate loans originated by the Bank generally contain a "due on sale" clause allowing the Bank to declare the unpaid principal balance due and payable upon the sale of the security property.
 The Bank also originates loans secured by multi-family residential properties that are often located outside the Company’s primary market area, but made to borrowers who operate within the primary market area. At June 30, 2019, the Bank had $141.0 million, or 8.2% of net loans receivable, in multi-family residential real estate. The majority of the multi-family residential loans that are originated by the Bank are amortized over periods generally up to 25 years, with balloon maturities up to ten years. Both fixed and adjustable interest rates are offered and it is typical for the Bank to include an interest rate “floor” and “ceiling” in these loan agreements. Variable rate loans

typically adjust daily, monthly, quarterly or annually based on the Wall Street prime interest rate. Generally, multi-family residential loans do not exceed 85% of the lower of the appraised value or purchase price of the secured property. The Bank generally requires a Board-approved independent certified fee appraiser to be engaged in determining the collateral value. As a general rule, the Bank requires the unlimited guaranty of all individuals (or entities) owning (directly or indirectly) 20% or more of the stock of the borrowing entity.
 The primary risk associated with multi-family loans is the ability of the income-producing property that collateralizes the loan to produce adequate cash flow to service the debt. High unemployment or generally weak economic conditions may result in borrowers having to provide rental rate concessions to achieve adequate occupancy rates. In an effort to reduce these risks, the Bank evaluates the guarantor’s ability to inject personal funds as a tertiary source of repayment.
 Commercial Real Estate Lending. The Bank actively originates loans secured by commercial real estate including land (improved and unimproved), shopping centers, retail establishments, nursing homes and other healthcare related facilities, and other businesses generally located in the Bank's market area. At June 30, 2019, the Bank had $840.8 million in commercial real estate loans, which represented 45.5% of net loans receivable. Of this amount, $182.7 million were loans secured by agricultural properties. The increase over the last several fiscal years in agricultural lending is the result of an intentional focus by the Bank on that segment of our market, including the hiring of personnel with knowledge of agricultural lending and experience in that type of business development. The Bank expects to continue to grow its agricultural lending portfolio, but expects that the rate of growth experienced over the last several fiscal years is unlikely to be maintained. The Bank expects to continue to maintain or increase the percentage of commercial real estate loans, inclusive of agricultural properties, in its total portfolio.
 Commercial real estate loans originated by the Bank are generally based on amortization schedules of up to 25 years with monthly principal and interest payments. Generally, these loans have fixed interest rates and maturities ranging up to seven years, with a balloon payment due at maturity. Alternatively, for some loans, the interest rate adjusts at least annually after an initial period up to five years, based upon the Wall Street prime rate. The Bank typically includes an interest rate "floor" in the loan agreement. The Bank's fixed-rate commercial real estate portfolio has a weighted average maturity of 49 months. Variable rate commercial real estate originations typically adjust daily, monthly, quarterly or annually based on the Wall Street prime rate. Generally, loans for improved commercial properties do not exceed 80% of the lower of the appraised value or the purchase price of the secured property. Agricultural real estate terms offered differ slightly, with amortization schedules of up to 25 years with an 80% loan-to-value ratio, or 30 years with a 75% loan-to-value ratio. Agricultural real estate loans generally require annual, instead of monthly, payments. Before credit is extended, the Bank analyzes the financial condition of the borrower, the borrower's credit history, and the reliability and predictability of the cash flow generated by the property and the value of the property itself. Generally, personal guarantees are obtained from the borrower in addition to obtaining the secured property as collateral for such loans. The Bank also generally requires appraisals on properties securing commercial real estate to be performed by a Board-approved independent certified fee appraiser.
 Generally, loans secured by commercial real estate involve a greater degree of credit risk than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. These loans typically involve large balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. Because payments on loans secured by commercial real estate are often dependent on the successful operation or management of the secured property, repayment of such loans may be subject to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy. See "Asset Quality."
 Construction Lending. The Bank originates real estate loans secured by property or land that is under construction or development. At June 30, 2019, the Bank had $123.3 million, or 6.7% of net loans receivable in construction loans outstanding.
 Construction loans originated by the Bank are generally secured by mortgage loans for the construction of owner occupied residential real estate or to finance speculative construction secured by residential real estate, land development, or owner-operated or non-owner occupied commercial real estate. At June 30, 2019, $44.3 million of the Bank's construction loans were secured by one- to four-family residential real estate (of which $14.2 million was for speculative construction), $31.3 million were secured by multi-family residential real estate, and $47.7 million were secured by commercial real estate.  During construction, these loans typically require monthly interest-only payments and have maturities ranging from 6 to 12 months. Once construction is completed, construction loans may be converted to permanent financing, generally with monthly payments using amortization schedules of up to 30 years on residential and up to 25 years on commercial real estate.

Speculative construction and land development lending generally affords the Bank an opportunity to receive higher interest rates and fees with shorter terms to maturity than those obtainable from residential lending. Nevertheless, construction and land development lending is generally considered to involve a higher level of credit risk than one- to four-family residential lending due to (i) the concentration of principal among relatively few borrowers and development projects, (ii) the increased difficulty at the time the loan is made of accurately estimating building or development costs and the selling price of the finished product, (iii) the increased difficulty and costs of monitoring and disbursing funds for the loan,  (iv) the higher degree of sensitivity to increases in market rates of interest and changes in local economic conditions, and (v) the increased difficulty of working out problem loans. Due in part to these risk factors, the Bank may be required from time to time to modify or extend the terms of some of these types of loans. In an effort to reduce these risks, the application process includes a submission to the Bank of accurate plans, specifications and costs of the project to be constructed. These items are also used as a basis to determine the appraised value of the subject property. Loan amounts are generally limited to 80% of the lesser of current appraised value and/or the cost of construction.
 Consumer Lending. The Bank offers a variety of secured consumer loans, including: home equity, direct and indirect automobile, second mortgage, mobile home and deposit-secured loans. The Bank originates substantially all of its consumer loans in its primary market area. Usually, consumer loans are originated with fixed rates for terms of up to five years, with the exception of home equity lines of credit, which are variable, tied to the prime rate of interest, and are for a period of ten years. At June 30, 2019, the Bank's consumer loan portfolio totaled $97.5 million, or 5.3% of net loans receivable.
 Home equity loans represented 44.5% of the Bank's consumer loan portfolio at June 30, 2019, and totaled $43.4 million, or 2.3% of net loans receivable.
 Home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) are secured with a deed of trust and are generally issued for up to 90% of the appraised or assessed value of the property securing the line of credit, less the outstanding balance on the first mortgage. Interest rates on the HELOCs are adjustable and are tied to the current prime interest rate, generally with an interest rate floor in the loan agreement. This rate is obtained from the Wall Street Journal and adjusts on a daily basis. Interest rates are based upon the loan-to-value ratio of the property with better rates given to borrowers with more equity. HELOCs, which are secured by residential properties, are generally secured by stronger collateral than other consumer loans and, because of the adjustable rate structure, present less interest rate risk to the Bank.
 Automobile loans represented 11.7% of the Bank's consumer loan portfolio at June 30, 2019, and totaled $11.4 million, or 0.62% of net loans receivable. Of that total, an immaterial amount was originated by auto dealers. Typically, automobile loans are made for terms of up to 60 months for new and used vehicles. Loans secured by automobiles have fixed rates and are generally made in amounts up to 100% of the purchase price of the vehicle.
 Consumer loan terms vary according to the type and value of collateral, length of contract and creditworthiness of the borrower. The underwriting standards employed for consumer loans include employment stability, an application, a determination of the applicant's payment history on other debts, and an assessment of ability to meet existing and proposed obligations. Although creditworthiness of the applicant is a primary consideration, the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the security, if any, in relation to the proposed loan amount.
 Consumer loans may entail greater credit risk than do residential mortgage loans, because they are generally unsecured or are secured by rapidly depreciable or mobile assets, such as automobiles. In the event of repossession or default, there may be no secondary source of repayment or the underlying value of the collateral could be insufficient to repay the loan. In addition, consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower's continuing financial stability, and thus are more likely to be affected by adverse personal circumstances. Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws, including bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount which can be recovered on such loans. The Bank's delinquency levels for these types of loans are reflective of these risks. See "Asset Classification."
 Commercial Business Lending. The Bank's commercial business lending activities encompass loans with a variety of purposes and security, including loans to finance accounts receivable, inventory, equipment and operating lines of credit. At June 30, 2019, the Bank had $355.9 million in commercial business loans outstanding, or 19.3% of net loans receivable. Of this amount, $95.5 million were loans related to agriculture, including amortizing equipment loans and annual production lines. The Bank expects to continue to maintain the current percentage of commercial business loans in its total loan portfolio.
 
 11
 

The Bank currently offers both fixed and adjustable rate commercial business loans. At year end, the Bank had $222.3 million in fixed rate and $133.6 million of adjustable rate commercial business loans. The adjustable rate business loans typically reprice daily, monthly, quarterly, or annually, in accordance with the Wall Street prime rate of interest. The Bank typically includes an interest rate "floor" in the loan agreement.
 Commercial business loan terms vary according to the type and value of collateral, length of contract and creditworthiness of the borrower. Generally, commercial loans secured by fixed assets are amortized over periods up to five years, while commercial operating lines of credit or agricultural production lines are generally for a one year period. The Bank's commercial business loans are evaluated based on the loan application, a determination of the applicant's payment history on other debts, business stability and an assessment of ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan. Although creditworthiness of the applicant is a primary consideration, the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the security, if any, in relation to the proposed loan amount.
 Unlike residential mortgage loans, which generally are made on the basis of the borrower's ability to make repayment from his or her employment and other income, and which are secured by real property whose value tends to be more easily ascertainable, commercial business loans are of higher risk and typically are made on the basis of the borrower's ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the borrower's business. As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial business loans may be substantially dependent on the success of the business itself. Further, the collateral securing the loans may depreciate over time, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value based on the success of the business.
 Contractual Obligations and Commitments, Including Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. The following table discloses our fixed and determinable contractual obligations and commercial commitments by payment date as of June 30, 2019. Commitments to extend credit totaled $317.4 million at June 30, 2019.

 As of June 30, 2019, loans with a maturity date after June 30, 2020, with fixed interest rates totaled $953.6 million, and loans with a maturity date after June 30, 2020, with adjustable rates totaled $162.2 million.
 Loan Originations, Sales and Purchases
 Generally, loans are originated by the Bank's staff, who are salaried loan officers. All loan officers are eligible for bonuses based on production, market performance, and credit quality. Certain lenders, in particular those originating higher volume of residential loans for sale on the secondary market, may earn a relatively higher percentage of their total compensation through bonuses. Loans are originated both to be held for investment and to be sold into the secondary market. Loan applications are generally taken and processed at each of the Bank's full-service locations, and the Bank in recent years began processing online applications for single-family residential loans.
 While the Bank originates both adjustable-rate and fixed-rate loans, the ability to originate loans is dependent upon the relative customer demand for loans in its market. In fiscal 2019, the Bank originated $606.3 million of loans, compared to $550.5 million and $494.9 million, respectively, in fiscal 2018 and 2017. Of these loans, mortgage loan originations were $437.6 million, $397.9 million, and $399.2 million in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Increases in originations over recent periods is attributed primarily to an expanded market area and customer base following recent acquisitions.
 From time to time, the Bank has purchased loan participations consistent with its loan underwriting standards. During fiscal 2019, the Bank committed to purchase $21.5 million of new loan participations. At June 30, 2019, loan participations totaled $31.9 million, or 1.73% of net loans receivable. At June 30, 2019, all of these participations were performing in accordance with their respective terms. The Bank evaluates additional loan participations on an ongoing basis, based in part on local loan demand, liquidity, portfolio and capital levels.

 Loan Commitments
 The Bank issues commitments for single- and multi-family residential mortgage loans, commercial real estate loans, operating or working capital lines of credit, and standby letters-of-credit. Such commitments may be oral or in writing with specified terms, conditions and at a specified rate of interest. The Bank had outstanding net loan commitments of approximately $317.4 million at June 30, 2019. See Note 14 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8.
Loan Fees
 In addition to interest earned on loans, the Bank receives income from fees in connection with loan originations, loan modifications, late payments and for miscellaneous services related to its loans. Income from these activities varies from period to period depending upon the volume and type of loans made and competitive conditions.
Asset Quality
 Delinquent Loans. Generally, when a borrower fails to make a required payment, the Bank begins the collection process by mailing a computer generated notice to the customer. If the delinquency is not cured promptly, the customer is contacted again by notice or telephone. After an account secured by real estate becomes over 60 days past due, the Bank will typically send a demand notice to the customer which, if not cured or unless satisfactory arrangements have been made within the time provided, will lead to foreclosure. Foreclosure may not 
 
 14
 


begin until the loan reaches 120 days delinquency in the case of consumer residential loans. For consumer loans, the Missouri Right-To-Cure Statute is followed, which requires issuance of specifically worded notices at specific time intervals prior to repossession or further collection efforts.
 The following table sets forth the Bank's loan delinquencies by type and by amount at June 30, 2019.

Non-Performing Assets. The table below sets forth the amounts and categories of non-performing assets in the Bank's loan portfolio. Loans are placed on non-accrual status when the collection of principal and/or interest becomes doubtful, and as a result, previously accrued interest income on the loan is removed from current income. The Bank has no reserves for uncollected interest and does not accrue interest on non-accrual loans. A loan may be transferred back to accrual status once a satisfactory repayment history has been restored. Foreclosed assets held for sale include assets acquired in settlement of loans and are shown net of reserves.
 The increase in nonperforming assets in fiscal 2019 was attributed primarily to the increase in nonaccrual loans, which, in turn, was primarily attributable to the Gideon Acquisition, which included nonperforming loans of $11.4 million, at fair value, at the time of acquisition. As of December 31, 2018, certain other acquired loans had been placed on nonaccrual status, and the total attributable to the Gideon Acquisition increased to $12.9 million, at fair value. As of June 30, 2019, the fair value of those loans resulting from the Gideon Acquisition was $10.2 million.
 For information regarding accrual of interest on impaired loans, see Note 1 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8.
 The Company may treat loans acquired with impaired credit quality as an accruing asset, despite reporting such loans as impaired, because these loans are recorded at acquisition at fair value, which includes an accretable discount which is recorded as interest income over the expected life of the obligation.

At June 30, 2019, troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) totaled $19.0 million, of which $5.8 million was considered nonperforming and was included in the nonaccrual loan total above. The remaining $13.2 million in TDRs have complied with the modified terms for a reasonable period of time and are therefore considered by the Company to be accrual status loans. At June 30, 2018, TDRs totaled $13.0 million, of which $1.3 million was considered nonperforming and was included in the nonaccrual loan total above. In general, these loans were subject to classification as TDRs at June 30, 2019, on the basis of guidance under ASU 2011-02, which indicates that the Company may not consider the borrower’s effective borrowing rate on the old debt immediately before the restructuring in determining whether a concession has been granted.
 Real Estate Owned. Real estate properties acquired through foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value, less estimated disposition costs. If fair value at the date of foreclosure is lower than the balance of the related loan, the difference will be charged-off to the allowance for loan losses at the time of transfer. Management periodically updates real estate valuations and if the value declines, a specific provision for losses on such property is established by a charge to operations. At June 30, 2019, the Company's balance of real estate owned totaled $3.7 million and included $533,000 in residential properties and $3.2 million in non-residential properties.
 Asset Classification. Applicable regulations require that each insured institution review and classify its assets on a regular basis. In addition, in connection with examinations of insured institutions, regulatory examiners have authority to identify problem assets and, if appropriate, require them to be classified. There are three classifications for problem assets: substandard, doubtful and loss. Substandard assets must have one or more defined weaknesses and are characterized by the distinct possibility that the insured institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Doubtful assets have the weaknesses of substandard assets with the additional 
 
 16
 

characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values questionable, and there is a high possibility of loss. An asset classified loss is considered uncollectible and of such little value that continuance as an asset of the institution is not warranted. When an insured institution classifies problem assets as loss, it charges off the balance of the assets. Assets which do not currently expose the Bank to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories but possess weaknesses, may be designated as special mention. The Bank's determination as to the classification of its assets and the amount of its valuation allowances is subject to review by the FRB and the Missouri Division of Finance, which can order the establishment of additional loss allowances.
 On the basis of management's review of the assets of the Company, at June 30, 2019, adversely classified assets totaled $32.0 million, or 1.45% of total assets as compared to $18.2 million, or 0.96% of total assets at June 30, 2018. Of the amount adversely classified as of June 30, 2019, $32.0 million was considered substandard, and $35,000 was considered doubtful. Included in adversely classified assets at June 30, 2019, were various loans totaling $28.3 million (see Note 3 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 for more information on adversely classified loans) and foreclosed real estate and repossessed assets totaling $3.8 million. The Company acquired adversely classified loans recorded at an acquisition date fair value of $17.5 million in the Gideon Acquisition. At June 30, 2019, the fair value of those acquired loans was $13.4 million. Adversely classified loans are so designated due to concerns regarding the borrower’s ability to generate sufficient cash flows to service the debt. Adversely classified loans totaling $14.6 million had been placed on nonaccrual status at June 30, 2019, of which $4.2 million were more than 30 days delinquent. Of the remaining $13.6 million of adversely classified loans, $10,000 were more than 30 days delinquent.
 Other Loans of Concern. In addition to the adversely classified assets above, there were also other loans with respect to which management has concerns as to the ability of the borrowers to continue to comply with present loan terms, which may ultimately result in the adverse classification of such assets. At June 30, 2019, these other loans of concern totaled $34.5 million, as compared to $10.2 million at June 30, 2018. These loans continued to perform according to terms as of June 30, 2019, but were identified as having elevated risk due to concerns regarding the borrower’s ability to continue to generate sufficient cash flows to service the debt. Other loans of concern attributable to the Gideon Acquisition were $13.7 million, at fair value, as of the date of acquisition, and were $12.2 million, at fair value, as of June 30, 2019.
 Allowance for Loan Losses. The Bank's allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses based on management's evaluation of the risk inherent in the loan portfolio and changes in the nature and volume of loan activity, including those loans which are being specifically monitored. Such evaluation, which includes a review of loans for which full collectability may not be reasonably assured, considers among other matters, the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral, economic conditions, historical loan loss experience and other factors that warrant recognition in provisioning for loan losses. These provisions for loan losses are charged against earnings in the year they are established. The Bank had an allowance for loan losses at June 30, 2019, of $19.9 million, which represented 80% of nonperforming assets as compared to an allowance of $18.2 million, which represented 139% of nonperforming assets at June 30, 2018.
 At June 30, 2019, the Bank also had an allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures of $1.3 million, as compared to $1.2 million at June 30, 2018. This amount is maintained as a separate liability account to cover estimated potential credit losses associated with off-balance sheet credit instruments such as off-balance sheet loan commitments, standby letters of credit, and guarantees.
 Although management believes that it uses the best information available to determine the allowance, unforeseen market conditions could result in adjustments and net earnings could be significantly affected if circumstances differ substantially from assumptions used in making the final determination. Future additions to the allowance will likely be the result of periodic loan, property and collateral reviews and thus cannot be predicted with certainty in advance.

The following table sets forth an analysis of the Bank's allowance for loan losses for the periods indicated. Where specific loan loss reserves have been established, any difference between the loss reserve and the amount of loss realized has been charged or credited to current income.

Investment Activities
 General. Under Missouri law, the Bank is permitted to invest in various types of liquid assets, including U.S. Government and State of Missouri obligations, securities of various federal agencies, certain certificates of deposit of insured banks and savings institutions, banker's acceptances, repurchase agreements, federal funds, commercial paper, investment grade corporate debt securities and obligations of States and their political sub-divisions. Generally, the investment policy of the Company is to invest funds among various categories of investments and repricing characteristics based upon the Bank's need for liquidity, to provide collateral for borrowings and public unit deposits, to help reach financial performance targets and to help maintain asset/liability management objectives.
 The Company's investment portfolio is managed in accordance with the Bank's investment policy which was adopted by the Board of Directors of the Bank and is implemented by members of the asset/liability management committee which consists of the President/Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, the Chief Operations Officer, and five outside directors.
 Investment purchases and/or sales must be authorized by the appropriate party, depending on the aggregate size of the investment transaction, prior to any investment transaction. The Board of Directors reviews all investment transactions. All investment purchases are identified as available-for-sale ("AFS") at the time of purchase. The Company has not classified any investment securities as held-to-maturity over the last five years. Securities classified as "AFS" must be reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, recorded as a separate component of stockholders' equity. At June 30, 2019, AFS securities totaled $165.5 million (excluding FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank membership stock). For information regarding the amortized cost and market values of the Company's investments, see Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8.
 As of June 30, 2019, the Company had no derivative instruments and no outstanding hedging activities. Management has reviewed potential uses for derivative instruments and hedging activities, but has no immediate plans to employ these tools.
 Debt and Other Securities. At June 30, 2019, the Company's debt and other securities portfolio totaled $55.1 million, or 2.49% of total assets as compared to $56.2 million, or 2.98% of total assets at June 30, 2018. During fiscal 2019, the Bank had $14.1 million in maturities and $2.8 million in securities purchases. Of the securities that matured, $3.6 million was called for early redemption. At June 30, 2019, the investment securities portfolio included $7.3 million in U.S. government and government agency bonds, of which $4.5 million is subject to early redemption at the option of the issuer, and $42.8 million in municipal bonds, of which $36.7 million is subject to early redemption at the option of the issuer. The remaining portfolio consists of $5.1 million in other securities, including pooled trust preferred securities with an estimated fair value of $779,000. Based on projected maturities, the weighted average life of the debt and other securities portfolio at June 30, 2019, was 33 months. Membership stock held in the FHLB of Des Moines, totaling $5.2 million, FHLB of Chicago totaling $215,000, and the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, totaling $4.4 million, along with equity stock of $775,000 in three correspondent (banker’s) banks, was not included in the above totals.
 At June 30, 2019, the Company owned two pooled trust preferred securities with an estimated fair value of $779,000 and a book value of $973,000. The June 30, 2019, cash flow analysis for these two securities indicated it is probable the Company will receive all contracted principal and related interest projected. The cash flow analysis used in making this determination was based on anticipated default, recovery, and prepayment rates, and the resulting cash flows were discounted based on the yield anticipated at the time the securities were purchased. See Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8.
 Mortgage-Backed Securities. At June 30, 2019, mortgage-backed securities (“MBS”) totaled $110.4 million, or 5.0%, of total assets, as compared to $90.2 million, or 4.8%, of total assets at June 30, 2018. During fiscal 2019, the Bank had maturities and prepayments of $15.9 million and $28.4 million in purchases of MBS. At June 30, 2019, the MBS portfolio included $51.9 million in fixed-rate MBS, and $58.6 million in fixed rate collateralized mortgage obligations (“CMOs”), all of which passed the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council's sensitivity test. Based on projected prepayment rates, the weighted average life of the MBS and CMOs at June 30, 2019, was 51 months. Actual prepayment rates experienced, which often vary due to changes in market interest rates, may cause the anticipated average life of MBS portfolio to extend or shorten as compared to prepayment rates anticipated.

Deposit Activities and Other Sources of Funds
 General. The Company's primary sources of funds are deposits, borrowings, payments of principal and interest on loans, MBS and CMOs, interest and principal received on investment securities and other short-term investments, and funds provided from operating results. Loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows and outflows and loan prepayments are significantly influenced by general market interest rates and overall economic conditions.
 Borrowings, including FHLB advances, have been used at times to provide additional liquidity. Borrowings are used on an overnight or short-term basis to compensate for periodic fluctuations in cash flows, and are used on a longer term basis to fund loan growth and to help manage the Company's sensitivity to fluctuating interest rates.
 Deposits. The Bank's depositors are generally residents and entities located in the States of Missouri, Arkansas, or Illinois. Deposits are attracted from within the Bank's market area through the offering of a broad selection of deposit instruments, including demand deposit accounts, negotiable order of withdrawal ("NOW") accounts, money market deposit accounts, saving accounts, certificates of deposit and retirement savings plans. Deposit account terms vary according to the minimum balance required, the time periods the funds may remain on deposit and the interest rate, among other factors. In determining the terms of its deposit accounts, the Bank considers current market interest rates, profitability to the Bank, managing interest rate sensitivity and its customer preferences and concerns. The Bank's Asset/Liability Committee regularly reviews its deposit mix and pricing.

The Bank will periodically promote a particular deposit product as part of the Bank's overall marketing plan. Deposit products have been promoted through various mediums, which include digital and social media, radio and newspaper advertisements, as well as “grassroots” marketing techniques, such as sponsorship of – or activity at – community events. The emphasis of these campaigns is to increase consumer awareness and market share of the Bank.
 The flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions, changes in prevailing interest rates, and competition. Based on its experience, the Bank believes that its deposits are relatively stable sources of funds. However, the ability of the Bank to attract and maintain money market deposit accounts, passbook savings accounts, and certificates of deposit, and the rates paid on these deposits, has been and will continue to be significantly affected by market conditions. The following table depicts the composition of the Bank's deposits as of June 30, 2019:

 In the unlikely event the Bank is liquidated, depositors will be entitled to payment of their deposit accounts prior to any payment being made to the Company as the sole stockholder of the Bank.
 Borrowings. As a member of the FHLB of Des Moines, the Bank has the ability to apply for FHLB advances. These advances are available under various credit programs, each of which has its own maturity, interest rate and repricing characteristics. Additionally, FHLB advances have prepayment penalties as well as limitations on size or term. In order to utilize FHLB advances, the Bank must be a member of the FHLB system, have sufficient collateral to secure the requested advance and own stock in the FHLB equal to 4.45% of the amount borrowed. See "REGULATION – The Bank – Federal Home Loan Bank System."
 Although deposits are the Bank's primary and preferred source of funds, the Bank has actively used FHLB advances. The Bank's general policy has been to utilize borrowings to meet short-term liquidity needs, or to provide a longer-term source of funding loan growth when other cheaper funding sources are unavailable or to aide in asset/liability management. As of June 30, 2019, the Bank had $44.9 million in FHLB advances, including $44.5 million in fixed-rate long term advances, $587,000 of fixed rate amortizing advances, and no overnight borrowings. In order for the Bank to borrow from the FHLB, it has pledged $754.4 million of its residential and commercial real estate loans to the FHLB (although the actual collateral required for advances taken and letters of credit issued amounts to $93.6 million) and has purchased $5.2 million in FHLB stock. At June 30, 2019, the Bank had additional borrowing capacity on its pledged residential and commercial real estate loans from the FHLB of $320.1 million, as compared to $267.0 million at June 30, 2018.
 Additionally, the Bank is approved to borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank’s discount window on a primary credit basis. Primary credit is available to approved institutions on a generally short-term basis at the “discount rate” set by the FOMC. The Bank has pledged agricultural real estate and other loans to farmers as collateral for any amounts borrowed through the discount window. As of June 30, 2019, the Bank was approved to borrow up to $181.7 million through the discount window, but no balance was outstanding.
 Also classified as borrowings are the Bank’s securities sold under agreements to repurchase (“repurchase agreements”). These agreements are typically entered into with local public units or corporations. Generally, the Bank pays interest on these agreements at a rate similar to those available on repurchase agreements with wholesale funding sources. The Bank views repurchase agreements with local entities as a stable funding source. At June 30, 2019, the Bank had outstanding $4.4 million in repurchase agreements, as compared to $3.3 million at June 30, 2018.
 Southern Missouri Statutory Trust I, a Delaware business trust subsidiary of the Company, issued $7.0 million in Floating Rate Capital Securities (the "Trust Preferred Securities") with a liquidation value of $1,000 per share in March, 2004. The securities are due in 30 years, were redeemable after five years and bear interest at a floating rate based on LIBOR. At June 30, 2019, the current rate was 5.16%. The securities represent undivided beneficial interests in the trust, which was established by Southern Missouri Bancorp for the purpose of issuing the securities. The Trust Preferred Securities were sold in a private transaction exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act") and have not been registered under the Act. The securities may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements.
 Southern Missouri Statutory Trust I used the proceeds of the sale of the Trust Preferred Securities to purchase Junior Subordinated Debentures of Southern Missouri Bancorp. Southern Missouri Bancorp is using the net proceeds for working capital and investment in its subsidiaries. Trust Preferred Securities currently qualify as Tier I Capital for regulatory purposes. See "Regulation" for further discussion on the treatment of the trust-preferred securities.

In its October 2013 acquisition of Ozarks Legacy, the Company assumed $3.1 million in floating rate junior subordinated debt securities. The securities had been issued in June 2005 by Ozarks Legacy in connection with the sale of trust preferred securities, bear interest at a floating rate based on LIBOR, and mature in 2035. At June 30, 2019, the carrying value was $2.6 million, and bore interest at a current coupon rate of 4.86% and an effective rate of 6.70%.
 
In the Peoples Acquisition, the Company assumed $6.5 million in floating rate junior subordinated debt securities. The debt securities had been issued in 2005 by PBC in connection with the sale of trust preferred securities, bear interest at a floating rate based on LIBOR, are now redeemable at par, and mature in 2035. At June 30, 2019, the carrying value was $5.2 million and bore interest at a current coupon rate of 4.21% and an effective rate of 6.68%.

The following is a brief description of certain laws and regulations applicable to the Company and the Bank. Descriptions of laws and regulations here and elsewhere in this prospectus do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the actual laws and regulations. Legislation is introduced from time to time in the United States Congress or the Missouri state legislature that may affect the operations of the Company and the Bank. In addition, the regulations governing us may be amended from time to time. Any such legislation or regulatory changes in the future could adversely affect our operations and financial condition.
 In 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) imposed various restrictions and an expanded framework of regulatory oversight for financial institutions, including depository institutions. The following discussion summarizes significant aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act that may affect the Bank and the Company.
 The following selected aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act are related to the operations of the Bank:
  
• | The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”), an independent consumer compliance regulatory agency within the FRB, was established. The CFPB is empowered to exercise broad regulatory, supervisory and enforcement authority over financial institutions with total assets of over $10 billion with respect to Federal consumer financial protection laws. Financial institutions with assets of less than $10 billion, like the Bank, will continue to be subject to supervision and enforcement by their primary federal banking regulator with respect to federal consumer financial protection laws; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The Federal Deposit Insurance Act was amended to require depository institution holding companies to serve as a source of strength for their depository institution subsidiaries; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The prohibition on payment of interest on demand deposits was repealed;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Deposit insurance was permanently increased to $250,000; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


• | The deposit insurance assessment base for FDIC insurance is the depository institution's average consolidated total assets less the average tangible equity during the assessment period; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The following aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act are related to the operations of the Company:
  
• | Tier 1 capital treatment for "hybrid" capital items like trust preferred securities was eliminated, subject to various grandfathering and transition rules. As required by the Act, the federal banking agencies have promulgated new rules on regulatory capital for both depository institutions and their holding companies; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Public companies are required to provide their shareholders with a non-binding vote: (i) at least once every three years on the compensation paid to executive officers, and (ii) at least once every six years on whether shareholders should have a "say on pay" vote every one, two or three years; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A separate, non-binding shareholder vote is required regarding golden parachutes for named executive officers when a shareholder vote takes place on mergers, acquisitions, dispositions or other transactions that would trigger the parachute payments; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Securities exchanges are required to prohibit brokers from using their own discretion to vote shares not beneficially owned by them for certain "significant" matters, which include votes on the election of directors, executive compensation matters, and any other matter determined to be significant;

2018 Regulatory Reform
 In May 2018 the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (the “Act”), was enacted to modify or remove certain financial reform rules and regulations, including some of those implemented under the Dodd-Frank Act. While the Act maintains most of the regulatory structure established by the Dodd-Frank Act, it amends certain aspects of the regulatory framework for small depository institutions with assets of less than $10 billion and for large banks with assets of more than $50 billion. Many of these changes could result in meaningful regulatory relief for community banks such as the Bank.
 The Act, among other matters, expands the definition of qualified mortgages which may be held by a financial institution and simplifies the regulatory capital rules for financial institutions and their holding companies with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion by instructing the federal banking regulators to establish a single “Community Bank Leverage Ratio” of between 8 and 10 percent. Any qualifying depository institution or its holding company that exceeds the “community bank leverage ratio” will be considered to have met generally applicable leverage and risk-based regulatory capital requirements and any qualifying depository institution that exceeds the new ratio will be considered to be “well capitalized” under the prompt corrective action rules. Regulations to implement the Community Bank Leverage Ratio have been proposed but not yet adopted in final form. The Act also expands the category of holding companies that may rely on the “Small Bank Holding Company and Savings and Loan Holding Company Policy Statement” (the “HC Policy Statement”) by raising the maximum amount of assets a qualifying holding company may have from $1 billion to $3 billion. This expansion also excludes such holding companies from the minimum capital requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act. In addition, the Act includes regulatory relief for community banks regarding regulatory examination cycles, call reports, the Volcker Rule (proprietary trading prohibitions), mortgage disclosures and risk weights for certain high-risk commercial real estate loans.
 It remains difficult at this time to predict when or how any new standards under the Act will ultimately be applied to us or what specific impact the Act and the implementing rules and regulations will have on community banks.
 The Bank
 General. As a state-chartered, federally insured trust company with banking powers, the Bank is subject to extensive regulation. Lending activities and other investments must comply with various statutory and regulatory requirements, including prescribed minimum capital standards. The Bank is regularly examined by the FRB and the Missouri Division of Finance and files periodic reports concerning the Bank's activities and financial condition with its regulators. The Bank's relationship with depositors and borrowers also is regulated to a great extent by both federal law and the laws of Missouri, especially in such matters as the ownership of deposit accounts and the form and content of mortgage documents.
 Federal and state banking laws and regulations govern all areas of the operation of the Bank, including reserves, loans, mortgages, capital, issuance of securities, payment of dividends, and establishment of branches. Federal and state bank regulatory agencies also have the general authority to limit the dividends paid by insured banks and bank holding companies if such payments should be deemed to constitute an unsafe and unsound practice, and in other circumstances. The FRB as the primary federal regulator of the Company and the Bank has authority to impose penalties, initiate civil and administrative actions and take other steps intended to prevent banks from engaging in unsafe or unsound practices.

State Regulation and Supervision. As a state-chartered trust company with banking powers, the Bank is subject to applicable provisions of Missouri law and the regulations of the Missouri Division of Finance. Missouri law and regulations govern the Bank's ability to take deposits and pay interest thereon, to make loans on or invest in residential and other real estate, to make consumer loans, to invest in securities, to offer various banking services to its customers, and to establish branch offices.
 Federal Reserve System. The FRB requires all depository institutions to maintain reserves at specified levels against their transaction accounts (checking, NOW and Super NOW checking accounts). At June 30, 2019, the Bank was in compliance with these reserve requirements.
 The Bank is authorized to borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank "discount window." The purpose of the discount window is to provide an additional backstop funding option for eligible depository institutions seeking to supplement their funding sources, particularly to meet unexpected short-term funding needs. Depository institutions like the Bank would typically utilize FHLB borrowings before borrowing from the Federal Reserve Bank’s discount window.
 Federal Home Loan Bank System. The Bank is a member of the FHLB of Des Moines, which is one of 11 regional FHLBs that provide home financing credit. Each FHLB serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region. It is funded primarily from proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated obligations of the FHLB System and makes loans or advances to members in accordance with policies and procedures established by the Board of Directors of the FHLB of Des Moines, which are subject to the oversight of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. All advances from the FHLB are required to be fully secured by sufficient collateral as determined by the FHLB. In addition, all long-term advances are required to provide funds for residential home financing. See Business - Deposit Activities and Other Sources of Funds - Borrowings.
 As a member, the Bank is required to purchase and maintain stock in the FHLB of Des Moines. At June 30, 2019, the Bank had $5.2 million in FHLB stock, which was in compliance with this requirement. The Bank received $345,000 and $147,000 in dividends from the FHLB of Des Moines for the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
 The FHLBs continue to contribute to low- and moderately-priced housing programs through direct loans or interest subsidies on advances targeted for community investment and low- and moderate-income housing projects. These contributions have adversely affected the level of FHLB dividends paid and could continue to do so in the future. These contributions could also have an adverse effect on the value of FHLB stock in the future. A reduction in value of the Bank's FHLB stock may result in a corresponding reduction in the Bank's capital.
 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The Bank's deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) of the FDIC. The general insurance limit is $250,000. As insurer, the FDIC imposes deposit insurance premiums and is authorized to conduct examinations of and to require reporting by FDIC-insured institutions. It also may prohibit any FDIC-insured institution from engaging in any activity the FDIC determines by regulation or order to pose a serious risk to the DIF. The FDIC also has the authority to initiate enforcement actions against a member bank of the FRB after giving the FRB an opportunity to take such action.
 In accordance with the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC has issued regulations setting insurance premium assessments based on an institution’s total assets minus its Tier 1 capital instead of its deposits.  The Bank’s FDIC premiums are based on its supervisory ratings and certain financial ratios.  Federal law required that the reserve ratio of the FDIC deposit insurance fund reach at least 1.35% by September 2020, and that depository institutions with consolidated assets of $10 billion or less receive assessment credits for the portion of their assessments that contributed to the growth of the reserve ratio from between 1.15% and 1.35%, to be applied when the reserve ratio is at or above 1.38%. In August 2019, the FDIC issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that would allow the assessment credits to be applied so long as the ratio remains above 1.35%. In September 2019, the Deposit Insurance Fund Reserve Ratio reached 1.40%, exceeding the required minimum reserve ratio to provide for receipt of assessment credits.
 Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. Management of the Bank is not aware of any practice, condition or violation that might lead to termination of the Bank's deposit insurance.

In addition to the assessment for deposit insurance, institutions are required to make payments on bonds issued in the late 1980s by the Financing Corporation to recapitalize a predecessor deposit insurance fund. This payment is established quarterly and during the fourth quarter ended June 30, 2019, was 0.12 basis points (annualized) of assessable deposits. The assessment has declined in recent periods as the bonds mature, with final maturities scheduled for the second half of calendar year 2019.
 Standards for Safety and Soundness. The federal banking regulatory agencies have prescribed, by regulation, standards for all insured depository institutions relating to: (i) internal controls, information systems and internal audit systems; (ii) loan documentation; (iii) credit underwriting; (iv) interest rate risk exposure; (v) asset growth; (vi) asset quality; (vii) earnings; and (viii) compensation, fees and benefits ("Guidelines"). The Guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. If the FRB determines that the Bank fails to meet any standard prescribed by the Guidelines, the agency may require the Bank to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard.
 Guidance on Subprime Mortgage Lending. The federal banking agencies have issued guidance on subprime mortgage lending to address issues related to certain mortgage products marketed to subprime borrowers, particularly adjustable rate mortgage products that can involve "payment shock" and other risky characteristics. Although the guidance focuses on subprime borrowers, the banking agencies note that institutions should look to the principles contained in the guidance when offering such adjustable rate mortgages to non-subprime borrowers. The guidance prohibits predatory lending programs; provides that institutions should underwrite a mortgage loan on the borrower's ability to repay the debt by its final maturity at the fully-indexed rate, assuming a fully amortizing repayment schedule; encourages reasonable workout arrangements with borrowers who are in default; mandates clear and balanced advertisements and other communications; encourages arrangements for the escrowing of real estate taxes and insurance; and states that institutions should develop strong control and monitoring systems.
 The federal banking agencies have announced their intention to carefully review the risk management and consumer compliance processes, policies and procedures of their supervised financial institutions and their intention to take action against institutions that engage in predatory lending practices, violate consumer protection laws or fair lending laws, engage in unfair or deceptive acts or practices, or otherwise engage in unsafe or unsound lending practices.
 Guidance on Commercial Real Estate Concentrations. The federal banking agencies have issued guidance on sound risk management practices for concentrations in commercial real estate lending. The particular focus is on exposure to commercial real estate loans that are dependent on the cash flow from the real estate held as collateral and that are likely to be sensitive to conditions in the commercial real estate market (as opposed to real estate collateral held as a secondary source of repayment or as an abundance of caution). The purpose of the guidance is not to limit a bank’s commercial real estate lending but to guide banks in developing risk management practices and maintaining capital levels commensurate with the level and nature of real estate concentrations. A bank that has experienced rapid growth in commercial real estate lending, has notable exposure to a specific type of commercial real estate loan, or is approaching or exceeding the following supervisory criteria may be identified for further supervisory analysis with respect to real estate concentration risk: total loans for construction, land development, and other land represent 100% or more of the bank’s total capital; or total commercial real estate loans (as defined in the guidance) greater than 300% of the Bank’s total capital and an increase in the bank’s commercial real estate portfolio of 50% or more during the prior 36 months.
 Regulatory Capital Requirements.  The Bank is required to maintain specified levels of regulatory capital under federal banking regulations. The capital adequacy requirements are quantitative measures established by regulation that require the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of capital. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by bank regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company’s financial statements.
 Effective January 1, 2015, (with some changes transitioned into full effectiveness on January 1, 2019), The Bank became subject to capital regulations which created required minimum ratio for common equity Tier 1 (“CET1”) capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital and the minimum leverage ratio; established risk-weightings for assets and certain off-balance sheet items for purposes of the risk-based capital ratios; required an additional capital conservation buffer over the minimum risk-based capital ratios; and defined what qualifies as capital for purposes of meeting the capital requirements. These regulations implement the regulatory capital reforms required by the Dodd Frank Act and the “Basel III” requirements.
 
 31
 



Under the capital regulations, the minimum capital ratios are: (1) a CET1 capital ratio of 4.5% of risk-weighted assets; (2) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0% of risk-weighted assets; (3) a total capital ratio of 8.0% of risk-weighted assets; and (4) a leverage ratio (the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average total adjusted assets) of 4.0%. CET1 generally consists of common stock; retained earnings; accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) except in the case of banking organizations that have elected to exclude AOCI from regulatory capital, as discussed below; and certain minority interests; all subject to applicable regulatory adjustments and deductions.
 In addition to the capital requirements, there were a number of changes in what constitutes regulatory capital compared to earlier regulations, subject to transition periods. These changes include the phasing-out of certain instruments as qualifying capital. Mortgage servicing and deferred tax assets over designated percentages of CET1 are deducted from capital. In addition, Tier 1 capital includes AOCI, which includes all unrealized gains and losses on available for sale debt and equity securities. Because of our asset size, we had the one-time option of deciding whether to permanently opt-out of the inclusion of unrealized gains and losses on available for sale debt and equity securities in our capital calculations. We made the decision to opt out.
 The capital regulations changed in the risk-weighting of certain assets in an effort to better reflect credit risk and other risk exposure compared to earlier regulations. These changes include a 150% risk weight (up from 100%) for certain high volatility commercial real estate acquisition, development and construction loans and for non-residential mortgage loans that are 90 days past due or otherwise in nonaccrual status; a 20% (up from 0%) credit conversion factor for the unused portion of a commitment with an original maturity of one year or less that is not unconditionally cancellable (set at 0%); and a 250% risk weight (up from 100%) for mortgage servicing and deferred tax assets that are not deducted from capital.
 In addition to the minimum CET1, Tier 1 and total capital ratios, the capital regulations require a capital conservation buffer consisting of additional CET1 capital greater than 2.5% of risk-weighted assets above the required minimum risk-based in order to avoid limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases and paying discretionary bonuses based on percentages of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions. The phase-in of the capital conservation buffer requirement began on January 1, 2016, when a buffer greater than 0.625% of risk-weighted assets was required, which amount increased by 0.625% each year until the buffer requirement was fully implemented on January 1, 2019. At June 30, 2019, the Bank and the Company reported risk-based capital ratios meeting the capital conservation buffer.
 Under the prompt corrective action standards of the FRB, in order to be considered well-capitalized, the Bank must have a ratio of CET1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.5%, a ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8%, a ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 10%, and a leverage ratio of at least 5%; and in order to be considered adequately capitalized, it must have the minimum capital ratios described above. To be considered well-capitalized a bank holding company must have, on a consolidated basis, at least a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8% and a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10% and not be subject to a higher enforceable individualized capital requirement. At June 30, 2019, the Bank and the Company were categorized as “well capitalized” under these prompt corrective action standards.
 Section 201 of the Act requires the Federal banking agencies to promulgate a rule establishing a new “Community Bank Leverage Ratio” of 8%-10% for depository institutions and depository institution holding companies, with less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets. If such a depository institution or holding company maintains tangible equity in excess of this leverage ratio, it would be deemed to be in compliance with (1) the leverage and risk-based capital requirements promulgated by the Federal banking agencies; (2) in the case of a depository institution, the capital ratio requirements to be considered “well capitalized” under the Federal banking agencies’ “prompt corrective action” regime; and (3) “any other capital or leverage requirements to which the depository institution or holding company is subject, in each case unless the appropriate Federal banking agency determines otherwise based on the particular institution’s risk profile. In carrying out these requirements, the Federal banking agencies are required to consult with State banking regulators and notify the applicable State banking regulator of any qualifying community bank that exceeds or no longer exceeds the Community Bank Leverage Ratio. Regulations to implement the Community Bank Leverage Ratio have been proposed but not yet adopted in final form.
 Activities and Investments of Insured State-Chartered Banks. Subject to certain regulatory exceptions, the FDIA and FDIC regulations provide that an insured state-chartered bank may not, directly, or indirectly through a subsidiary, engage as "principal" in any activity that is not permissible for a national bank unless the FDIC has determined that such activities would pose no risk to the Deposit Insurance Fund and that the bank is in compliance with applicable regulatory capital requirements.
 
 32
 


Under regulations dealing with equity investments, an insured state bank generally may not directly or indirectly acquire or retain any equity investment of a type, or in an amount, that is not permissible for a national bank. An insured state bank is not prohibited from, among other things, (i) acquiring or retaining a majority interest in a subsidiary, (ii) investing as a limited partner in a partnership the sole purpose of which is direct or indirect investment in the acquisition, rehabilitation or new construction of a qualified housing project, provided that such limited partnership investments may not exceed 2% of the bank's total assets, (iii) acquiring up to 10% of the voting stock of a company that solely provides or reinsures directors', trustees' and officers' liability insurance coverage or bankers' blanket bond group insurance coverage for insured depository institutions, and (iv) acquiring or retaining the voting shares of a depository institution if certain requirements are met.
 Affiliate Transactions. The Company and the Bank are separate and distinct legal entities. Various legal limitations restrict the Bank from lending to or otherwise engaging in transactions with the Company (or any other affiliate), generally limiting such transactions with an affiliate to 10% of the Bank's capital and surplus and limiting all such transactions with all affiliates to 20% of the Bank's capital and surplus. Such transactions, including extensions of credit, sales of securities or assets and provision of services, also must be on terms and conditions consistent with safe and sound banking practices, including credit standards, that are substantially the same or at least as favorable to the Bank as those prevailing at the time for transactions with unaffiliated companies.
 Federally insured banks are subject, with certain exceptions, to certain additional restrictions (including collateralization) on extensions of credit to their parent holding companies or other affiliates, on investments in the stock or other securities of affiliates and on the taking of such stock or securities as collateral from any borrower. In addition, such banks are prohibited from engaging in certain tying arrangements in connection with any extension of credit or the providing of any property or service.
 Community Reinvestment Act. Banks are also subject to the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 ("CRA"), which requires the appropriate federal bank regulatory agency, in connection with its regular examination of a bank, to assess the bank's record in meeting the credit needs of the community serviced by the bank, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The regulatory agency's assessment of the bank's record is made available to the public. Further, such assessment is required of any bank which has applied, among other things, to establish a new branch office that will accept deposits, relocate an existing office or merge or consolidate with, or acquire the assets or assume the liabilities of, a financial institution. The Bank received a "satisfactory" rating during its most recent CRA examination.
 Dividends. Dividends from the Bank constitute the major source of funds for dividends that may be paid by the Company. The amount of dividends payable by the Bank to the Company depends upon the Bank's earnings and capital position, and is limited by federal and state laws, regulations and policies.
 The amount of dividends actually paid by the Bank during any one period will be strongly affected by the Bank's management policy of maintaining a strong capital position. Dividends can be restricted if the capital conservation buffer is not maintained as described under “Capital Rules” above. Federal law further provides that no insured depository institution may make any capital distribution (which would include a cash dividend) if, after making the distribution, the institution would be "undercapitalized," as defined in the prompt corrective action regulations. Moreover, the federal bank regulatory agencies also have the general authority to limit the dividends paid by insured banks if such payments should be deemed to constitute an unsafe and unsound practice.
 The Company
 Federal Securities Law. The stock of the Company is registered with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). As such, the Company is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements of the SEC under the Exchange Act.
 The Company's stock held by persons who are affiliates (generally officers, directors and principal stockholders) of the Company may not be resold without registration or unless sold in accordance with certain resale restrictions. If the Company meets specified current public information requirements, each affiliate of the Company is able to sell in the public market, without registration, a limited number of shares in any three-month period.
 Bank Holding Company Regulation. Bank holding companies are subject to comprehensive regulation by the FRB under the Bank Holding Company Act (“BHCA”). As a bank holding company, the Company is required to file reports with the FRB and such additional information as the FRB may require, and the Company and its non-banking affiliates are subject to examination by the FRB. Under FRB policy, a bank holding company must serve as a source of financial strength for its subsidiary banks. Under this policy the FRB may require, and has required in 
 
 33
 


the past, a holding company to contribute additional capital to an undercapitalized subsidiary bank. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, this policy is codified and rules to implement it are to be established. Under the BHCA, a bank holding company must obtain FRB approval before: (i) acquiring, directly or indirectly, ownership or control of any voting shares of another bank or bank holding company if, after such acquisition, it would own or control more than 5% of such shares (unless it already owns or controls the majority of such shares); (ii) acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of another bank or bank holding company; or (iii) merging or consolidating with another bank holding company.
 The Company is subject to the activity limitations imposed on bank holding companies that are not financial holding companies. The BHCA prohibits a bank holding company, with certain exceptions, from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any company which is not a bank or bank holding company, or from engaging directly or indirectly in activities other than those of banking, managing or controlling banks, or providing services for its subsidiaries. The principal exceptions to these prohibitions involve certain activities which are permitted, by statute or by FRB regulation or order, have been identified as activities closely related to the business of banking or managing or controlling banks. The list of activities permitted by the FRB includes, among other things, operating a savings institution, mortgage company, finance company, credit card company or factoring company; performing certain data processing operations; providing certain investment and financial advice; underwriting and acting as an insurance agent for certain types of credit-related insurance; leasing property on a full-payout, non-operating basis; selling money orders, travelers' checks and United States Savings Bonds; real estate and personal property appraising; providing tax planning and preparation services; and, subject to certain limitations, providing securities brokerage services for customers.
 TAXATION
 
Federal Taxation
General. The Company and the Bank report their income on a fiscal year basis using the accrual method of accounting and are subject to federal income taxation in the same manner as other corporations with some exceptions, including particularly the Bank's reserve for bad debts discussed below. The following discussion of tax matters is intended only as a summary and does not purport to be a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to the Bank or the Company.
 On December 22, 2017, the United States enacted tax reform legislation through the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which significantly changed U.S. tax laws, including a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, as well as other changes. As a result of enactment of the legislation, the Company incurred additional one-time income tax expense of $998,000 during the second quarter of fiscal 2018, primarily related to the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities.
 Bad Debt Reserve. Historically, savings institutions, such as the Bank used to be, which met certain definitional tests primarily related to their assets and the nature of their business ("qualifying thrift"), were permitted to establish a reserve for bad debts and to make annual additions thereto, which may have been deducted in arriving at their taxable income. The Bank's deductions with respect to their loans, which are generally loans secured by certain interests in real property, historically has been computed using an amount based on the Bank's actual loss experience, in accordance with IRC Section 585(B)(2). Due to the Bank's loss experience, the Bank generally recognized a bad debt deduction equal to their net charge-offs.
 The Bank’s average assets for the current year exceeded $500 million, thus classifying it as a large bank for purposes of IRC Section 585. Under IRC Section 585(c)(3), a bank that becomes a large bank must change its method of accounting from the reserve method to a specific charge-off method under IRC Section 166. The Bank’s deductions with respect to their loans are computed under the specific charge-off method. The specific charge-off method has been used in the current year and will be used in all subsequent tax years.
 Dividends-Received Deduction. The Company may exclude from its income 100% of dividends received from the Bank as a member of the same affiliated group of corporations. The corporate dividends-received deduction is generally 50% in the case of dividends received from unaffiliated corporations with which the Company and the Bank will not file a consolidated tax return, except that if the Company or the Bank owns more than 20% of the stock of a corporation distributing a dividend, then 65% of any dividends received may be deducted.
 
 34
 




Missouri Taxation
General. Missouri-based banks, such as the Bank, are subject to a Missouri bank franchise and income tax.
 Bank Franchise Tax. The Missouri bank franchise tax is imposed on (i) the bank's taxable income at the rate of 7%, less credits for certain Missouri taxes, including income taxes. However, the credits exclude taxes paid for real estate, unemployment taxes, bank tax, and taxes on tangible personal property owned by the Bank and held for lease or rentals to others - income-based calculation; and (ii) the bank's net assets at a rate of .007%. Net assets are defined as total assets less deposits and the investment in greater than 50% owned subsidiaries - asset-based calculation.
 Income Tax. The Bank and its holding company and related subsidiaries are subject to an income tax that is imposed on the consolidated taxable income apportioned to Missouri at the rate of 6.25%. The return is filed on a consolidated basis by all members of the consolidated group including the Bank.
Arkansas Taxation
 General. Due to its loan activity and the acquisitions of Arkansas banks in recent periods, the Bank is subject to an Arkansas income tax. The tax is imposed on the Bank’s apportioned taxable income at a rate of 6%.
Illinois Taxation
 General. Due to its loan activity and the acquisitions of Illinois banks in recent periods, the Bank is subject to an Illinois income tax. The tax is imposed on the Bank’s apportioned taxable income at a rate of 9.5%.
Audits
 There have been no IRS audits of the Company's Federal income tax returns or audits of the Bank's state income tax returns during the past five years.
 For additional information regarding taxation, see Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8.
 PERSONNEL
 As of June 30, 2019, the Company had 438 full-time employees and 32 part-time employees. The Company believes that employees play a vital role in the success of a service company and that the Company's relationship with its employees is good. The employees are not represented by a collective bargaining unit.
