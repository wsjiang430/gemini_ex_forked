 ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 ﻿
 General
 ﻿
 The First of Long Island Corporation (“Registrant”), a one-bank holding company, was incorporated on February 7, 1984 for the purpose of providing financial services through its wholly-owned subsidiary, The First National Bank of Long Island. The consolidated entity is referred to as the "Corporation," and the Bank and its subsidiaries are collectively referred to as the "Bank."
 ﻿
 The Bank was organized in 1927 as a national banking association under the laws of the United States of America. The Bank has two wholly owned subsidiaries: FNY Service Corp., an investment company, and The First of Long Island Agency, Inc. The Bank and FNY Service Corp. jointly own another subsidiary, The First of Long Island REIT, Inc., a real estate investment trust (“REIT”).
 ﻿
 All of the financial operations of the Corporation are aggregated in one reportable operating segment. All revenues are attributed to and all long-lived assets are located in the United States.
 ﻿
 The Bank’s revenues are derived principally from interest on loans and investment securities, service charges and fees on deposit accounts, income from investment management and trust services and bank-owned life insurance (“BOLI”).
 ﻿
 The Bank did not commence, abandon or significantly change any of its lines of business during 2018. 
 ﻿
 Markets Served and Products Offered
 ﻿
 The Bank serves the financial needs of small and medium-sized businesses, professionals, consumers, public bodies and other organizations primarily in Nassau and Suffolk Counties, Long Island, and the boroughs of New York City (“NYC”). The Bank’s head office is located in Glen Head, New York, and the Bank has 51 other branch locations including six full-service branches in Queens, three in Brooklyn and two commercial banking offices in Manhattan. The Bank continues to evaluate potential new branch sites on Long Island and in the NYC boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens.
 ﻿
 The Bank’s loan portfolio is primarily comprised of loans to borrowers on Long Island and in the boroughs of NYC, and its real estate loans are principally secured by properties located in those areas. The Bank’s investment securities portfolio is comprised of direct obligations of the U.S. government and its agencies, corporate bonds of large U.S. financial institutions and highly rated obligations of states and political subdivisions. The Bank has an Investment Management Division that provides investment management, pension trust, personal trust, estate and custody services.
 ﻿

 Competition
 ﻿
 The Bank encounters substantial competition in its banking business from numerous other financial services organizations that have offices located in the communities served by the Bank. Principal competitors are money center and large regional and community banks located within the Bank’s market area, mortgage brokers, brokerage firms, credit unions and fintech or e-commerce companies. The Bank competes for loans based on the quality of service it provides, loan structure, competitive pricing and branch locations, and

      competes for deposits by offering a high level of customer service, paying competitive rates and through the geographic distribution of its branch system.
 ﻿

Investment Activities
 ﻿
 The investment policy of the Bank, as approved by the Board Asset Liability Committee (“BALCO”) and supervised by both the BALCO and the Management Investment Committee, is intended to promote investment practices which are both safe and sound and in full compliance with applicable regulations. Investment authority is granted and amended as necessary by the Board of Directors or BALCO.
 ﻿
 The Bank's investment decisions seek to optimize income while keeping both credit and interest rate risk at acceptable levels, provide for the Bank's liquidity needs and provide securities that can be pledged, as needed, to secure deposits and borrowings.
 ﻿
 The Bank’s investment policy generally limits individual maturities to twenty years and estimated average lives on collateralized mortgage obligations (“CMOs”) and other mortgage-backed securities to ten years. At the time of purchase, bonds of states and political subdivisions must generally be rated AA or better, notes of states and political subdivisions must generally be rated MIG-1 (or equivalent), commercial paper must be rated A-1 or P-1, and corporate bonds of large U.S. based financial institutions must have a rating of BBB+ or better. In addition, management periodically reviews the creditworthiness of all securities in the Bank’s portfolio other than those issued by the U.S. government or its agencies. Any significant deterioration in the creditworthiness of an issuer is analyzed and action is taken if deemed appropriate. 
 ﻿
 At year-end 2018 and 2017, there were no holdings of securities of any one issuer, other than the U.S. government and its agencies, in an amount greater than 10% of stockholders’ equity.
 ﻿
 At December 31, 2018, $419.2 million of the Corporation’s municipal securities were rated AA or better, $2.1 million were rated A and $3.9 million were non-rated bonds issued by local municipalities. The Corporation’s pass-through mortgage securities portfolio at December 31, 2018 is comprised of $167.9 million and $52.9 million of securities issued by the Government National Mortgage Association (“GNMA”) and the Federal National Mortgage Association (“FNMA”), respectively. Each issuer’s pass-through mortgage securities are backed by residential mortgages conforming to the issuer’s underwriting guidelines and each issuer guarantees the timely payment of principal and interest on its securities. All of the Corporation’s CMOs were issued by GNMA and such securities are backed by GNMA residential pass-through mortgage securities. GNMA guarantees the timely payment of principal and interest on its CMOs and the underlying pass-through mortgage securities. Obligations of GNMA, a U.S. government agency, represent full faith and credit obligations of the U.S. government, while obligations of FNMA, which is a U.S. government-sponsored agency, do not. The Corporation’s corporate bond portfolio is comprised of $117.6 million of senior unsecured fixed-to-floating rate securities issued by large U.S. based financial institutions. The bonds are rated A- to BBB+, have a stated maturity of ten years, a fixed rate for a period of two or three years and then reset quarterly based on the ten-year swap rate.
 ﻿
 The Bank has not engaged in the purchase and sale of securities for the primary purpose of producing trading profits and its current investment policy does not allow such activity.
 ﻿
 Lending Activities
 ﻿
 General. The Bank’s lending is subject to written underwriting standards and loan origination procedures, as approved by the Board Loan Committee and contained in the Bank’s loan policy. The loan policy allows for exceptions and sets forth specific exception approval requirements. Decisions on loan applications are based on, among other things, the borrower’s credit history, the financial strength of the borrower, estimates of the borrower’s ability to repay the loan and the value of the collateral, if any. All real estate appraisals must meet the requirements of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (“Dodd-Frank Act”), banking agency guidance and, for those loans in excess of $250,000, be reviewed by the Bank’s independent appraisal review function. 
 ﻿
 The Bank conducts its lending activities out of its main office in Glen Head, New York and its Suffolk County regional office in Hauppauge, New York. The Bank’s loan portfolio is primarily comprised of loans to small and medium-sized privately owned businesses, professionals and consumers on Long Island and in the boroughs of NYC. The Bank offers a full range of lending services including commercial and residential mortgage loans, home equity lines, commercial and industrial loans, small business credit scored loans, Small Business Administration (“SBA”) loans, construction and land development loans, consumer loans and commercial and standby letters of credit. The Bank makes both fixed and variable rate loans. Variable rate loans are primarily tied to and reprice with changes in the prime interest rate of the Bank, the prime interest rate as published in The Wall Street Journal, U.S. Treasury rates, Federal Home Loan Bank of New York advance rates and the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). 
 ﻿
 Residential mortgage loans in excess of $750,000, home equity and small business credit scored loans in excess of $500,000 and other loans in excess of $750,000 generally require the approval of the Management Loan Committee. Loans in excess of $12.5 million require the additional approval of two non-management members of the Board Loan Committee, while those in excess of $17.5 million require the approval of a majority of the Board of Directors.

      Commercial and Industrial Loans. Commercial and industrial loans include, among other things, short-term business loans and lines of credit; term and installment loans; loans secured by marketable securities, the cash surrender value of life insurance policies, deposit accounts or general business assets; small business credit scored loans as described hereinafter; and equipment finance loans. The Bank makes commercial and industrial loans on a demand basis, short-term basis or installment basis. Short-term business loans are generally due and payable within one year and should be self-liquidating during the normal course of the borrower’s business cycle. Lines of credit are reaffirmed annually and generally require an annual cleanup period. Term and installment loans are usually due and payable within five years. Generally, it is the policy of the Bank to request personal guarantees of principal owners on loans made to privately-owned businesses. 
 ﻿
 Small Business Credit Scored Loans. The Bank makes small business credit scored loans and issues VISA® credit cards to businesses that generally have annual sales at the time of application of less than $3.5 million. Most of these loans are in the form of revolving credit lines and, depending on the type of business, the maximum amount generally ranges from $100,000 to $500,000. Others are installment loans made to finance business automobiles, trucks and equipment and can be secured by the asset financed and/or deposit accounts with the Bank. Both installment loans and revolving credit commitments generally have maturities up to 60 months. Business profile reports are used in conjunction with credit reports and FICO (Fair Isaac Corporation) small business score cards for loan underwriting and decision making purposes. Credit and FICO small business risk scores enable the Bank to quickly and efficiently identify and approve loans to low-risk business applicants and decline loans to high-risk business applicants. There were $623,000 of small business credit scored term loans outstanding at December 31, 2018. In addition, the Bank had commitments on small business credit scored revolving lines of credit of $52.8 million, of which $20.0 million were drawn and funded.
 ﻿
 Real Estate Mortgage Loans and Home Equity Lines. The Bank makes residential and commercial mortgage loans and establishes home equity lines of credit. Applicants for residential mortgage loans and home equity lines will be considered for approval provided they have satisfactory credit history and collateral and the Bank believes that there is sufficient monthly income to service both the loan or line applied for and existing debt. Applicants for commercial mortgage loans will be considered for approval provided they, as well as any guarantors, have satisfactory credit history and can demonstrate, through financial statements and otherwise, the ability to repay. Commercial and residential mortgage loans are made with terms not in excess of 30 years and are generally maintained in the Bank’s portfolio. The residential mortgage loans made by the Bank in recent years consist of both fixed rate loans with terms ranging from 10 to 30 years and variable rate loans that reprice in five, seven or ten years and then every year thereafter. Commercial mortgage loans generally reprice within five years and home equity lines generally mature within ten years. Depending on the type of property, the Bank will generally not lend more than 75% of appraised value on residential mortgage, home equity and commercial mortgage loans. The lending limitations with regard to appraised value are more stringent for loans on co-ops and condominiums.
 ﻿
 In processing requests for commercial mortgage loans, the Bank generally requires an environmental assessment to identify the possibility of environmental contamination. The extent of the assessment procedures varies from property to property and is based on factors such as the use and location of the subject property and whether or not the property has a suspected environmental risk based on current or past use.
 ﻿
 Construction Loans. From time to time, the Bank makes loans to finance the construction of both residential and commercial properties. The maturity of such loans is generally 18 months or less and advances are made as the construction progresses. The advances can require the submission of bills and lien waivers by the contractor, verification by a Bank-approved inspector that the work has been performed, and title insurance updates to ensure that no intervening liens have been placed. Variable rate construction and land development loans are included in Commercial Mortgages on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and amounted to $6.1 million at December 31, 2018.
 ﻿
 Consumer Loans and Lines. The Bank makes auto loans, home improvement loans and other consumer loans, establishes revolving overdraft lines of credit and issues VISA® credit cards. Consumer loans are generally made on an installment basis over terms not in excess of five years. In reviewing loans and lines for approval, the Bank considers, among other things, the borrower’s ability to repay, stability of employment and residence and past credit history.
 ﻿
 Sources of Funds
 ﻿
 The Corporation’s primary sources of cash have been deposits, maturities and amortization of loans and investment securities, operations, borrowings and funds received under the Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan (“DRIP”). The Corporation uses cash from these and other sources to fund loan growth, purchase investment securities, repay borrowings, expand and improve its physical facilities, pay cash dividends, repurchase its common stock and for general operating purposes. 
 ﻿
 The Bank offers checking and interest-bearing deposit products. In addition to business and small business checking, the Bank has a variety of personal checking products that differ in minimum balance requirements, monthly maintenance fees, and per check charges, if any. The interest-bearing deposit products, which have a wide range of interest rates and terms, consist of checking accounts, which include negotiable order of withdrawal (“NOW”) accounts and IOLA, escrow service accounts, rent security accounts, a variety of personal and nonpersonal money market accounts, a variety of personal and nonpersonal savings products, time deposits, holiday club accounts and a variety of individual retirement accounts.

      ﻿
 The Bank relies primarily on its branch network, customer service, calling programs, lending relationships, referral sources, competitive pricing, deposit rate promotions and advertising to attract and retain local deposits. The flow of deposits is influenced by general economic conditions, changes in interest rates and competition.
 ﻿
 Employees
 ﻿
 As of December 31, 2018, the Bank had 344 full-time equivalent employees and considers employee relations to be good. Employees of the Bank are not represented by a collective bargaining unit.
 ﻿
 Supervision and Regulation
 ﻿
 General. The banking industry is highly regulated. Statutory and regulatory controls are designed primarily for the protection of depositors and the banking system, and not for the purpose of protecting shareholders. The following discussion is not intended to be a complete list of all the activities regulated by banking laws or of the impact of such laws and regulations on the Corporation and the Bank. Changes in applicable laws or regulations and their interpretation and application by regulatory agencies cannot be predicted and may have a material effect on our business and results of operations. 
 ﻿
 As a registered bank holding company, the Corporation is regulated under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (“BHC Act”), and subject to inspection, examination and supervision by the Federal Reserve Board. In general, the BHC Act limits the business of bank holding companies to banking, managing or controlling banks, performing servicing activities for subsidiaries and engaging in activities that the Federal Reserve has determined, by order or regulation, are so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto under the BHC Act. The Corporation is also subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as administered by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Our common stock is listed on the Capital Market tier of the NASDAQ Stock Market (“NASDAQ”) under the symbol “FLIC” and is subject to NASDAQ rules for listed companies. 
 ﻿
 As a national bank, the Bank is subject to regulation and examination by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”). Insured banks, such as the Bank, are subject to extensive regulation of many aspects of their businesses. These regulations relate to, among other things: (i) the nature and amount of loans that may be made by the Bank and the rates of interest that may be charged; (ii) types and amounts of other investments; (iii) branching; (iv) anti-money laundering; (v) permissible activities; (vi) reserve requirements; and (vii) dealings with officers, directors and affiliates. 
 ﻿
 The Dodd-Frank Act made extensive changes in the regulation of depository institutions and their holding companies. For example, the Dodd-Frank Act created a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) as an independent bureau of the Federal Reserve Board. The CFPB has assumed responsibility for the implementation of the federal financial consumer protection and fair lending laws and regulations, a function previously assigned to principal federal banking regulators, and has authority to impose new requirements. However, institutions of less than $10 billion in assets, such as the Bank, continue to be examined for compliance with consumer protection and fair lending laws and regulations by, and be subject to the enforcement authority of, their primary federal regulator, although the CFPB has limited back-up authority to examine such institutions.
 ﻿
 Bank Holding Company Regulation. The BHC Act requires the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board for the acquisition by a bank holding company of 5% or more of the voting stock or substantially all of the assets of any bank or bank holding company. Also, under the BHC Act, bank holding companies are prohibited, with certain exceptions, from engaging in, or from acquiring 5% or more of the voting stock of any company engaging in activities other than (i) banking or managing or controlling banks, (ii) furnishing services to or performing services for their subsidiaries or (iii) activities that the Federal Reserve Board has determined to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. Bank holding companies that meet certain criteria specified by the Federal Reserve may elect to be regulated as a “financial holding company” and thereby engage in a broader array of financial activities including insurance and investment banking.
 ﻿
 Payment of Dividends. A large source of the Corporation’s liquidity is dividends from the Bank. Prior approval of the OCC is required if the total of all dividends declared by a national bank in any calendar year would exceed the sum of the bank’s net profits for that year and its retained net profits for the preceding two calendar years, less any required transfers to surplus. Under the foregoing dividend restrictions, and while maintaining its “well-capitalized” status and absent affirmative governmental approvals, during 2019 the Bank could declare dividends to the Corporation of approximately $52.3 million plus any 2019 net profits retained to the date of the dividend declaration.
 ﻿
 In addition, the Corporation and the Bank are subject to other regulatory policies and requirements relating to the payment of dividends, including requirements to maintain adequate capital above regulatory minimum capital levels. The Federal Reserve Board is authorized to determine under certain circumstances relating to the financial condition of a bank holding company or a bank that the payment of dividends would be an unsafe or unsound practice and to prohibit payment thereof. Federal Reserve guidance sets forth the supervisory expectation that bank holding companies will inform and consult with Federal Reserve staff in advance of declaring a dividend that 

     
4

      exceeds earnings for the quarter and should inform the Federal Reserve and should eliminate, defer or significantly reduce dividends if (i) net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends, (ii) the prospective rate of earnings retention is not consistent with the bank holding company’s capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition, or (iii) the bank holding company will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios.
 ﻿
 Stock Repurchases. Current Federal Reserve regulations provide that a bank holding company that is not well capitalized or well managed, as such terms are defined in the regulations, or that is subject to any unresolved supervisory issues, is required to give the Federal Reserve prior written notice of any repurchase or redemption of its outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for repurchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such repurchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, will be equal to 10% or more of the company’s consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve may disapprove such a repurchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe and unsound practice or violate a law or regulation. Federal Reserve guidance generally provides for bank holding company consultation with Federal Reserve Bank (“FRB”) staff prior to engaging in a repurchase or redemption of a bank holding company’s stock, even if a formal written notice is not required. However, it has recently come to the attention of the Corporation that the Federal Reserve staff is interpreting the capital regulations as requiring a bank holding company to secure Federal Reserve approval prior to redeeming or repurchasing any capital stock that is included in regulatory capital.
 ﻿
 Transactions with Affiliates. Federal laws strictly limit the ability of banks to engage in transactions with their affiliates, including their bank holding companies. Regulations promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board limit the types and amounts of these transactions (including loans due and extensions of credit from their U.S. bank subsidiaries) that may take place and generally require those transactions to be on an arm’s-length basis. In general, these regulations require that any “covered transactions” between a subsidiary bank and its parent company or the nonbank subsidiaries of the bank holding company be limited to 10% of the bank subsidiary’s capital and surplus and, with respect to such parent company and all such nonbank subsidiaries, to an aggregate of 20% of the bank subsidiary’s capital and surplus. Further, loans and extensions of credit to affiliates generally are required to be secured by eligible collateral in specified amounts. 
 ﻿
 Source of Strength Doctrine. Federal Reserve policy has historically required bank holding companies to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to their subsidiary banks. The Dodd-Frank Act codified this policy as a statutory requirement. Under this requirement, the Corporation is expected to commit resources to support the Bank, including at times when the Corporation may not be in a financial position to provide such resources. Any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to depositors and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary banks. In the event of a bank holding company’s bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment. 
 ﻿
 Capital Requirements. As a bank holding company, the Corporation is subject to consolidated regulatory capital requirements administered by the Federal Reserve. The Bank is subject to similar capital requirements administered by the OCC. 
 ﻿
 The Corporation and the Bank are subject to the Basel III regulatory capital standards (“Basel III”) issued by the Federal Reserve Board and the OCC. Under the Basel III capital requirements, the Corporation and the Bank are required to maintain minimum ratios of Tier 1 capital to average assets of 4.00%, Common equity tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets of 4.50%, Tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets of 6.00% and Total capital to risk weighted assets of 8.00%. Common equity tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital, Total capital, risk weighted assets and average assets are defined in the Basel III rules. Failure to meet the minimum capital requirements can result in certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by the regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the financial statements of the Corporation and Bank. The Corporation and the Bank exceeded the Basel III minimum capital adequacy requirements at December 31, 2018.
 ﻿
 Basel III also phased-in a capital conservation buffer from 2016 through 2019. The capital conservation buffer must be maintained in order for a banking organization to avoid being subject to limitations on capital distributions, including dividend payments, and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. The capital conservation buffer of 2.5% is now fully phased in and the capital ratio requirements for 2019, including the capital conservation buffer, for banks with $250 billion or less in total assets are 7.00% for Common equity tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets, 8.50% for Tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets and 10.50% for Total capital to risk weighted assets.
 ﻿
 Federal legislation enacted in 2018 requires that the federal banking agencies, including the OCC and FRB, establish an alternative framework that specifies a “community bank leverage ratio” of between 8 and 10% of average total consolidated assets for qualifying banking organizations with less than $10 billion of assets. Institutions and holding companies with tangible equity (subject to certain adjustments) meeting the specified level and electing to follow the alternative framework would be deemed to comply with the applicable regulatory capital requirements, including the risk-based requirements, and be considered to be “well-capitalized” for purposes of the Prompt Corrective Action (“PCA”) regulations, discussed in the following section. The agencies have issued a proposed rule that would set the “community bank leverage ratio” at 9%. Management is evaluating the proposed rule to determine whether or not to elect the alternative framework.

      ﻿
 ﻿
 Prompt Corrective Action Regulations. The Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended (“FDIA”), requires among other things, that the federal banking agencies take “prompt corrective action” with respect to banks that do not meet minimum capital requirements. The FDIA sets forth the following five capital tiers for purposes of implementing the PCA regulations: “well-capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized.” The PCA thresholds established by Basel III for each of the capital tiers is as follows: 
 ﻿

﻿ | | | | 
-------------------------------+--------------------------------------+-----------------------+------------------------------------+--------------------
﻿ | | | | 
﻿ | Total RBCMeasure (%) | Tier 1 RBCMeasure (%) | Common EquityTier 1 RBCMeasure (%) | LeverageMeasure (%)
Well capitalized | > 10 | > 8 | > 6.5 | > 5 
Adequately capitalized | > 8 | > 6 | > 4.5 | > 4 
Undercapitalized | < 8 | < 6 | < 4.5 | < 4 
Significantly undercapitalized | < 6 | < 4 | < 3 | < 3 
Critically undercapitalized | Tangible equity to total assets < 2 

  ﻿
 The Bank was well capitalized under the Basel III PCA thresholds at December 31, 2018. 
 ﻿
 Deposit Insurance. The FDIC imposes an assessment on financial institutions for deposit insurance. The assessment is based on the FDIC’s statistical model for estimating the institution’s probability of failure over a three-year period and the institution’s average total assets and average tangible equity. The FDIC periodically adjusts the deposit insurance assessment rates, which may raise or lower the cost to an institution of maintaining FDIC insurance coverage.
 ﻿
 The FDIC may terminate the insurance of an institution’s deposits upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. Management is not aware of any practice, condition or violation that might lead to termination of the Bank’s deposit insurance.
 ﻿
 On September 30, 2018, the Deposit Insurance Fund Reserve Ratio exceeded 1.35%. As a result, small banks such as the Bank will receive assessment credits for the portion of their assessment that contributed to the growth in the reserve ratio from 1.15% to 1.35%, to be applied when the reserve ratio is at least 1.38%. Based on a notice received from the FDIC in January 2019, the Bank would receive approximately $960,000 in credits toward future assessments once the reserve ratio reaches 1.38%.
 ﻿
 Safety and Soundness Standards. The FDIA requires the federal bank regulatory agencies to prescribe standards, through regulations or guidelines, relating to internal controls, information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings, stock valuation and compensation, fees and benefits, and such other operational and managerial standards as the agencies deem appropriate. Guidelines adopted by the federal bank regulatory agencies establish general standards relating to internal controls and information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, compensation, fees and benefits. In general, the guidelines require, among other things, appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risk and exposures specified in the guidelines. The guidelines prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer, employee, director or principal stockholder. In addition, the agencies adopted regulations that authorize, but do not require, an agency to order an institution that has been given notice by an agency that it is not satisfying one or more of the safety and soundness standards to submit a compliance plan. If, after being so notified, an institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an acceptable compliance plan, the agency must issue an order directing action to correct the deficiency and may issue an order directing other actions of the types to which an undercapitalized institution is subject under the PCA provisions of the FDIA. If an institution fails to comply with such an order, the agency may seek to enforce such order in judicial proceedings and to impose civil money penalties. 
 ﻿
 Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Laws. The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (“CRA”) requires depository institutions to assist in meeting the credit needs of their market areas consistent with safe and sound banking practice. Under the CRA, each depository institution is required to help meet the credit needs of its market areas by, among other things, providing credit to low and moderate income individuals and communities. Depository institutions are periodically examined for compliance with the CRA and are assigned ratings. Banking regulators take into account CRA ratings when considering approval of proposed acquisition transactions. The Bank received a “Satisfactory” CRA rating on its most recent Federal examination. The Bank and the Corporation are firmly committed to the practice of fair lending and maintaining strict adherence to all federal and state fair lending laws which prohibit discriminatory lending practices.

      Federal Home Loan Bank System. The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System (“FHLB System”), which consists of 11 regional Federal Home Loan Banks (each a “FHLB”). The FHLB System provides a central credit facility primarily for member banks. As a member of the FHLB of New York, the Bank is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the FHLB in an amount equal to 4.5% of its borrowings from the FHLB (transaction-based stock) plus .125% of the total principal amount at the beginning of the year of the Bank’s unpaid residential real estate loans, commercial real estate loans, home equity loans, CMOs, and other similar obligations (membership stock). At December 31, 2018, the Bank was in compliance with the FHLB’s capital stock ownership requirement. 
 ﻿
 Financial Privacy. Federal regulations require the Bank to disclose its privacy policy, including identifying with whom it shares “nonpublic personal information,” to its customers at the time the customer establishes a relationship with the Bank and annually thereafter. In addition, we are required to provide our customers with the ability to “opt-out” of having the Bank share their nonpublic personal information with nonaffiliated third parties before we can disclose that information, subject to certain exceptions. 
 ﻿
 The federal banking agencies adopted guidelines establishing standards for safeguarding our customer information. The guidelines describe the agencies’ expectation that regulated entities create, implement and maintain an information security program, which would include administrative, technical and physical safeguards appropriate to the size and complexity and the nature and scope of our activities. The standards set forth in the guidelines are intended to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information, protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of customer records, and protect against unauthorized access to records or information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to customers. Additionally, the guidance states that banks, such as the Bank, should develop and implement a response program to address security breaches involving customer information, including customer notification procedures. The Bank has developed such a program. 
 ﻿
 Anti-Money Laundering and the USA PATRIOT Act. A major focus of governmental policy on financial institutions in recent years has been aimed at combating money laundering and terrorist financing. The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (“Patriot Act”) substantially broadened the scope of United States anti-money laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant new compliance and due diligence obligations, creating new crimes and penalties and expanding the extra-territorial jurisdiction of the United States. The United States Treasury Department has issued a number of regulations that apply various requirements of the Patriot Act to financial institutions such as the Bank. These regulations impose obligations on financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies, procedures and controls to detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the identity of their customers. Certain of those regulations impose specific due diligence requirements on financial institutions that maintain correspondent or private banking relationships with non-U.S. financial institutions or persons. Failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, or to comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations, could have serious legal, financial and reputational consequences for the institution.

 Legislative Initiatives and Regulatory Reform. From time to time, various legislative and regulatory initiatives are introduced in Congress and state legislatures, as well as by regulatory agencies. Such initiatives may include proposals to expand or contract the powers of bank holding companies and depository institutions or proposals to change substantially the financial institution regulatory system. Such legislation could change banking statutes and the operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways. If enacted, such legislation could increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions and other financial institutions. The Corporation cannot predict whether any such legislation will be enacted, and, if enacted, the effect that it, or any implementing regulations, would have on our financial condition or results of operations. A change in statutes, regulations or regulatory policies applicable to the Corporation could have a material effect on our business.
