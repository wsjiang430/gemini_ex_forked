Smart Surfaces
 
The surface is an important part of virtually every physical object and often plays an overriding role in many processes, beyond mere connectivity and structural support, but more deeply into areas involving chemical and biological interactions. In some instances, the surface provides an easy entry into the chemical or biological systems; in others it protects the internal elements of the object, surrounded by the surfaces.
 
The Company’s current technology platform is the Smart Surface. By being able to control the surface properties of materials down to the nanometer scale, new and improved devices can be designed and built that may lead to compelling business opportunities. One type of smart surface of particular interest allows properties to be changed in response to an external stimulus.
 
Initially, the Company’s development focused on Micro Electronic Mechanic Systems (MEMS) devices by manipulating the surface of silicon materials – the same material used to make microelectronic materials and devices. Using physical and chemical processes, the surface of the silicon is modified to make solid porous structures known as membranes. This is where microfluidics comes into play. These membranes can be used to selectively control the flow of liquids through the pores or openings at the micrometer length scale.
 
Surfaces may be characterized as hydrophilic or hydrophobic depending on whether or not they attract or repel water (or other liquids). A hydrophilic surface can be wet and adsorbs water. A hydrophobic surface, on the other hand, cannot be wet. Hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces are abundant in nature and in synthetic materials, both organic and inorganic in chemical composition. A familiar example of a hydrophilic surface is a sponge that readily soaks up water. By contrast, many plant leaves and flower petals are hydrophobic, as are insect parts and bird feathers. Synthetic hydrophobic surfaces include Scotchgard™ treated fabric, Teflon® coated metal, or Rain-X® coated glass. On a hydrophobic surface, water beads up and can move around without being absorbed by the solid material that it is resting on.
 
So-called superhydrophobic surfaces are also found in nature and can now be replicated in the lab. The lotus leaf and rose petal, for example, exhibit super-hydrophobicity. Here water droplets form almost perfect spheres with hardly any contact with the underlying solid surface. This makes the liquid even easier to move and manipulate. The synthesis of superhydrophobic surfaces has recently been made possible by advances in nanotechnology and the Company is leading the way to better understand and create materials and devices incorporating these unique surface properties.
 
As the Company’s research and development efforts evolve, in addition to silicon materials, the ability to control the surface properties of materials can be extended to other substances such as polymers, ceramics, metals, and fibers providing opportunities for our platform technology to be used in a range of potential applications such as energy storage and power management for portable electronics and microelectronics, self-cleaning surfaces, filters for water purification or desalination systems, materials for environmental remediation that separate liquids or solvents, and other situations where the control of the interaction of a solid surface exposed to a liquid is vitally important.

Smart NanoBattery
 
Battery technology has changed little in its fundamentals over the past 150 years. As a result, ordinary batteries begin dissipating energy as soon as they are assembled and therefore have limited shelf life. Chemistries are fixed inside the package so the user cannot interact with the contents to program functionality. The size and form of batteries have not kept pace with the miniaturization of electrical components, microprocessors and integrated circuits. As a result, the optimal implementation of an electronic device is not always achieved. Some batteries contain chemicals that are not considered safe or environmentally friendly (“green”). This makes disposal a potential issue.
 
The Company is challenging this convention by using their proprietary superhydrophobic porous silicon membrane technology as the basis to build the Smart NanoBattery, a reserve battery providing Power On Command™ prior to initial activation.
 
Super-hydrophobicity initially keeps the liquid electrolyte physically separated from the solid electrodes of the battery, thus preventing the chemical reactions from occurring that cause the battery to provide power. This gives the Smart NanoBattery the benefit of potentially infinite shelf life.
 
A conventional battery loses some capacity while sitting on the shelf in its package or stored in an electronic or electrical device, even before being used for the first time. On the other hand, the Smart NanoBattery is built so that it is inactive and remains that way indefinitely until it is turned on. No power is lost to self-discharge or leakage current prior to activation. When needed, the Smart NanoBattery can be activated on command via the phenomenon of electrowetting. The surface properties of the porous silicon membrane are selectively controlled to shift instantly from a superhydrophobic to hydrophilic state. In other words, electrowetting acts as the triggering mechanism.
 
The Company has successfully fabricated and demonstrated its first 3-volt lithium-based Smart NanoBattery, based on a design allowing either manual or remote activation by the user, the feature known as Power on Command™.
 
By incorporating the phenomenon of electrowetting on nanostructured surfaces into a revolutionary way of storing energy, the Smart NanoBattery provides power to portable electronic and microelectronic devices exactly when and where it is needed. As a reserve battery it is an augmentation to conventional primary batteries. The nanobattery converts stored chemical energy into usable electrical energy, but in a way that is potentially more reliable, more versatile, more environmentally friendly, and less expensive than conventional primary batteries.
 
Applications
 
Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
 
The Company has recently acquired technologies focused on artificial intelligence and machine learning. The related proprietary software enable customers to enhance their business capabilities by providing sophisticated digital analysis of large volumes of data to provide sophisticated solutions to complex problems. The current product offering includes software covering eight categories: inventory, stock management, marketing optimization, sentiment analysis, customer segmentation and behavior, agro-tech image detection, electrocardiogram automation, and a recommendation engine with multiple uses.

The Smart NanoBattery, the Company’s first smart surface product, has a unique architecture that enables a shelf life of decades, remote activation, programmable control, scalable manufacturing, and adaptability to multiple configurations. The value proposition to the end user is to have a source of energy or power that is literally always ready – reliable, convenient, low cost – a battery guaranteed to work at full capacity when and where you need it.
 
The Smart NanoBattery can conceivably supply power “on command” to a wide variety of portable electronic and microelectronic devices used in military, medical, industrial, and consumer applications.
 
The Company has demonstrated that the battery works in lab tests as well as in a significant field test conducted for the U.S. Army as part of a guided munitions project. The relationship with the Army also included an $850,000 funded project to develop a battery for a mission critical computer memory backup application. The target was a small footprint, 3-volt lithium battery with a minimum shelf life of 20 years and uninterruptible power output during this time period. To the best of the Company’s knowledge, no other battery technology available today can deliver the long-term performance requirements specified by the U.S. Army for this application.
 
The Smart NanoBattery can potentially be designed to accommodate a variety of sophisticated portable electronic and microelectronic devices including next-generation cell phones, handheld gaming devices, wireless sensor systems, radio frequency identification tags, high-tech flashlights and beacons, health alert alarms, and non-implantable and implantable medical devices such as pacemakers.
 
Initial applications will address the need to supply emergency and backup power to a range of products for defense and security, with future applications in the commercial and consumer arenas.
 
Strategic Alliances
 
Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
 
The Company has recently entered into two contracts with two separate customers to provide, including but not limited to, software, training, and support services as required. The contracts provide for initial revenue streams as well as subsequent revenue for training, support, updates and maintenance services as provided.
 
Smart NanoBattery
 
The Company continued during 2019, together with Picatinny Arsenal, to jointly seek federal funding under SBIR grants to develop additional new products for military small munitions applications. The Company has a strong historic cooperative relationship for product development and testing with Picatinny Arsenal having entered into 3 CRADA’s (Cooperative Research Agreements) with this small munitions testing facility of the U.S. Army The Company seek opportunities with various potential academic partners to obtain further STTR grants for new product research and development.
 
In 2007, the Company entered into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (“CRADA”) with Picatinny Arsenal to test the single cell version of the Smart NanoBattery suitable for future research and development programs for projectile launched munitions. From 2007 through the first quarter of calendar year 2010, numerous internal laboratory air gun simulation tests were performed, including a live-air gun and live gun fired test at the United States Army’s facility at Aberdeen Proving Grounds, Aberdeen, Maryland. A prototype of the Smart NanoBattery was the subject of a live fire test as part of a projectile fired out of an Abrams Tank. The results of the test indicated that the battery was activated by 10,000 G forces indicating that it could supply energy necessary to operate a guidance system for small munitions. In addition, the Smart NanoBattery demonstrated extreme resiliency to shock and acceleration since, it survived tests that subjected it to high acceleration of over 30,000 G forces.

On February 9, 2011, the Company announced that it had signed a 3-year CRADA with the U.S. Army Armament Research, Development, and Engineering Center (ARDEC) at Picatinny, New Jersey, to continue to cooperatively test and evaluate the mPhase Smart NanoBattery, including new design features functionally appropriate for DoD based systems requiring portable power sources. The army researchers are evaluating the prototypes using the Army’s testing facilities at Picatinny Arsenal in New Jersey to determine applicability of the technology to gun fired munitions and potentially to incorporate the technologies into research and development and other programs sponsored by Picatinny. The Research Agreement is supported by the Fuze & Precision Armaments Technology Directorate. In order for significant further research and development to be performed with respect to the Smart Nano Battery the Company will have to be successful in obtaining additional congressional funding specifically designated for this type of battery. This CRADA was renewed on March 27, 2014 for an additional three-year period by the Army. The Company is currently seeking to enter a new CRADA with the U.S. Army, subject to availability of funding.
 
Products and Services
 
Since its inception in 1996, the Company has been focused on the development of intellectual property involving high technology innovative solutions and products with high-growth potential. The Company has previously served as an incubator for exploratory research and initial development for products that are best characterized as having a high risk/high reward profile since they involve exploratory research to achieve significant scientific breakthroughs from existing products that can have a substantial economic impact and benefit upon successful commercialization. Beginning on January 11, 2019, the new management of the Company has shifted the focus to the rapid expansion of profit centers centered around the rapid creation, either by acquisition or fast development of software platforms that will enable the Company to generate revenue from artificial intelligence and machine learning.
Competitive Business Conditions
 
The industry of artificial intelligence and machine learning software is highly competitive. Well capitalized companies such as Amazon, Google, IBM and Microsoft are devoting significant resources and capital in developing customer products and solutions using this technology. Such companies have far greater resources than the Company. The Company believes, however, that it has assembled a group in India of highly qualified software and technology experts on a very cost-effective basis. The Company is also acquiring entities that have already established customer relationships, revenues and market niches that will enable the Company to leverage off such capabilities, and where appropriate, enhance its existing technology in the area of “Smart Surfaces” described below.
Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Segment
 
Artificial intelligence is the use of machines to do cognitive work such as problem solving, pattern matching and creating new patterns. Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence which refers to training a machine as opposed to simply programming it. Artificial intelligence has the potential to revolutionize nearly all aspects of business across sections and functions. Currently only a small percentage of organizations have deployed artificial intelligence but this is changing quickly. There is a high correlation between organizations that are far along in digitizing their information and those that are ready for products and solutions provided by artificial intelligence and machine learning providers. The Company has acquired and is developing significant product capabilities in this area.

Battery Segment
 
The Company believes that the design and functionality of its lithium Smart NanoBattery make it unique to the portable electronics battery market segment throughout the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019. To the best of our knowledge, there is no existing product that directly competes with the Smart NanoBattery in terms of its combination of small size and reserve design. As a reserve battery, the Smart NanoBattery remains dormant until it is activated on command. It does not self-discharge or die prior to its first activation, thereby offering extremely long shelf life prior to use as either a primary or backup battery in a device. Shelf life is projected to be in excess of twenty years.
 
There are numerous thin film batteries based on lithium metal, lithium ion and lithium polymer, as well as other chemistries, used in military devices, portable electronics, RFID tags and wireless sensor networks, that are similar in size to the Smart NanoBattery, often referred to as microbatteries. None of these designs is based on reserve battery architectures. Thin film batteries are manufactured by companies including Cymbet Corporation, Front Edge Technology, Infinite Power Solutions, ITN Energy Systems, Johnson Research and Development Company, KSW Microtec, Lithium Technology Corporation, MPower Solutions, Oak Ridge Micro-Energy, Power Paper, Solicore, VoltaFlex Corporation. Large companies such as Energizer, Ultralife, Varta and Proctor & Gamble are also involved with developing thin film batteries. Thin film battery markets are anticipated to grow substantially as the result of a wide expansion of portable devices in that time frame. With 3.5 billion cell phone users and 67 billion RFID tags per year, it is expected that there will be substantial commercial demand for thin film batteries.
 
Traditional reserve batteries are distinct from the mPhase Smart NanoBattery in terms of size and activation mechanism. The market for reserve batteries has largely been limited to the military for supplying power to munitions and other mission-critical electronic devices. The traditional reserve battery tends to be larger and certain types are built by hand and contain mechanical parts to activate the battery. The Smart NanoBattery relies on the phenomenon of electrowetting to initiate activation or a mechanical barrier that can be broken, in the case of the breakable barrier design. Traditional reserve batteries for military applications have been supplied by companies such as EaglePicher, Yardney and Storage Battery Systems, Inc. The Company believes that it may be able to significantly reduce the cost of its Smart Nanobattery with the recent discovery of the potential of “printing” the battery on a form of graphite rather than traditional silicon surface. The Company, through its working relationship with Stevens Institute, began in fiscal year 2012 to investigate the feasibility of the use of graphite which is much stronger, flexible and inexpensive than traditional silicon.
 
Outsourcing
 
Research and Development
 
The Company practices an outsourcing model whereby it contracts with third party vendors to perform research and development rather than performing the bulk of these functions internally. For current development of its SmartNano battery, the Company has outsourced the majority of the work. From February of 2004 through March of 2007, the Company engaged Lucent/Bell Labs (now Nokia) to develop, using the science of nanotechnology, micro power cell arrays creating a structure for zinc batteries that separated the chemicals or electrolytes prior to initial activation. This was done by suspending on nano grass or small spoke-like pieces of silicon a liquid electrolyte taking advantage of a superhydrophobic effect that occurs as a result of the ability to manipulate materials of a very small size or less than 1/50,000 the size of a human hair. The Company has, as a result of outsourcing, been able to have access to facilities, equipment and research capabilities that the Company would not be able to develop on its own given the financial resources and time that would be required to build or acquire such research capabilities. The Company has also been able to achieve key strategic alliances with the U.S. Army to successfully test, under military combat conditions, its SmartBattery design, leading to further validation of its path to product development under a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA). In addition, the Company has formed a relationship with Energy Storage Research Group, a center of excellence at Rutgers University, in New Jersey, that has enabled the Company to expand its battery development from a zinc to a lithium battery capable of delivering significantly more power. During fiscal years 2009 and 2010, the Company outsourced considerable foundry work for final development of the Smart NanoBattery to Silex, a Swedish company.

During the period from March of 2005 to April of 2007, the Company engaged the Bell Labs division of Lucent Technologies, Inc. to develop a magnetometer or electronic sensor also using the science of nanotechnology. Although the Company has, in order to conserve financial resources, currently suspended further development of its magnetometer product line, we believe that the intellectual property developed from the research to date could be resumed to develop viable military and industrial products depending upon future financial resources of the Company and future competitive market conditions.
 
Commencing in fiscal year ended June 30, 2013, the Company has limited product development of its Smart NanoBattery in order to conserve resources. The Company continues through the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, to protect its intellectual property with respect to the Smart NanoBattery through active management of its patent portfolio.
 
Patents and Licenses
 
The Company has filed and intend to file United States patents and/or copyright applications relating to some of our proposed products and technologies, either with our collaborators, strategic partners or on our own. There can be no assurance however, that any of the patents obtained will be adequate to protect our technologies or that we will have sufficient resources to enforce our patents.
 
Because we may license our technology and products in foreign markets, we may also seek foreign patent protection for some specific patents. With respect to foreign patents, the patent laws of other countries may differ significantly from those of the United States as to the patentability of our products or technology. In addition, it is possible that competitors in both the United States and foreign countries, many of which have substantially greater resources and have made substantial investments in competing technologies, may have applied for, or may in the future apply for and obtain, patents, which will have an adverse impact on our ability to make and sell our products. There can also be no assurance that competitors will not infringe on our patents or will not claim that we are infringing on their patents. Defense and prosecution of patent suits, even if successful, are both costly and time consuming. An adverse outcome in the defense of a patent suit could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require disputed rights to be licensed from third parties or require us to cease our operations.
 
The Company has intellectual property as follows:
