Our Business
ImmunityBio, Inc. is a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing next-generation therapies and vaccines that complement, harness, and amplify the immune system to defeat cancers and infectious diseases. We strive to be a vertically-integrated immunotherapy company designing and manufacturing our products so they are more effective, accessible, more conveniently stored, and more easily administered to patients. 
Our broad immunotherapy and cell therapy platforms are designed to attack cancer and infectious pathogens by activating both the innate immune system—natural killer (NK) cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages—and the adaptive immune system—B cells and T cells—in an orchestrated manner. The goal of this potentially best-in-class approach is to generate immunogenic cell death thereby eliminating rogue cells from the body whether they are cancerous or virally infected. Our ultimate goal is to employ this approach to establish an “immunological memory” that confers long-term benefit for the patient.
Our business is based on the foundation of multiple platforms that collectively act on the entire immune response with the goal of targeted, durable, coordinated, and safe immunity against disease. These platforms and their associated product candidates are designed to overcome the limitations of the current standards of care in oncology and infectious diseases, such as checkpoint inhibitors and antiretroviral therapies. Our portfolio includes:
Our platforms include 9 first-in-human therapeutic agents that are currently being studied in 26 clinical trials—17 of which are in Phase 2 or 3 development—across 12 indications in liquid and solid tumors, including bladder, pancreatic and lung cancers. These are among the most frequent and lethal cancer types for which there are high failure rates for existing standards of care or, in some cases, no available effective treatment. In infectious diseases, our pipeline currently targets such pathogens as the novel strain of the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). We believe SARS-CoV-2 currently lacks a vaccine that provides long-term protection against the virus, particularly its variants, while HIV affects tens of millions of people globally and currently has no known cure.
We believe that our innovative approach to orchestrate and combine therapies for optimal immune system response will become a therapeutic foundation across multiple clinical indications. Additionally, we believe that data from multiple clinical trials indicates N-803 has broad potential to enhance the activity of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), including checkpoint inhibitors (e.g., Keytruda), across a wide range of tumor types. N-803 is currently being studied in 21 clinical trials (both ImmunityBio and investigator-sponsored) across 12 indications. Although such designations may not lead to a faster development process or regulatory review and may not increase the likelihood that a product candidate will receive approval, Anktiva, ImmunityBio’s novel antibody cytokine fusion protein, has received Breakthrough Therapy and Fast Track designations from the FDA in combination with bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) for the treatment of patients with BCG-unresponsive non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) with carcinoma in situ (CIS) with or without Ta or T1 disease. In May 2022, we announced the submission of a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the FDA for our product candidate, Anktiva in combination with BCG for the treatment of patients with BCG-unresponsive NMIBC with CIS with or without Ta or T1 disease. In July 2022, we announced that the FDA had accepted our BLA for review and set a target Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) action date of May 23, 2023. It is unclear when the FDA will approve our BLA, if at all.
We have established Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) manufacturing capacity at scale with cutting-edge cell manufacturing expertise and ready-to-scale facilities, as well as extensive and seasoned research and development (R&D), clinical trial, and regulatory operations and development teams.
Our Strategy
We seek to become the leading global immunological therapeutics company by creating the next generation of immunotherapies to address serious unmet needs within oncology and infectious diseases. To achieve this goal, the key elements of our strategy include: 
•advancing the approval and commercialization of our lead antibody cytokine fusion protein, N-803, as an integral component of immunotherapy combinations, including those with checkpoint inhibitors;
•continuously scrutinizing our clinical pipeline and assessing our strategic priorities to maximize opportunities for regulatory approval and to meet unmet medical needs;
•accelerating our immunotherapy platform and product candidates with registrational intent to address difficult-to-treat oncological and infectious disease indications;
•continuing to prospect, license, and acquire technologies to complement and strengthen our platforms and product candidates, both as single agent and combination therapies, in order to activate and coordinate the innate and adaptive immune system to generate cellular memory against multiple tumor types and infectious diseases;
•optimizing investment in our discovery, development, and manufacturing capabilities for our next-generation targeted antibody cytokine fusion and recombinant proteins and vaccine candidates, as well as for cell therapies;
•advancing our formulations and delivery mechanisms to make our promising biotechnology product candidates available to the broadest population possible; and
•cultivating new and expanding existing collaborations for our multi-stage pipeline to efficiently scale globally.
Our Next-Generation Platforms
1.Antibody Cytokine Fusion Proteins
Antibody cytokine fusion proteins such as N-803 are a novel class of biopharmaceuticals that enhance the therapeutic potential of cytokines, and promote lymphocyte infiltration at a site of disease, improving immune response. N-803 is a novel interleukin-15 (IL-15) superagonist fusion protein consisting of high-affinity mutant IL-15N72D fused to the IL-15 receptor α sushi subunit and linked to the Fc portion of IgG1 Fc. The novel antibody cytokine fusion protein specifically increases the activity of two critical aspects of the immune system—NK cells and cytotoxic (tumor cell killing) CD8 T-cells—and exerts its effects via enhanced IL-2 receptor binding to the β site resulting in generation of Killer T cells and not the immunosuppressive regulatory T-cell (T-reg) cells. This superagonist IL-15 activity is the first in class to activate and proliferate NK cells, CD8+ Killer T cells, and Memory T cells. We believe this fusion protein combined with our natural killer cell therapy platform and our DNA/RNA vector delivery platforms places ImmunityBio at the leading edge to successfully deliver a cancer vaccine for durable complete responses across multiple tumor types. Although such designations may not lead to a faster development process or regulatory review and may not increase the likelihood that a product candidate will receive approval, Anktiva has received Breakthrough Therapy and Fast Track designations by the FDA for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC CIS with or without Ta or T1 disease as well as Fast Track designation for BCG-unresponsive NMIBC papillary and BCG-naïve NMIBC CIS. 
In May 2022, we announced the submission of a BLA to the FDA for our product candidate, Anktiva in combination with BCG for the treatment of patients with BCG-unresponsive NMIBC with CIS with or without Ta or T1 disease. In July 2022, we announced that the FDA had accepted our BLA for review and set a target PDUFA action date of May 23, 2023. It is unclear when the FDA will approve our BLA, if at all.
We believe that other N-803 indications with registration potential include BCG-unresponsive papillary bladder cancer, lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) in oncology and HIV in infectious diseases. 
N-803
In addition to N-803, we are developing bi-specific fusion proteins targeting CD20, PD-L1, IL-12, and TGF-ß to further enhance NK and T-cell activation directed to the infectious disease or tumor microenvironment, and to modulate the systemic and local immune response to accelerate immunogenic cell death. Prioritized product candidates in preclinical development include antibody cytokine fusion proteins N-820 (targeting CD20), N-809 (targeting PD-L1), N-812 (delivering IL-12 to necrotic tumor cells), and N-830 (delivering a TGF-ß Trap to necrotic tumor cells). 
2.DNA, RNA, and Recombinant Protein Vaccine Technologies
We have developed and acquired rights to multiple vaccine delivery technologies for infectious diseases to target key viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, and for oncology to deliver common tumor-associated antigens (TAAs), and neoepitopes (expressed only by cancer cells). These technologies can deliver DNA, self-amplifying RNA (saRNA), and subunit proteins to induce B- and T-cell memory due to the activation of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells along with antibody (humoral) responses. In SARS-CoV-2, we believe the focus on targeting a highly mutable S-protein and the associated antigenic drift with limited memory T-cell response is leading to a potential for emergence of resistance to the current generation of vaccines. A booster vaccine targeting the N protein, which is highly conserved in the coronavirus genus and is one of the most abundant structural proteins in virus-infected cells, could provide maximal immune protection against current and future COVID-19 variants such as Delta and Omicron and their associated sub-lineage variants of concern. In oncology, we are exploring the delivery of N-803 in combination with hAd5 TAAs like E6/E7, CEA, MUC1, Brachyury, and PSA, which we believe could yield immunological memory. Our key vaccine delivery technologies include:
a.Self-amplifying RNA 
Synthetic RNA technology has quickly emerged for prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines in part because it allows for rapid, scalable, and cell-free manufacturing as evidenced by the adoption of SARS-CoV-2 RNA vaccines. We believe our saRNA technology (licensed from the Access to Advanced Health Institute (AAHI) (formerly known as the Infectious Disease Research Institute, or IDRI), both directly and, in the case of SARS-CoV-2, through our joint venture formed with Amyris, Inc. (Amyris) in December 2021) represents a significant improvement over existing RNA technologies. Our saRNA constructs include a nanostructured lipid carrier (NLC) formulation important for thermal stability and facilitating the substitution of genetic sequences and have demonstrated an ability to vaccinate with multivalent strains. The self-replicating capability allows for increased potency by maintaining auto-replicative activity derived from the RNA virus vector, while the self-amplifying capability may increase the duration and breadth of immunity. Preclinical studies in small animal and non-human primate (NHP) models have shown that the saRNA delivery vehicle results in potent humoral and cell-based immunogenicity. Phase 1 first-in-human trials of saRNA for COVID-19 began in 2022 and continues in the first quarter of 2023. Results to date demonstrated limited adverse events of the saRNA S construct, and the trial is currently evaluating the safety and immunogenicity of our saRNA N construct in a similar dose escalation manner. Once Phase 1 is complete, the results will be used to inform the Phase 2 design for optimal immunogenicity.
b.Second-generation adenovirus hAd5 vector
Adenovirus is a well-established viral vector and can be utilized as a vaccine to stimulate the immune system. Our human adenovirus serotype 5 (hAd5) technology has unique deletions in the early 1, (E1), early 2 (E2b) and early 3 (E3) regions (hAd5 [E1-, E2b-, E3-]), which allows it to be effective in the presence of pre-existing adenovirus immunity and lowers the risk of generating de novo vector-directed immunity. We have developed several hAd5 product candidates, which have been studied in multiple clinical trials as potential vaccines for the treatment of infectious diseases and certain cancers. Importantly, these product candidates have shown an ability to overcome previous adenovirus immunity in preclinical models and in cancer patients.
In oncology, we are exploring the delivery of N-803 in combination with hAd5 TAAs like HPV E6/E7, CEA, MUC1, Brachyury, and PSA, which we believe could yield immunological memory.
c.Recombinant protein platforms
Our yeast vaccine platforms have been studied in both oncology and infectious diseases: 
(i)our Tarmogen platform (licensed from our subsidiary GlobeImmune, Inc. (GlobeImmune)) has been administered to over 400 patients with cancer or infectious diseases in FDA-regulated clinical trials. This platform technology consists of a heat-killed, recombinant S cerevisiae yeast-based vaccine engineered to express immunogens such as TAAs, pathogen antigens, and tumor-specific neoepitopes. Immunization with this platform elicits CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses capable of eliminating tumor cells or pathogen-infected cells. 
(ii)our pichia platform was used to produce RBD antigens (licensed from Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) (which was developed at the Texas Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development)), which, when combined with the 3M-052/Alum adjuvants and related technology (licensed from AAHI and 3M Company (3M) and affiliates), had been shown to provide protection against SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 (and variants of concern), and animal coronaviruses in preclinical models. 
3.Toll-Like Receptor Activating Adjuvants
Adjuvants are either synthetic or naturally occurring molecules that activate toll-like receptors (TLRs) thereby enhancing the humoral and cell-mediated immune response of vaccines. There are 10 human TLRs expressed either on the inside or outside of the immune cell and their function is to recognize foreign substances expressed by pathogens. Once activated, these TLRs stimulate danger signals to the immune cells initiating an immune response. We have licensed adjuvants and related technology from AAHI and 3M and its affiliates to incorporate with the vaccine delivery platforms described above and have access to multiple toll receptor activators, including TLR 4, TLR 7, and TLR 8. The synthetic imidazoquinolinone 3M-052 is structurally similar to resiquimod. The 3M-052/Alum adjuvant formulation is in Phase 1 trials in the U.S. with an HIV antigen and has been well-tolerated and immunogenic. 
4.NK Cell Therapy
ImmunityBio has one of the most comprehensive clinical-stage natural killer cell platforms, which has demonstrated the ability to induce cell death in cancers and virally-infected cells through a variety of concurrent mechanisms including innate killing, antibody-mediated killing, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-directed killing, and a combination of both antibody-mediated and CAR-directed killing. 
a.Off-the-shelf natural killer (NK) cells
Natural killer cells (NK cells) are a type of cytotoxic lymphocyte critical to the innate immune system. NK cells show spontaneous cytolytic activity against cells under stress such as tumor cells and virally-infected cells. After activation, NK cells also secrete several cytokines such as interferon-γ (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and chemokines that can modulate the function of other innate and adaptive immune cells. Cytotoxic cell lines (including our NK-92) have been established from patients with clonal NK-cell lymphoma. Those cells can be expanded in culture in the presence of cytokines (IL-2, IL-15). Our “off-the-shelf” NK cell platform has been molecularly engineered in a variety of ways to boost its killing capabilities against cancers and virally-infected cells. Unlike normal natural killer cells, our aNK cells do not express the key inhibitory receptors that diseased cells often exploit to turn off the killing function of NK cells and escape elimination. We have genetically engineered our aNK cell platform to overexpress high-affinity CD16 receptors that bind to antibodies. These antibody-targeted haNK cells are designed to directly bind to IgG1-type antibodies, such as avelumab, trastuzumab, cetuximab, and rituximab, with the intention of enhancing the cancer-killing efficacy of these antibodies by boosting the population of competent natural killer cells that can kill cancer cells through antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC).
Our most advanced line of off-the-shelf product candidates is an innovative, bioengineered combination that incorporates all the features of our haNK platform together with a CAR (t-haNK). Product candidates under this platform have three modes of killing: innate, antibody-mediated, and CAR-directed killing. These product candidates also include one or more additional expression elements such as functional cytokines, chemokines and trafficking factors. These product candidates are intended to be combined with commercially available therapeutic antibodies to effectively target either two different epitopes of the same cancer-specific protein or two entirely different cancer specific proteins. Trials studying our t-haNK product candidates were initiated—PD-L1 t-haNK in a Phase 1 trial in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), and a Phase 2 trial in pancreatic cancer—and CD19 t-haNK has been cleared to commence Phase 1 testing. 
In collaboration with the National Cancer Institute (NCI), our PD-L1 t-haNK was reported to be a potent cell therapy agent against myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and overcome T cell escape in multiple types of resistant tumors (Fabian et al 2020). Results of the QUILT 88 trial of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer reported at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) meeting in June 2022 and updated at ASCO GI in January 2023 showed a median overall survival of 6.3 months (95% CI: 5.0, 7.2 months) in patients who had progressed after two prior lines of therapy, more than doubling historical survival. 
We believe we have a pipeline of other prominent CARs for t-haNK, including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which is advancing through clinical-enabling studies, which will enable us to potentially address an even broader range of cancers as part of a chemotherapy-free combination regimen. 
b.Autologous and allogenic memory-like cytokine-enhanced NK cells (M-ceNK)
Memory-like cytokine-enhanced NK cells are a unique set of lymphocytes that differentiate after a brief pre-activation with interleukin-12 (IL-12), IL-15 and IL-18 and exhibit enhanced responses to cytokine re-stimulation that include enhanced IFN-γ production and cytotoxicity against leukemic cell lines. These cells have been isolated and characterized by their unique cell-surface marker profile and their highly desirable feature of immune-memory, marked by their pronounced anti-cancer activity for weeks to months in duration, which has made these cells a research focus for more than a decade. We have developed a unique ability to generate a portfolio of distinct M-ceNK cell products through the application of our proprietary technology and cytokines and our proprietary methods and overall expertise in scale manufacturing of NK cell-based products. A Phase 1 trial is open and actively enrolling patients in a first-in-human trial to study the M-ceNK platform in solid tumors (QUILT 3.076). 
5.Damage-Associated Molecular Patterns Inducers
DAMPs are released in response to cell stress and death, and elicit potent sterile inflammation. Recent evidence suggests that DAMPs may also have a key role in the development of cancer as well as in the host response to cytotoxic anti-tumor therapy. DAMPs may play a protective role by alerting the immune system to the existence of dying tumor cells, thereby triggering immunogenic tumor cell death. Albumin-bound immune modulators and tumor associated antigen regulators target delivery of the chemotherapy agent to the tumor microenvironment, activate tumor killing macrophages and/or enable a tumor suppressive microenvironment.
a.Aldoxorubicin
Aldoxorubicin is an albumin-associated anthracycline designed to target immune evasion in cancer. Aldoxorubicin has the same cytotoxic mechanism of action as doxorubicin, which is currently approved for use in 14 indications, including breast cancer, Hodgkin’s lymphoma and small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), but also has unique pharmacological properties resulting in lower cardiotoxicity as shown in Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials for soft tissue sarcoma previously conducted by LadRx Corporation (LadRx, formerly CytRx Corporation). LadRx out-licensed global development, manufacturing, and commercialization rights for aldoxorubicin to us in 2017. The investigative therapeutic is currently in a Phase 2 trial in metastatic pancreatic cancer (QUILT 88) of DAMP inducers combined with N-803 and PD-L1 t-haNK to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combination. 
b.Nanatinostat
VRx-3996 (nanatinostat), an orally available histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, is being developed by Viracta. Nanatinostat is selective for specific isoforms of Class I HDACs, which is key to inducing viral genes that are epigenetically silenced in Epstein-Barr virus-associated malignancies. In preclinical studies, nanatinostat has been shown to reactivate silenced transgenes in tumor cells thereby turning them into preferential targets for NK cell killing, while also serving to broadly stimulate a patient’s immune system, offering the potential for improved clinical responses in cancer patients. The activity of HDAC inhibitors are believed to be based on the upregulation of natural killer group 2D (NKG2D) ligand expression on cancer cells, which serve as “eat-me” signals for NK cells and can drive NK proliferation, activation and cancer cell killing. We entered into an agreement with Viracta under which we were granted exclusive worldwide rights in patents and know-how related to nanatinostat for use in combination with our platform of NK cell therapies.
Our Pipeline
Our platforms include 9 first-in-human therapeutic agents that are currently being studied in 26 clinical trials—17 of which are in Phase 2 or 3 development—across 12 indications in liquid and solid tumors, including bladder, pancreatic and lung cancers. These are among the most frequent and lethal cancer types for which there are high failure rates for existing standards of care or, in some cases, no available effective treatment. We are constantly monitoring and deciding which trials to initiate or continue based upon the availability of our resources and the efficacy and market developments of our, and our competitors’, products and product candidates, among other factors.
1.Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer
In the U.S., bladder cancer is the fourth most commonly-diagnosed solid malignancy in men and twelfth in women. The American Cancer Society estimates there will be 82,290 new cases and 16,710 deaths from bladder cancer in 2023. There is an urgent, unmet need to treat NMIBC and avoid radical cystectomy of the bladder in an attempt to control the disease. Although such designations may not lead to a faster development process or regulatory review and may not increase the likelihood that a product candidate will receive approval, Anktiva has received Breakthrough Therapy and Fast Track designations by the FDA for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC CIS (Cohort A) with or without Ta or T1 disease as well as Fast Track designation for BCG-unresponsive NMIBC papillary (Cohort B) and BCG-naïve NMIBC CIS. In our QUILT 3.032 trial, the company reported in November 2022, as published in NEJM Evidence, that the primary end points were met for both BCG-unresponsive NMIBC CIS with a complete response rate of 71%, and BCG-unresponsive NMIBC papillary with a 12-month disease-free rate of 55%. As presented at ASCO 2022, the combination of BCG plus Anktiva (as measured in BCG-unresponsive NMIBC patients, Cohorts A and B combined) was well-tolerated with 1% treatment-related serious adverse events, 0% immune-related serious adverse events, and 100% bladder cancer-specific overall survival at 24 months. Low-grade treatment-related adverse events include dysuria (22%), pollakiuria (20%), hematuria (17%), fatigue (16%), and urgency (12%), and all other treatment-related adverse events were seen at 7% or less. Seminal patents covering intravesical administration of BCG and Anktiva were issued providing term coverage until 2035.
BCG-Unresponsive CIS (QUILT 3.032)
In our Phase 2/3 open-label multi-center trial of BCG-unresponsive high grade NMIBC patients, the patients are receiving BCG plus Anktiva weekly for six consecutive weeks during induction. The patients also receive additional treatment including three weekly maintenance instillations every three months for up to 12 months and then at month 18. Patients with no disease or low-grade Ta disease at months 24, 30, and 36 are eligible for continued BCG plus Anktiva (Cohort A) or Anktiva alone (Cohort C) treatment (3 weekly instillations), at the principal investigators’ discretion. 
The primary endpoint of the BCG-unresponsive NMIBC CIS trial is a CR rate at any time equal to or greater than 30% and the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval must be greater than or equal to 20% for success. Complete response, or the disappearance of measurable disease in response to treatment, is evaluated at three months or six months following initial administration of BCG plus Anktiva (and every three months thereafter until 24 months). This endpoint would be achieved once at least 24 of the 80 patients in the trial achieve complete response.
All patients enrolled in Cohort A have been treated with the recommended number of full-strength doses of BCG on study during our trial. We have enrolled patients who have received a lower dosage of BCG therapy before enrollment in our trial as a result of BCG shortages. The mean and median number of prior BCG doses in Cohort A is 16.5 and 12.0, respectively, which are consistent with the FDA definition of BCG-unresponsive CIS. The FDA allowed our modification of the study design to allow enrollment of such patients, and definition of these patients may require further discussions with the FDA upon review. A published meta-analysis (Zeng 2015) of six relevant randomized controlled trials and two quasi-randomized controlled trials in NMIBC concluded that low-dose BCG instillation significantly reduces the incidence of overall side effects, especially severe and systemic symptoms in patients with NMIBC, while the oncological control efficacy of low-dose BCG is not inferior to standard-dose BCG. There can be no assurance that the FDA will agree with this conclusion.
A data cutoff occurred in January 2022, which provided a median follow-up in Cohort A of approximately 24 months. Data as published in NEJM Evidence in November 2022 showed a complete response in 58 of 82 patients with a 71% CR rate (95% CI: 59.6, 80.3) and a median duration of CR of 26.6 months (95% CI: 9.9, [upper bound not reached]). At 24 months in patients with complete response, the probability of avoiding cystectomy and disease-specific survival was 91.4% and 100%, respectively. Also at 24 months in all patients in Cohort A, the probability of avoiding cystectomy and of disease-specific survival was 84.1% and 100%, respectively.
In May 2022, we announced the submission of a BLA to the FDA for our product candidate, Anktiva in combination with BCG for the treatment of patients with BCG-unresponsive NMIBC with CIS with or without Ta or T1 disease. In July 2022, we announced that the FDA had accepted our BLA for review and set a target PDUFA action date of May 23, 2023. It is unclear when the FDA will approve our BLA, if at all.
BCG-Unresponsive Papillary (QUILT 3.032)
In our Phase 2, open-label multi-center trial of BCG-unresponsive high grade NMIBC papillary patients (Cohort B), the patients are receiving BCG plus N-803 weekly for six consecutive weeks during induction. The patients also receive additional treatment including three weekly maintenance instillations every three months for up to 12 months and then every nine months for up to 24 months. The primary endpoint of the trial is a 12-month disease free rate greater than or equal to 30% and the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval must be greater than or equal to 20% for success. To meet the primary endpoint, 24 out of 80 patients must be disease free at 12 months. 
A data cutoff occurred in January 2022, which provided a median follow-up in Cohort B of approximately 21 months. Data as published in NEJM Evidence in November 2022 showed a 12-month disease-free survival rate of 55% (95% CI: 42.0, 66.8), with median disease-free survival of 19.3 months (95% CI: 7.4, [upper bound not reached]). At the cutoff date 67 of 72 patients, 93.1%, had not progressed to radical cystectomy and the 24 month disease-free survival rate was 97.7%. 
We met with the FDA in December 2022, and the FDA advised us to conduct a randomized trial in localized BCG-unresponsive NMIBC papillary disease.
BCG-Naïve (QUILT 2.005)
As discussed above, N-803 has been awarded Fast Track designation by the FDA for the treatment of BCG-naïve NMIBC CIS. We are currently enrolling patients in our Phase 2b blinded, randomized, two-cohort, open-label, multi-center trial of intravesical BCG plus Anktiva versus BCG alone, in BCG naïve patients with high-grade NMIBC CIS (Cohort A) and NMIBC papillary (Cohort B). Planned enrollment for Cohort A (CIS) and Cohort B (papillary) is 366 patients and 230 patients, respectively.
2.Lung Cancer 
According to the American Cancer Society, lung cancer is the second most common cancer in the U.S. In 2023, it is estimated that 238,340 new cases of lung cancer will be diagnosed in the U.S. and 127,070 deaths will be attributed to the disease. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for about 80% to 85% of all lung cancers diagnoses and there are very few successful treatment options for these patients once the cancer spreads beyond the lungs. The development of checkpoint inhibitors in NSCLC has been revolutionary, doubling the median overall survival in some settings; however, patient response may be short lived, due to late response and/or progression after achieving an initial response. As with bladder cancer, N-803 enhances the proliferation and activation of NK and T cells critical for targeting and killing lung cancer cells. There is therefore a strong rationale to evaluate N-803 in addition to an anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor for patients with NSCLC who have relapsed after achieving an initial response to PD-1 or PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor therapy. 
Analysis of pooled data from a Phase 1/2 trial conducted from January 2016 to June 2017 in 23 patients, and a subsequent investigator-initiated Phase 2 trial conducted by the Medical University of South Carolina, yielded confirmation of activity of the combination of checkpoint inhibitors and N-803 in relapsed NSCLC. In 15 patients with PD-L1 greater than 50%, the overall response rate was 38% and the median overall survival rate was 17.1 months. These preliminary findings were favorable relative to the historical response rate seen in this patient population in the first-line setting with checkpoint inhibitor therapy. 
On the basis of these findings, we initiated a single-arm Phase 2b multi-cohort basket trial (QUILT 3.055) of N-803 and checkpoint inhibitor combinations in patients who have previously received treatment with PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors per an FDA-approved indication. Patients enrolled in this trial were eligible if actively progressing on checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Upon enrollment, patients continued on the same checkpoint inhibitor but with the addition of N-803. Despite progressing on checkpoint inhibitor therapy upon entry into the trial, the majority of patients reverted to stable disease and demonstrated durability of stable disease, some extending as long as nine months. Data presented at the ASCO Annual Meeting in 2021 showed that despite the patients’ prior progression on checkpoint inhibitor therapy alone, upon entry into the trial the majority of patients experienced clinical benefit either as stable disease (49%) or a partial response (9%). 
Among 140 patients enrolled in QUILT 3.055, the common N-803 attributed grade 1 and 2 adverse events included: injection site reaction (71%), chills (34%), fatigue (27%), pyrexia (24%), flu-like illness (13%), and decreased appetite (10%). A total of 18 grade 3 and 4 adverse events attributed to N-803 have been reported among 16 patients (12%) in the trial as of February 2021. All reported grade 3 and 4 adverse events occurred at a frequency of 5% or less; two patients reported increased alanine amino transferase, increased aspartate amino transferase or increased blood alkaline phosphatase, anemia, injection-site reaction or injection-site pain. All other occurrences of grade 3 or 4 adverse events that the clinical trial site investigators reported as suspected as being due to N-803 include: decreased lymphocyte count; weight loss; influenza-like illness; injection site pruritus; cellulitis; injection-site cellulitis; sepsis; deep vein thrombosis; hypovolemic shock; colitis; diarrhea; delirium; respiratory failure; and maculopapular rash. Although further studies are warranted, based on this relatively well-tolerated adverse event profile, coupled with NK and CD8+ T cell stimulatory effects, we believe that N-803 has the potential to become a standard in combination with other immunotherapies for multiple indications.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (Lung-Map)
In October 2021, we announced that N-803 had been chosen by Lung Cancer Master Protocol (Lung-MAP), a public-private partnership—which includes the NCI, the National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN) Cooperative Groups (SWOG, ECOG-ACRIN, Alliance, and NRG), Friends of Cancer Research, and the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health (FNIH)—to study N-803 in the Lung-MAP trial. 
The trial design is a randomized comparison of N-803 in combination with Keytruda® (pembrolizumab) compared to standard of care chemotherapy options in two separate cohorts:
•Primary Resistance (Cohort 1). Disease progression during or after anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy that occurred less than or equal to (≤) 84 days following initiation (Cycle 1 Day 1) of anti-PD-1 or PD-L1 therapy (combination or monotherapy).
•Acquired Resistance (Cohort 2). Disease progression during or after anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy that occurred more than (>) 84 days following initiation (Cycle 1 Day 1) of anti-PD-1 or PD-L1 therapy (combination or monotherapy).
The trial will include up to 478 second-line patients with tumors that are not targetable with a drug, which accounts for the majority of NSCLC cases. In April 2022, we announced that the first participants had been enrolled in the trial. 
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (QUILT 2.023)
On the basis of earlier trials in NSCLC, and our belief that N-803 enhances the proliferation and activation of NK and T cells, we enrolled patients in a randomized Phase 3 trial to evaluate N-803 plus checkpoint inhibitor combinations versus other checkpoint inhibitor combinations in the first-line setting for NSCLC in the cohorts described below:
•Immunotherapy for either squamous or non-squamous NSCLC with PD-L1 TPS >1% (Cohort A). Combination of N-803 with Keytruda versus Keytruda as the standard of care control arm in this randomized trial.
•Chemoimmunotherapy for squamous NSCLC (Cohort B). Combination of N-803 with Carboplatin, Abraxane® and Keytruda versus Carboplatin, Abraxane / paclitaxel and Keytruda as the standard of care control arm in this randomized trial.
•Chemoimmunotherapy for non-squamous NSCLC (Cohort C). Combination of N-803 with Cisplatin / Carboplatin, Keytruda and Pemetrexed versus Cisplatin / Carboplatin, Keytruda and Pemetrexed as the standard of care control arm in this randomized trial.
The trial is currently ongoing.
3.Pancreatic Cancer 
According to ASCO, in the U.S. pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death in both men and women and has one of the highest mortality rates of all major cancers, taking nearly 50,000 lives every year, with a five-year survival rate for late-stage cases of only 3%. 
Advanced Pancreatic Cancer (QUILT 88)
Exploratory Phase 1b/2 trials in patients with second-line or greater metastatic pancreatic cancer in which N-803 and aldoxorubicin were combined with off-the-shelf NK (haNK) cells, other agents, and stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) showed encouraging results in patients with advanced disease. The primary endpoints of the Phase 1b and 2 portions of the trials were safety and objective response rate, respectively. In aggregate, 82% of patients (14/17) with advanced pancreatic cancer achieved disease control following combination therapy including N-803 and aldoxorubicin. There were no N-803-related grade 3 or 4 adverse events reported. 
On the basis of these exploratory trials, together with the preclinical findings that PD-L1 t-haNK is as active as haNK + anti-PD-L1 mAbs, we initiated a first- through third-line pancreatic cancer clinical trial that uses PD-L1 t-haNK as described below.
•First-line advanced pancreatic cancer (Cohort A). Combination of N-803 with aldoxorubicin and low-dose chemotherapy plus SBRT with or without PD-L1 t-haNK versus gemcitabine/Abraxane® as the standard of care control arm in this randomized trial.
•Second-line advanced pancreatic cancer (Cohort B). Combination of N-803 with aldoxorubicin and low-dose chemotherapy plus SBRT + PD-L1 t-haNK versus 5FU/Onivyde® as the standard of care control arm in this randomized trial.
•Third-line and beyond (Cohort C). Combination of N-803 with aldoxorubicin and low-dose chemotherapy plus SBRT + PD-L1 t-haNK in a single arm cohort of this trial with a primary endpoint of overall survival. 
On October 13, 2021, we announced that the trial’s Cohort C was fully enrolled. Based on the strength of earlier data and the significant unmet medical need, we submitted an amendment to the FDA to increase enrollment in Cohort C. As of January 2023 as reported at ASCO GI, the median overall survival in this highly advanced group of patients (who failed two to six prior lines of treatment) is 5.8 months (95% CI: 4.9, 6.4 months) exceeding the approximately two- to three-month historical median overall survival. Of the 83 patients, 41 (49.4%) had progressed after two prior lines of therapy. Median overall survival in this group was 6.3 months (95% CI: 5.0, 7.2 months), more than doubling the historical overall survival (survival of three months as reported by Manax et al ASCO GI 2019). In Cohort C, grade 3 or greater treatment-related adverse events included anemia (32%), neutropenia (25%), thrombocytopenia (13%) and fatigue (7%) while all other grade 3 or greater treatment-related adverse events occurred at a frequency of less than 5%.
We met with the FDA in December 2022 to obtain guidance toward a registration pathway in metastatic pancreatic cancer with combination immunotherapy and NK cell therapy, and the FDA advised us to conduct a randomized trial in late-stage metastatic pancreatic cancer.
4.Glioblastoma Multiforme 
According to the American Association of Neurological Surgeons, GBM is the most common malignant brain tumor accounting for approximately 48% of all primary brain tumors with a low survival rate of approximately 40% in the first year after diagnosis and only 17% in the second year. In preclinical settings, we evaluated the preclinical activity of N-803 in a murine GL261-luc glioblastoma model. We showed that N-803, as a single-agent treatment as well as in combination with an anti-PD-1 antibody or stereotactic radiosurgery, exhibits a robust antitumor immune response resulting in prolonged survival including complete remission in tumor bearing mice. N-803-treated mice had decreased tumor volume and increased median survival compared to control. In addition, N-803 treatment resulted in long-term immune memory against glioblastoma tumor rechallenge. 
A new randomized, multi-center, Phase 3 trial is currently being developed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combinations of N-803, PD-L1 t-haNK and bevacizumab in patients with recurrent or progressive GBM. A pilot phase will evaluate the safety of this combination prior to the randomized Phase 3 portion versus bevacizumab monotherapy as the current standard of care. 
•Pilot (Part A). Enrollment will initiate with a single-arm study of 10 patients to receive N-803, PD-L1 t-haNK, and bevacizumab combination therapy. Continued development of the experimental arm in Part B will be based on the overall risk/benefit of the combined treatment regimen observed in Part A.
•Randomized Comparison of Combination Therapy versus Bevacizumab Monotherapy (Part B). Part B will enroll 336 patients to be randomly assigned (1:1) to the experimental arm or to the control arm. 
5.Human Papillomavirus-Associated Tumors 
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, every year about 19,400 women and 12,100 men experience cancers caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV), which is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the U.S. According to ASCO, head and neck cancers account for nearly 4% of all cancers in the U.S. It is estimated that more than 66,470 men and women in the U.S. will be diagnosed with head and neck cancers in 2023, and 15,050 will die from the disease. 
HPV Associated Cancer in Lower Genitourinary, Cervical, and Head & Neck
Backed by data from preclinical animal models, we are exploring IBRX-042 that leverages our hAd5-based vaccine platform to target tumors caused by HPV infection (which includes most types of lower genitourinary (GU), cervical, and some types of head/neck cancers). Our second-generation hAd5 vector includes enhancements with the E1, E2b, E3 regions of the hAd5 deleted (E1-, E2b-, E3-), decreasing the risk for vector-directed immune responses that may reduce efficacy, while maintaining high target antigen production. The platform has previously been used to generate vaccines against TAAs such as CEA, MUC1 and Brachyury. In IBRX-042, hAd5 encodes HPV-16 E6 and E7 tumor-associated proteins (oncotarget antigens). E6 and E7 play a role in early infection and, importantly, transformation of cells into rapidly-dividing tumor cells. Specifically, E6 promotes degradation of p53—a factor that typically prevents excess cell division—indirectly activates telomerase, and disrupts the function of the cellular phosphatase tumor suppressor PTPN13. E7 inactivates pRb (which plays a role similar to the p53) and activates Mi2b and is also implicated in transformation. Together, these oncogenic alterations drive rapid cellular proliferation, suppress or downregulate key tumor suppressor proteins, and lead to cellular immortality. In addition, E6 and E7 expression is required to maintain a malignant transformed phenotype. IBRX-042 has demonstrated the ability to induce immune responses against HPV16 antigens that induced significant anti-tumor effects in vivo in HPV+ mouse models. To support clinical studies, we have successfully completed the GMP production of GMP IBRX-042.
We are planning a Phase 1/2 open-label trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of subcutaneous IBRX-042 vaccination combined with N-803 (to enhance immune responses) in combination with standard of care in patients with HPV-associated tumors. 
6.Solid Tumors
Autologous M-ceNK in Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors (QUILT 3.076)
An initial study conducted by the NCI showed that N-803-enhanced NK cell anti-tumor activity against all variants of small-cell lung cancer (Fousek 2022). Based on this data and other preclinical analysis, we initiated a two-part, open-label Phase 1 trial to evaluate safety and preliminary efficacy of cryopreserved M-ceNK cells, in combination with N-803 for subcutaneous administration, in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. The trial will compare the quantity and quality of the M-ceNK cells collected and manufactured from newly diagnosed patients who have not received prior treatment or who have received prior first-line treatment (prior to the M-ceNK cells collected and manufactured) to the quantity and quality of the M-ceNK cells collected and manufactured from patients who have progressive disease and who have received at least two prior treatments for their cancer. The trial consists of two cohorts and there will be up to 80 participants total with up to 30 enrolled in Cohort 1 and up to 50 enrolled in Cohort 2. 
•Newly diagnosed or no more than one line of treatment (Cohort 1). Includes patients with newly diagnosed high-risk solid tumors who have not received prior treatment for high-risk tumors or who have received prior first-line treatment. Patients in Cohort 1 will participate in apheresis collection of lymphocytes (Part A) and will not receive any investigational therapy unless they subsequently enroll in Cohort 2 (Part B) if they have progressive disease after ≥ 2 prior therapies or if they have progressive disease within 12 months of receiving neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy. They must also meet the inclusion criteria to participate in the treatment phase (Part B).
•Progressive disease with at least two prior lines of treatment (Cohort 2). Includes patients with r/r solid tumors who have progressive disease after receiving at least two prior therapies. 
◦Apheresis collection (Part A). Patients in Cohort 2 will undergo an apheresis collection of lymphocytes prior to receiving four weeks of disease-specific therapy per their oncologists’ recommendations. 
◦Treatment with M-ceNK and N-803 (Part B). If an adequate number of M-ceNK cells can be manufactured from the autologous apheresis product and the patients are eligible to participate in the treatment phase (Part B), M-ceNK will be infused in combination with subcutaneous N-803 on monthly repeatable cycles, subject to adequate doses of M-ceNK being available.
7.Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
According to the American Cancer Society, in 2023 it is estimated that 80,550 people will be diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in the U.S. and 20,180 deaths will be attributed to the disease. A Phase 1 trial evaluating N-803 in combination with rituximab, an anti-CD20 mAb therapy, in patients with indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (iNHL), who had relapsed or were refractory after two lines of therapy, was published in the American Association for Cancer Research journal, Clinical Cancer Research, in 2021. The combination regimen of N-803 and Rituxan® was well tolerated with a single reported grade 4 adverse event and no reported grade 5 adverse events. For patients with anti-CD20 mAb sensitive disease, the overall response rate in the SQ cohort was 78% (7 of 9) with 7 of 7 (100%) responses in the SQ cohorts were complete remissions (CRs).
Most B-cell malignancies express high levels of CD19, including the majority of NHLs, such as diffuse large B Cell lymphoma (DLBCL), follicular lymphoma (FL), and mantle cell lymphoma. In addition, many leukemias express high levels of CD19, including B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and hairy cell leukemia. As such, two CD19‑directed CAR-T cell therapeutics are FDA-approved for use in a variety of indications including NHL and ALL. Like T cells, NK cells can be genetically modified to express CARs that recognize tumor‑associated cell-surface antigens and mediate specific recognition and lysis of cancer cells. A number of aNK cell lines that express CARs have been developed and importantly, aNK cells engineered with CARs targeting CD19 and CD20 have shown to be effective against in vitro/in vivo models of lymphoblastic leukemia and lymphoma (Boissel 2013, Muller 2008, Romanski 2016). Derived from aNK, the haNK cell line is engineered to express the high-affinity variant of the Fcγ receptor (FcγRIIIa/CD16a 158V) as well as endoplasmic reticulum-retained IL-2, and has demonstrated enhanced ADCC-mediated antitumor activity (Jochems 2016). The CD19 t-haNK cell line combines the engineered enhancements of haNK cells with the expression of a CAR targeting CD19, and thus has potential to demonstrate robust ADCC antitumor activity against cancerous B cells and provide clinical benefit to patients with r/r NHL. 
Relapsed/Refractory Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (QUILT 3.092)
We are currently developing an open-label, Phase 1, first-in-human, open-label trial to study the safety of CD19 t-haNK as a single agent and the safety and preliminary efficacy of CD19 t-haNK in combination rituximab only (Cohort A) and in combination with N-803 and rituximab (Cohort B) in patients with r/r NHL.
8.Other Oncology Indications
In addition to the trials listed above, we are exploring or pursuing several other both company-sponsored and investigator-initiated studies of our product candidates including in colon cancer (N-803, hAd5 CEA), prostate cancer (N-803, hAd5 PSA), Lynch Syndrome (N-803, hAd5 CEA, hAd5 MUC1, hAd5 Brachyury), and head and neck cancer (N-803, hAd5 CEA, hAd5 MUC1, hAd5 Brachyury) among others.
1.SARS-CoV-2
Since the inception of the pandemic, we have believed that a highly mutable S-only focused, antibody-based vaccine approach that could require boosters approximately every six months, would prove insufficient to overcome viral evolution. We have believed T cell response is critical to clearing the virus and long-term immunity and so our focus is on vaccine candidates that also target the more highly conserved N protein. With mass adoption of first-generation S-only vaccines, our data from our prior NHP Challenge Study and early trials have formed the basis of our design of a universal T cell boost vaccine candidate and the associated set of trials currently underway in South Africa.
THEMBA saRNA Vaccine Boost—South Africa (COVID 4.015)
The THEMBA trials are the first studies of our joint venture saRNA technology with next-generation NLCs. In South Africa in 2022, we initiated a Phase 1/2 trial assessing the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of saRNA-based vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 as boost vaccines in participants that have been previously vaccinated against or previously infected with COVID-19. We are testing both an saRNA S and saRNA N construct. The Phase 1 portion of the trial is ongoing in the first quarter of 2023. The Phase 1 trial, for up to 60 previously vaccinated/infected participants, will be enrolled as 6 separate cohorts to receive a single vaccine boost consisting of different doses of either saRNA encoding the Spike protein (AAHI-SC2 vaccine) or saRNA encoding the nucleocapsid protein (AAHI-SC3 vaccine) delivered by NLC. We expect the Phase 2 trial, of up to 120 previously vaccinated/infected additional participants, to be enrolled with a randomized 1:1:1:1 design to receive Janssen, Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines (control arm), the AAHI-SC2 vaccine (experimental arm 1), or the AHHI-SC3 (experimental arms 2 and 3). 
2.HIV 
HIV affects tens of millions of people globally and currently has no known cure. One current strategy for curing HIV is known as the “kick and kill” approach. The “kick” is to induce HIV out of its latent resting state in T cells and the “kill” is to remove or kill the infected cells via an immune response or immunotherapy. We believe N-803 is a molecule capable of both “kick and kill” in this strategy because of its ability to activate viral transcription in CD4+ T cells (“kick”) while strongly activating CD8+ effector memory cells and NK cells important for recognizing and killing HIV infected cells (“kill”), as well as directing these cells to sites of viral reservoirs. 
HIV Cure Study
In June 2021, we announced the opening of a study sponsored by the AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) and the NIAID (the “HIV Cure Study”) that will evaluate whether N-803 alone or together with broadly neutralizing antibodies can control HIV following interruption of antiretroviral therapy (ART). The Phase 1 open-label, randomized trial will enroll 46 people living with HIV whose virus has been suppressed by ART for approximately two years, including at least 30% cisgender women or transgender men. 
Thai Red Cross and the U.S. Military HIV Research Program
In April 2021, we announced the launch of a Phase 2 trial sponsored by the Thai Red Cross and the U.S. Military HIV Research Program. The trial is enrolling 15 patients and is designed to investigate the safety, tolerability and immunostimulatory effects of administering N-803 during acute HIV infection. N-803 will be administered subcutaneously at weeks zero, three and six (for a total of three doses) and will be initiated together with antiretroviral therapy in order to determine if the immunostimulatory effects of N-803 will reduce the amount of HIV present during acute infection. The trial duration for individual participants will be approximately 12 weeks. It is hypothesized that N-803 initiated with anti-retroviral therapy during acute HIV infection will not result in complications or additional toxicities compared with anti-retroviral therapy alone, and may result in a reduced viral load in these patients by inhibiting early establishment of HIV reservoirs in infected individuals. 
NIAID University of Minnesota Trial
A Phase 1b, non-randomized, open-label clinical trial sponsored by the University of Minnesota in collaboration with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) investigated the effect of N-803 on B cell follicles in antiretroviral treated HIV disease. This trial included 10 HIV-infected adults on effective antiretroviral therapy who received N-803 to intensively investigate the immunological effects of treatment. The hypothesis is that in HIV-infected subjects treated with N-803, CD8+ T cells will migrate to and increase in number in B cell follicles that will result in a reduction in the frequency of cells with an inducible HIV provirus. The trial is in data analysis mode with all subjects having completed the trial.
In addition to the studies and trials listed above, we are exploring an additional HIV trial with our Thai and U.S. Military collaborators using N-803 plus broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) and HIV vaccines. 
Our Large-Scale GMP Biologic Manufacturing Capabilities
ImmunityBio has adopted a strategic position to be vertically integrated and develop its products according to the FDA’s GMP standards for large-scale manufacturing, even during Phase 2 clinical trial development. Biological upstream and downstream manufacturing capabilities, with its attendant know-how and regulatory compliance for approval, have long lead times. We have adopted an approach for preparedness to provide our vaccine, immunotherapy and cell therapy products at a global scale. As such, we have established our own plants and have access to facilities on a global basis.
Our ability to create an efficient manufacturing process and supply chain will be important in enabling us to develop novel therapies. Our strategy is to anticipate the needs of our early-stage research and development initiatives for preclinical and eventual clinical product candidates with a focus on rapid capability to produce at scale fusion proteins, hAd5, saRNA, subunit protein, toll receptor activator, and NK cell products. In addition, our pipeline for development of synthetic small molecules and immunomodulatory peptides uses innovative technology to derive new therapies. We believe members of our management team, many of whom have experience in both nanoparticle commercialization and large-scale injectable drug production, are capable of constructing the processes and commissioning the facilities necessary to meet our development and commercialization goals. For well-known processes, we currently work, and plan to continue working, with established contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs) to produce drug substance and drug products. In addition, we plan to further enhance our in-house manufacturing capabilities for drug substances, drug products, and labeling and packaging. 
Overview of our Manufacturing Model 
Our manufacturing capabilities include advanced technology facilities to produce and test various drug substances and drug products. Our experienced operations and quality team focuses on internal manufacturing and testing with a constant endeavor to create robust, high quality, efficient and consistent supply that meets target product profiles. Our Phase 1 manufacturing process is designed to seamlessly scale-up through all phases of clinical development to commercial manufacturing to drive successful commercialization.
Commercial cGMP Production
For our N-803 product candidate, we have contracted with a multi-national biologics manufacturer with multiple cGMP-compliant facilities in the U.S., Europe and Asia for our current clinical trials and future commercial sales, if approved. The facilities have robust process development and validation and quality oversight with high-capacity production suites operating multiple 2,000-20,000L production bioreactors. 
Clinical Trial GMP Antibody and Fusion Protein Production 
We are establishing a cGMP-compliant multi-platform facility in California, which includes a large space for the production of antibodies and fusion proteins (including N-803) to treat cancers and infectious diseases. This facility will include fully integrated biologic upstream and downstream production suites and a quality assurance/quality control release laboratory for high-capacity antibody and fusion protein production.
Clinical Trial GMP saRNA, Adenovirus, and Yeast Production
We have established other cGMP-compliant facilities for saRNA, adenovirus, and yeast production in multiple sites in California and a site in Colorado for oncology and infectious diseases. One of our sites in California is dedicated to adenovirus product candidates for the production of vaccine candidates to treat infectious diseases and oncology TAAs. These facilities generally have fully-integrated biologic upstream and downstream production suites and quality assurance/quality control release laboratories for high capacity, continuous, or personalized just-in-time vaccine production.
Clinical Trial GMP NK Cell Therapy Production
We have established other cGMP-compliant facilities for NK cell therapy product production in multiple sites in California for oncology. One of our sites in California is dedicated to our off-the-shelf product candidates (including PD-L1 t‑haNK), while another is primarily focused on our M-ceNK product candidates, including a training lab for our second-generation offerings.
cGMP ISO Class 5 Manufacturing Facility
On February 14, 2022, we acquired a leasehold interest in approximately 409,000 rentable square feet of cGMP ISO Class 5 pharmaceutical manufacturing space in western New York (the Dunkirk Facility). In September 2022, we initiated a workforce reduction at the Dunkirk Facility as a result of upcoming construction at the project, which we believe may take approximately 12 to 18 months. We believe this facility will provide us with a state-of-the-art biotech production center that will substantially expand and diversify our existing manufacturing capacity in the U.S. and the ability to scale production across all of our key platforms. 
Manufacture of Platform Product Candidates
ImmunityBio’s diverse product candidate portfolio and pipeline requires a broad knowledge of various manufacturing and quality assurance methods. We have invested heavily in the processes, systems and technology to build an extensive range of manufacturing programs spanning various levels of development from IND-enablement through BLA preparation of our first commercial product.
We believe our plan to selectively use CMOs for certain of our assets at various stages, coupled with internal development, will give us assurance that any products will have backup manufacturing options.
Competition
We face potential competition from many different sources, including major and specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic research institutions, governmental agencies, and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with current therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. We believe that the key competitive factors affecting the success of any of our product candidates will include safety profile, efficacy, convenience, cost, market access, level of promotional activity devoted to them, competitive intensity, and intellectual property protection.
We have focused our efforts on oncological and infectious disease indications that are difficult to treat and with large unmet needs, and we believe our platform will be broadly applicable across multiple tumor types and infections. Based on the breadth and depth of our platforms, we believe our competitors will range from large pharmaceutical companies to emerging novel biotechnology companies. 
Oncology
•Antibody Cytokine Fusion and Recombinant Proteins. This platform primarily competes with large pharmaceutical companies marketing checkpoint inhibitors. However, the potential exists for some of these large pharmaceutical companies to seek collaboration for combination of N-803 with their marketed checkpoint inhibitor.

In addition, a very large number of companies, government agencies and academic centers around the world are developing or have developed COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics. In the HIV space, we have product candidates that use N-803 that will likely compete with companies who have approved therapeutics for HIV, including Abbott Laboratories Inc., BMS, Gilead, and GSK.
Intellectual Property
We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are commercially important to our business, including seeking, maintaining, and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing patent applications in the U.S. and in jurisdictions outside of the U.S. related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements, and product candidates that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trade secrets and know-how relating to our proprietary technology and product candidates, continuing innovation, and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen, and maintain our proprietary position in the field of cancer therapeutics and immunotherapy. We expect to rely on data exclusivity, market exclusivity, patent term adjustment and patent term extensions when available, as well as on regulatory protection afforded through orphan drug designations. Our commercial success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for our product candidates, technology, inventions, and improvements; to preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; to maintain our licenses to use intellectual property owned by third parties; to defend and enforce our proprietary rights, including our patents; and to operate without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties.
We have developed, acquired, and in-licensed patents and patent applications across platforms as previously described for: (1) activated NK and T cells; (2) memory T cell activation; and (3) activated tumoricidal macrophages. With respect to activated NK and T cells, we have developed N-803, an N72D variant IL-15 complexed to a dimeric IL-15Ra/Fc fusion protein; with respect to memory T cell activation, we have developed adenoviral and yeast immunotherapies expressing tumor antigens such as CEA, MUC1, and Brachyury, and in-licensed saRNA technologies; and with respect to activated tumoricidal macrophages, we have in-licensed intellectual property licensed to aldoxorubicin, a tumor-targeted doxorubicin conjugate, from LadRx.
We own patents and patent applications related to the development and commercialization of N-803.

For example, these patents and patent applications include claims directed to methods, bioreactors, and apparatuses for monitoring and culturing cells.
The term of individual patents extend for varying periods of time, depending upon the date of filing of the patent application, the date of patent issuance, and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, patents issued for applications filed in the U.S. are effective for 20 years from the earliest effective filing date of a non-provisional patent application. The patent term may be adjusted to compensate for delayed patent issuance, when such delays are caused by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) or successful appeals against USPTO actions. There is no statutory limit on this patent term adjustment, which is generally the length of any such delays caused by the USPTO. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period. The restoration period cannot be longer than five years, the total patent term, including the restoration period, must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval, only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it, or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. While we plan to seek such patent term adjustments and extensions where applicable, there is no guarantee that the USPTO and/or FDA will agree with our assessment of whether such adjustments or extensions should be granted, and if granted, the length of such adjustments or extensions. The duration of patents outside of the U.S. varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product and country-to-country basis and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country, and the validity and enforceability of the patent. 
The patent positions of companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. No consistent policy regarding the scope of claims allowable in patents in the field of immunotherapy has emerged in the U.S. The patent situation outside of the U.S. is even more uncertain. Changes in either the patent laws or their interpretation in the U.S. and other countries may diminish our ability to protect our inventions and enforce our intellectual property rights, and more generally could affect the value of our intellectual property. In particular, our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell, or importing products that infringe our intellectual property will depend in part on our success in obtaining and enforcing patent claims that cover our technology, inventions, and improvements. With respect to both licensed and owned intellectual property, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any current pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed in the future, nor can we be sure that any existing patents or any patents that may be granted in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our product candidates and the methods used to manufacture those product candidates. Moreover, even our issued patents do not guarantee us the right to practice our technology in relation to the commercialization of our product candidates. The area of patent and other intellectual property rights in biotechnology is an evolving one with many risks and uncertainties, and third parties may have blocking patents that could be used to prevent us from commercializing our product candidates and practicing our technology. Our issued patents and those that may issue in the future may be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related products or limit the length of the term of patent protection that we may have for our product candidates. In addition, the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies. For these reasons, we may have competition for our product candidates. Moreover, because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product candidate, it is possible that, before any particular product candidate can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of the patent.
Our registered trademark portfolio currently contains approximately 16 registered trademarks in the U.S., approximately 119 registered trademarks in foreign jurisdictions, approximately 29 pending trademark applications in the U.S., and approximately 52 pending trademark applications in foreign jurisdictions. We may also rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We seek to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with those who have access to our confidential information, including our employees, contractors, consultants, collaborators, and advisors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our proprietary technology and processes by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. Although we have confidence in these individuals, organizations, and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or may be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our employees, contractors, consultants, collaborators, or advisors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. For risks related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements and products, see Part I, Item 1A., “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property” and Item 3., “Legal Proceedings” of this Annual Report.
Collaboration and License Agreements
We anticipate that strategic collaborations will continue to be an integral part of our operations, providing opportunities to leverage our partners’ expertise and capabilities to gain access to new technologies and further expand the potential of our technologies and product candidates across relevant platforms. We believe we are well positioned to become a leader in immunotherapy due to our broad and vertically-integrated platforms and through complementary strategic partnerships. Agreements shown below have been arranged in alphabetical order.
The following description of certain of our collaboration and license agreements is not a comprehensive listing of all such agreements to which we are a party, and the inclusion of a description of any collaboration or license agreement is not an indication that we consider such agreement(s) to be material to our business and operations as a whole, which is a dynamic and evolving analysis and may change over time.

In 2015, our subsidiary NantCell, Inc. and Sorrento established NANTibody as a stand-alone biotechnology company with $100.0 million in initial joint funding. We own 60% of the equity interests and Sorrento owns 40% of the equity interests in NANTibody, which focuses on accelerating the development of multiple therapeutic product candidates that are being developed as standalone treatments as well as in combination with other therapies as part of an immune-oncology treatment regimen.
In 2015, NantCell entered into an exclusive license agreement with Sorrento pursuant to which we obtained an exclusive license under certain patent rights and antibody materials, including antibody sequences and complementary DNA (cDNA) and clones and a non-exclusive license under certain know-how, in each case to use, research and develop certain antibodies and anti-body drug conjugates (ADCs) including for neoepitopes, which are epitopes resulting from mutations specific to an individual’s cancer cells, and to commercialize the resulting licensed products, in exchange for consideration that included an upfront cash payment of $10 million, equity consideration with a valuation of $100 million, and mid-single digit percentage royalties on net sales of the resulting licensed products. Our obligation to pay royalties was, on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis, until the later of (i) the date on which such licensed product is no longer covered by a valid claim of a patent licensed pursuant to the agreement in such country and (ii) ten years after the first commercial sale of such licensed product in such country. In addition, the agreement provided us with the right to negotiate an exclusive license from Sorrento for two CAR-T/NK cell products to be mutually determined on terms substantially similar to the terms of the license agreement. NantCell was to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize the licensed products. Subject, as applicable, to the licenses granted by Sorrento to us, each party was to own all inventions and other developments it creates or develops in the course of activities conducted pursuant to the agreement. 
In 2015, NANTibody entered into an exclusive license agreement with Sorrento pursuant to which NANTibody obtained a royalty-free exclusive license under certain patent rights and materials, including antibody sequences and cDNA, and clones and a non-exclusive license under certain know-how, in each case related to up to 75 immuno-oncology antibodies, immune-check point antibodies, bi-specific antibodies and/or ADCs from Sorrento’s G-MAB library to be mutually identified by the parties (21 of which were already identified at the time of signing the agreement), to use, research, develop and commercialize the resulting licensed products. 
In 2019, we filed cross-claims against Sorrento in the Superior Court of California, Los Angeles County, alleging that Sorrento had breached the exclusive license agreement with us; these claims were pursued in arbitration. Sorrento filed counterclaims against the company and NANTibody in the arbitration. 
On December 2, 2022, the arbitrator issued a final award finding that Sorrento had breached the two exclusive license agreements with NantCell and NANTibody. In addition, the arbitrator determined that our license agreement remains in full force and effect with respect to ImmunityBio’s PD-L1 NK-cell. The arbitrator ruled that Sorrento, NantCell, and NANTibody have no further rights or obligations under either license agreement with respect to other targets. Sorrento has no further obligation to contribute materials or know how with respect to the PD-LI antibody, and NantCell and NANTibody are not required to return any materials or know-how received from Sorrento. For more information, see Note 7, Commitments and Contingencies—Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc. Litigation, of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” that appears in Part II, Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report.
Viracta Therapeutics, Inc.
In 2017, we entered into an agreement with Viracta under which we were granted exclusive worldwide rights to Viracta’s Phase 2 drug candidate, nanatinostat, for use in combination with our platform of NK cell therapies. In consideration for the license, we are obligated to pay Viracta mid-single digit percentage royalties on net sales of licensed products for therapeutic use and milestone payments ranging from $10.0 million to $25.0 million up to an aggregate maximum of $100.0 million for various regulatory approvals and cumulative net sales levels. We may terminate the agreement, at our sole discretion, in whole or on a product-by-product and/or country-by-country basis, at any time upon 90 days’ prior written notice. In addition, either party may terminate the agreement in the event of a material breach or for bankruptcy of the other party.
Government Regulation
In the U.S., the FDA regulates biopharmaceuticals under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and the Public Health Service Act (PHSA). Biopharmaceuticals also are subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or post-market may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, product recalls or market withdrawals, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement and civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements subjects a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, including warning letters, the seizure or recall of products, injunctions, consent decrees placing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations and civil and criminal penalties. Contract manufacturers often encounter difficulties involving production yields, quality control and quality assurance, as well as shortages of qualified personnel. Any of these actions or events could have a material impact on the availability of our product candidates.
The FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state, and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring, and post-approval reporting of biologics such as those we are developing. We, along with third-party contractors, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval or licensure of our product candidates. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
The process required by the FDA before biopharmaceutical product candidates may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following:
•completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies performed in accordance with the FDA’s GLP requirements;
•submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually or when significant changes are made;
•approval by an independent IRB or ethics committee for each clinical site before the clinical trial is begun;
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety, purity and potency of the proposed biologic product candidate for its intended purpose;
•preparation of and submission to the FDA of a BLA or NDA, after completion of all required clinical trials;
•a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA/NDA to file the application for review;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the proposed product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product candidates’ continued safety, quality, purity and potency or efficacy, and of selected clinical investigational sites to assess compliance with GCP requirements; 
•FDA review and approval of the BLA or NDA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the U.S.; and 
•compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a REMS, and the potential requirement to conduct post-approval studies.
The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate, we must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an IND product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical trials. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology, and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises safety concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial. 
When a clinical trial using genetically engineered cells is conducted at, or sponsored by, institutions receiving NIH funding for wild-type DNA research, prior to the submission of an IND to the FDA, a protocol and related documentation is submitted to and the study is registered with the NIH Office of Biotechnology Activities (OBA) pursuant to the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules (NIH Guidelines). Compliance with the NIH Guidelines is mandatory for investigators at institutions receiving NIH funds for research involving wild-type DNA, and many companies and other institutions not otherwise subject to the NIH Guidelines voluntarily follow them. The NIH is responsible for convening the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (RAC), a federal advisory committee that discusses protocols that raise novel or particularly important scientific, safety, or ethical considerations at one of its quarterly public meetings. The OBA will notify the FDA of the RAC’s decision regarding the necessity for full public review of a protocol. RAC proceedings and reports are posted to the OBA web site and may be accessed by the public. If the FDA allows the IND to proceed, but the RAC decides that full public review of the protocol is warranted, the FDA will request at the completion of its IND review that sponsors delay initiation of the protocol until after completion of the RAC review process.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirement, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments. Furthermore, an independent IRB, for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial, must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site and must monitor the study until completed. Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and clinical trial results to public registries.
For purposes of BLA or NDA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap.
•Phase 1. The investigational product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
•Phase 2. The investigational product is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy or potency of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.
•Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy or potency, and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk to benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
•Phase 4. Companies may voluntarily pursue additional clinical trials after a product is approved to gain more information about the product for that approved indication. 
In some cases, the FDA may require an additional trial after a product is approved, and these so-called Phase 4 trials may be a condition to approval of the BLA or NDA. 
Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 testing may not be completed successfully within a specified period, if at all, and there can be no assurance that the data collected will support FDA approval or licensure of the product. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies may complete additional animal studies and develop additional information about the biological characteristics of the product candidate and must finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with use of biological products, the Public Health Service Act emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product, or for biologics, the safety, purity and potency. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
We may be required to develop and implement additional clinical trial policies and procedures designed to help protect subjects from the COVID-19 virus. Since March 2020, the FDA has issued various COVID-19 related guidance for sponsors and manufacturers, including guidance on, on conducting clinical trials during the pandemic, and Good Manufacturing Practice considerations for responding to COVID-19 infection in employees in drug and biological products manufacturing, among others. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business, preclinical studies and clinical trials will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence. Recently, President Biden announced that the administration intends to end the COVID-19 national and public health emergencies on May 11, 2023. The full impact of the termination of the public health emergencies on FDA and other regulatory policies and operations are unclear.
BLA/NDA Submission and Review by the FDA
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA for a biologic product candidate or an NDA for a small molecule product candidate requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. Unless agreed to in advance with the FDA, the BLA/NDA must include all data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results, as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of the product or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. The submission of a BLA/NDA requires payment of a substantial user fee to the FDA, and the sponsor of an approved BLA/NDA is subject to annual product and establishment user fees. These fees typically increase annually. A waiver of user fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances.
Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA/NDA to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA or NDA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA/NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. Once a BLA/NDA has been filed, the FDA’s goal is to review the application within ten months after it accepts the application for filing, or, if the application relates to an unmet medical need in a serious or life-threatening indication, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. The review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews a BLA/NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective, or safe, pure and potent for the proposed indication(s) and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, purity and potency or efficacy. The FDA may convene an advisory committee to provide clinical insight on application review questions. Before approving a BLA/NDA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities comply with cGMP requirements and are adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. If applicable, FDA regulations also require tissue establishments to register and list their human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products with the FDA and to evaluate donors through screening and testing. Additionally, before approving a BLA/NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
The testing and approval process require substantial time, effort and financial resources, and each may take several years to complete. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all, and we may encounter difficulties or unanticipated costs in our efforts to secure necessary governmental approvals, which could delay or preclude us from marketing our product candidates. After the FDA evaluates a BLA/NDA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or its drug substance will be produced, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete, and the application is not ready for approval. A complete response letter may request additional information or clarification. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of a BLA/NDA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product.
If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the BLA/NDA with a REMS plan to mitigate risks, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or other restrictions to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may require one or more Phase 4 post-market trials and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies. In addition, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates under development.
A sponsor may seek approval of its product candidate under programs designed to accelerate the FDA’s review and approval of new drugs and biological products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs and biological products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. For a Fast Track product, the FDA may consider sections of the BLA/NDA for review on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted if relevant criteria are met. A Fast Track-designated product candidate may also qualify for priority review. Priority review is granted when there is evidence that the proposed product would be a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of a serious condition. If criteria are not met for priority review, the application is subject to the standard FDA review period. Priority review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval.
Under the accelerated approval program, the FDA may approve a BLA/NDA on the basis of either a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Post-marketing studies or completion of ongoing studies after marketing approval are generally required to verify the product’s clinical benefit in relationship to the surrogate endpoint or ultimate outcome in relationship to the clinical benefit. In December 2022, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, including the Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act (FDORA), was signed into law. FDORA made several changes to the FDA’s authorities and its regulatory framework, including, among other changes, reforms to the accelerated approval pathway, such as requiring the FDA to specify conditions for post-approval study requirements and setting forth procedures for the FDA to withdraw a product on an expedited basis for non-compliance with post-approval requirements.
In addition, the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012 (FDASIA) established Breakthrough Therapy designation. A sponsor may seek FDA designation of its product candidate as a Breakthrough Therapy if the product candidate is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the therapy may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Sponsors may request the FDA to designate a Breakthrough Therapy at the time of, or any time after, the submission of an IND, but ideally before an end-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA. If the FDA designates a Breakthrough Therapy, it may take actions appropriate to expedite the development and review of the application, which may include holding meetings with the sponsor and the review team throughout the development of the therapy; providing timely advice to, and interactive communication with, the sponsor regarding the development of the product candidate to ensure that the development program to gather the nonclinical and clinical data necessary for approval is as efficient as practicable; involving senior managers and experienced review staff, as appropriate, in a collaborative, cross-disciplinary review; assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the FDA review team to facilitate an efficient review of the development program and to serve as a scientific liaison between the review team and the sponsor; and considering alternative clinical trial designs when scientifically appropriate, which may result in smaller or more efficient clinical trials that require less time to complete and may minimize the number of patients exposed to a potentially less efficacious treatment. Breakthrough Therapy designation also allows the sponsor to file sections of the BLA/NDA for review on a rolling basis. We may seek designation as a Breakthrough Therapy for some or all of our product candidates.
Breakthrough Therapy and/or Fast Track designations and priority review do not change the standards for approval. The receipt of such designations may not lead to a faster development process or regulatory review and may not increase the likelihood that a product candidate will receive approval. 
In addition, the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA) requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric clinical trials for certain drugs and biological products, for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration. Under PREA, original NDAs/BLAs and supplements must contain a pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver. The required assessment must evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The sponsor or FDA may request a deferral of pediatric clinical trials for some or all of the pediatric subpopulations. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the product candidate is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric clinical trials are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data needs to be collected before the pediatric clinical trials begin. The FDA must send a non-compliance letter to any sponsor that fails to submit the required assessment, keep a deferral current or fails to submit a request for approval of a pediatric formulation.
Orphan Drugs
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, defined as a disease or condition with a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or a patient population greater than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. and when there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available the drug or biologic in the U.S. will be recovered from sales in the U.S. for that drug or biologic. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA or NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA.
If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for a particular active ingredient for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full BLA or NDA, to market the same biologic or drug product for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity or if the FDA finds that the holder of the orphan drug exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA application user fee.
A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, orphan drug exclusive marketing rights in the U.S. may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
Emergency Use Authorization
Operation Warp Speed (OWS) aimed to deliver 300 million doses of a safe, effective vaccine for COVID-19 by January 2021, and was part of a broader government strategy to accelerate the development, manufacturing, and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics. OWS was a partnership among components of HHS, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the FDA, the NIH, and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) and the Department of Defense; engaged with private firms and other federal agencies; and coordinated existing HHS-wide efforts, including the NIH’s Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines partnership, NIH’s Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics initiative, and work by BARDA. A COVID-19 vaccine product may be approved initially under an emergency use authorization (EUA) followed by a full BLA approval when more data are available and submitted to FDA for approval.
On February 4, 2020, the Secretary of HHS determined that the COVID-19 pandemic is a public health emergency that has a significant potential to affect national security or the health and security of U.S. citizens. On the basis of such determination, on March 27, 2020, the Secretary of HHS declared that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of emergency use of drugs and biologics during the COVID-19 outbreak, pursuant to Section 564 of the FDCA, which permits the FDA Commissioner to allow unapproved medical products or unapproved uses of approved medical products to be used in the COVID-19 public health emergency. FDA has created the Coronavirus Treatment Acceleration Program, a new program designed to expedite the development of potential COVID-19 therapies by using every tool at the agency’s disposal to determine if the therapies are safe and effective for their intended uses. In issuing an emergency use authorization, FDA will consider the totality of scientific evidence available to FDA regarding safety, efficacy and known and potential risks of such products and availability of alternatives to the emergency use products, among others. Emergency Use Authorizations issued by FDA will specify the scope authorization and conditions of authorization, including limitations on distribution and conditions related to product advertising and promotion. Once granted, an EUA is effective will be effective until the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of the emergency use of drugs and biologics for prevention and treatment of COVID-19 is terminated under Section 564(b)(2) of the FDCA or the EUA is revoked under Section 564(g) of the FDCA, after which the product must be approved by FDA under a traditional pathway in order to remain on the market or to continue commercialization of the product.
Post-Approval Requirements
Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data. Biopharmaceutical manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements upon us, and any third-party manufacturers, that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future suppliers will be able to comply with the cGMP regulations and other FDA regulatory requirements. If our present or future suppliers are not able to comply with these requirements, the FDA may, among other things, halt our clinical trials, require us to recall a product from distribution, or withdraw approval of the BLA or NDA.
In the U.S., once a drug is approved, its manufacture is subject to comprehensive and continuing regulation by the FDA. FDA regulations require that drugs be manufactured in specific facilities per the BLA or NDA approval and in accordance with cGMP. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. These regulations also impose certain organizational, procedural, and documentation requirements with respect to manufacturing and quality assurance activities. BLA or NDA holders using contract manufacturers, laboratories or packagers are responsible for the selection and monitoring of qualified firms, and, in certain circumstances, qualified suppliers to these firms. These firms and, where applicable, their suppliers are subject to inspections by the FDA at any time, and the discovery of violative conditions, including failure to conform to cGMP, could result in enforcement actions that interrupt the operation of any such facilities or the ability to distribute drugs manufactured, processed, or tested by them. 
Future FDA and state inspections may identify compliance issues at our facilities or at the facilities of contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct. In addition, discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable requirements may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved BLA or NDA, including withdrawal or recall of the product from the market or other voluntary, FDA-initiated or judicial action that could delay or prohibit further marketing.
The FDA may also require post-approval testing, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 testing, risk minimization action plans, and post-marketing surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved drug or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the drug. The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
•fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
•refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
•product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
•injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of biologics or drug products. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties, and exclusion from participation in governmental health programs, like Medicare and Medicaid. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products.
Prescription drug advertising is subject to federal, state, and foreign regulations. In the U.S., the FDA regulates prescription drug promotion, including direct-to-consumer advertising. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use. Any distribution of prescription drugs and pharmaceutical samples must comply with the U.S. Prescription Drug Marketing Act (PDMA), a part of the FDCA. The Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA), enacted in 2013, aims to build an electronic system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs distributed in the U.S. The DSCSA mandates phased-in and resource-intensive obligations for pharmaceutical manufacturers, wholesale distributors, and dispensers. The law’s requirements include the quarantine and prompt investigation of a suspect product to determine if it is illegitimate and notifying trading partners and the FDA of any illegitimate product. Drug manufacturers and their collaborators are also required to place a unique product identifier on prescription drug packages.
Premarket Clearance and Approval Requirements for Medical Devices
Each medical device we seek to commercially distribute in the U.S. will require either a prior 510(k) clearance, unless it is exempt (PMA) from the FDA. Generally, if a new device has a predicate that is already on the market under a 510(k) clearance, the FDA will allow that new device to be marketed under a 510(k) clearance; otherwise, a PMA is required. Medical devices are classified into one of three classes: Class 1, Class 2 or Class 3, depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Class 1 devices are deemed to be low risk and are subject to the general controls of the FDCA, such as provisions that relate to: adulteration; misbranding; registration and listing; notification, including repair, replacement, or refund; records and reports; and good manufacturing practices. Most Class 1 devices are classified as exempt from pre-market notification under section 510(k) of the FDCA, and therefore may be commercially distributed without obtaining 510(k) clearance from the FDA. Class 2 devices are subject to both general controls and special controls to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Special controls include performance standards, post market surveillance, patient registries and guidance documents. A manufacturer may be required to submit to the FDA a pre-market notification requesting permission to commercially distribute some Class 2 devices. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device, are placed in Class 3. A Class 3 device cannot be marketed in the U.S. unless the FDA approves the device after submission of a PMA. However, there are some Class 3 devices for which FDA has not yet called for a PMA. For these devices, the manufacturer must submit a pre-market notification and obtain 510(k) clearance in orders to commercially distribute these devices. The FDA can also impose sales, marketing or other restrictions on devices in order to assure that they are used in a safe and effective manner.
510(k) Clearance Pathway
When a 510(k) clearance is required, we must submit a pre-market notification to the FDA demonstrating that our proposed device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device, which is a previously cleared and legally marketed 510(k) device or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976. By regulation, a pre-market notification must be submitted to the FDA at least 90 days before we intend to distribute a device. As a practical matter, clearance often takes significantly longer. To demonstrate substantial equivalence, the manufacturer must show that the proposed device has the same intended use as the predicate device, and it either has the same technological characteristics, or different technological characteristics and the information in the pre-market notification demonstrates that the device is equally safe and effective and does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness. The FDA may require further information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence. If the FDA determines that the device, or its intended use, is not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared device or use, the FDA will place the device into Class 3.
There are three types of 510(k)s: traditional; special; and abbreviated. Special 510(k)s are for devices that are modified and the modification needs a new 510(k) but does not affect the intended use or alter the fundamental scientific technology of the device. Abbreviated 510(k)s are for devices that conform to a recognized standard. The special and abbreviated 510(k)s are intended to streamline review, and the FDA intends to process special 510(k)s within 30 days of receipt.
De Novo Classification
Medical device types that the FDA has not previously classified as Class 1, 2 or 3 are automatically classified into Class 3 regardless of the level of risk they pose. The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 established a new route to market for low to moderate risk medical devices that are automatically placed into Class 3 due to the absence of a predicate device, called the Request for Evaluation of Automatic Class 3 Designation (or the De Novo Classification Process).
This procedure allows a manufacturer whose novel device is automatically classified into Class 3 to request down-classification of its medical device into Class 1 or Class 2 on the basis that the device presents low or moderate risk, rather than requiring the submission and approval of a PMA application. Prior to the enactment of the FDASIA, a medical device could only be eligible for de novo classification if the manufacturer first submitted a 510(k) pre-market notification and received a determination from the FDA that the device was not substantially equivalent. FDASIA streamlined the de novo classification pathway by permitting manufacturers to request de novo classification directly without first submitting a 510(k) pre-market notification to the FDA and receiving a not substantially equivalent determination. Under FDASIA, the FDA is required to classify the device within 120 days following receipt of the de novo application. If the manufacturer seeks reclassification into Class 2, the manufacturer must include a draft proposal for special controls that are necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the medical device. In addition, the FDA may reject the reclassification petition if it identifies a legally marketed predicate device that would be appropriate for a 510(k) or determines that the device is not low to moderate risk or that general controls would be inadequate to control the risks and special controls cannot be developed.
Pre-market Approval Pathway
A PMA application must be submitted to the FDA for Class 3 devices for which the FDA has required a PMA. The PMA application process is much more demanding than the 510(k) pre-market notification process. A PMA application must be supported by extensive data, including but not limited to technical, preclinical, clinical trials, manufacturing and labeling to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction reasonable evidence of safety and effectiveness of the device.
After a PMA application is submitted, the FDA has 45 days to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review and thus whether the FDA will file the application for review. The FDA has 180 days to review a filed PMA application, although the review of an application generally occurs over a significantly longer period of time and can take up to several years. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of the information already provided. Also, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device.
Although the FDA is not bound by the advisory panel decision, the panel’s recommendations are important to the FDA’s overall decision making process. In addition, the FDA may conduct a preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with the Quality System Regulation (QSR). The agency also may inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with FDA’s regulations.
Upon completion of the PMA review, the FDA may: (i) approve the PMA application which authorizes commercial marketing with specific prescribing information for one or more indications, which can be more limited than those originally sought; (ii) issue an approvable letter which indicates the FDA’s belief that the PMA application is approvable and states what additional information the FDA requires or the post-approval commitments that must be agreed to prior to approval; (iii)issue a not approvable letter which outlines steps required for approval, but which are typically more onerous than those in an approvable letter, and may require additional clinical trials that are often expensive and time consuming and can delay approval for months or even years; or (iv) deny the application. If the FDA issues an approvable or not approvable letter, the applicant has 180 days to respond, after which the FDA’s review clock is reset.
Clinical trials are almost always required to support PMA and are sometimes required for 510(k) clearance. In the U.S., for significant risk devices, these trials require submission of an application for an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) to the FDA. The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE must be approved in advance by the FDA for a specific number of patients at specified trial sites. During the trial, the sponsor must comply with the FDA’s IDE requirements for investigator selection, trial monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping. The investigators must obtain patient informed consent, rigorously follow the investigational plan and trial protocol, control the disposition of investigational devices and comply with all reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Clinical trials for significant risk devices may not begin until the 
IDE application is approved by the FDA and the appropriate IRBs at the clinical trial sites. An IRB is an appropriately constituted group that has been formally designated to review and monitor medical research involving subjects and which has the authority to approve, require modifications in, or disapprove research to protect the rights, safety and welfare of human research subjects. A nonsignificant risk device does not require FDA approval of an IDE; however, the clinical trial must still be conducted in compliance with various requirements of FDA’s IDE regulations and be approved by an IRB at the clinical trial sites. The FDA or the IRB at each site at which a clinical trial is being performed may withdraw approval of a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the benefits or a failure to comply with FDA or IRB requirements. Even if a trial is completed, the results of clinical testing may not demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the device, may be equivocal or may otherwise not be sufficient to obtain approval or clearance of the product.
Sponsors of clinical trials of devices are required to register with clinical trials.gov, a public database of clinical trial information. Information related to the device, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators and other aspects of the clinical trial is made public as part of the registration.
Ongoing Medical Device Regulation by the FDA
Even after a device receives clearance or approval and is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include:
•establishment registration and device listing;
•the QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process;
•labeling regulations and the FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved or off-label uses and other requirements related to promotional activities;
•medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufactures report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or if their device malfunctioned and the device or a similar device marketed by the manufacturer would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur;
•corrections and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufactures report to the FDA field corrections or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by a device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health; and
•post market surveillance regulations, which apply to certain Class 2 or 3 devices when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device.
After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, will require a new clearance or possibly a PMA. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially, but the FDA can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacture’s determination. If the FDA disagrees with our determination not to seek a new 510(k) clearance, the FDA may retroactively require us to seek 510(k) clearance or possibly a PMA. The FDA could also require manufacturer to cease marketing and distribution and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA is obtained. Also, in these circumstances, the manufacturer may be subject to significant regulatory fines and penalties.
Some changes to an approved PMA device, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new PMA application or PMA supplement, as appropriate, before the change can be implemented. Supplements to a PMA application often require the submission of the same type of information required for an original PMA application, except that the supplement is generally limited to that information needed to support the proposed change from the device covered by the original PMA. The FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing PMA supplements as it does in reviewing original PMA applications.
FDA regulations require us to register as a medical device manufacturer with the FDA. Additionally, some states require us to register as a medical device manufacturer within the state. Because of this, the FDA and similar state agencies may inspect us on a routine basis for compliance with the QSR. These regulations require that the manufacturer maintain proper documentation in a prescribed manner with respect to manufacturing, testing and control activities. Further, the FDA requires medical device manufacturers to comply with various FDA regulations regarding labeling. 
Failure by us or by our suppliers to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA or state authorities, which may include any of the following sanctions:
•warning or untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;
•customer notifications, voluntary or mandatory recall or seizure of our medical device product candidates;
•operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
•delay in processing submissions or applications for new products or modifications to existing products;
•withdrawing approvals that have already been granted; and
•criminal prosecution.
The Medical Device Reporting laws and regulations require medical device manufacturers to provide information to the FDA when they receive or otherwise become aware of information that reasonably suggests the device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury as well as a device malfunction that likely would cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. In addition, the FDA prohibits an approved device from being marketed for off-label use. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including substantial monetary penalties and criminal prosecution.
Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory clearance or approval of our medical device product candidates under development. Medical device manufacturers are also subject to other federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory and manufacturing practices.
Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
We are subject to numerous foreign, federal, state, and local environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment, and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. In addition, our leasing and operation of real property may subject us to liability pursuant to certain U.S. environmental laws and regulations, under which current or previous owners or operators of real property and entities that disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances may be held strictly, jointly, and severally liable for the cost of investigating or remediating contamination caused by hazardous substance releases, even if they did not know of and were not responsible for the releases.
The distribution of pharmaceutical drugs is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage, and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical drugs. The failure to comply with regulatory requirements subjects firms to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines, or other penalties, injunctions, voluntary recall or seizure of drugs, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals, or refusal to allow a firm to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts. In addition, even if a firm complies with FDA and other requirements, new information regarding the safety or efficacy of a product could lead the FDA to modify or withdraw product approval. Prohibitions or restrictions on sales or withdrawal of future products marketed by us could materially affect our business in an adverse way.
Our sales, promotion, medical education, clinical research and other activities following product approval will be subject to regulation by numerous regulatory and law enforcement authorities in the U.S. in addition to the FDA, including potentially the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice, CMS, other divisions of HHS and state and local governments. Our promotional and scientific/educational programs must comply with the AKS, the FCA, physician payment transparency laws, privacy laws, security laws, and additional federal and state laws similar to the foregoing. If drugs are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. Drugs must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. Manufacturing, sales, promotion, and other activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. Changes in regulations, statutes, or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: (i) changes to our manufacturing arrangements; (ii) additions or modifications to product labeling; (iii) the recall or discontinuation of our products; or (iv) additional record-keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business. 
The AKS prohibits, among other things, the knowing and willing, direct or indirect offer, receipt, solicitation or payment of remuneration in exchange for or to induce the referral of patients, including the purchase, order or lease of any good, facility, item or service that would be paid for in whole or part by Medicare, Medicaid or other federal health care programs. Remuneration has been broadly defined to include anything of value, including cash, improper discounts, and free or reduced-price items and services. The AKS has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, formulary managers, and beneficiaries on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the AKS. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the AKS has been violated. The government has enforced the AKS to reach large settlements with healthcare companies based on sham research or consulting and other financial arrangements with physicians. Further, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the AKS constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the FCA. Many states have similar laws that apply to their state health care programs, as well as private payors.
Federal false claims and false statement laws, including the FCA, imposes liability on persons or entities that, among other things, knowingly present or cause to be presented claims that are false or fraudulent or not provided as claimed for payment or approval by a federal health care program. The FCA has been used to prosecute persons or entities that “cause” the submission of claims for payment that are inaccurate or fraudulent, by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers, promoting a product off-label, submitting claims for services not provided as claimed, or submitting claims for services that were provided but not medically necessary. Actions under the FCA may be brought by the Attorney General, or as a qui tam action by a private individual, in the name of the government. Violations of the FCA can result in significant monetary penalties and treble damages. The federal government is using the FCA, and the accompanying threat of significant liability, in its investigation and prosecution of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies throughout the country, for example, in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses and other illegal sales and marketing practices. The government has obtained multi-million and multi-billion dollar settlements under the FCA in addition to individual criminal convictions under applicable criminal statutes. In addition, certain companies that were found to be in violation of the FCA have been forced to implement extensive corrective action plans and have often become subject to consent decrees or corporate integrity agreements, restricting the manner in which they conduct their business.
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors; knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services; and willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense. Like the AKS, the ACA amended the intent standard for certain healthcare fraud statutes under HIPAA such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that the government will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers’ and manufacturers’ compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws. In addition, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor, in addition to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs. Additionally, to the extent that our product candidates, once commercialized, are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws.
In addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and certain other healthcare providers and teaching hospitals. The ACA, among other things, under the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, imposed reporting requirements on certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, for payments or other transfers of value made by them to certain covered recipients, including physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Effective January 1, 2022, these reporting obligations with respect to covered recipients have been extended to include payments and transfers of value made to non-physician providers such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners. Covered manufacturers are required to collect and report detailed payment data and submit legal attestation to the accuracy of such data to the government each year. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately and completely reported in an annual submission. Additionally, entities that do not comply with mandatory reporting requirements may be subject to a corporate integrity agreement. Certain states also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs, impose restrictions on covered manufacturers’ marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians and other healthcare professionals.
We may also be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (HITECH) and their respective implementing regulations, impose specified requirements on certain health care providers, plans and clearinghouses, or collectively, covered entities, and their “business associates,” relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” which includes independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce HIPAA and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, certain states have their own laws that govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other and/or HIPAA in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, imprisonment, contractual damages, reputational harm, and diminished profits and future earnings, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. If any of the physicians or other providers, independent contractors, or entities with whom we do business are found to not be in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs and imprisonment, which could affect our ability to operate our business. Further, defending against any such actions can be costly, time-consuming and may require significant personnel resources. Therefore, even if we are successful in defending against any such actions that may be brought against us, our business may be impaired.
In addition to the foregoing health care laws, we are also subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or private-sector recipients for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. The anti-corruption policy mandates compliance with the FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws applicable to our business throughout the world. However, we cannot assure you that such a policy or procedures implemented to enforce such a policy will protect us from intentional, reckless or negligent acts committed by our employees, distributors, partners, collaborators or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could result in fines, penalties or prosecution and have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and reputation.
Coverage and Reimbursement
Sales of pharmaceutical products depend significantly on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement are provided by third-party payors. Third-party payors include state and federal government health care programs, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Although we currently believe that third-party payors will provide coverage and reimbursement for our product candidates, if approved, we cannot be certain of this. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the cost-effectiveness, and reducing reimbursement for medical products and services. In the U.S., no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drugs or biological products exists, and one payor’s determination to provide coverage and adequate reimbursement for a product does not assure that other payors will make a similar determination. In the U.S., the principal decisions about reimbursement for new medicines are typically made by the CMS, an agency within the HHS, as the CMS decides whether and to what extent a new medicine will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare. Private third-party payors tend to follow Medicare coverage and reimbursement limitations to a substantial degree, but also have their own methods and approval process apart from Medicare determinations. Significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products. 
The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost containment measures and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures could further limit our revenues and results. We may need to conduct expensive clinical trials to demonstrate the comparative cost-effectiveness of our product candidates. The product candidates that we develop may not be considered cost-effective and thus may not be covered or sufficiently reimbursed. It is time consuming and expensive for us to seek coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors, as each payor will make its own determination as to whether to cover a product and at what level of reimbursement. Thus, one payor’s decision to provide coverage and adequate reimbursement for a product does not assure that another payor will provide coverage or that the reimbursement levels will be adequate. Moreover, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our product candidates on a competitive and profitable basis.
Healthcare Reform
The U.S. and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our product candidates profitably. Among policy makers and payors in the U.S. and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the U.S., the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives.
By way of example, in March 2010, the ACA was signed into law, intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. Among the provisions of the ACA of importance to our potential product candidates are:
•an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs;
•an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1% and 13.0% of the average manufacturer price for branded and generic drugs, respectively;
•a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;
•a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 70% (increased pursuant to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, effective as of 2019) point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for a manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;
•extension of a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;
•expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability;
•expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program; and
•a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.
In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. These changes include, among others, the Budget Control Act of 2011, which mandates aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year effective April 1, 2013, and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will remain in effect through 2031, with the exception of a temporary suspension implemented under various COVID-19 relief legislation from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022. Under current legislation, the actual reduction in Medicare payments will vary from 1% in 2022 to up to 4% in the final fiscal year of this sequester. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the ARTA, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on customers for our product candidates, if approved, and, accordingly, our financial operations.
Under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, effective January 1, 2024, the statutory cap on Medicaid Drug Rebate Program rebates that manufacturers pay to state Medicaid programs will be eliminated. Elimination of this cap may require pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay more in rebates than it receives on the sale of products, which could have a material impact on our business. Further, in July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order, “Promoting Competition in the American Economy,” with multiple provisions aimed at increasing competition for prescription drugs. In August 2022, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which includes prescription drug provisions that have significant implications for the pharmaceutical industry and Medicare beneficiaries, including allowing the federal government to negotiate a maximum fair price for certain high-priced single source Medicare drugs, imposing penalties and excise tax for manufacturers that fail to comply with the drug price negotiation requirements, requiring inflation rebates for all Medicare Part B and Part D drugs, with limited exceptions, if their drug prices increase faster than inflation, and redesigning Medicare Part D to reduce out-of-pocket prescription drug costs for beneficiaries, among other changes. The impact of these legislative, executive, and administrative actions and any future healthcare measures and agency rules implemented by the Biden administration on us and the pharmaceutical industry as a whole is unclear. The impact of these regulations and any future healthcare measures and agency rules implemented by the Biden administration on us and the pharmaceutical industry as a whole is currently unknown. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our product candidates if approved. Complying with any new legislation and regulatory changes could be time-intensive and expensive, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business. 
Since the enactment of the ACA, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. In June 2021, the United States Supreme Court held that Texas and other challengers had no legal standing to challenge the ACA, dismissing the case without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Accordingly, the ACA remains in effect in its current form. It is possible that the ACA will be subject to judicial or Congressional challenges in the future. It is unclear how additional challenges and healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the ACA. Complying with any new legislation or changes in healthcare regulation could be time-intensive and expensive, resulting in material adverse effect on our business.
At the state level, individual states are increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures. For example, a number of states are considering or have recently enacted state drug price transparency and reporting laws that could substantially increase our compliance burdens and expose us to greater liability under such state laws once we begin commercialization after obtaining regulatory approval for any of our products. These measures could reduce the demand for our products, if approved, or impose additional pricing pressures on how much we can charge for our products if approved.
We expect that the ACA, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and lower reimbursement and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government-funded programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our product candidates. Furthermore, the current presidential administration and Congress may continue to attempt broad sweeping changes to the current health care laws. We face uncertainties that might result from modifications or repeal of any of the provisions of the ACA, including as a result of current and future executive orders and legislative actions. The impact of those changes on us and potential effect on the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries as a whole is currently unknown. However, any changes to the ACA are likely to have an impact on our results of operations and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We cannot predict what other healthcare programs and regulations will ultimately be implemented at the federal or state level or the effect any future legislation or regulation in the U.S. may have on our business.
Foreign Regulation
In addition to regulations in the U.S., we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our product candidates to the extent we choose to develop or sell any product candidates outside of the U.S. The approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required to obtain FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.
Human Capital
Our Human Capital talent strategy relies on attracting, retaining and developing top talent that align with our culture and mission to “outsmart your disease.” We promote a culture that is focused on delivering treatments utilizing natural immunities, and we seek to harness our science first focus to deliver solutions to patients and families. As of December 31, 2022, we had 725 employees located across the U.S. and Italy. Among our employees, 23% are focused on research and development, 14% on clinical development and regulatory, 40% on manufacturing and quality, and 23% on general and administrative functions. We have not been subject to labor action or union activities, and our management considers its relationships with employees to be good.
We believe that fostering a workplace that celebrates differences and strengths creates an environment that supports the inclusion and value of diverse thoughts, backgrounds and perspectives. A well rounded culture allows for ongoing dialogue and discussions that challenge the status quo and create a learning environment that supports diversity, equity and inclusion. As part of our commitment we continue to encourage a culture where employees can freely ask questions and raise concerns. Our annual performance review process helps support our commitment to develop and retain top talent by providing an opportunity to have open dialogue, establish goals, discuss milestones and continue to engage in opportunities to develop and cultivate the talent. Additionally, our management team makes themselves available to all employees including 1:1s, Department Meetings and Town Hall events.
Our ongoing success will continue to depend on our ability to attract, engage and retain top talent in an ever growing competitive market. We offer a competitive compensation package to help meet the needs of our employees. In addition to salaries, these programs include annual bonuses, stock awards, a 401(k) plan, healthcare and insurance benefits, flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, flexible work schedules, an employee assistance program, among others. We work to ensure pay equity by assessing our compensation practices and working with external benchmarks and compensation consultants to design and benchmark our programs.
Our ongoing response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which complies with government orders in all the states and counties where we operate, focuses on employee health and wellness. We implemented a number of health-related measures over the past three years that included work from home policies, on-site access restrictions, and increased cleaning and sanitizing procedures.
Organization and Development of ImmunityBio, Inc.
ImmunityBio, Inc. was established following a series of mergers and name changes. We were incorporated in Illinois on October 7, 2002 under the name ZelleRx Corporation. Our name was later changed to Conkwest, Inc., and we were reincorporated in the state of Delaware in March 2014. On July 10, 2015, we changed our name to NantKwest, Inc. (NantKwest).
NantCell, LLC was originally organized as a Delaware limited liability company in November 2014. In April 2015, it was converted to a Delaware corporation, NantCell, Inc., and in May 2019 changed its name to ImmunityBio, Inc. (a private company) (NantCell).
On December 21, 2020, NantKwest and NantCell entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement), pursuant to which NantKwest and NantCell agreed to combine their businesses. The Merger Agreement provided that a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company would merge with and into NantCell (the Merger), with NantCell surviving the Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company. We believe that the Merger, which closed on March 9, 2021, combined two companies to create a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing next-generation therapies and vaccines that complement, harness, and amplify the immune system to defeat cancers and infectious diseases. 
ImmunityBio is incorporated in Delaware and its principal executive offices are located in San Diego, California.
