Item 1.  Business.
Overview
 
CTD Holdings, Inc. (“we” “our” “us” or “the Company”) was organized as a Florida corporation on August 9, 1990, with operations beginning in July 1992. In conjunction with a restructuring in 2000, we changed our name from Cyclodextrin Technologies Development, Inc., or CTDI, to CTD Holdings, Inc.; CTDI was then incorporated as a Florida corporation and became a wholly owned subsidiary of CTD Holdings, Inc.  
 
We are a biotechnology company that develops cyclodextrin-based products for the treatment of disease. We filed a Type II Drug Master File with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) in 2014 for our lead drug candidate, Trappsol® Cyclo™ (hydroxypropyl beta cyclodextrin) as a treatment for Niemann-Pick Type C disease (“NPC”). NPC is a rare and fatal cholesterol metabolism disease that impacts the brain, lungs, liver, spleen, and other organs. In 2015, we launched an International Clinical Program for Trappsol® Cyclo™ as a treatment for NPC. In 2016, we filed an Investigational New Drug application (“IND”) with the FDA, which describes our Phase I clinical plans for a randomized, double blind, parallel group study at a single clinical site in the U.S. The Phase I study will evaluate the safety of Trappsol® Cyclo™ along with markers of cholesterol metabolism and markers of NPC during a 14-week treatment period of intravenous administration of Trappsol® Cyclo ™ every two weeks to participants 18 years of age and older. The IND was approved by the FDA in September 2016, and in January 2017 the FDA granted Fast Track designation to Trappsol® Cyclo™ for the treatment of NPC. Initial patient enrollment in the U.S. Phase I study commenced in September 2017.
 
We have also filed Clinical Trial Applications for a Phase I/II clinical study with several European regulatory bodies, including those in the United Kingdom, Sweden and Italy, and in Israel, all of which have approved our applications. The European Phase I/II study will evaluate the safety of Trappsol® Cyclo™ along with a range of clinical outcomes, including neurologic, hepatic, and respiratory, in addition to measurements of cholesterol metabolism and markers of NPC. The European study is similar to the U.S. study, providing for the administration of Trappsol® Cyclo™ intravenously to NPC patients every two weeks in a double-blind, randomized trial. The first patient was dosed in this study in July 2017.
 
Preliminary data from our clinical studies suggests that Trappsol® CycloTM crosses the blood-brain-barrier in individuals suffering from NPC. Following intravenous administration of Trappsol® CycloTM to study subjects, it was detected in subjects' cerebrospinal fluid. The clinical significance of these findings will be determined as part of the final analysis of both clinical trials.
 
We are also exploring the use of cyclodextrins in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease under a collaborative arrangement with Kerwin Research Center, which is funding this project. In January 2018, the FDA authorized a single patient IND expanded access program using Trappsol®  Cyclo™ for the treatment of this disease, and in October 2018, we filed a patent application with respect to the use of hydroxypropyl beta cyclodextrins in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
 
We also continue to sell cyclodextrins and related products to the pharmaceutical, nutritional, and other industries, primarily for use in diagnostics and specialty drugs with continuing growth in research and new product development. However, our core business has transitioned to a biotechnology company primarily focused on the development of cyclodextrin-based biopharmaceuticals for the treatment of disease from a business that had been primarily reselling basic cyclodextrin products.
 
We have retained Torreya Capital, LLC, as our strategic advisor to support business development.
 
Cyclodextrins
 
Cyclodextrins are molecules that bring together oil and water, making the oily materials soluble in water, and have potential applications anywhere oil and water must be used together. Successful applications of cyclodextrins have been established in biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, analytical chemistry, cosmetics, diagnostics, electronics, foodstuffs, and toxic waste treatment. Stabilization of food flavors and fragrances is the largest current worldwide market for cyclodextrin applications. We and others have developed cyclodextrin-based applications in stabilization of flavors for food products; elimination of undesirable tastes and odors; preparation of antifungal complexes for foods and pharmaceuticals; stabilization of fragrances and dyes; reduction of foaming in foods, cosmetics and toiletries; and the improvement of quality, stability and storability of foods.

Cyclodextrins can improve the solubility and stability of a wide range of drugs. Many promising drug compounds are unusable or have serious side effects because they are either unstable or poorly soluble in water. Strategies for administering currently approved compounds involve injection of formulations requiring pH adjustment and/or the use of organic solvents. The result is frequently painful, irritating, or damaging to the patient. These side effects can be ameliorated by cyclodextrins. Cyclodextrins also have many potential uses in drug delivery for topical applications to the eyes and skin.  In 2010, Trappsol® Cyclo™ was designated an orphan drug by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of NPC.  Trappsol® Cyclo™ is the first use of a cyclodextrin as an active pharmaceutical and not just as an inactive formulation excipient.
 
Cyclodextrin Product Background
 
Cyclodextrins are donut shaped rings of glucose (sugar) molecules. Cyclodextrins are formed naturally by the action of bacterial enzymes on starch. They were first noticed and isolated in 1891. The bacterial enzyme naturally creates a mixture of at least three different cyclodextrins depending on how many glucose units are included in the molecular circle; six glucose units yield alpha cyclodextrin; seven units, beta cyclodextrin; eight units, gamma cyclodextrin. The more glucose units in the molecular ring, the larger the cavity in the center of the ring. The inside of this ring provides an excellent resting place for “oily” molecules while the outside of the ring is compatible with water, allowing clear, stable solutions of cyclodextrins to exist in aqueous environments even when an “oily” molecule is carried within the ring. The net result is a molecular carrier that comes in small, medium, and large sizes with the ability to transport and deliver “oily” materials using plain water as the solvent.  It is the ability of molecular encapsulation of compounds that makes cyclodextrins so useful chemically and pharmaceutically.
 
Cyclodextrins are manufactured commercially in large quantities by mixing purified enzymes with starch solutions. A mixture of alpha, beta, and gamma cyclodextrins can be manufactured by this enzymatic modification of starch with purified natural enzymes and therefore are considered to be natural products. Additional processing is required to isolate and separate the individual cyclodextrins. The purified alpha, beta and gamma cyclodextrins are referred to collectively as natural or native cyclodextrins.
 
The hydroxyl chemical groups on each glucose unit in a cyclodextrin molecule provide chemists with ways to modify the properties of the cyclodextrins, i.e. to make them more water soluble or less water soluble, thereby making them better carriers for a specific chemical. The cyclodextrins that result from chemical modifications are no longer considered natural and are referred to as chemically modified cyclodextrins. Since the property modifications achieved are often advantageous to a specific application, the Company does not believe the loss of the natural product categorization will prevent its ultimate pharmaceutical use. It does, however, create a greater regulatory burden.
 
Use of Cyclodextrins to Treat NPC
 
Natural cyclodextrins have been confirmed to be generally recognized as safe (GRAS) in most of the world, including the U.S. Moreover, approvals of products containing cyclodextrins by the FDA since 2001 suggest that regulatory approval for new products may be easier to obtain in the future. In 2001, Janssen Pharmaceutica, now a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, received FDA approval to market Sporanox®, an antifungal which contained hydroxypropyl beta cyclodextrin as an excipient. In 2009, one of our products was used in an FDA approved compassionate use investigational new drug protocol for the treatment of NPC. Under the Orphan Drug Act, companies that develop a drug for a disorder affecting fewer than 200,000 people in the United States may seek designation as an orphan drug. If such designation is approved, a company will have the ability to sell the drug exclusively for seven years following FDA drug approval, and the company may receive clinical trial tax incentives.  On May 17, 2010, the FDA designated Trappsol® Cyclo™ as an orphan drug for the treatment of NPC. We have also obtained Orphan Drug Designation for Trappsol® Cyclo™ in Europe. Trappsol® Cyclo™ has been administered to more than 20 NPC patients in compassionate use programs around the world, including in the U.S., Brazil and Spain. The doctors and patients participating in these programs, including patients that have been administered Trappsol® Cyclo™ intravenously for more than five years, have made their data available to us, which we used to design our clinical studies in the U.S. and abroad.
 
Other Cyclodextrin Uses
 
Applications of cyclodextrins in personal products and for industrial uses have appeared in many patents and patent applications. Cyclodextrins are used in numerous brand-name household goods, including fabric softeners and air fresheners. With increased manufacturing capacity and supply, the prices of the natural cyclodextrins have decreased to the point that use of these materials is considered in even the most price sensitive goods.

In Japan, at least twelve pharmaceutical preparations are now marketed which contain cyclodextrins; there are also multiple products in Europe and the United States.  Cyclodextrins permit the use of all routes of administration. Ease of delivery and improved bioavailability of such well-known drugs as nitroglycerin, dexamethasone, PGE(1&2), and cephalosporin permit these “old” drugs to command new market share and sometimes new patent lives. Because of the value added, it is management’s opinion that the dollar value of the worldwide market for products containing cyclodextrins and for complexes of cyclodextrins can be substantially greater than that of the market sales of the cyclodextrin itself. 
 
Our Cyclodextrin Products
 
Substantially all of our revenues are derived from our legacy fine chemical business, consisting of the sale of cyclodextrins, including cyclodextrin complexes, the resale of cyclodextrins manufactured by others for our clients to their specifications, and our own licensed cyclodextrin products. We have trademarked certain products under our Trappsol® and Aquaplex® product lines. The Trappsol® product line includes basic cyclodextrins, and cyclodextrins with different chemical adducts resulting in more than 261 different cyclodextrins products available for sale from us. The Aquaplex® product line includes various cyclodextrins combined with more than 80 different active ingredients that, only as a complex, then become water soluble; we currently list for sale more than 116 different Aquaplex® products. Historically, substantially all of our sales of Aquaplex® products were to one chemical supply house, Sigma-Aldrich Fine Chemical.  Sales of Trappsol® and Aquaplex® comprise approximately 88% and 12%, respectively, of our 2018 product sales.  The Trappsol® and Aquaplex® products can be used in many industries, the largest being the food and pharmaceutical industries.  We do not have any other registered trademarks and do not have any patents or licenses.
 
We have protected our Trappsol® and Aquaplex® trademarks used in our legacy fine chemical business by registering them with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.  These trademarks add additional visibility to our products and reputation as a leader in the industry. Our website at www.cyclodex.com has grown to be an important cyclodextrin information Internet site.
 
Natural and chemically modified cyclodextrins are available from at least four major commercial manufacturers around the world, including Wacker Biosolutions, a division of Wacker Chemie AG (Germany), with a production facility located in Adrian, Michigan; Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation (Japan); Roquettes Freres (France); and Hangzhou Pharma and Chem Co. (China).  Prior to 2008, we purchased all of our Aquaplex® cyclodextrin complex products from Cyclodextrin Research & Development Laboratory, which is located in Budapest, Hungary; there are few, if any, other sources in the world for commercial quantities of current Good Manufacturing Practice (c-GMP) cyclodextrin complexes.  While we continue to purchase many of our cyclodextrin materials from Cyclodextrin Research & Development Laboratory, we also produce our own Aquaplex® materials. Additionally, we use third party manufacturers, such as Equinox Chemical in Albany, Georgia, to develop cyclodextrin complexes.   We historically have not had difficulties obtaining natural and chemically modified cyclodextrins from our suppliers and we do not expect to experience any difficulties obtaining adequate cyclodextrins for our current and expected expanded future needs.  
 
Customers
 
We currently sell our legacy fine chemical products directly to customers in the pharmaceutical, diagnostics, and industrial chemical industries, and to chemical supply distributors.  For the year ended December 31, 2018, our revenues consisted of 17% biopharmaceuticals, 71% basic natural and chemically modified cyclodextrins, and 12% cyclodextrin complexes.
 
Our cyclodextrin sales historically involve small quantities (i.e., less than 1.0 kg).  We sell directly to our customers, package the orders at our facility and ship using common carriers.  
 
The majority of our revenues are from five to ten customers who have historically been repeat purchasers. In 2018 and 2017, one customer (UNO Healthcare, Inc.) accounted for 15% and 23% of our total revenue, respectively.  Sigma-Aldrich Fine Chemical, Inc. accounts for almost 95% of our 2018 and 2017 annual sales of Aquaplex®. In a given year, we typically sell to fewer than 200 individual customers. Our industrial customers buy products from us as needed primarily for product research and development purposes.  Therefore, it is difficult to predict future sales from these customers, as it is dependent on the current cyclodextrin related research and development activities of others, which we have monitored in the past by following  the issuance and applications of patents in the US and elsewhere.

We intend to continue promoting the use of Trappsol® and Aquaplex® products in the research and product development activities of existing and new customers and clients.
 
Competition
We face competition in the commercialization of our Trappsol® Cyclo™ orphan drug product. An effort to pursue a similar product has been announced by another company, and the disclosed team is composed of professionals in the finance and pharmaceutical industries. We believe our longstanding efforts, our close connections with patient advocacy groups in the U.S. and Europe, and the fact that we have a finished product currently in use in human patients all give us a competitive advantage.
 
We have also noted increased competition for the distribution of small quantities of cyclodextrins. Those we have examined are small operations or small offerings of a larger distributor that lack the focus and depth of expertise offered by the Company. They are also most often not price competitive with our products. We believe there is a perceived barrier to entry into the cyclodextrin industry because of the lack of general experience with cyclodextrins. We have established business relationships with many of the producers and consumers of cyclodextrins worldwide and, over more than 30 years, we have developed an unmatched experience database. We believe these relationships and market knowledge provide significant business advantages.
 
Research and Development
 
We are currently pursuing clinical programs in the U.S., Europe and Israel in an effort to gain market authorization of our bio-pharmaceutical product for the treatment of NPC. We have made a substantial investment in the research and development of our Trappsol® Cyclo™ product as we seek approval for marketing the product for the treatment of NPC. We are also exploring the use of cyclodextrins in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. We will continue to expend substantial funds in support of these efforts with the progression of our clinical trials, which we commenced in 2017. Research and development expenses increased to approximately $2,711,000 in 2018, from $2,293,000 in 2017.
 
We also conduct research and development focused on the improvement of our manufacturing processes. We occasionally initiate research to develop a new product such as a novel cyclodextrin complex that has promising applications and is not otherwise available.  We do not currently conduct, nor have we historically conducted, research and development activities or on behalf of or jointly with our customers.  Our clients bear their own research and development costs.   
 
Government Regulation
 
The development, production and marketing of biological products, which include the proposed use of Trappsol® Cyclo™ to treat disease, including NPC, are subject to regulation for safety, efficacy and quality by numerous governmental authorities in the U.S. and other countries. In the U.S., the development, manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceuticals are subject to extensive regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The FDA, and comparable agencies in foreign countries, not only assesses the safety and efficacy of these products but also regulate, among other things, the testing, manufacture, labeling, storage, record-keeping, advertising and promotion of such products. The process of obtaining FDA and foreign regulatory approval for a new pharmaceutical is costly and time-consuming.
 
Under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the FDA is also given comprehensive authority to regulate the development, production, distribution, labeling and promotion of food and food additives. The FDA’s authority includes the regulation of the labeling and purity of our food additive and nutraceutical products. In the event the FDA believes any company is not in compliance with the law, the FDA can institute proceedings to detain or seize products, enjoin future violations or assess civil and/or criminal penalties against that Company.

Trappsol® Cyclo™ has been granted orphan drug status by the FDA. It has been used by a limited number of customers for the treatment of NPC under the supervision of a physician following an Investigational New Drug (IND) protocol approved by the FDA. All of our other products are sold for our customers’ research and development purposes only, and do not require FDA approval. Any use in humans as a drug or food product would require compliance with FDA regulations. Under present FDA regulations, FDA defines drugs as “articles intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment or prevention of disease in man.” In 2014, the Company submitted a Type II Drug Master File (DMF) to the FDA for Trappsol® Cyclo™ and it was accepted for filing. This DMF (#028889) can now be cited by researchers seeking IND approval for use of Trappsol® Cyclo™ in the treatment of disease. This same product is also the focus of a clinical program to achieve market authorization in Europe. As such it will be subject to the regulatory authorities in that jurisdiction including, but not limited to, the European Medicines Agency (EMEA). Trappsol® Cyclo™ has also been designated an orphan drug in Europe.
 
Our IND for Trappsol® Cyclo™ as a treatment for NPC was approved by the FDA in September 2016, and in January 2017 the FDA granted Fast Track designation to Trappsol® Cyclo™ for the treatment of NPC. Initial patient enrollment in the U.S. Phase I study commenced in September 2017. We have also filed Clinical Trial Applications for a Phase I/II clinical study with several European regulatory bodies, including those in the United Kingdom, Sweden and Italy, and in Israel, all of which have approved our applications. The European Phase I/II study will evaluate the safety of Trappsol® Cyclo™ along with a range of clinical outcomes, including neurologic, hepatic, and respiratory, in addition to measurements of cholesterol metabolism and markers of NPC. The European study is similar to the U.S. study, providing for the administration of Trappsol® Cyclo™ intravenously to NPC patients every two weeks in a double-blind, randomized trial. The first patient was dosed in this study in July 2017.
 
There have been a number of federal and state legislative changes made over the last few years regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical products, government control and other changes to the healthcare system of the U.S. It is uncertain how such legislative changes will be adopted or what actions federal, state or private payers for medical goods and services may take in response to such legislation. We cannot predict the effect such healthcare changes will have on our business, and no assurance can be given that any such reforms will not have a material adverse effect.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, we employed five people on a full-time basis. None of our employees belong to a union.  We believe relations with our employees are good.
