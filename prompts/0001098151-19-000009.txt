ITEM 1: BUSINESS

within the 2018 Annual Report to Shareholders, incorporated by reference.  The service area is comprised of the Borough of Dunmore and the surrounding communities within Lackawanna and Luzerne counties in Northeastern Pennsylvania.  In 2018, the Company had 6.12% of the Scranton-Wilkes-Barre metropolitan statistical area’s total deposit market share ranking 7th in total deposits. The Company had 181 full-time equivalent employees on December 31, 2018, which includes exempt officers, exempt, non-exempt and part-time employees.
 The banking business is highly competitive, and the success and profitability of the Company depends principally on its ability to compete in its market area.  Competition includes, among other sources: local community banks; savings banks; regional banks; national banks; credit unions; savings & loans; insurance companies; money market funds; mutual funds; small loan companies and other financial services companies.  The Company has been able to compete effectively with other financial institutions by emphasizing customer service enhanced by local decision making.  These efforts enable the Company to establish long-term customer relationships and build customer loyalty by providing products and services designed to address their specific needs.
 The banking industry is affected by general economic conditions including the effects of inflation, recession, unemployment, real estate values, trends in national and global economies and other factors beyond the Company’s control.  The Company’s success is dependent, to a significant degree, on economic conditions in Northeastern Pennsylvania, especially within Lackawanna and Luzerne counties which the Company defines as its primary market area.  An economic recession or a delayed economic recovery over a prolonged period of time in the Company’s market could cause an increase in the level of the Company’s non-performing assets and loan losses, and thereby cause operating losses, impairment of liquidity and erosion of capital.  There are no concentrations of loans that, if lost, would have a material adverse effect on the continued business of the Company.  There is no material concentration within a single industry or a group of related industries that is vulnerable to the risk of a near-term severe impact.  
 The Company’s profitability is significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions, changes in market interest rates, government policies and actions of regulatory authorities.  The Company’s loan portfolio is comprised principally of residential real estate, consumer, commercial and commercial real estate loans.  The properties underlying the Company’s mortgages are concentrated in Northeastern Pennsylvania.  Credit risk, which represents the possibility of the Company not recovering amounts due from its borrowers, is significantly related to local economic conditions in the areas where the properties are located as well as the Company’s underwriting standards.  Economic conditions affect the market value of the underlying collateral as well as the levels of adequate cash flow and revenue generation from income-producing commercial properties. 
 During 2018, the national economy continued to improve with the unemployment rate dropping to 3.9% compared to 4.1% at the end of 2017.  The unemployment rate in the Company’s local statistical market, Scranton-Wilkes-Barre, fell to 4.8% from 5.0% at the end of 2017.  The local economy has been volatile in recent years and generally lags the national market trends.  The Company’s credit function strives to mitigate the negative impact of economic conditions by maintaining strict underwriting principles for commercial and consumer lending and ensuring that home mortgage underwriting adheres to the standards of secondary market makers.  In addition, the Company strives to accelerate the property foreclosure process thereby lessening the negative financial impact of foreclosed property ownership.  Refer to Item 1A, “Risk Factors” for material risks and uncertainties that management believes affect the Company.
