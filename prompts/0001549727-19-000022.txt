DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
 
We were incorporated on February 16, 2017 in the State of Nevada. We were initially a travel agency that organizes individual and group tours in the Dominican Republic, such as cultural, recreational, sport, business, ecotours and other travel tours. Starting December 27, 2018, associated with the change of management, we expand our business operations to the research and development of yacht manufacturing, tourism, pier, real estate operations and the application of new energy saving technologies. 
 In 2018, we made a detailed market research of Asia and decided to expand our Marine tourism business in Taiwan, China and Southeast Asia, where Marine tourism is booming.
 By means of yacht sharing, we have increased the number of yachts that can be rented to provide services for more customers, who can use yachts for island jumping, boarding, diving and fishing.
 We have developed an Internet ON-LINE platform that allows us to do business globally. The platform connects customers and businesses around the world, and customers can book travel services in the regions where we do business through the APP. There will be two main sections in our business: 
 
(1)In mainland China and Taiwan, we will carry out the development, sales and operation of new energy electric yachts and traditional power yachts, covering the entire yacht industry chain. Through the Internet platform, we will provide our own proprietary and third-party yacht tourism products, covering the best coastal tourism attractions in Taiwan and China including Hainan, Guangdong, Xiamen, and Quanzhou. 
 
(2)For the global energy market, we develop a series of oil and gas energy-saving products with new energy-saving technologies. This cross-century energy-saving solution can be applied in various scenarios with oil and natural gas as energy sources. Experiments have shown that achieving energy efficiency of up to 50% in the field of large boiler energy saving has a huge market prospect. This energy-saving innovative technology will also be applied to new energy-saving ships and traditional boat reconstruction equipment to save energy. This innovative technology will bring new changes to the yachting industry and promote a low carbon journey for tourists to protect the global environment. 
 
In the field of yacht manufacturing, the company has developed a series of new energy saving yacht for environmental protection, which can be used in waters with strict environmental protection requirements,. In the field of marine tourism, the number of yachts that can be rented has been increased through yacht sharing program system, which can provide services for more customers. In the field of yacht real estate, we are actively developing wharfs. Two wharf projects have reached development intentions with the local government, with a total berth of more than 600.The application of new energy-saving technology has begun trial operation, and market work will be carried out in an all-round way after achieving ideal results.
