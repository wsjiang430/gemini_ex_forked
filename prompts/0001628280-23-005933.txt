Business Overview
ESS is a long-duration energy storage company specializing in iron flow battery technology. We design and produce long-duration batteries predominantly using earth-abundant materials that we believe can be cycled over 20,000 times without capacity fade. Because we designed our batteries to operate using an electrolyte of primarily salt, iron and water, they are non-toxic and substantially recyclable. Our batteries provide flexibility to grid operators and energy assurance for commercial and industrial customers. Our technology addresses energy delivery, duration and cycle life in a single battery platform that compares favorably to lithium ion batteries, the most widely deployed alternative technology. Using our second-generation S200 iron flow battery technology, we are developing two products, the Energy Warehouse and the Energy Center, each of which is able to provide reliable, safe, long-duration energy storage. As of December 31, 2022, we had a limited number of second-generation products fully deployed for which we recognized revenue. We have shipped and were in the process of installing and commissioning additional second-generation Energy Warehouse at December 31, 2022. With each battery deployed, we will further our mission to accelerate the transition to a zero-carbon energy future with increased grid reliability.
Our batteries are non-flammable, non-toxic, do not have explosion risk and can operate in temperatures ranging from -5°C to 50°C without requiring heating or cooling systems. This allows our energy storage products to be located in sites where lithium-ion batteries cannot be placed due to fire, chemical or explosion risks. In addition, our batteries are environmentally sustainable, predominantly utilizing easily sourced materials and recyclable components. 
Our batteries and technology can be purchased with an extended ten-year warranty which is backed by investment-grade, ten-year warranty and project insurance policies from Munich Re, a leading provider of reinsurance, primary insurance and insurance-related risk solutions, which stands behind the performance of our energy storage products. To our knowledge, we are the first long-duration energy storage company to receive this type of insurance, which provides a warranty backstop for our proprietary flow battery technology, supporting our performance obligations regardless of project size or location and de-risking the technology for our customers. We have also collaborated with Munich Re to develop separate project financing coverage for our customers. This project financing coverage provides warranty continuity insurance in the event of our insolvency, providing long-term assurance of project performance to our customers and their investors and lenders. Bonding and surety capital is provided through OneBeacon Insurance Group (“OneBeacon”) as well as qualification from the U.S. Export-Import Bank, which provides additional product assurance. We believe each of these elements allows us to increase our total addressable market, as potential customers have reduced technology risk, financing risk and importing risk.
We believe that as we scale up our production, our battery technology will be priced competitively. When comparing products on a lifetime levelized cost of storage (“LCOS”) basis, which is the total cost of the investment in an electricity storage technology divided by its cumulative delivered electricity, we expect our batteries to be less expensive on a LCOS basis than lithium-ion alternatives for storage durations greater than four hours, which we believe is the operational maximum for lithium-ion technologies. Our cost advantage increases as the storage duration extends beyond four hours because of the scalable nature of our technology.

Energy storage solutions of various sizes and durations must be installed throughout global electrical grids to enable decarbonization in line with global climate objectives. Our energy storage products are intended to supply long-duration power across this expanding spectrum of use cases. As described below in the subsection entitled “—Our Technology and Products,” we believe our energy storage products will be capable of addressing customer needs across multiple use cases and markets. We are an early mover in long-duration energy storage and we believe we will enable more rapid implementation of renewable energy while also improving grid stability. The safety, flexibility and durability of our energy storage products enable customers to use them in nearly any location globally. Examples of use cases range from localized energy storage at commercial and industrial sites to grid-scale use cases, such as peaker plant replacement and grid stabilization.
Our Technology and Products
Our long-duration iron flow batteries are the product of nearly 50 years of scientific advancement. In the 1970’s, researchers first developed the concept of iron flow batteries. Despite realizing the battery’s promising ability to store energy, these researchers found that the reaction between the positive and negative sides created hydroxide formations that clogged the electrodes and reduced the activity of the electrolytes. Hydroxide formation caused rapid degradation in early iron flow batteries after only a few cycles. Unable to prevent the hydroxide from forming, these scientists were forced to abandon their work.
After years of neglect, our founders, Craig Evans and Dr. Julia Song, began advancing this technology in 2011 and formed Legacy ESS. Building upon this promising concept, our team has significantly enhanced the technology, improved round-trip efficiency and developed an innovative and patented solution to the hydroxide build-up problem. Our proprietary solution to eliminate the hydroxide formation is known as the Proton Pump, and it works by utilizing hydrogen generated by side reactions on the negative electrode. The Proton Pump converts the hydrogen back into protons in the positive electrolyte. This process eliminates the hydroxide and stabilizes the pH level of the system. The Proton Pump allows the electrolyte to be used for the 20,000 cycle-design without capacity fade.
Our iron flow batteries store energy by converting electrical energy into chemical energy. Each battery module is made up of one or more cells and each of these cells are made up of a negative electrode and a positive electrode, and these two electrodes are separated by a porous separator. On the positive side (positive electrode) of the battery during charge, ferrous iron (Fe+2) is oxidized into ferric iron (Fe+3) and on the negative side (negative electrode) of the battery, ferrous iron is reduced to iron metal. The porous separator is used to minimize the positive and the negative electrolyte from mixing, which helps improve the coulombic efficiency of the battery. The positive and negative electrolytes are stored separately in tanks outside of the battery and this electrolyte is constantly pumped in and out of the battery while in operation. To convert the chemical energy back to electrical energy, the reaction is reversed; on the positive side of the battery, ferric iron is reduced to ferrous iron and on the negative side, metallic iron is oxidized into ferrous iron. During these charge and discharge cycles the pH of the positive and negative electrolyte can change dramatically. The Proton Pump ensures that the electrolyte pH remains stable and clear of any hydroxides. 
Our iron flow batteries store energy by charging positive and negative electrolyte tanks that are separated by a membrane. In order to release energy, we generate a reaction between the tanks via the membrane. The power generated is a factor of the membrane size, while the duration of storage we can offer is a factor of the tank sizes and the addition of electrolytes to the tank. The duration of stored energy can be independently varied from the power. We can increase the size of the electrolyte tanks at a relatively low cost, and the electrolyte, consisting of iron, potassium or sodium chloride and water, is extremely inexpensive. This allows for very low marginal costs of energy, making our technology attractive for long-duration energy storage.
Using our iron flow battery technology, we are developing two products, each of which is able to provide reliable, safe, long-duration energy storage. Our first energy storage product, the Energy Warehouse, is our “behind-the-meter” solution (referring to solutions that are located on the customers’ premise, behind the service demarcation with the utility) that offers energy storage ranging from 50 kilowatt (“kW”) to 90 kW and four to 12-hour duration. A 50 kW system, when used for eight hours of storage, can power the equivalent of 20 homes with a total output of 400 kilowatt-hours (“kWh”). Energy Warehouses are deployed in shipping container units, allowing for a fully turnkey system that can be installed easily at nearly any customer’s site. Potential use cases for Energy Warehouses include microgrids, peaker plant replacement on a small-scale and commercial and industrial (“C&I”) demand. For customers who require additional energy storage capacity, multiple units can be added to the same system. The first generation of our Energy Warehouse was deployed in 2015. Since then, all of our first-generation units have been returned to us except for two where the prototype trials continue. As of December 31, 2022, we had a limited number of second-generation products fully deployed for which we recognized revenue and were in the process of installing and commissioning additional second-generation Energy Warehouse units that had shipped.

Our second, larger scale energy storage product, the Energy Center, is a “front-of-the-meter” solution, meaning that it is designed for use in front of the service demarcation with the utility. Energy Center solutions are designed specifically for utilities, independent power producers (“IPPs”) and large C&I consumers. The Energy Center offers a fully customizable configuration range and is installed to meet our customers’ power, energy and duration needs. The Energy Center’s modular design allows the product to scale to meet IPP and utility-scale applications, including large renewable-plus-storage projects and standalone energy storage projects. The modular design of the Energy Center also allows for it to be flexibly configured to meet varying power and energy capacity needs and deployment in a variety of settings.
For both of our energy storage products, the intellectual property and points of differentiation are contained within the Proton Pump, power module and electrolyte. These components are protected by trade secrets, patents (both granted and in process) and years of research. The remainder of the Energy Warehouse and the Energy Center are intentionally designed to be easily produced. By using standard pumps and equipment and easily fabricated enclosures, our energy storage products can be assembled almost anywhere and produced at an efficient cost.
ESS’ Critical Technology
Customers
Our current and potential customers include utilities, IPPs and C&I end users. Our potential customers are interested in several use cases including solar shifting, peak shaving, price arbitrage, utility ancillary services and microgrids.
We intend to serve customers in both behind-the-meter and front-of-the-meter markets. In behind-the-meter applications, customers will use our energy storage products to reduce energy costs, integrate with renewable energy solutions to achieve corporate sustainability goals, and to enhance their energy resiliency. Behind-the-meter customers may include microgrids and small-scale C&I customers.
Front-of-the-meter customers, in contrast, are primarily utilities experiencing high rates of renewable energy penetration and requiring energy storage to help balance the grid, and IPPs who can leverage energy storage to improve the economics of renewable energy projects. These customers use our energy storage products to store energy on a utility scale that they can then utilize or sell to their customers when needed. Over time, we expect our front-of-the-meter customer base to expand to include additional types of energy suppliers. Current customers of ours include large utility companies. We also plan to sell products to IPPs.

We have designed the Energy Warehouse and Energy Center to address the needs of these two distinct markets. The Energy Warehouse is intended for behind-the-meter use owing to its small size and convenient turnkey packaging. The Energy Center can be used by larger customers in both the behind-the-meter and front-of-the-meter markets.
Suppliers
Our batteries are made predominantly of earth-abundant, non-toxic materials. These materials are considerably less expensive than rare earth metals that make up other batteries and as a result make up a low percentage of the total costs for our batteries. Because these materials are widely available, there are multiple suppliers for each input. In addition, we use limited high cost materials such as platinum in our manufacturing. While supply chain disruptions have impacted the ability of some of our suppliers to deliver certain components of our batteries to us in a timely manner as described in the section entitled “Part I—Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Technology, Products and Manufacturing—We depend on third-party suppliers for the development and supply of key raw materials and components for our energy storage products. We also depend on vendors for the shipping of our energy storage products. Continued delays in our supply chain and shipments could further harm our ability to manufacture and commercialize our energy storage products,” the mechanical elements and control systems of our batteries are comprised of commercially available equipment that can be supplied by multiple manufacturers.

We believe that we have enforceable intellectual property protection over all critical design elements as well as the key enabling technologies for iron flow batteries. We have developed a significant patent portfolio. We have over 175 patents that are granted or in the pipeline and an undisclosed number of trade secrets and identified patents. Without taking into account any possible patent term adjustments or extensions, the earliest these patents will begin to expire is 2028. We continually review our efforts to assess the existence and patentability of new intellectual, proprietary technology. We intend to leverage our iron flow expertise to drive innovation and are pursuing additional technological advancements.
Competition
The energy storage industry is highly competitive. The declining cost of renewable energy, the decrease in battery costs, improving battery technologies, and public financial support in the form of grants and tax incentives are shifting customer demands causing the industry to evolve and expand. The main competitive factors in the energy storage market include, but

are not limited to, safety and reliability, duration, performance and uptime, operational flexibility, asset life length and cyclability, ease of integration, operability in extreme temperatures, environmental sustainability, historical track record, and field-proven technology.
With the rising demand for clean electric power solutions with lower greenhouse gas emissions, there has been a transition to renewable energy sources and increasing penetration of distributed energy infrastructure. The proliferation of intermittent generating resources has created new challenges to electric grid stability, and thus an opportunity for an increased role for long-duration energy storage solutions. Climate change will also result in more unpredictable weather events including extreme temperatures, hurricanes and wildfires. Our technology can operate efficiently and effectively in these extreme weather conditions. Our key competitors include different energy storage technologies such as lithium-ion batteries, lithium metal batteries, vanadium or zinc bromine batteries, sodium sulfur batteries, compressed air, hydrogen, fuel cell and pumped-storage hydropower. Key competitors in the traditional lithium-ion space include Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Limited, Energy Vault, LG Chem, Ltd., Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., Sungrow Power Supply Co., Ltd., and Tesla, Inc. Key competitors in the non-lithium-ion space include CellCube, CMBlu Energy AG, Enerox GmbH, Eos Energy Enterprises, Inc., Highview Power PTY Ltd., Honeywell UOP, Hydrostor, Lockheed Martin, Malta Inc., Redflow, and VoltStorage GmbH. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources than we do. Although we are small compared to our competitors, we believe we are well-positioned to compete with them in the market supported by our innovative iron flow battery technology, strategic partnerships and premier leadership team with a proven track record of success.
New technologies may enter the market that may have additional or superior advantages to our offerings. We believe there is significant government support available for energy storage technologies, and a variety of newer and emerging companies have announced plans to develop energy storage products using a variety of technologies, including compressed air, thermal energy, and solid-state batteries among others. Although many of these companies are not in commercial production today, they may in the future offer solutions that become competitive with our offerings. We intend to continuously improve our product offerings and maintain robust research and development efforts in order to stay ahead of existing and emerging competitors.
Government Regulations and Compliance
We operate in the heavily regulated energy sector. As such, there are a variety of federal, state and local regulations and agencies that impact our operations. As a participant in the renewable energy sector specifically, there are additional regulations, tax incentives and support mechanisms in place to promote growth. Renewable energy is a priority for both the Biden administration and for many state and local governments across the country.
On the federal level, tax credits are currently in place that incentivize the deployment of renewable energy and battery storage. Battery storage projects storing energy from renewable energy sources are eligible for investment tax credits that allow project developers to monetize and sell the tax credits they experience from the creation of their projects. Additionally, battery storage is eligible for accelerated depreciation via the federal government’s Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System. Both policies provide tax and financing advantages for battery storage projects. They lower the capital requirements for renewable energy projects to be developed and open a new source of funding for these projects.
State incentives have also driven growth in the deployment of renewable energy and energy storage. States with high Renewable Portfolio Standards, for example, have seen greater deployment of renewables than states with similar renewable resources that lack such requirements. In many states, including Texas, Oklahoma and California, the RPS-driven deployment of intermittent renewables is straining the electric grid and thus driving demand for energy storage.
Incentives for renewable energy and grid upgrades in Australia may drive growth for battery and energy storage as well. The Australian Government’s Powering Australia plan includes an investment of AU$20 billion by 2030 for upgrades to the electricity grid to support more renewable power. At the state level, the government of Victoria has pledged to legislate Australia’s largest renewable energy storage targets: 2.6 gigawatts of renewable energy storage capacity by 2030 and 6.3 gigawatts of storage by 2035. New South Wales has also recognized the critical need for energy storage, calling for the procurement of 2 GW of long-duration energy storage in its Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap.
All of these governmental programs supporting demand for our products are complex and political in nature, and therefore are subject to repeal, amendment, and interpretation in ways less supportive of our growth.
In addition to benefiting from governmental laws and regulations supporting energy storage, we are subject to federal, state and local requirements on the environment, health, safety and employment. Our manufacturing process is subject to environmental regulations, and our products are subject to regulations addressing safety and reliability. We are also subject to the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Act, local wage regulations and rigorous health and safety regulations in the State of Oregon.
