GENERAL
Background
On July 6, 2022, Schweitzer-Mauduit International, Inc. ("SWM") consummated its previously announced merger transaction involving Neenah, Inc. ("Neenah"). A wholly-owned subsidiary of SWM merged with and into Neenah (the "Merger"), with Neenah surviving the Merger as a direct and wholly-owned subsidiary of SWM. Effective as of the closing date of the Merger, SWM changed its name to Mativ Holdings, Inc. ("Mativ," "we," "our," or the "Company"). Mativ is a global leader in specialty materials headquartered in Alpharetta, Georgia, United States of America. The Company offers a wide range of critical components and engineered solutions to solve customers' most complex challenges, targeting premium applications across diversified and growing end-markets. Combined with global manufacturing, supply chain, innovation, and material science capabilities, our broad portfolio of technologies combines polymers, fibers, and resins to optimize the performance of customers' products across multiple stages of the value chain. 
Mativ was incorporated in Delaware in 1995 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Kimberly-Clark Corporation ("Kimberly-Clark"). On November 30, 1995, Kimberly-Clark transferred its tobacco-related paper and other paper products businesses conducted in the United States, France and Canada to the Company and distributed all of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company to its stockholders (the "spin-off"). As a result, the Company became an independent public company. Mativ and its subsidiaries manufacture on four continents, conduct business in over 100 countries and operate 47 production locations worldwide, with facilities in the United States, United Kingdom, China, Germany, France, Belgium, Poland, India, Brazil, Canada, Spain, Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands, Malaysia, and Luxembourg.
Our principal executive office is located at 100 North Point Center East, Suite 600, Alpharetta, Georgia 30022-8246 and our telephone number is (800) 514-0186. Our stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") under the symbol "MATV."
Strategic Narrative
The Company believes the Merger created a global leader in specialty materials with nearly $3.0 billion in sales, attractive margins, and approximately $65 million of anticipated synergies within 3 years, with value creation and growth opportunities exceeding what each legacy company could have achieved independently. We consider the Merger a transformational step in the competitive position of the combined entity. In addition to the expanded manufacturing and technology capabilities, our increased presence in growing end-markets and the powerful combination of our design and innovation programs are expected to offer significant commercial and operational benefits and the potential to accelerate long-term growth.
What started in 1995 for legacy SWM and 2004 for legacy Neenah as two lower growth companies with limited end-market exposure and manufacturing technologies, has culminated in the merger of separate but similar transformative journeys. Both companies evolved their respective portfolios toward large, growing, defensible categories that value a range of premium, unique engineered solutions. Over time, each company repositioned to a more diversified and growth-oriented enterprise while maintaining a company-wide focus on several underlying themes: focus on high-value categories, deep material science know-how, solution-driven product design and innovation, and customizable manufacturing capabilities to solve customers' complex challenges. The companies selectively targeted acquisition candidates that served diversified and growing end-markets, generated profitability associated with premium differentiated products, and had leading and defensible competitive positions in their core product categories. Over the last several years, each company successfully completed acquisitions which increasingly aligned the two business profiles, with about two-thirds of the overall businesses weighted towards higher growth categories.
In addition to having complementary marketplace touch-points in key growing product categories, such as filtration, healthcare, packaging, and specialty tapes, the Company sees strong trends supporting the positive outlook of our business, such as the need for clean air and water, personal health and wellness, performance coating solutions, and sustainable alternatives. The Company can address our customers’ and markets’ most complex and challenging needs by offering an expanded variety of manufacturing capabilities and technical solutions, ranging from advanced coating, engineered nonwovens, and polymer extrusion, to specialty adhesives—all core technologies that align with our target categories' evolving needs and increasing technical demands. We believe our ability to engineer unique material solutions for premium applications across a variety of industries gives Mativ a powerful value proposition and supports our ability to win in the marketplace.
With respect to synergies, the Company expects to achieve its $65 million plan within 3 years, with approximately half of these synergies coming from reductions in selling and general expenses and organizational efficiencies, and the other half from procurement and supply chain opportunities. Management also foresees longer-term synergies in new product development, cross-selling, and geographic expansion (e.g. leveraging the legacy SWM footprint in Asia to help the legacy Neenah business accelerate growth in the region).
As a result of past acquisitions and the Merger, Mativ is now a diversified specialty materials producer with a broad portfolio of technologies and a portfolio weighted towards growing markets, which management believes is well-positioned to deliver long-term profit growth. The Company operates in two primary segments, Advanced Technical Materials ("ATM") and Fiber-Based Solutions ("FBS"). ATM is the Company’s growth platform and will likely be the primary focus of future growth investments, which we expect to be concentrated in three key end-markets and categories – filtration, protective solutions, and release liners. FBS generally operates in more mature end-markets, though is highly profitable and generates strong cash flow. These segments are described further in the "Description of Business" section below. 
The management team has high conviction that our focus on solving customer’s problems with best-in-class service and technical capabilities with a rigorous focus on cost and capital deployment will deliver strong long-term results for our customers, employees, and shareholders. As such, entering 2023, the Company has clarified its ambition – to be the global leader in specialty materials, consistently driving growth by engineering bold, innovative solutions that solve our customers’ complex challenges. To achieve this ambition, the Company is aligned on three strategic pillars – lean into growth, focus our efforts, and drive value creation, as well as a unifying set of five values – Prioritize Safety, Be Curious, Win with Customers, Have a Voice, and Make it Happen. While we have brought two separate leading companies together, we have strong cultural alignment, a shared strategic vision, and a path to accelerated long-term growth.

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
Segment Financial Information. We operate and manage two reportable segments based on our product lines: ATM and FBS. ATM is comprised of the legacy SWM Advanced Materials & Structures segment and FBS is comprised of the legacy SWM Engineered Papers segment. As such, there were no changes to the historical results of these segments. The merged legacy Neenah segments have been allocated to ATM and FBS based on performance, market focus, technologies, and reporting structure. The ATM segment manufactures fiber, polymer, and resin-based products used in specialty applications in the filtration, protective solutions, release liners, healthcare, and industrials end-markets. The FBS segment primarily serves customers in the packaging, specialty papers, and engineered papers for the tobacco end-market. 
Additional information regarding "Segment Performance" is included in Part II, Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations". In addition, selected financial data for our segments is available in Note 21. Segment Information of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and a discussion regarding the risks associated with foreign operations is available in Part I, Item 1A. "Risk Factors".

Advanced Technical Materials
Products. We manufacture and sell a variety of highly engineered polymer, resin and fiber-based substrates, nets, films, adhesive tapes, and other nonwovens. These performance materials are often used in growing applications serving the filtration, protective solutions, release liners, and healthcare end-markets. Our manufacturing process consists of taking basic inputs, such as fibers and chemicals, to create highly engineered media, such as nonwovens, films, specialty paper, and advanced netting. We then further process our media through coating, saturating, adhesive application, and advanced converting manufacturing processes to impart specific product attributes that are valued by our customers, enhancing Mativ’s value proposition as a full solutions provider. With the growth of our ATM division, our technical expertise around the production, coating, and converting of polymer and resin-based materials is increasing. We believe we have industry-leading innovation capabilities and an expanding product portfolio which we expect to support growth through collaborative product development opportunities with our customers. 
Applications and Categories. The following are more detailed descriptions of our key products and applications:
Filtration: We produce highly engineered media and components aiding in the separation and purification of air and liquids for a variety of applications. Our primary products include fiber and polymer based nonwoven media and thermoplastic nets that are sold to filter manufacturers who, in turn, incorporate our media in the final filter assembly. Primary filtration applications for our media include:
•water – reverse osmosis and waste water treatment
•transportation – air intake, oil, fuel, and cabin air
•process – fluid purification for industrial manufacturing
•air – HVAC, air purification, and vapor permeation
Protective solutions: We manufacture our thermoplastic polyurethane films to have combinations of the following attributes: UV and scratch resistance, durability, and ultra-clarity. The ability to demonstrate these rare combinations make them ideally suited for demanding protective solutions, such as automotive paint protection films, which are typically installed in the after-market. Other key applications include ballistic-resistant and security reinforced glass used in various transportation modes (e.g. auto, aero, and train), electronics and specialty cameras (e.g. back-up cameras in vehicles), and other applications in the industrial (e.g. emerging “smartglass” products) and healthcare (e.g. diagnostic testing strips) end-markets. 
Release liners: We manufacture protective substrates that aid in the separation of a product from an adhesive for a diverse set of end-use applications. Leveraging our advanced coating capabilities, these protective substrates are typically produced by applying a specialty silicone coating to various base medias (primarily paper), then sold to customers who integrated into a final end-product solution. The key to these products is the ability to develop release characteristics that interface with a variety of adhesives, enabling separation (“peeling away”) without damage to the main product. Primary categories include personal care and hygiene, labels, specialty tapes, graphic arts, industrial specialties, composites, and other uses.
Healthcare: We are a turn-key provider with a broad portfolio of capabilities to support medical device manufacturing and support for a variety of health and wellness solutions. Using our advanced films, adhesive coating, and converting operations, our products are used in such demanding applications as wound care (both advanced technologies used in hospital settings and consumer products found in retail), medical device fixation, and consumer wellness (e.g. topical skin care and health & beauty applications).
Industrials: We leverage a diverse array of production techniques (e.g. resin extrusion, precision coating, and saturation) to manufacture specialty products, such as thermoplastic nets, specialty papers, and adhesive media/tapes, that serve specialty segments of large, global categories. A majority of these products are highly customized for specific, demanding applications in areas such as construction, automotive, home improvement, sporting goods, and agriculture. Some examples of our diverse product catalog include consumer-oriented specialty tapes, tape and abrasive backings, performance labels, cable wraps, support structures, and netting products for construction and packaging. 
Markets and Customers. The ATM segment supplies customers serving the filtration, protective solutions, release liners, healthcare, and industrials end-markets. Generally, the applications and customers the ATM segment serves are in growing end-markets, and as a percentage of total ATM segment net sales in 2022 were as follows: industrials – 34%, protective solutions – 22%, filtration – 21%, healthcare – 16%, and release liners – 7%. These products are highly engineered and often customized. In some cases, we are the sole supplier of certain products to our top customers, though no customer represents more than 10% of our consolidated net sales. Our products are generally used in markets that are directly affected by economic business cycles. Certain market segments, such as filtration, protective solutions, release liners, and healthcare are considered to be more resilient to economic downturns than more macro-correlated end-markets like those within industrials. Most products are performance-based and require extended qualification by customers; however, certain categories may also be subject to price competition and the substitution of lower cost substrates for some less demanding applications.
Sales and Distribution. ATM products are primarily sold by the marketing, sales and customer service organizations of our ATM operations as a component part directly to system integrators and downstream manufacturers, given the customized nature of many of our products. However, in some geographic regions, we use sales agents and distributors to assist us in the sales process. We typically deliver our products to customers by truck, rail and ocean-going vessels. 
Competition. Our ATM products are typically leaders in their respective categories and compete against specialty products made by competitors such as Shaoxing Naite Plastics Co. Ltd., 3M Company, Covestro AG, ORAFOL Europe GmbH, Hollingsworth and Vose Company, Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc, Avery Dennison, Ahlstrom-Munksjo, Mondi plc, Loparex LLC, Monadnock Paper Mills, Inc., and Potsdam Specialty Paper, Inc. We believe our ATM products compete primarily on product features, innovations and customer service across the end-markets we serve, particularly in healthcare, transportation, filtration, and release liners. Of the end-markets we 
serve, industrial is generally more price competitive due to a higher portion of products we sell in this end-market with generally lower technical requirements. 
Fiber-Based Solutions
Overview. Our FBS segment primarily produces packaging and specialty paper products, as well as engineered papers, using mainly natural and sustainable fibers. We produce a wide range of substrates at various thicknesses and with various attributes to meet the needs of our customers. Some examples of these value-added attributes include printability, color, texture, specialty finish, safety, and recycled content. While certain categories within this segment are mature, our products are aligned with trends towards sustainable alternatives, and we continue to evolve our business through innovation to diversify end-markets and enhance growth. Our manufacturing capabilities are flexible and nimble to service very specialized products at various order quantities efficiently, and our products are sold globally, though most prevalent in North America. 
Applications and Categories. The following are more detailed descriptions of our products and applications:
Packaging and specialty papers: We are a leading supplier of premium packaging, printing, and other high-end specialty papers, predominantly in North America. We participate in premium pockets of our categories with a wide portfolio of products and specialty manufacturing that is not easily replicated by commodity paper producers. Our premium packaging products are used for wine, spirits and beer labels, folding cartons, box wrap, bags, hang tags, and stored value cards servicing high-end retail, cosmetics, spirits, and electronics end-use markets. These papers are characterized by finishing, colors, textures and distinctive coating, which are valued by customers and incorporated into their branding and image. Our premium papers are primarily used in high-end commercial printing services, advertising collateral, stationery, corporate identity packages and brochures, direct mail, business cards, and a variety of other uses where colors, texture, coating, unique finishes, or heavier weight papers are desired. We also produce a variety of branded paper-based products for the consumer channel, such as bright papers, cardstock, stationery paper, envelopes, journals, and planners. 
Engineered papers: We are a leading producer of natural fiber-based solutions and services, primarily serving the combustibles tobacco market, as well as other niche applications. We have specialized manufacturing capabilities centered around lightweight papers and alternative fibers, creating highly technical products with unique features, such as fire safety and sustainability. Our combustibles products include conventional papers and filter wraps, low-ignition propensity papers that have embedded self-extinguishment fire-safety features, wrappers for small cigars, hemp-based alternatives, and we also produce reduced risk products (such as “heat-not-burn”) noncombustibles. In addition, we produce several other types of lightweight papers for other emerging applications and categories, such as lightweight packaging made from botanical and natural fibers, battery separators and energy storage papers, and laminates.
Markets and Customers. Our FBS segment is generally more mature given its exposures to commercial print and combustibles end-markets, both of which have historically demonstrated secular volume declines. FBS continues to reposition itself by leveraging its unique manufacturing capabilities and product innovation to diversify its end-markets and enhance growth, particularly by expanding in sustainable alternatives and premium packaging. Our packaging and specialty papers business serves a variety of end-use customers, primarily by selling to converters and printers who are producing products to meet the needs of designers, brand owners, and other end-users. We also sell direct to consumers through major retail channels. In engineered papers, we supply the major, and many of the smaller, cigarette and cigar manufacturers, including Philip Morris-USA, a subsidiary of Altria Group Inc., Philip Morris International ("PMI"), Imperial Brands Plc, Japan Tobacco Inc. ("JT"), and British American Tobacco ("BAT").
Sales and Distribution. In packaging and specialty papers, we primarily use our internal sales, marketing, and customer service organization to sell our products in a variety of channels including authorized paper distributors, converters, major national retailers, specialty business converters, and direct to end-users. For engineered papers, our internal sales, marketing, and customer service organization sell most of our products directly to customers or their designated converters. We typically deliver our products to customers by truck, rail and ocean-going vessels. 
Competition. Our packaging and specialty papers is a leading supplier of premium printing and other high-end specialty papers and packaging applications in North America, competing primarily in North America with Mohawk Fine Papers, Inc. and Monadnock Paper Mills, Inc. in specialty papers and with a highly fragmented competitor group in packaging. We believe the primary basis of competition for premium fine papers are product quality, customer service, product availability, promotional support, color and texture variety, and brand recognition. The specialized nature of our papers requires extensive know-how, specialized manufacturing capabilities, high service and operational excellence, all of which limits the ability of more commodity-oriented producers from competing in our categories.
The specialized nature of combustible papers requires unique papermaking equipment, technical expertise, and research and development capabilities to meet exacting customer specifications. These factors have limited the number of competitors capable of servicing global tobacco products manufacturers. Our principal competitors include delfortgroup AG ("delfort"), which licenses our LIP technology, Miquel y Costas & Miquel S.A. ("Miquel y Costas"), Julius Glatz GmbH ("Glatz") and PT Bukit Muria Jaya ("BMJ"). 
Seasonality. Generally, sales of our products are subject to seasonal fluctuations due to periodic machine downtime and typically lower order volumes in the fourth quarter. Quarterly sales fluctuations can also be influenced by inventory building and/or destocking by our customers. 
Raw Materials and Energy
We use a variety of resins, polymers, and synthetic fibers in our ATM products. We source a variety of commodity-grade resins, including polypropylene and polyethylene, as well as more specialized materials such as thermoplastic polyurethane. Resin prices can fluctuate significantly and can impact profitability. Commodity grade resin prices can sometimes correlate with crude oil prices while specialty resin prices often do not. We also source synthetic fibers (distinct from the natural fibers used in our FBS segment), such as polyester, and specialty pulps, such as mercerized pulp.
We have multiple sources for most of our raw material needs. For more commoditized inputs, the loss of a single supplier would not likely have a material adverse effect on our ability to procure needed raw materials from other suppliers. However, some of our specialty inputs are supplied by fewer manufacturers and our results could be more materially affected by the loss or disruption of supply of certain specialty resins or synthetic fibers from those producers. 
Wood pulp is the primary fiber used in our FBS segment. While FBS uses other specialty natural fibers, such as flax, in our operations, as well as a variety of specialty chemicals used in paper making, we believe that purchased raw materials are generally available from several sources.
Paper production uses significant amounts of energy, primarily electricity, natural gas and fuel oil. We believe that energy supply is generally reliable throughout our manufacturing footprint, although prices can fluctuate significantly based on demand. We enter into agreements to procure a portion of our energy requirements for future periods to reduce the uncertainty of future energy costs.
The majority of our energy requirements relate to electricity in the U.S., and Europe. We consider this to be a relatively stable energy source historically; however, the geopolitical events in Russia and Ukraine have resulted in volatile energy prices in Europe as well as temporary concerns about supply of energy sources, such as natural gas, in the region. Currently, while energy prices remain elevated versus historical levels, supplies appear to be stable.
Additional information regarding agreements for the supply of certain raw materials and energy is included in Note 20. Commitments and Contingencies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Research and Development
As of December 31, 2022, we employ approximately 140 research and development employees in research and laboratory facilities in France, Brazil, the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain and Mexico. We are dedicated to developing product innovations and improvements to meet the needs of individual customers. We believe our research and product development capabilities have played an important role in establishing our reputation for high quality, superior products in both our ATM and FBS segments. Within ATM, we have a history of finding innovative design solutions, including developing products that improve the performance of customers' products and manufacturing operations. We believe our commitment to research and development, coupled with our investment in new technology and equipment, has positioned us to take advantage of growth opportunities in many places around the world. Within FBS, our research and development has enabled us to establish and sustain leading shares. We also are working with customers to meet increasing demand for reduced-risk tobacco products, as well as hemp-based products. 
Intellectual Property
Patents, trade secrets and trademarks are an important part of Mativ’s intellectual property. Mativ’s products are sold around the world under various trademarks. Many of the processes used to make Mativ's products are kept as trade secrets. Mativ owns, or holds licenses to use, numerous U.S. and foreign patents. Mativ’s research and development activities generate a steady stream of inventions that are covered by new patents or trade secrets. In general, no single patent or group of related patents is material to the conduct of Mativ’s business as a whole or to any of Mativ’s business segments. At December 31, 2022, Mativ owned about 1,100 patents and patent applications globally.
Management of a large portion of Mativ's research and development activities is provided from our Luxembourg City, Luxembourg operation ("SWM Luxembourg"). These activities are often performed at other Mativ locations under contract by SWM Luxembourg, and funded by SWM Luxembourg. SWM Luxembourg has the authority to initiate and manage research and development projects across our businesses. This operation also provides global oversight and active management for much of the Company's intellectual property rights.
Human Capital
As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 7,500 full-time employees, of whom approximately 3,500 employees were located in North America, 3,300 employees were located in Europe, 450 employees were located in South America, and 250 employees were located in Asia Pacific. 
The Company’s ambition is to be the global leader in specialty materials, solving complex challenges for our customers, creating value for our shareholders, and offering meaningful professional opportunities for our global employees. 
Mativ’s talent strategy aligns closely with our core values – Prioritize Safety, Be Curious, Have a Voice, Win with Customers, Make It Happen – and focuses the organization on its goal of accelerating employee growth by fostering a culture of possibility and cultivating the right people in the right roles with the right skills at the right time. We are doing this by continually evolving how we attract, engage, grow, and reward our people. 
Safety 
The safety and well-being of our employees is very important to us. We strive to reflect this core value in everything we do and are in the process of launching our new continuous improvement process – IMPACT – designed to help deliver meaningful value, and most importantly, support robust safety systems for our employees. IMPACT, along with enhanced operator training, risk identification and proactive risk reduction strategies, is planned to be rolled out across manufacturing facilities starting in 2023. 
Each of our facilities maintains safety management systems designed to continuously review and improve employee safety and regulatory compliance. This includes periodic workplace safety audits, employee participation in safety 
meetings and training, and active safety committees. Additionally, employees are encouraged to identify and report workplace conditions that could lead to an injury. 
Training and Development 
Mativ recently launched MyPath, a platform that supports setting objectives, creating a culture of ongoing feedback, differentiating and rewarding individual performance, and creating global learning and development opportunities for our employees. 
In 2023, the Company intends to launch Employee Resource Groups ("ERGs") to connect employees through shared identity or affinity. These groups will be designed to provide networking opportunities for employees and create direct lines of communication between the ERGs and leadership to help address concerns, mitigate risks, and solve challenges. 
We are committed to building and developing a diverse workforce and have adopted policies designed to support equal employment opportunities to all qualified applicants, without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, age, protected veteran or disabled status, or genetic information.
Government Regulation
We are required to comply with numerous regulations that are normal and customary to businesses in the regions, industries, and markets in which we operate. These regulations include, but are not limited to, tax, employment, privacy, imports/exports, healthcare, environmental protection, antitrust, anti-corruption, marketing, fraud and abuse, product safety and efficacy, and other areas.
Governmental entities around the world have taken, or have proposed, actions that had, or are likely to have, the effect of reducing consumption of combustible and non-combustible tobacco products which, in turn, reduces demand for our products. These actions, including efforts to regulate, restrict or prohibit the sale, advertisement and promotion of these products and their components, to limit smoking in public places, to control or restrict additives that may be used in these products and to increase taxes on such products, are intended to discourage consumption.
Our facilities are subject to significant federal, state, local and foreign environmental protection laws with respect to air, water and emissions, as well as the disposal of solid waste. We believe we are operating in compliance with these laws and regularly incur capital and operating expenditures to achieve future compliance. Although we are not aware of any environmental conditions at any of our facilities that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, we own facilities in France, the United States, and elsewhere that have been operated over the course of many decades. Should the Company make material changes in the operations at a facility, it is possible such changes could generate environmental obligations that might require remediation or other action, the nature, extent and cost of which are not presently known. We may also face higher disposal and clean-up costs to replace equipment or facilities containing materials that were compliant when installed but are now considered contaminants. Additionally, as we sell closed or other facilities or materially alter operations at a facility, we may be required to perform additional environmental evaluations that could identify items that might require remediation or other action, the nature, extent and cost of which are not presently known. We may also incur environmental liabilities in connection with assets or businesses we may purchase in the future.
The Company is subject to laws concerning our business operations and marketing activities in foreign countries where we conduct business. For example, the Company is subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, U.S. export control and trade sanction laws, and similar anti-corruption and international trade laws in certain foreign countries, such as the U.K. Bribery Act. Aspects of the Company’s operations and businesses are also subject to privacy, data security, and data protection regulations, which impact the way we use and handle data and operate our products and services.
The Company is not aware of any regulatory compliance matters that are expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, competitive position, financial position, results of operations, capital expenditures or cash flows.
Environmental, Social and Governance
Building long-term value for our customers, employees and stockholders includes a focus on ensuring the long-term sustainability of our business, good corporate citizenship, and contributing to our communities. Corporate responsibility has long been part of the Mativ corporate mission and is one of our core values. 
Our manufacturing facilities and corporate office have a longstanding tradition of community engagement and reducing our impact on the environment. We maintain our Supplier Code of Conduct and our Sustainable Forestry Policy to further align with our sustainability goals. Our sustainability initiatives are further described on our corporate website at www.mativ.com. 
Some of our key environmental and community initiatives are highlighted below:
Environmental Initiatives
•Sustainable Packaging Material: The NEENAH ENVIRONMENT® Mailer is designed for the shipping or mailing of non-fragile soft goods, like clothing. The NEENAH ENVIRONMENT® Mailer is constructed from a proprietary, patent-pending, paper-based substrate developed to allow premium printability while providing superior water and puncture resistance. It is made with approximately 50% post-consumer waste and is blue-bin/curbside recyclable. In addition, it carries multiple 3rd party certifications, including FSC®, Green-e® and SmartWay™. 
•Sustainable Innovation: Mativ developed RevonexTM membrane backing paper which improves reverse osmosis filtration efficiency by eliminating bleed-through. In addition, Mativ developed a biodegradable cigarette filter media that is designed to replace cellulose acetate which contributes to microplastics pollution (or similar debris) in the ocean.
•Filtration Products that Benefit Society: Mativ produces a diverse portfolio of products that make water and air cleaner and safer. Our HVAC air filtration media can reach removal efficiencies as high as 99.9% while our ASD netting can provide up to a 20% decrease in pressure drop during Reverse Osmosis filtration, decreasing energy costs and allowing customers to provide energy efficient water filtration solutions. 
•Reducing Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions and Supporting Air Quality: We recognize the importance of reducing our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and have prioritized actions to reduce our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, such as the specific initiatives and equipment replacements intended to improve energy efficiency. We also currently have several renewable energy feasibility studies underway.
•Partnership with Planet Water Foundation: Mativ partners with Planet Water Foundation to support global efforts to improve access to clean, safe water. In 2022, through our support, the Foundation installed four AquaTower water systems in India, in the state of Tamil Nadu and three AquaHome systems in the Philippines. The four AquaTower systems in India are providing clean, safe drinking water for up to 7,224 people each day. The three AquaHome systems in the Philippines are providing families with solar powered electricity and drinking water at home.
•FSC® Certification: All unprocessed wood fiber and pulp and wood-based bioenergy consumed are sourced exclusively from suppliers maintaining FSC and/or PEFC Chain of Custody certification and/or have achieved FSC and/or PEFC Mix Credit or Controlled Wood certification. The packaging we use for our own business purposes (as opposed to the packaging we sell) is not necessarily certified or derived from certified suppliers, as we often purchase from small suppliers for whom certification is cost-prohibitive.
•Environmental Certification and Energy Efficiency: All 17 Mativ locations are certified to ISO 14001 for environmental management systems. Our mills in France are certified to the ISO 50001 energy management standard.
•Biodiversity Support: Mativ has a history of supporting local biodiversity initiatives, such as the installation of salmon and eel runs in the Isole River near our FBS facility in Quimperlé, France, and the planting of native trees and rebuilding of natural habitat near our plant in Santanesia, Brazil. 
•Recycling: Our U.S.-based ATM manufacturing sites have recycled more than 6 million pounds of plastic in 2022 with some of the recycled plastic being used in new products. Across the Company, more than 33 
million pounds of cardboard and paper were recycled. Many other initiatives are in place involving the reuse of waste products and packaging materials.
Community Initiatives
•In addition to investing in area communities where our facilities are located by providing jobs and sourcing products, we support efforts to make our communities stronger through financial donations and volunteer participation. Most of our philanthropic efforts are locally directed, empowering our employees to contribute their time and expertise to organizations that matter to them and serve the unique needs of their communities. We donate to nonprofit or community organizations that support the communities where our plants are located. 
We continue to look for ways to enhance the sustainability of our business and make a positive impact on the communities in which we live and serve. 
Governance
Mativ believes good corporate governance supports long-term value creation for our stockholders. The Governance section of the Investor Relations section of our website at www.mativ.com includes our Code of Conduct, by-laws, corporate governance guidelines, Board of Directors committee charters, as well as disclosure of any amendment to or waivers of our Code of Conduct granted to any of the principal executive officer, principal financial officer or principal accounting officer. Information from our website is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additional information about Mativ's governance can also be found in our proxy statement. 
Working Capital
We normally maintain approximately 50 to 90 days of inventories to support our operations. Our sales terms average between 15 and 60 days for payment by our customers, dependent upon the products and market segment served. With respect to our accounts payable, we typically carry approximately 15 to 40 days outstanding, in accordance with our purchasing terms, which vary by business location. The accounts payable balance varies in relation to changes in our manufacturing operations, particularly due to changes in prices of wood pulp, resins and purchased energy and the level and timing of capital expenditures related to projects in progress.
