ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Our Business — An Overview
NeuroMetrix is a commercial stage, innovation driven healthcare company combining neurostimulation and digital medicine to address chronic health conditions including chronic pain, sleep disorders, and diabetes. Our core expertise in biomedical engineering has been refined over nearly two decades of designing, building and marketing medical devices that stimulate nerves and analyze nerve response for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. We created the market for point-of-care nerve testing and were first to market with sophisticated wearable technology for management of chronic pain. We have an experienced management team and Board of Directors. Our business is fully integrated with in-house capabilities spanning product research and development, manufacturing, regulatory affairs and compliance, sales and marketing, and customer support. We derive revenues from the sale of medical devices and after-market consumable products and accessories. Our products are sold in the United States and select overseas markets. They are cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and regulators in foreign jurisdictions where appropriate. We have two principal product lines:

• | Wearable neurostimulation therapeutic devices


• | Point-of-care neuropathy diagnostic tests

Chronic pain is a significant public health problem. It is defined by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) as any pain lasting more than 12 weeks. This contrasts with acute pain which is a normal bodily response to injury or trauma. Chronic pain conditions include low back pain, arthritis, fibromyalgia, neuropathic pain, cancer pain and many others. Chronic pain may be triggered by an injury or there may be an ongoing cause such as disease or illness. There may also be no clear cause. Pain signals continue to be transmitted in the nervous system over extended periods of time often leading to other health problems. 
1

These can include fatigue, sleep disturbance, decreased appetite, and mood changes which cause difficulty in carrying out important activities and contributing to disability and despair. In general, chronic pain cannot be cured. Treatment of chronic pain is focused on reducing pain and improving function. The goal is effective pain management.
Chronic pain affects over 100 million adults in the United States and more than 1.5 billion people worldwide. The estimated incremental impact of chronic pain on health care costs in the United States is over $250 billion per year and lost productivity is estimated to exceed $300 billion per year. The most common approach to chronic pain management is pain medication. This includes over-the-counter (OTC) internal and external analgesics as well as prescription pain medications, both non-opioid or opioid. The approach to treatment is individualized, drug combinations may be employed, and the results are often hit or miss. Side effects and the potential for addiction are real and the risks are substantial. Increasingly, restrictions are being imposed on access to prescription opioids. Reflecting the complexity of chronic pain and the difficulty in treating, we believe that inadequate relief leads 25% to 50% of pain sufferers to seek alternatives to prescription pain medications. These alternatives include nutraceuticals, acupuncture, chiropractic care, non-prescription analgesics, electrical stimulators, braces, sleeves, pads and other items. In total these pain relief products and services account for approximately $20 billion in annual spending in the United States.
Nerve stimulation is a long-established category of treatment for chronic pain. In simplified terms, the mechanism of action involves triggering the body’s central pain inhibition system to suppress pain. This treatment approach is available through implantable spinal cord stimulation requiring surgery with its attendant risks. Non-invasive approaches involving transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) have achieved limited efficacy in practice due to device limitations, ineffective dosing and low patient adherence. Our Quell wearable technology for chronic pain addresses these limitations and has demonstrated its efficacy in multiple clinical studies. 
Diabetes is a worldwide epidemic with an estimated affected population of over 400 million people. Within the United States there are over 30 million people with diabetes and another 80 million with pre-diabetes. The annual direct cost of treating diabetes in the United States exceeds $100 billion. Although there are dangerous acute manifestations of diabetes, the primary burden of the disease is in its long-term complications which include cardiovascular disease, nerve disease and resulting conditions such as foot ulcers which may require amputation, eye disease leading to blindness, and kidney failure. The most common long-term complication of diabetes affecting over 50% of the diabetic population is nerve disease or diabetic neuropathy. Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is the primary trigger for diabetic foot ulcers which may progress to the point of requiring amputation. People with diabetes have a 15-25% lifetime risk of foot ulcers and approximately 15% of foot ulcers lead to amputation. Foot ulcers are the most expensive complication of diabetes with a typical cost of $5,000 to $50,000 per episode. In addition, between 16% and 26% of people with diabetes suffer from chronic pain in the feet and lower legs. 
Early detection of DPN is important because there are no treatment options once the nerves have degenerated. Today’s diagnostic methods for DPN range from a simple monofilament test for lack of sensory perception in the feet to a nerve conduction study performed by a specialist. Our DPNCheck technology provides a rapid, low cost, quantitative test for peripheral nerve disease, including DPN. It addresses an important medical need and is particularly effective in screening large populations likely susceptible to DPN. DPNCheck has been validated in numerous clinical studies.
Goals and Strategy
We believe that personalized neurostimulation to suppress pain can provide a valuable complement to pain medications and other treatments. Our Quell technology addresses this important medical need and we are uniquely positioned to make Quell available to chronic pain sufferers in the United States. We also recognize the worldwide need for an accurate, cost-effective technique to screen for diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Our DPNCheck technology was designed to address this specific need and is supported by an extensive body of clinical evidence. Our overall business objective is profitable growth led by targeted marketing of Quell and supported by an important contribution from DPNCheck. Profitable growth in the near term should include gross margin expansion, efficient deployment of operating spending and declining net cash consumption from operations. 
We are entering the second year of our collaboration with GlaxoSmithKline Healthcare (GSK). In early 2018 we entered into the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Development and Services Agreement and related documents with GSK, which we refer to as the “GSK collaboration,” pursuant to which we sold to GSK the rights to Quell in markets outside the United States in exchange for $26.5 million in milestone payments and an agreement to co-fund the Quell development program starting in 2019. We recently amended the GSK collaboration to restructure the milestones and related payments. This had the effect of accelerating the timing of the milestones and recognizing a time-value-of-money adjustment. Also, we agreed with GSK on the 2019 Quell development program which will be overseen by a joint development committee of NeuroMetrix and GSK representatives. In 2018 we received $14.7 million in milestone funding from GSK. In 2019 we expect to receive GSK funding 
2

from both milestone achievement and the Quell development program. While the payments are not determinable at this time, we believe that the GSK funding will be adequate to address our 2019 capital requirements.
Driving Profitable Growth with Key Proprietary Products.

• | Quell is an advanced, wearable technology for treating chronic pain. It can be worn during the day while active and at night while sleeping. Quell is drug-free and has been cleared by the FDA for treatment of chronic pain without a prescription. Quell has been shown in multiple clinical studies to relieve chronic pain and, in a published study, 4 out of 5 users reported improvement in chronic pain. Quell users can personalize and manage therapy discreetly via the Quell app. Quell also offers health tracking relevant to chronic pain sufferers including pain, sleep, activity, and gait. Quell users can synchronize their data with the Quell Health Cloud™, which provides customized feedback and powers one of the world’s largest chronic pain databases.

Quell was made commercially available in the United States in mid-2015. Quell product sales during 2018 totaled $10.5 million and cumulatively from launch have totaled $32.6 million. We have shipped over 180,000 Quell devices to customers. Quell is available via e-commerce on our QuellRelief website and Amazon, and at select retailers. We use television and digital promotion to expand brand awareness. In September 2018 we launched our next generation product Quell 2.0 with enhanced functionality. Quell 2.0 features a 50% reduction in device size and 20% increase in power capacity, an updated app with coaching, an intensive therapy option, and advanced personalization. 
In 2018 we initiated several key efforts to improve profitability:

• | User experience - launched Quell 2.0 with improved usability


• | User engagement - implemented focused, continuing user outreach to improve aftermarket sales


• | Distribution - restructured channels to emphasize e-commerce, minimize higher cost retail and home shopping


• | Cost of goods - launched Quell 2.0 incorporating a design for manufacturing efficiency


• | Pricing - launched Quell 2.0 at higher price and with bundling, subscription option for consumables


• | DPNCheck is a fast, accurate, quantitative diagnostic test for peripheral neuropathies, including diabetic peripheral neuropathy.

DPNCheck was made commercially available in late 2011. DPNCheck product sales in 2018 totaled $4.2 million and over the past three years totaled $12.1 million. We have shipped nearly 5,000 devices to customers. Our DPNCheck revenues are dominated by sales of high margin patient test biosensors. Our U.S. sales efforts focus on Medicare Advantage providers who assume financial responsibility and the associated risks for the health care costs of their patients. We believe that DPNCheck presents an attractive clinical case with early detection of neuropathy allowing for earlier clinical intervention to help mitigate the effects of neuropathy on both patient quality of life and cost of care. Also, the diagnosis and documentation of neuropathy provided by DPNCheck helps clarify the patient health profile which, in turn, may have a direct, positive effect on the Medicare Advantage premium received by the provider. DPNCheck is marketed in Japan by our distribution partner Fukuda Denshi; in China by OMRON Medical (Beijing) Ltd.; and in Mexico by Scienta Farma.
Research and Development Innovation for Competitive Advantage
Our products are proprietary and were developed in-house by our R&D team. We believe that continual product innovation, focusing in our unique competency of precision neurostimulation, is essential to profitable growth and to competitive advantage. In 2019 we will enter the joint development phase of our GSK collaboration. Quell projects will constitute the majority of our R&D development efforts and will be prioritized and overseen by a joint steering committee of NeuroMetrix and GSK representatives. Quell projects will be jointly funded as part of the GSK collaboration. In addition, our R&D team will provide DPNCheck engineering resources to address product maintenance and development requirements.

Our Business Model
Our products consist of a medical device used in conjunction with a consumable electrode or biosensor. Other accessories and consumables are also available to customers. Our commercial objective is to build an installed base of active customer accounts that regularly orders aftermarket products. We successfully implemented this model with our original NC-stat system and have applied it to subsequent product generations including ADVANCE. Our more recent products, Quell and DPNCheck, conform to this model. Our Quell user engagement initiative also specifically targets increased aftermarket sales.
Primary Marketed Products
Quell
Quell is a wearable device for relief of chronic pain such as nerve pain due to diabetes, arthritis, fibromyalgia and lower back problems. It incorporates a collection of proprietary approaches designed to optimize the clinical efficacy of nerve stimulation. These include high power electrical stimulation hardware with precise control, algorithms that automatically determine therapeutic stimulation intensity and compensate for nerve desensitization, and automated detection of user sleep and appropriate adjustment of stimulation level. Quell is comprised of (1) an electronic device that is placed in a neoprene band worn on the upper calf, (2) an electrode that attaches to the device and is the interface between the device and the skin, and (3) a smartphone app which may be used to control the device and visualize, understand and optimize data relating to chronic pain and health. The app is integrated with the Quell Health Cloud for storage of user data, data analytics and clinical research. The device is lightweight and can be worn during the day while active, and at night while sleeping. It has been cleared by the FDA for treatment of chronic pain and is available OTC. The device was made commercially available in June 2015. In a published clinical study, 81% of subjects reported an improvement in their chronic pain and health, and 67% reported a reduction in their use of pain medications. To encourage persons with chronic pain to try Quell, we offer a 60-day trial period during which the product can be returned for a full refund. To date, product returns have averaged approximately 25% which is broadly in line with the percentages of users who reported improvement in clinical results. Quell is available via e-commerce, select retailers and health care professionals. We utilize television promotion and digital advertising to expand product awareness. Cumulatively through 2018 over 180,000 Quell devices have been shipped to customers. 
DPNCheck
DPNCheck is a fast, accurate, and quantitative nerve conduction test that is used to evaluate systemic neuropathies such as diabetic peripheral neuropathy. It is designed to be used by primary care physicians, endocrinologists, podiatrists and other clinicians at the point-of-care to objectively detect, stage, and monitor DPN. The device measures nerve conduction velocity and response amplitude of the sural nerve, a nerve in the lower leg and ankle. These parameters are widely recognized as sensitive and specific biomarkers of DPN. DPNCheck is comprised of: (1) an electronic hand-held device and (2) a single patient-use biosensor. In addition, we provide users with PC-based software that links to the device via a USB connection thereby allowing physicians to generate reports and manage their test data.
DPNCheck is a modified version of our previously marketed NC-stat nerve testing device that has the same clinical indications with respect to DPN. The modified device costs less than the original device but has the same functionality with respect to sural nerve testing. More than 3 million patient studies have been performed using our NC-stat technology. Our technology has been the subject of many published studies, including several studies specifically addressing the accuracy and clinical utility of the device in assessment of DPN. Cumulatively through 2018 nearly 5,000 DPNCheck devices have been shipped to customers.
ADVANCE System
Our legacy neurodiagnostics business is primarily the ADVANCE System which is a comprehensive platform for the performance of traditional nerve conduction studies. The ADVANCE System is comprised of: (1) the ADVANCE device and related modules, (2) various types of electrodes, and (3) a communication hub that enables a physician’s office to network the device to their office computers and to our servers for data archiving, report generation, and other network services. The ADVANCE System is used with proprietary nerve specific electrode arrays. These electrode arrays combine multiple individual electrodes and embedded microelectronic components into a single patient-use disposable unit. We currently market seven different nerve-specific electrode arrays but do not actively market the ADVANCE device.
Historically, the ADVANCE System was marketed to a broad range of physician specialties including neurologists, orthopedic surgeons, primary care physicians, and endocrinologists, and utilized for a variety of different clinical indications 
4

including assessment of carpal tunnel syndrome, or CTS, low back and leg pain, and DPN. It is most commonly used in the assessment of CTS. Numerous papers have been published on the use of this technology in this clinical application. As of December 31, 2018, we had an installed base of approximately 250 active customers for the ADVANCE System.
The following chart summarizes our previously and currently marketed products.

Cumulatively through December 31, 2018, over 180,000 Quell devices have been shipped. DPNCheck customers include managed care organizations, endocrinologists, podiatrists and primary care physicians in the United States and distributors in Europe, Japan, China, the Middle East and Mexico. Cumulatively through December 31, 2018 nearly 5,000 DPNCheck devices have been shipped to customers. Our legacy ADVANCE System customers include approximately 250 active accounts covering primary care, internal medicine, orthopedic and hand surgeons, pain medicine physicians, neurologists, physical medicine and rehabilitation physicians, and neurosurgeons.
At December 31, 2018, two customers accounted for 45% of accounts receivable and two customers accounted for 23% of revenue.
Sales, Marketing, and Distribution
Quell is distributed in the United States via e-commerce including the Company’s website www.quellrelief.com and Amazon, and via select retailers and health care professionals. We utilize television promotion and digital advertising to expand product awareness.
Our U.S. sales efforts for DPNCheck focus on Medicare Advantage organizations and providers who assume financial responsibility and the associated risks for the health care costs of their patients. We believe that DPNCheck presents an attractive clinical case with early detection of neuropathy allowing for earlier clinical intervention to help mitigate the effects of neuropathy on both patient quality of life and cost of care. Also, the diagnosis and documentation of neuropathy provided by DPNCheck helps clarify the patient health profile which, in turn, may have a direct, positive effect on the Medicare Advantage premiums received by the provider. We believe that attractive growth opportunities exist outside the United States, including Japan where DPNCheck is sold by our distribution partner Fukuda Denshi; in China where DPNCheck is sold by Omron Beijing Ltd.; and in Mexico where DPNCheck is sold by Scienta Farma.
Our installed base of ADVANCE accounts is supported by marketing and our customer service department. We are not actively pursuing new ADVANCE customers. Internationally, ADVANCE sales and account support is handled by our network of independent distributors.
Quell sales and marketing efforts are led by our Senior Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer. Sales and marketing efforts for DPNCheck and ADVANCE are led by our Senior Vice President, General Manager, Diagnostics. We provide 
5

technical, clinical, and business practices training for our commercial employees including sales and marketing, and customer service.
Manufacturing and Supply
We perform final assembly and servicing of our Quell and DPNCheck devices at our manufacturing facility in Massachusetts. The ADVANCE device which is no longer in production but for which we continue to sell accessories, is serviced by us. Outside suppliers provide us the sub-assemblies and components that we use in manufacturing Quell and DPNCheck, as well as our consumable products including biosensors and electrodes. We maintain alternative suppliers for some but not all of the sub-assemblies and key components. Consumable biosensors and electrodes are manufactured to our specifications by two long standing suppliers. In outsourcing, we target companies that meet FDA, International Organization for Standardization, or ISO, and other quality standards supported by internal policies and procedures. Supplier performance is maintained and managed through a corrective action program ensuring all product requirements are met or exceeded. Following the receipt of products or product components from our third-party manufacturers, we conduct the necessary inspection, final assembly, packaging, and labeling at our manufacturing facility. We believe that our manufacturing relationships minimize our capital investment, provide us with manufacturing expertise, and help control costs.
Sunburst EMS, Inc., or Sunburst, has been manufacturing devices and providing sub-assemblies to us since 2005. Sunburst currently manufactures sub-assemblies for Quell and DPNCheck at a facility in Massachusetts. MC Assembly, Inc., or MC Assembly, has manufactured sub-assemblies for Quell at a facility in Massachusetts since 2016.
Johnson Medtech, LLC, or Johnson, has been manufacturing ADVANCE electrodes for us since 1999, currently at a facility in Ohio. Katecho, Inc., a full service original equipment manufacturer (or OEM) based in Iowa and specializing in medical and cosmetic devices, manufactures DPNCheck biosensors and Quell electrodes under normal commercial terms contained in our purchase orders. 
We are registered with the FDA and subject to compliance with FDA quality system regulations. As a registered device manufacturer, we undergo regularly scheduled FDA quality system inspections, are subject to periodic inspections by state agencies and, if deemed necessary by the FDA, additional inspections may occur. We are also ISO registered and undergo frequent quality system audits by a European agency. ADVANCE and DPNCheck are cleared for marketing within the United States, Canada and the European Union. DPNCheck is also cleared for marketing in Japan, China and Mexico. Our neurostimulation systems for chronic pain, are cleared for marketing in the United States, Canada, the European Economic Area, and Australia; however, under terms of the agreements with GSK executed in 2018, our accessible market is restricted to the United States.
Research and Development
We believe that we have research and development (R&D) capability that is unique to the industry with over two decades of experience in developing diagnostic and therapeutic devices involving the precision stimulation and measurement of nerve signals for clinical purposes. Our company has extensive experience in neurophysiology, biomedical instrumentation, signal processing, biomedical sensors, and information systems.
Our R&D team works closely with our marketing group and customers to design products that are focused on improving clinical outcomes. The team consists of ten people including two who hold M.D. degrees and three who hold Ph.D. degrees. Our founder and Chief Executive Officer is extensively involved with our R&D efforts. He holds both M.D. and Ph.D. degrees and coordinates the clinical programs that are supported by NeuroMetrix.
R&D efforts currently encompass the following areas:

• | Quell Innovation. Quell utilizes our proprietary wearable nerve stimulation technology to provide relief from chronic pain which can encompass lower back problems, fibromyalgia, arthritis, painful diabetic neuropathy and others. Quell is unique among OTC neurostimulation products in its clinical indications, technology, personalization and digital health features. While our R&D efforts to date have provided us first-to-market advantage, we anticipate that success will attract competition and that we must continually innovate to maintain a leadership position. Starting in 2019 our Quell development efforts will be overseen by a joint steering committee of NeuroMetrix and GSK representatives and will be co-funded by both NeuroMetrix and GSK. Also, we intend to continually strengthen our intellectual property position with the development of additional know-how and a growing body of patent applications.

• | Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) Improvement. We have identified specific opportunities to reduce Quell COGS, with both near-term and longer-term initiatives underway. Lower COGS would improve gross margins and product profitability. The COGS initiatives involve R&D support as well as investment in engineering design and equipment. 


• | Support for DPNCheck. DPNCheck, our quantitative nerve conduction test for peripheral neuropathies including DPN, has experienced growing demand in the Medicare Advantage market in the United States, in Japan and in Mexico. DPNCheck has regulatory clearance in China and is in the early stages of building the market. The characteristics of new markets often require device modification for local acceptance which, in turn, involves our R&D team. 


• | Support clinical studies for our wearable technology. Quell is an FDA-cleared Class 2 medical device. We plan to continue to build the body of evidence from clinical studies that is foundational to Quell credibility among health care professionals and supports our marketing efforts. 

Clinical Program
Our clinical program operates under the direction of our Chief Executive Officer. This may from time-to-time be comprised of internal, collaborative, and external clinical studies. Internal clinical studies are designed and implemented directly by us for the purposes of product design and early clinical validation. Collaborative studies are conducted together with leading researchers around the world to provide clinical validation and to explore the clinical utility of our products. External studies are entirely independent of us, although in many cases the researchers request unrestricted grants for financial and/or material support, such as for devices and consumables. External studies may examine the clinical performance and utility of our products or our products may be used as outcomes measures. We actively seek to publish our clinical study results in leading peer-reviewed journals while also encouraging our clinical collaborators and clinical study grant recipients to do the same.
In a study published in 2016 in the Journal of Pain Research, 81% of subjects reported a general improvement in their chronic pain and 67% reported a reduction in pain medication use after 60 days of use of Quell. Additional study findings included decreased interference from pain with sleep and walking ability. Another study published in the Journal of Pain Research in 2017 examined changes in chronic pain outcomes following 60 days of Quell use. Study subjects reported statistically and clinically significant improvement in all pain outcomes and all pain outcomes exhibited a strong dose-response relationship. In particular, about 60% of subjects with high Quell therapy utilization reported a large (at least 2 point) improvement in pain interference with activity or mood. In a recently published study in the Journal of Pain and Relief, Quell users showed statistically and clinically significant decrease in pain outcome after 60 days of use. There were no differences in pain outcomes or dose-response associations between study participants with distal chronic pain (i.e., affecting the feet and legs) and proximal chronic pain (i.e., hips, lower back and upper body). This result suggests that Quell produces pain relief beyond the site of stimulation at the calf.
Results of an external study conducted at the Brigham and Women's Hospital Pain Management Center were presented at the 9th World Congress of the Work Institute of Pain. Key findings of this randomized clinical trial include: subjects with chronic low back pain in the experimental (Quell) group demonstrated reduced pain intensity compared to control (treatment as usual) subjects; subjects in the experimental group exhibited reduced pain interference with function and pain catastrophizing compared to the control group.
In addition, results of internal studies based on data from Quell Health Cloud™ have been presented at various research conferences.

• | At the American Academy of Neurology Annual Meeting a poster entitled “Pilot Study of Sleep/Wake Classification by Leg-Worn Actigraphy” reported an accuracy study of the sleep monitoring technology in the Quell device by comparing it to the accuracy of gold standard polysomnography. The study was conducted in collaboration with researchers at the Massachusetts General Hospital.


• | At the American Academy of Pain Medicine Annual Meeting, a poster entitled “Levels and Predictors of Activity in Users of Wearable Neurostimulators with Chronic Pain” explored activity levels in Quell users and associated health. A second poster entitled “Does Fixed-Site High-Frequency Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation Provide Analgesia Beyond Application Site?” addressed the widespread analgesic effect of Quell neurostimulation.


• | At the PAINWeek National Conference a poster entitled “Effectiveness of Fixed-Site High-Frequency Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation among Individuals with Chronic Pain and Abnormal Sleep” addressed statistically and clinically significant improvement in all pain outcomes in study participants using the Quell device’s objective sleep tracking. In addition, Quell effectiveness was found to be generally independent of baseline sleep characteristics. A second poster entitled “Real-Word Effectiveness of Fixed-Site High-Frequency Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve

7

Stimulation in Chronic Low Back Pain” evaluated Quell’s effectiveness in a 10-week real-world retrospective study. A third poster entitled “Pilot Study of Fixed-Site High-Frequency Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation in Fibromyalgia” evaluated Quell efficacy in an open-label study of subjects with confirmed fibromyalgia.
Competition
We believe there is no direct competition to our Quell wearable neurostimulation device for the treatment of chronic pain. The most common approach to chronic pain is pain medication. This includes over-the-counter drugs (such as Advil and Motrin), and prescription drugs including anti-convulsants (such as Lyrica and Neurontin) and anti-depressants (such as Cymbalta and Elavil). Topical creams may also be used (such as Zostrix and Bengay). With severe pain, narcotic or opioid pain medications may be prescribed (such as codeine, fentanyl, morphine, and oxycodone). The approach to treatment is individualized, drug combinations may be employed, and the results are often hit or miss. Side effects and the potential for addiction are real and the risks are substantial.
Reflecting the difficulty in treating chronic pain, inadequate relief leads many pain sufferers to turn to the over-the-counter market for supplements or alternatives to prescription pain medications. These include non-prescription medications, topical creams, lotions, electrical stimulators, dietary products, braces, sleeves, pads and other items. In the United States, over $4 billion is spent annually on such pain relief products.
Nerve stimulation is an established treatment for chronic pain supported by numerous clinical studies demonstrating efficacy. In simplified outline, the mechanism of action involves intensive nerve stimulation to activate the body’s central pain inhibition system resulting in widespread analgesia, or pain relief. The nerve stimulation activates brainstem pain centers leading to the release of endogenous opioids that act primarily through the delta opioid receptor to reduce pain signal transmission through the central nervous system. This therapeutic approach is available through implantable spinal cord stimulation; however, this approach requires surgery and has attendant risks. Non-invasive approaches to neurostimulation (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, or TENS) have achieved limited efficacy in practice due to device limitations, ineffective dosing and low patient adherence. We believe that our clinical and market claims with respect to our wearable technology covering chronic pain and sleep, technical characteristics of high power and automation, and the digital health integration characteristics place Quell in a unique neurostimulation category. There are numerous manufacturers of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation devices including widely marketed over-the-counter TENS such as Sanofi’s IcyHot SmartRelief, Omron PM3030 and Aleve Direct Therapy.
We believe that DPNCheck is currently the only objective and standardized test for DPN widely available at the point-of-care. The American Diabetes Association and other organizations recommend at least annual evaluation of all people with diabetes for DPN. Due to cost and availability, this screen is typically performed with a simple (5.07/10g) monofilament. This subjective method identifies late stage neuropathy where intervention is generally limited to foot care. Experts in the field have indicated that there is an unmet need for a practical, objective, and sensitive test for diabetic neuropathy that can be widely deployed in the regular care of all people with diabetes. Monofilaments (5.07/10g) are a commodity sold by a number of medical supply companies.
There are several companies that sell neurodiagnostic devices that compete with our ADVANCE System. These companies include Cadwell Laboratories, Inc. and Natus Medical Incorporated. Natus Medical Incorporated has substantially greater financial resources than we do. Natus Medical Incorporated and Cadwell Laboratories, Inc. have established reputations as having effective worldwide distribution channels for medical instruments to neurologists and physical medicine and rehabilitation physicians.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, and other intellectual property laws, nondisclosure agreements and other measures to protect our proprietary technology, intellectual property rights, and know-how. We hold issued utility patents covering a number of important aspects of our Quell, SENSUS, DPNCheck and ADVANCE products. We believe that in order to have a competitive advantage, we must develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our technologies. We also require our employees, consultants and advisors, whom we expect to work on our products, to agree to disclose and assign to us all inventions conceived, or developed using our property, or which relate to our business. Despite any measures taken to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary.

Patents
As of December 31, 2018, we had 42 issued U.S. patents, five issued foreign patents, and 32 patent applications, including 29 U.S. applications, and three foreign applications. Our wearable therapeutic products have ten issued U.S. utility patents and three issued U.S. design patents plus 28 utility and design patent applications. The foreign patents for wearable therapeutics were assigned to GSK under the terms of our collaboration agreement. For our DPNCheck diagnostic device, nine utility patents were issued that cover the core technology and there is one additional utility patent application.
With regard to our legacy neurodiagnostic products, our issued design patents began to expire in 2015, and our issued utility patents began to expire in 2017. In particular, seven of our issued U.S. utility patents covering various aspects of the legacy neurodiagnostic products expired on the same date in 2017. Although the patent protection for material aspects of these products covered by the claims of the patents were lost at that time, we have additional patents and patent applications directed to other novel inventions that will have patent terms extending beyond 2018.
The medical device industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent litigation based on allegations of patent infringement. Patent litigation can involve complex factual and legal questions, and its outcome is uncertain. Any claim relating to infringement of patents that is successfully asserted against us may require us to pay substantial damages. Even if we were to prevail, any litigation could be costly and time-consuming and would divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations. Our success will also depend in part on our not infringing patents issued to others, including our competitors and potential competitors. If our products are found to infringe the patents of others, our development, manufacture, and sale of these potential products could be severely restricted or prohibited. In addition, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies. Because of the importance of our patent portfolio to our business, we may lose market share to our competitors if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights.
A patent infringement suit brought against us may force us or any strategic partners or licensees to stop or delay developing, manufacturing, or selling potential products that are claimed to infringe a third-party’s intellectual property, unless that party grants us rights to use its intellectual property. In such cases, we may be required to obtain licenses to patents or proprietary rights of others in order to continue to commercialize our products. However, we may not be able to obtain any licenses required under any patents or proprietary rights of third parties on acceptable terms, or at all. Even if we were able to obtain rights to the third-party’s intellectual property, these rights may be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same intellectual property. Ultimately, we may be unable to commercialize some of our potential products or may have to cease some of our business operations as a result of patent infringement claims, which could severely harm our business.
Trademarks
We hold domestic registrations for the trademarks NEUROMETRIX, Quell, OptiTherapy, DPNCheck, SENSUS, and NC-stat. We use a trademark for ADVANCE, Wearable Pain Relief Technology, and Quell Health Cloud. We hold certain foreign registrations for the marks NEUROMETRIX, Quell, OptiTherapy, NC-stat, and SENSUS.
Third-Party Reimbursement
Procedures performed with our neurodiagnostic medical devices including ADVANCE and DPNCheck may be paid for by third-party payers, including government health programs, such as Medicare, and private insurance and managed care organizations. The 2019 Physicians Fee Schedule published by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) includes CPT 95905 for nerve conduction studies performed with pre-configured electrode arrays such as those used with the DPNCheck device and the ADVANCE System.
We believe that physicians are generally receiving reimbursement under CPT 95905 from Medicare for nerve conduction studies performed for carpal tunnel syndrome using pre-configured electrode arrays that meet the medical necessity requirements in their local Medicare region but that commercial insurers are generally not providing reimbursement. Reimbursement by third-party payers is an important element of success for medical device companies. We do not foresee a significant near-term improvement in reimbursement for procedures performed with ADVANCE and DPNCheck.
In the United States, some insured individuals are receiving their medical care through managed care programs which monitor and often require pre-approval of the services that a member will receive. Some managed care programs are paying their providers on a per capita basis a predetermined annual payment per member which puts the providers at financial risk for the services provided to their members. This is generally the case under Medicare Advantage where contracting insurers receive a monthly capitated fee from CMS to provide all necessary medical care to participating members. These capitated fees are adjusted under CMS’s risk-adjustment model which uses health status indicators, or risk scores, to ensure the adequacy of 
9

payment. Members with higher risk codes generally require more healthcare resources than those with lower risk codes. In turn, the insurer fully absorbs the risk of patient health care costs. Insurers may share a portion of the risk with provider organizations such as independent practice associations (IPAs) with whom they contract to provide medical services to their members. Proper assessment of each member’s health status and accurate coding helps to assure that insurers receive capitation fees consistent with the cost of treating these members. Nerve conduction testing can provide valuable, early identification of neuropathy leading to clinical interventions that can reduce health care costs. Also, these tests provide valuable input regarding each member’s health risk status which can result in more appropriate capitated payments from CMS. We believe that the clinical and economic proposition for DPNCheck is attractive to Medicare Advantage insurers and risk bearing provider organizations. We are focusing our United States sales effort for DPNCheck on the Medicare Advantage managed care market segment.
We believe that our legacy SENSUS pain management therapeutic system is considered a durable medical equipment (DME) benefit and is reimbursed for chronic pain by Medicare and many commercial insurers under the Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) code EO730 for the device and under HCPCS code A4595 for the consumable electrodes. These pre-existing codes apply to DME benefits employing transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation equipment. We expect that Quell will generally not be reimbursed by third party payers in the near future.
We believe that the overall escalating cost of medical products and services has led to, and will continue to lead to, increased pressures on the healthcare industry to reduce the costs of products and services.
Our success in selling DPNCheck and ADVANCE will depend upon, among other things, our customers receiving, and our potential customers’ expectation that they will receive sufficient reimbursement or patient capitated premium adjustments from third-party payers for procedures or therapies using these products. See “Risk Factors,” “If health care providers are unable to obtain sufficient reimbursement or other financial incentives from third-party health care payers related to the use of our products other than Quell, their adoption and our future product sales will be materially adversely affected.”
FDA and Other Governmental Regulation
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Regulation
Our products are medical devices that are subject to extensive regulation by the U.S. FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, as well as by other regulatory bodies in the United States and abroad. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes based on the risks associated with the medical device and the controls deemed necessary to reasonably ensure the device’s safety and effectiveness. Those three classes are:

• | Class I, the lowest risk products, which require compliance with medical device general controls, including labeling, establishment registration, device product listing, adverse event reporting and, for some products, adherence to good manufacturing practices through the FDA’s quality system regulations;


• | Class II, comprising moderate-risk devices, which also require compliance with general controls and in some cases, so-called special controls that may include performance standards, particular labeling requirements, or post-market surveillance obligations; typically a Class II device also requires pre-market review and clearance by FDA of a pre-market notification (also referred to as a “510(k) application”) as well as adherence to the quality system regulations/good manufacturing practices for devices; and


• | Class III, high-risk devices that are often implantable or life-sustaining, which also require compliance with the medical device general controls and quality system regulations, but which generally must be approved by FDA before entering the market, through a more lengthy pre-market approval (PMA) application. Approved PMAs can include post-approval conditions and post-market surveillance requirements, analogous to some of the special controls that may be imposed on Class II devices.

Before being introduced into the U.S. market, our products must obtain marketing clearance or approval from FDA through the 510(k) pre-market notification process, the de novo classification process (summarized below under De Novo Classification Process), or the PMA process, unless they are determined to be Class I devices or to otherwise qualify for an exemption from one of these available forms of pre-market review and authorization by the FDA. To date, our products have all been classified as Class II, moderate-risk medical devices and have been subject to the 510(k) review and clearance process. See “Risk Factors,” “We are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA which could restrict the sales and marketing of the Quell and DPNCheck devices and the ADVANCE System, as well as other products for which we may seek FDA clearance or approval, and could cause us to incur significant costs.”
10

In recent months, FDA has announced a series of efforts to modernize and streamline the 510(k) notification and regulatory review process and for monitoring device post-market safety, as well as issued a Proposed Rule to formalize the De Novo classification process to provide clarity to innovative device developers.
510(k) Pre-Market Notification Process
Class II devices typically require pre-market review and clearance by the FDA, which is accomplished through the submission of a 510(k) pre-market notification before the device may be marketed. To obtain 510(k) clearance, we must demonstrate that a new device is substantially equivalent to another device with 510(k) clearance or grandfathered status, or to a device that was reclassified from Class III to Class II or Class I - this device to which the new device is compared is called the “predicate device.” In some cases, we may be required to perform clinical trials to support a claim of substantial equivalence. If clinical trials are required, we may be required to submit an application for an investigational device exemption, or IDE, which must be cleared by the FDA prior to the start of a clinical investigation, unless the device and clinical investigation are considered non-significant risk by the FDA or are exempt from the IDE requirements. Whether or not an IDE is required for a clinical study involving a medical device, an appropriate Institutional Review Board (IRB) must review and approve the study protocol before it is initiated. It generally takes three months from the date of the pre-market notification submission to obtain a final 510(k) clearance decision from the FDA, but it can be significantly longer.
After a medical device receives a 510(k) clearance letter, which authorizes commercial marketing of the new device for one or more specific indications for use, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, requires the submission of a new 510(k) notification or could require de novo classification or a PMA. The FDA allows each company to make this determination, but the FDA can review the decision as part of routine compliance audits of the company. If the FDA disagrees with a company’s decision not to seek prior FDA authorization, the FDA may require the company to seek additional 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval. The FDA also can require the company to cease marketing and/or recall the medical device in question until its regulatory status is resolved.
De Novo Classification Process
If the FDA determines that a new, previously unclassified medical device or its intended use is not substantially equivalent to a predicate device, the device is automatically placed into Class III, requiring the submission of a PMA. Devices that cannot be cleared through the 510(k) process due to lack of a predicate device but would be considered low or moderate risk (in other words, they do not rise to the level of requiring the approval of a PMA because any risks associated with the device could be mitigated through general controls and/or special controls) may be eligible for the 510(k) De Novo classification process. If a product is classified as Class II through the De Novo classification process, then that device may serve as a predicate device for subsequent 510(k) pre-market notifications.
On December 7, 2018, FDA issued a Proposed Rule that would formally codify requirements for the medical device De Novo process and the procedures and criteria for product developers to file a De Novo classification request. Over the past twenty years, the De Novo process has been implemented by FDA pursuant to statutory authorities and somewhat organically through informal guidance and iterative changes by Congress. The Proposed Rule now allows industry to participate in the development of FDA’s policies and procedures for De Novo requests through the notice-and-comment rulemaking process. Although this Proposed Rule, if finalized by FDA, would not impact our marketed products, FDA’s activities to create predictability, consistency, and transparency for innovative medical device developers may benefit the medical technology industry as a whole.
PMA Application Process
If a medical device does not qualify for the 510(k) pre-market notification process and is not eligible for classification as a low or moderate-risk device through the De Novo process, the device is deemed to be Class III and a company must submit a PMA application to seek authorization for its commercial sale. A PMA requires more extensive pre-filing testing than is required in the 510(k) application and is more costly, lengthy and uncertain. The PMA review and approval process can take one to three years or longer, from the time the PMA application is filed with the FDA. Under a PMA, the company must demonstrate to the FDA that the new medical device is safe and effective for its intended purpose. A PMA typically includes extensive pre-clinical and clinical trial data, and information about the device, its design, manufacture, labeling and components. Before approving a PMA, the FDA generally also performs an on-site inspection of manufacturing facilities for the product to ensure compliance with the FDA’s quality system regulation, or QSR.
11

If FDA approves the PMA, the approved indications may be more limited than those originally sought. In addition, FDA’s approval order may include post-approval conditions that the FDA believes necessary to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution and post-market study requirements. Failure to comply with the post-approval conditions can result in adverse enforcement or administrative actions, including the withdrawal of the approval. Approval of a new PMA application or a PMA supplement may be required before making certain types of modifications to the device, including to its labeling, intended use or indication, or manufacturing process, especially when such modifications have the potential to affect safety and effectiveness.
Post-Marketing Compliance Obligations
Regardless of which pre-market pathway a medical device uses to reach the U.S. market, after a device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:

• | the FDA’s QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other good manufacturing practice and quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process (unless a device category is exempt from this requirement by the FDA, such as in the case of many Class I devices);


• | labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared or unapproved uses (known as off-label uses), as well as requirements to provide adequate information on both risks and benefits;


• | medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to FDA any event that the company learns of in which a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur;


• | correction and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and device recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA caused by the device that may present a risk to health;


• | post-market surveillance regulations, which apply to Class II or III devices if the FDA has issued a post-market surveillance order and the failure of the device would be reasonably likely to have serious adverse health consequences, the device is expected to have significant use in the pediatric population, the device is intended to be implanted in the human body for more than one year, or the device is intended to be used to support or sustain life and to be used outside a user facility;


• | regular and for-cause inspections by FDA to review a manufacturer’s facility and its compliance with applicable FDA requirements; and


• | the FDA’s recall authority, whereby it can ask, or order, device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of applicable laws and regulations.

Regulatory Approvals and Clearances
The ADVANCE System received 510(k) clearance as a Class II medical device in April 2008 for its intended use by physicians to perform nerve conduction studies and needle electromyography procedures.
The NC-stat System is also a Class II medical device and has been the subject of several 510(k) clearances, the most recent in July 2006 (K060584). The NC-stat System is cleared for use to stimulate and measure neuromuscular signals that are useful in diagnosing and evaluating systemic and entrapment neuropathies. We believe our NC-stat DPNCheck, or DPNCheck, device is a technical modification to the 510(k) cleared NC-stat device and has the same intended use, and therefore does not raise safety or effectiveness questions. Under the FDA’s published guidance on 510(k) requirements for modified devices, we do not believe that a 510(k) submission is required for DPNCheck.
As transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulators, the SENSUS and Quell pain therapy devices are Class II medical devices that received 510(k) clearance from the FDA in August 2012 and July 2014, respectively. In November 2012, the FDA provided 510(k) clearance for the disposable electrode used in conjunction with the SENSUS device, and in July 2013, the FDA provided 510(k) clearance for the use of SENSUS during sleep. The intended use of the SENSUS pain management therapeutic system is the symptomatic relief and management of chronic pain. While the SENSUS device is still marketed we have transitioned many SENSUS customers to the newer models of our transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulator, called Quell. In July 2014, our Quell device received 510(k) clearance for over-the-counter use and in November 2014, our Quell disposable electrode received 510(k) clearance for over-the-counter use. In January 2016, a number of new features were added to Quell and received 510(k) clearance, most notably use with an optional mobile app that contains several convenience features. The intended use of the Quell pain management therapeutic system is the symptomatic relief and management of chronic pain. The Quell device may also be used during nighttime sleep.

Federal Trade Commission Regulatory Oversight
We are subject to Federal Trade Commission (FTC) regulatory oversight. Under the Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act), the FTC is empowered, among other things, to (a) prevent unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce; (b) seek monetary redress and other relief for conduct injurious to consumers; and (c) gather and compile information and conduct investigations relating to the organization, business, practices, and management of entities engaged in commerce. The FTC has very broad enforcement authority, and failure to abide by the substantive requirements of the FTC Act and other consumer protection laws can result in administrative or judicial penalties, including civil penalties, injunctions affecting the manner in which we would be able to market Quell in the future, or criminal prosecution. In 2017, the Company received a Civil Investigative Demand (CID) from the FTC. The CID requested information in connection with an FTC review for compliance of the Company’s representations about Quell with Sections 5 and 12 of the FTC Act. The Company produced and supplied to the FTC all documents and information in response to the CID. To the knowledge of the Company, no complaint has been filed against the Company; however, no assurance can be given as to the timing or outcome of the investigation. FTC counsel has communicated that they continue to review our information and documents, but they have not provided a timeframe for completion of that review or for potential closure of the investigation.
Manufacturing Facilities
Our facility, and the facilities utilized by Sunburst and MC Assembly., our contract sub-assembly manufacturers, have been inspected by FDA in the past, and observations were noted. There were no findings that involved a significant violation of regulatory requirements. The responses to these observations have been accepted by the FDA and we believe that we and our contract manufacturers are in substantial compliance with the QSR. We expect that our facility and our subcontract facilities will be inspected again as required by the FDA. If the FDA finds significant violations, we could be subject to fines, recalls, requirements to halt manufacturing, or other administrative or judicial sanctions.
Legacy Products
We were founded in 1996 as a science-based health care company focused on the development of innovative products for the detection, diagnosis, and monitoring of peripheral nerve and spinal cord disorders, such as those associated with carpal tunnel syndrome, lumbosacral disc disease and spinal stenosis, and diabetes. Our NC-stat System for the performance of nerve conduction studies at the point-of-care was commercially launched in 1999 and the second generation NC-stat was released in 2002. In 2008, we brought to market the more sophisticated ADVANCE System for nerve conduction testing and performance of invasive needle electromyography. These systems were general purpose with broad application in evaluating and diagnosing nerve disorders. Numerous studies demonstrating the clinical accuracy and utility of these devices have been conducted and published in high quality peer-reviewed journals. Furthermore, these devices have been used in FDA sanctioned clinical trials for pharmacological agents and large-scale epidemiological studies sponsored by the NIH, Center for Disease Control and other governmental agencies. The products have been cleared by the FDA, field tested for over a decade and highly regarded for their ease of use, accuracy and reproducibility of results. The health market, particularly the physician office segment, embraced the opportunity to perform nerve conduction tests which previously had required referral to specialists. Point-of-care nerve testing was seen to provide a combination of improved patient care and patient convenience. However, significant changes to health reimbursement during 2006-2009 adversely affected the financial profile on our NC-stat and ADVANCE nerve conduction testing products, particularly when used by non-specialists. This resulted in declining Company revenues and ultimately our decision to discontinue investment in the products and to manage them for cash flow and not for growth. They are now classified as Legacy Products. Also, our initial prescription wearable technology for chronic pain called SENSUS has been classified as a Legacy Product since our 2015 launch of the OTC Quell product line. We reported revenue for our Legacy Products of $1.4 million and $1.5 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had a total of 42 full time employees. Of these employees, twelve were in research and development, twelve in sales and marketing, ten in production/distribution, and eight in general and administrative services. One employee holds both M.D. and Ph.D. degrees, one employee holds an M.D. degree and two additional employees hold Ph.D. degrees. Our employees are not represented by a labor union and are not subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We have never experienced a work stoppage. We believe that we have good relations with our employees.
