Overview
 ﻿
 Pulse Biosciences, Inc. is a clinical stage medical therapy company pursuing commercial introduction of our proprietary CellFX™ System utilizing our patent-protected Nano-Pulse Stimulation™ (NPS™) platform technology. With our proprietary CellFX System, we can deliver a unique cell-focused effect on dysfunctional cells while preserving surrounding non-cellular tissue, a combination that may potentially lead to both improved efficacy and less collateral tissue damage. It also causes a process of immunogenic cell death that may stimulate an immune response to the dysfunctional cells. 
 ﻿
 We intend to commercialize novel, proprietary, and differentiated products that have the potential to significantly improve patient outcomes in the markets we serve. To achieve this mission, we intend to: 
 ﻿

· | Demonstrate the unique benefits of our proprietary CellFX System and its unique mechanism of action across a number of compelling indications. The CellFX System is the only tunable nanosecond pulsed energy system designed for use in human medicine of which we are aware. Our proprietary CellFX System allows for the adjustment of four key pulsing parameters: pulse duration, pulse amplitude, pulse frequency, and the number of pulses, depending on the tissue and desired treatment outcome. We have conducted or are conducting several clinical studies, including studies in Seborrheic Keratosis (SK), the most common benign raised pigmented lesion, Sebaceous Hyperplasia (SH), a common but difficult to treat facial lesion, Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC), the most common form of skin cancer, cutaneous warts, and acne. We expect to conduct clinical studies on an ongoing basis to continue to demonstrate the value of our CellFX System across a growing list of valuable applications;

· | Commercialize our proprietary CellFX System and applications for its use across a broad array of clinical indications. During February 2019 we submitted a Pre-Market Notification 510(k) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) seeking clearance to commercialize our CellFX System. Our FDA filing requests clearance of the CellFX System for commercial use in common dermatologic procedures to remove general benign lesions including SH and SK. Pending regulatory clearance, we plan to launch our CellFX System in the United States.

     Our Proprietary Nano-Pulse Stimulation Technology Platform
 Our proprietary CellFX™ System leverages our patented NPS™ technology platform. NPS technology is characterized by ultrafast electrical energy pulses, with pulse durations from billionths up to a millionth of a second. When applied to targeted tissue, our NPS energy pulses enter cells and we believe alter the function of the internal cellular organelles, including the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum, without disrupting extracellular tissue, leading to regulated cell death (RCD), a process exhibited by cells in the human body when they undergo stress and are unable to restore cellular homeostasis. 
 Our proprietary CellFX System’s unique non-toxic and non-thermal mechanism of action is likely a biophysical disruption brought about by the tunable speed and amplitude of our NPS pulses interacting with the physical structure of cells.  While our CellFX System delivers pulses that directly affect the internal organelles of cells, these pulses have no functional effect on non-cellular tissue, such as collagen, a protein that forms the structural foundation of the skin. In short, with our proprietary CellFX System, we can deliver a more selective, cell-focused effect that we believe leads to RCD while preserving surrounding non-cellular tissue, a combination that may potentially lead to highly differentiated treatment applications.  Additionally, in the case of cancer this regulated cell death process may result in immunogenic cell death that stimulates the immune system to mount a systemic immune response against antigens, or markers, in those cancer cells.
 ﻿
 Aesthetic Dermatology Procedure Market
 We believe our CellFX System has high potential to offer improved clinical outcomes for a broad range of dermatology conditions and aesthetic skin applications for which targeted clearance of cellular lesions or structures is medically or cosmetically desirable. Current dermatology procedures to remove lesions or undesired skin tissue typically involve either excision (e.g. surgery) or the use of heat (e.g. lasers or radiofrequency energy) or cold (e.g. cryoablation). These thermal methods of tissue destruction affect both cellular and non-cellular tissue components indiscriminately, which can lead to collateral damage of the dermal foundation in the skin.
 ﻿
 Based on our clinical data demonstrating the unique, non-thermal, cell targeting NPS mechanism, we believe there is a significant opportunity for our CellFX System in aesthetic and medical dermatology in the United States. According to the 2017 Consumer Survey by the American Society for Dermatologic Surgery (ASDS) the number of consumers considering a cash-pay cosmetic procedure has more than doubled, from 30% in 2013 to 70% in 2017. The survey also highlighted that consumers ranked their dermatologist as the #1 influencer of skin procedure decisions. We have worked closely with top key opinion leaders (KOLs) in the aesthetic and medical dermatology field to identify those procedures and skin conditions in which our CellFX System and its unique NPS mechanism of action would offer a high value proposition.
     Initial Aesthetic Dermatology Applications
 ﻿
 Sebaceous Hyperplasia
 ﻿
 Sebaceous Hyperplasia (SH) is a common, benign condition of sebaceous glands in adults of middle age or older. SH occurs when the sebaceous glands become enlarged, creating small, shiny, yellowish lesions or bumps, usually 2-4 millimeters in diameter and typically on the face. Results from our research have demonstrated that NPS has a unique ability to target cellular structures located within the dermis of the skin, such as the sebaceous gland, without damaging the dermis, making it a potentially unique and highly effective treatment modality for SH lesions and similar targets residing deeper within the dermis of the skin. 
 During 2018 we conducted a multi-center clinical study evaluating the safety and efficacy of our NPS platform for the treatment of SH. Results from our clinical study, including 73 patients and 222 treated SH lesions, indicate that NPS technology is effective for eliminating SH. Over 99% of treated SH lesions (221 of 222) were rated clear or mostly clear by investigators at the 60-day post treatment follow-up evaluation. Approximately 92% (n=203) of treated lesions were assessed as clear or mostly clear after a single treatment. Patients in the study rated 77% of lesion outcomes as satisfied or mostly satisfied.
 ﻿
 We believe that the successful elimination of SH lesions reflects a valuable commercial opportunity for our CellFX System in an area of unmet need and substantiates the unique ability of NPS pulses to penetrate the dermis and target deeper cellular structures without damaging the surrounding dermis.
 ﻿
 ﻿
 Seborrheic Keratosis
 ﻿


     
4

 
     Seborrheic Keratosis (SK) is one of the most common non-cancerous skin growths in older adults. SK usually appear as a brown, black or light tan growth on the face, chest, shoulders or back and has a waxy, scaly, slightly elevated appearance. SK are normally painless, and patients often seek to have them removed if they become irritated by clothing or for cosmetic reasons.    During 2017 and 2018 we conducted a multi-center clinical study evaluating the safety and efficacy of NPS technology for the treatment of SK. Results from our clinical study, including 58 patients and 174 treated SK lesions, indicate that a single NPS treatment is effective for eliminating SK. 82% of treated SK lesions (143 of 174) were rated clear or mostly clear by investigators at the 106-day post treatment follow-up evaluation. Patients in the study rated 78% of treatment outcomes as satisfied or mostly satisfied. 
 ﻿
 We believe that the results of this clinical study provide support to pursue commercial opportunities for the CellFX System in the treatment of SK.
 ﻿
 ﻿
 Future Dermatology Application Feasibility Studies
 ﻿
 We expect to conduct clinical studies on an ongoing basis to continue to evaluate clinical opportunities for and demonstrate the value of our CellFX System across a growing list of valuable indications:  
 ﻿
 Cutaneous Warts
 ﻿
 During 2018 we initiated a 20 patient multi-center clinical feasibility study evaluating the safety and effectiveness of our CellFX System for the treatment of non-genital cutaneous warts. Non-genital cutaneous warts are benign grainy skin growths that are typically caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). Results from this study will inform decisions regarding opportunities for future clinical studies for the treatment of warts.
 ﻿
 Acne
 ﻿
 During early 2019 we initiated a multi-center clinical feasibility study evaluating the safety and effectiveness of our CellFX System for the treatment of acne on the back. Back acne is characterized by eruptions of pimples, pustules, blackheads and/or cysts, often on the upper back, and is generally caused by the same factors that trigger facial acne, namely overactive sebaceous glands that lead to the proliferation of acne related bacteria. Our unique ability to target the sebaceous gland, as evidenced by the impressive results from our sebaceous hyperplasia study, led our dermatology advisory board to encourage us to pursue a feasibility study in acne, based on the role of the sebaceous glands in chronic acne eruptions.  
 ﻿
 Nano-Pulse Stimulation Initiated Immunogenic Cell Death
 ﻿
 In previously published preclinical models of cancerous lesions, NPS treatment has been shown to induce immunogenic cell death (ICD), a process that leads to the exposure of the unique cancer cell antigens to the immune system, resulting in the generation of cytotoxic T-cells and the mounting of an adaptive immune response targeted against those cells, without any observed toxic side effects. Based on this foundation of preclinical evidence, we believe NPS technology has the potential to play a role in immuno-oncology. Applications in immuno-oncology are a longer-term potential opportunity and may require the use of adjuvants or other agents in combination with NPS. We continue to evaluate NPS technology and our CellFX System in clinical and preclinical studies.
 ﻿
 During 2018 we commenced a clinical biomarker study to evaluate the CellFX System and NPS technology in Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC), the most prevalent form of skin cancer. We believe BCC represents a bridge between our developments in dermatology and those in oncology. This is our first human study in cancer and it will allow us to look at both the ability of CellFX System and NPS pulses to treat BCC lesion cells and the immune response changes as a result of treatment. This is not a therapeutic endpoint study, but it is an important first step that enables us to move quickly to demonstrate safety and NPS technology effect in treating skin cancer while providing necessary information to inform decisions relative to next steps towards a follow-on study aimed at a therapeutic endpoint. 
 ﻿
 ﻿
 Our CellFX System
 We have developed and plan to commercialize our proprietary CellFX System into the large and growing aesthetic procedure market as our first commercial market. The CellFX System is a platform, designed to support a wide array of 

     
5

 
     applications in aesthetic dermatology and potentially in other medical disciplines. We believe our CellFX System is the only tunable nanosecond pulsed energy delivery system designed and used in human medicine. Our CellFX System allows for the adjustment of four key treatment parameters: pulse duration, pulse amplitude, pulse frequency, and the number of pulses, depending on the target tissue, application and desired treatment outcome. 
 The CellFX System currently includes a multi-use handpiece and an initial family of five (5) single-patient use dermatology treatment tips. The system is designed to operate in a variety of medical environments, including a physician’s office or clinic, as well as outpatient surgery centers or hospitals. The system is a mobile cart-based system that can easily be transported from room to room and plugs into a standard wall outlet adaptable to either U.S. or international power sources.
 The treatment tips enable treatment of a variety of lesion sizes, from 1.5mm to 10mm square, and wirelessly connect to our CellFX System when they are plugged into the handpiece. This enables the use of automated treatment settings based on the treatment tip being utilized.
 The CellFX System and its component parts are engineered for volume manufacturing and the use of outsourced contract manufacturing partners to ensure our ability to meet anticipated demand while effectively managing underlying system costs that support a profitable sale of the CellFX System at competitive price points.
 Safety Profile of Our NPS Technology Platform
 ﻿
 During the course of conducting human clinical studies in dermatology with the NPS platform to support an FDA filing at leading dermatology research centers across the United States, no serious adverse events have been reported and patient tolerance to the procedure has been very high. A histological study of treated human tissue examined by experts in dermatopathology revealed a unique and consistent cell-specific mechanism of action and a predictable healing response that spared non-cellular dermal tissue across a wide range of skin types and patient demographics.    ﻿ Commercialization Strategy
 ﻿
 During February 2019 we submitted a Pre-Market Notification 510(k) to the FDA seeking clearance to commercialize our CellFX System. Pending regulatory clearance, we plan to launch our CellFX System in the United States during 2019.  The commercialization strategy for our CellFX System is comprised of three primary elements: 
 ﻿

· | We are in the process of building a sales and marketing team comprised of professionals with experience in delivering products and applications into the aesthetic dermatology market and have long-standing relationships with the key opinion leaders, clinics and customers. We plan to scale our sales and marketing infrastructure along with the growth of the business;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We intend to leverage and expand our existing relationships with our KOL advisors. These opinion leaders have significant influence on their peers and on the adoption of new technologies and treatment modalities through podium presentations at major meetings and media exposure in major markets; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We will continue to conduct clinical studies and work with our KOLs to pursue additional applications for which our cell specific mechanism of action is enabling. We have already started our evaluation for the treatment of warts, acne and basal cell carcinoma. Our application development pipeline continues to reveal additional targets that have potential to add to the utilization potential of our future growing installed base.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿
 We believe knowledgeable salespersons who can convey and assist the clinician in delivering the value of our CellFX System to patients, success of early adopter KOLs, and the increasing utility of our CellFX System with meaningful clinical data greatly enhances our ability to attract customers and promote ongoing utilization of installed systems.
 ﻿
 ﻿
 Intellectual Property
 ﻿
 We maintain a portfolio of intellectual property surrounding our CellFX System and our NPS technology platform. As a medical technology company our current patents and ongoing intellectual property development are, and will continue to be, a priority for our business. We believe our intellectual property is an important competitive advantage for us. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to further develop, maintain and strengthen our competitive position. We actively protect our intellectual property through a combination of patent registrations, trademarks, and copyright protections; confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and other parties; and access control to sensitive information.

     We own or have a license to 89 issued patents worldwide and have 79 patent applications pending worldwide, with the earliest expiration of a United States issued patent, in this case a licensed patent, in 2020 and the latest in 2035. As we have over the last several years, we are filing and plan to continue to file new patent applications to protect our systems, algorithms, applicators, methods, and designs of our technologies and products as they evolve. Medical technologies such as ours may be utilized in many different applications and incorporate several patentable features, and our strategy will be to always strive to protect our products and technologies with multiple patents directed to the variety of features and applications, in order to establish a strong defense against competitors and such that an expiration of a single patent does not lessen our overall comprehensive coverage. We believe our NPS platform and current CellFX System are protected by several issued patents covered in multiple pending applications we are pursuing.
 Research and Development
 ﻿
 Since inception, the majority of our business has focused on the development of our CellFX System and earlier clinical versions of the system, conducting clinical studies, including dermatology studies in SK, SH, warts, acne and BCC, and preclinical and basic research into the unique mechanism of action of our Nano-Pulse Stimulation technology platform. We continue to conduct research and development activities in pursuit of commercial applications for our CellFX System, but have not yet commercialized or recognized revenue from our technology. 
 The development of our proprietary CellFX System has involved a multi-disciplinary effort including; electrical, mechanical, biomedical, and software engineers to design and integrate the various elements of our CellFX System and its predecessors; clinical research specialists to plan and conduct clinical studies; and research scientists to assess and interpret the focal and systemic biological effects of our technology. We believe we can expand the potential of our CellFX System through ongoing innovation and additional clinical studies demonstrating safety and efficacy in additional dermatologic conditions and additional therapeutic areas.    Competition
 The applications we intend to target are subject to intense competition from rapidly evolving companies and new scientific discoveries. We compete against well-established incumbent technologies offering products in oncology, dermatology and aesthetics, minimally invasive treatments, and veterinary applications. Given the broad scope of our technology, we face competition ranging from large manufacturers with multiple business lines to small companies with focused products, as well as providers of other medical therapies and therapeutics for conditions that we intend to treat. Some of these companies currently have greater financial, technical, research and/or other resources than we do and have larger and more established manufacturing capabilities and marketing, sales and support functions. Our future success will depend on our ability to establish and maintain a competitive position in current and future technologies. Our technology is unique and differentiated in that NPS technology stimulates primarily intracellular cell death which we believe would be less traumatic to treated tissue and would result in less scarring or collateral damage to surrounding tissues.
 Government Regulation
 The CellFX System is a medical device subject to extensive and ongoing regulation by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDC&A, and its implementing regulations, as well as other federal and state regulatory bodies in the United States. The laws and regulations govern, among other things, product design and development, pre-clinical and clinical testing, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, storage, recordkeeping and reporting, clearance or approval, marketing, distribution, promotion, import and export, and post-marketing surveillance. 
 The FDA regulates the medical device market to ensure the safety and efficacy of these products. The FDA allows for two primary pathways for a medical device to be commercialized: a successful pre-market approval application, or PMA, or Premarket Notification, or 510(k) clearance. The FDA has established three different classes of medical devices, based on the level of risk associated with using a device and consequent degree of regulatory controls needed to govern its safety and efficacy.
 Class I and Class II devices are considered lower risk devices. Most Class I devices are exempt from the 510(k) process. Most Class II devices, including the CellFX System requires 510(k) clearance from the FDA in order to be marketed in the United States. A 510(k) Premarket Notification is a premarket submission made to the FDA to demonstrate that the device to be marketed is substantially equivalent (SE) to a legally marketed device that is not subject to premarket approval, or a predicate. Companies making a 510(k) submission must compare their 510(k) device to a predicate device. A device recently cleared under 510(k) is usually used as a predicate device. However, any legally U.S. marketed device that has the same intended use and same technological characteristics may be used as a predicate device. The FDA has a 90-calendar day 

     
7

 
     review goal from the date of receipt of the 510(k) to either authorize or decline commercial distribution of the device, but clearance generally takes longer than 90 days. If the FDA decides that the product is not substantially equivalent to a predicate device, a clearance will not be granted and the device cannot be commercialized.
  Medical devices regarded as the highest risk by the FDA are designated Class III and generally require the submission of a PMA application for approval. Class III devices generally include life-sustaining, life-supporting, or implantable devices or devices without a known predicate technology already approved by the FDA. 
 A PMA application must be accompanied by substantial data that supports the reasonable safety and efficacy of the device, which includes the provision of preclinical, clinical, technical, manufacturing and labeling information. After the FDA determines the application is sufficient complete to commence a substantive review, it has 180 days to review the submission, but it can typically take longer (up to several years) as this regulatory body can request additional data, including clinical data or clarifications. The FDA may also impose additional regulatory scrutiny for a PMA, including the institution of an outside advisory committee (panel review) to assess the application or provide recommendations as to whether to approve the device. Although the FDA is not required to follow the recommendation of an advisory panel, it generally does. As part of the review, the FDA will also inspect the manufacturing operations of the company requesting approval to verify compliance with Quality System regulations.
 After a device receives 510(k) clearance or PMA approval, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or PMA Supplemental approval. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially, but the FDA can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If the FDA disagrees with the determination not to seek a new 510(k) clearance or PMA Supplement, the FDA may retroactively require a new 510(k) clearance or PMA Supplements to be submitted. The FDA could also require a manufacturer to cease marketing and distribution and/or recall the modified device until clearance or approval is obtained. Also, in these circumstances, the manufacturer may be subject to significant regulatory fines, penalties, and possible warning letters.
 ﻿
 Pervasive and Continuing Regulation
 After a device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:
 ﻿

· | The FDA’s Quality System Regulation (QSR) which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved or off-label uses;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | medical device reporting (MDR), regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | post-market surveillance regulations, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The FDA has broad post-market and regulatory enforcement powers. We may be subject to unannounced inspections by the FDA and the Food and Drug Branch of the California Department of Public Health to determine our compliance with the QSR and other regulations, and these inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of our suppliers. 
 Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by FDA, which may include any of the following sanctions:
 ﻿

· | warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | repair, replacement, refunds, recall or seizure of our products;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | refusing our requests for 510(k) clearance or premarket approval of new products, new intended uses or modifications to existing products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | withdrawing 510(k) clearance or premarket approval that has already been granted; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | criminal prosecution.

 Regulatory System for Medical Devices in Europe
 The European Union (EU) consists of 28-member states and has a coordinated system for the authorization of medical devices. Marketing medical devices in the EU is subject to compliance with the Medical Devices Directive 93/92/EEC (MDD). A medical device may be placed on the market within the EU only if it conforms to certain “essential requirements” and bears the CE Mark. The most fundamental and essential requirement is that a medical device must be designed and manufactured in such a way that it will not compromise the clinical condition or safety of patients, or the safety and health of users and others. In addition, the device must achieve the essential performance(s) intended by the manufacturer and be designed, manufactured and packaged in a suitable manner.
 Manufacturers must demonstrate that their devices conform to the relevant essential requirements through a conformity assessment procedure. The nature of the assessment depends upon the classification of the device. The classification rules are mainly based on three criteria: the length of time the device is in contact with the body, the degree of invasiveness and the extent to which the device affects the anatomy. Conformity assessment procedures for all but the lowest risk classification of device involve a notified body. Notified bodies are often private entities and are authorized or licensed to perform such assessments by government authorities. Manufacturers usually have some flexibility to select a notified body for the conformity assessment procedures for a particular class of device and to reflect their circumstances, e.g., the likelihood that the manufacturer will make frequent modifications to its products. Conformity assessment procedures require an assessment of available clinical evidence, literature data for the product and post-market experience in respect of similar products already marketed. Notified bodies also may review the manufacturer’s quality systems. If satisfied that the product conforms to the relevant essential requirements, the notified body issues a certificate of conformity, which the manufacturer uses as a basis for its own declaration of conformity and application of the CE Mark. Application of the CE Mark allows the general commercializing of a product in the EU. The product can also be subjected to local registration requirements depending on the country. 
 In May 2017, the EU adopted a new Medical Devices Regulation (EU) 2017/745 (MDR), which will repeal and replace the MDD with effect from May 26, 2020. The MDR clearly envisages, among other things, stricter controls of medical devices, including strengthening of the conformity assessment procedures, increased expectations with respect to clinical data for devices and pre-market regulatory review of high-risk devices. The MDR also envisages greater control over notified bodies and their standards, increased transparency, more robust device vigilance requirements and clarification of the rules for clinical investigations. Under transitional provisions, medical devices with notified body certificates issued under the MDD prior to May 26, 2020 may continue to be placed on the market for the remaining validity of the certificate, until May 27, 2024 at the latest. After the expiry of any applicable transitional period, only devices that have been CE marked under the MDR may be placed on the market in the EU.
 ﻿
 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
 The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, impacts the transmission, maintenance, use and disclosure of certain individually identifiable health information (referred to as protected health information, or PHI). Since HIPAA was enacted in 1996, numerous implementing regulations have been issued, including, but not limited to: (1) standards for the privacy of individually identifiable health information (the Privacy Rule), (2) standards to protect the confidentiality, integrity and security of electronic protected health information (the Security Rule), (3) standards for electronic transactions, (4) a standard unique national provider identifier for providers and health plans, and (5) the HHS Breach Notification Rule. We refer to these rules, as well as similar state laws applicable to our operations, as the HIPAA Rules. HHS has also issued regulations governing the enforcement of the HIPAA Rules, the violation of which potentially includes significant criminal and civil penalties. Furthermore, many states have similar laws and regulations applicable to our operations, including but not limited to state data security breach requirements.

The HIPAA Rules apply to “covered entities,” which includes healthcare providers who conduct certain transactions electronically, including but not limited to the electronic submission of health care claims to an insurance carrier. We also provide services to customers that are directly regulated entities under HIPAA and the HIPAA Rules, and we are required to provide satisfactory written assurances to these customers through our written agreements that we will provide our services in accordance with HIPAA and the HIPAA Rules. As such, HIPAA and the HIPAA Rules apply to various aspects of our business and we are required to be in compliance with HIPAA and the HIPAA Rules.
 On February 17, 2009, Congress enacted Subtitle D of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.  This law includes strengthened federal privacy and security provisions to protect personally-identifiable health information, such as the notification requirements set forth in the Breach Notification Rule. On January 25, 2013, the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) of the Department of Health and Human Services published its final rule to modify the HIPAA Privacy, Security, Breach and Enforcement Rules, including most revisions/additions made by the HITECH Act. The rule became effective on March 23, 2013, and entities and business associates covered by the rule were required to comply with most of the applicable requirements by September 23, 2013.
 We are currently subject to the HIPAA regulations. We are subject to audit under the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, HITECH-mandated audit program. We may also be audited in connection with a privacy complaint. We are subject to prosecution and/or administrative enforcement and increased civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance, including a new, four-tiered system of monetary penalties adopted under HITECH. We are also subject to enforcement by state attorneys general who were given authority to enforce HIPAA under HITECH. To avoid penalties under the HITECH breach notification provisions, we must ensure that breaches of protected health information are promptly detected and reported within the company, so that we can make all required notifications on a timely basis. However, even if we make required reports on a timely basis, we may still be subject to penalties for the underlying breach.
 In addition to the federal privacy regulations, there are a number of state laws regarding the privacy and security of health information and personal data that are applicable to clinical laboratories. The compliance requirements of these laws, including additional breach reporting requirements, and the penalties for violation vary widely and new privacy and security laws in this area are evolving. Requirements of these laws and penalties for violations vary widely. We believe that we have taken the steps required of us to comply with health information privacy and security statutes and regulations in all jurisdictions, both state and federal. However, we may not be able to maintain compliance in all jurisdictions where we do business. Failure to maintain compliance, or changes in state or federal laws regarding privacy or security, could result in civil and/or criminal penalties and could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 If we or our operations are found to be in violation of HIPAA, HITECH or their implementing regulations, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, fines, and exclusion from participation in U.S. federal or state health care programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. HITECH increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against Covered Entities, their Business Associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.
 New laws governing privacy may be adopted in the future as well. We have taken steps to comply with health information privacy requirements that are applicable to us.

 Federal, State and Foreign Fraud and Abuse Laws
 Because of the significant federal funding involved in Medicare and Medicaid, Congress and the states have enacted, and actively enforce, a number of laws to eliminate fraud and abuse in federal healthcare programs. Our business is subject to compliance with these laws. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Healthcare and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, which we refer to collectively as the Affordable Care Act, was enacted in the United States. The provisions of the Affordable Care Act are effective on various dates. The Affordable Care Act expands the government’s investigative and enforcement authority and increases the penalties for fraud and abuse, including amendments to both the Anti-Kickback Statute and the False Claims Act, to make it easier to bring suit under these statutes. The Affordable Care Act also allocates additional resources and tools for the government to police healthcare fraud, with expanded subpoena power for HHS, additional funding to investigate fraud and abuse across the healthcare system and expanded use of recovery audit contractors for enforcement.
 Anti-Kickback Statutes. The federal healthcare programs’ Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce 

     
10

 
     either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare or Medicaid.
 The definition of “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including, for example, gifts, certain discounts, the furnishing of free supplies, equipment or services, credit arrangements, payment of cash and waivers of payments. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered businesses, the statute has been violated. Penalties for violations include criminal penalties and civil sanctions such as fines, imprisonment and possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. In addition, some kickback allegations have been claimed to violate the Federal False Claims Act, discussed in more detail below.
 The Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and prohibits many arrangements and practices that are otherwise lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry. Recognizing that the Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and may technically prohibit many innocuous or beneficial arrangements, Congress authorized the Office of Inspector General, or OIG, of HHS to issue a series of regulations known as “safe harbors.” These safe harbors set forth provisions that, if all their applicable requirements are met, will assure healthcare providers and other parties that they will not be prosecuted under the Anti-Kickback Statute. The failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit precisely within one or more safe harbors does not necessarily mean that it is illegal or that prosecution will be pursued. However, conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy an applicable safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities such as OIG.
 Many states have adopted laws similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute. Some of these state prohibitions apply to referral of recipients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
 Government officials have focused their enforcement efforts on the marketing of healthcare services and products, among other activities, and recently have brought cases against companies, and certain individual sales, marketing and executive personnel, for allegedly offering unlawful inducements to potential or existing customers in an attempt to procure their business.
 Federal False Claims Act. Another development affecting the healthcare industry is the increased use of the federal False Claims Act, and in particular, action brought pursuant to the False Claims Act’s “whistleblower” or “qui tam” provisions. The False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal healthcare program. The qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has violated the False Claims Act and to share in any monetary recovery. In recent years, the number of suits brought against healthcare providers by private individuals has increased dramatically. In addition, various states have enacted false claims laws analogous to the False Claims Act, and many of these state laws apply where a claim is submitted to any third-party payor and not just a federal healthcare program.
 When an entity is determined to have violated the False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties of between $11,181 and $22,363 for each separate instance of false claim. As part of any settlement, the government may ask the entity to enter into a corporate integrity agreement, which imposes certain compliance, certification and reporting obligations. There are many potential bases for liability under the False Claims Act. Liability arises, primarily, when an entity knowingly submits, or causes another to submit, a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government. The federal government has used the False Claims Act to assert liability on the basis of inadequate care, kickbacks and other improper referrals, and improper use of Medicare numbers when detailing the provider of services, in addition to the more predictable allegations as to misrepresentations with respect to the services rendered. In addition, the federal government has prosecuted companies under the False Claims Act in connection with off-label promotion of products. Our future activities relating to the reporting of wholesale or estimated retail prices of our products, the reporting of discount and rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third-party reimbursement of our products and the sale and marketing of our products may be subject to scrutiny under these laws.
 While we are unaware of any current matters, we are unable to predict whether we will be subject to actions under the False Claims Act or a similar state law, or the impact of such actions. However, the costs of defending such claims, as well as any sanctions imposed, could significantly affect our financial performance.
 The Sunshine Act. The Physician Payment Sunshine Act, or the Sunshine Act, which was enacted as part of the Affordable Care Act, requires manufacturers of prescription drugs, devices, biologics or other medical supplies available for coverage by Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to report annually to the Secretary of HHS: (i) payments or other transfers of value made by that entity, or by a third-party as directed by that entity, to physicians and 

     
11

 
     teaching hospitals or to third parties on behalf of physicians or teaching hospitals; and (ii) physician ownership (including immediate family ownership) and investment interests in the entity. The statute requires the federal government to make reported information available to the public starting September 2014, which it has. Failure to comply with the reporting requirements can result in significant civil monetary penalties ranging from $1,000 to $10,000 for each payment or other transfer of value that is not reported (up to a maximum per annual report of $150,000) and from $10,000 to $100,000 for each knowing failure to report (up to a maximum per annual report of $1.0 million). Additionally, there are criminal penalties if an entity intentionally makes false statements in such reports. We are subject to the Sunshine Act and the information we disclose may lead to greater scrutiny, which may result in modifications to established practices and additional costs. Additionally, similar reporting requirements have also been enacted on the state level domestically, and an increasing number of countries worldwide either have adopted or are considering similar laws requiring transparency of interactions with healthcare professionals.
 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits any United States individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring us to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, if any, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.
 International Laws. In Europe, various countries have adopted anti-bribery laws providing for severe consequences, in the form of criminal penalties and/or significant fines, for individuals and/or companies committing a bribery offense. Violations of these anti-bribery laws, or allegations of such violations, could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and reputation. For instance, in the United Kingdom, under the Bribery Act 2010, which went into effect in July 2011, a bribery occurs when a person offers, gives or promises to give a financial or other advantage to induce or reward another individual to improperly perform certain functions or activities, including any function of a public nature. Bribery of foreign public officials also falls within the scope of the Bribery Act 2010. Under the new regime, an individual found in violation of the Bribery Act of 2010, faces imprisonment of up to 10 years. In addition, the individual can be subject to an unlimited fine, as can commercial organizations for failure to prevent bribery.
 There are also international privacy laws that impose restrictions on the access, use, and disclosure of health information. All of these laws may impact our business. Our failure to comply with these privacy laws or significant changes in the laws restricting our ability to obtain required patient information could significantly impact our business and our future business plans.

 U.S. Healthcare Reform
 Changes in healthcare policy could increase our costs and subject us to additional regulatory requirements that may interrupt commercialization of our current and future solutions. Changes in healthcare policy could increase our costs, decrease our revenues and impact sales of and reimbursement for our current and future solutions. The Affordable Care Act substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts our industry. The Act contains a number of provisions that impact our business and operations, some of which in ways we cannot currently predict, including those governing enrollments in federal healthcare programs and reimbursement changes.
 There will continue to be proposals by legislators at both the federal and state levels, regulators and third-party payors to reduce costs while expanding individual healthcare benefits. Certain of these changes could impose additional limitations on the prices we will be able to charge for our current and future solutions or the amounts of reimbursement available for our current and future solutions from governmental agencies or third-party payors. While in general it is too early to predict specifically what effect the Affordable Care Act and its implementation or any future healthcare reform legislation or policies will have on our business, current and future healthcare reform legislation and policies could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.

 Environmental
 We are subject to federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations and policies governing the use, generation, manufacture, storage, air emission, effluent discharge, handling and disposal of certain hazardous and potentially hazardous substances used in connection with our operations. Although we believe that we have complied with these laws and regulations in all material respects and, to date, have not been required to take any action to correct any noncompliance, there can be no assurance that we will not be required to incur significant costs to comply with environmental regulations in the future.

 Insurance
 We maintain product and clinical trial liability insurance coverage which includes a maximum of per claim and an annual aggregate policy limits, subject to self-insured retentions. The policy covers, subject to policy conditions and exclusions, claims of bodily injury and property damage from any product manufactured by us or from trial-related adverse events.
 There is no assurance that our level of coverage is adequate. We may not be able to sustain or maintain our current level of coverage and cannot assure you that adequate insurance coverage will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. A successful product liability claim may exceed our existing coverages and may make future coverages significantly more expensive, if available at all.
