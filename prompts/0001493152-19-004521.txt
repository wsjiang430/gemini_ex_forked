Business Overview
 
The Company produces live pop culture conventions (“Comic Conventions”) across the United States that provide a social networking and entertainment venue for enthusiasts of movies, TV shows, video games, technology, toys, social networking, gaming, comic books, and graphic novels. Our Comic Conventions provide an opportunity for companies in the entertainment, toy, gaming, publishing and retail business to carry out sales, marketing, product promotion, public relations, advertising, and sponsorship efforts.
 
During 2016, the Company underwent a significant senior management restructuring. The restructuring included the appointment of a new Chief Executive Officer and new Chief Operating Officer, both entering their roles with experience at major movie studios and television networks. The Company also appointed an Executive Chairman. Focused on reforming the Company’s operations and key operating controls, the new management has worked extensively to position the Company to successfully grow by, among other things, implementing newly constituted internal accounting, marketing, and talent departments. A further description of management’s work to create a foundation for the Company to grow can be found below in Growth Strategy.
 
Conventions
 
The Company has been producing Comic Conventions since July 1997.
 
The Company receives revenue from its Comic Conventions primarily from three sources: (i) consumer admissions; (ii) exhibitor booth sales; and (iii) national and/or regional sponsorships. Comic Conventions vary in cost to produce. Production costs vary based on the size and scope of the production. Generally, our production costs range from approximately under $1,000,000 for a smaller scale production to $3,000,000 for a larger production.
 
In 2018 to the Company produced Comic Convention in the following cities: (i) New Orleans, LA; (ii) St. Louis, MO; (iii) Cleveland, OH; (iv) Portland, OR; (v) Philadelphia, PA; (vi) Des Moines, IA; (vii) Columbus, OH ; (viii) Boise ID; (ix) Winston Salem, NC; (x) Chicago, IL; (xi) Tulsa, OK; (xii) Austin, TX; and (xiii) Madison, WI.
 
Our target audience includes men and women in the 18 to 34-year-old demographic, together with families of all ages who are fans of various types of entertainment and media, including movies, music, toys, video games, consumer electronics, computers, and lifestyle products (e.g. clothes, footwear, digital devices, and mobile phones). We continuously review our existing operations and procedures relating to our Comic Conventions in order to ensure that we produce the best possible fan experience at our Comic Conventions and maximize revenue while containing costs.

CONtv
 
The Company currently holds a limited and passive interest in CONtv, a digital network devoted to fans of pop culture entertainment.
 
Digital Media
 
The Company produces a number of digital media properties, including, but not limited to, our website www.wizardworld.com, emails, newsletters, together with posts on Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and Instagram, to create awareness of our Comic Conventions and provide updates to our fans and consumers. To a large extent we also use our website www.wizardworld.com to provide the latest Wizard World news and information. While we derive little or no direct revenue from these properties, they have the indirect benefit of supporting sales relating to our Comic Conventions (dealer and exhibitor booths, admissions, sponsorships), as well as helping us secure additional sought after and high-profile talent. This in turn helps us obtain additional admissions, booth sales and sponsorships for our Comic Conventions. The Company intends to increase its presence in the digital space, through the creation and distribution of high quality and compelling content.
 
The Company maintains an email list consisting of all our current and active users. This is a primary driver of information dissemination, along with Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. YouTube is mainly used as brand awareness, information is posted after a Comic Convention, which helps to generate excitement at future events. Because our Comic Conventions visit multiple cities, it is essential that we create excitement in multiple regions, not just focused on a single event.
 
Through posts on Facebook, our attending artists and celebrities are able to help promote our Comic Conventions by announcing their involvement at our events. This helps generate excitement among both their existing fan base and ours while creating a sense of community and groundswell of support for the upcoming Comic Convention. Once we establish a critical mass of people, the Comic Convention can become part of the fabric of the community where people anticipate and look forward to the event months and sometimes even a full year in advance. Retention of Comic Convention attendees is essential to our sales process. Procuring new and timely talent helps generate new customers, as well as the word of mouth of previous attendees. Much of this is achieved via email, Facebook, Twitter, and www.wizardworld.com.
 
Unlike many live events (sports, concerts, etc.), where attendees are spectators (even if they are a part of a community at large), at our Comic Conventions the attendees participate in events. This atmosphere creates a greater amount of user generated content on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube. For instance, we generally observe an increase in Facebook “Likes” on profile picture changes on Facebook the days during and after our Comic Conventions featuring celebrity “Photo Ops.” This is a non-paid form of free advertising. Social networks such as Facebook and Twitter are a perfect marriage for these types of event photos.
 
Strategy
 
Our objective is to continue to create an expanded and qualitatively enhanced digital presence to leverage the Company’s digital extensions to become a dominant voice and destination for pop culture enthusiasts across multiple media platforms. Key elements of our strategy include:

● | producing high quality Comic Conventions events across the United States to entertain fans and to allow for promotion of consumer products and entertainment; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | produce rich content and leveraging the content created at the Comic Conventions through digital media outlets such as websites, apps, emails, newsletters, Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, Tumblr, Instagram and YouTube, among others; and 
● | obtaining sponsorships and promotions from media and entertainment companies for our Comic Conventions, including: (i) expanding our relationships with entertainment and media companies; and (ii) Continue efforts to control all costs including corporate overhead and convention production costs. 

Sponsorships and Advertising
 
The Company sells sponsorship, exhibitor and advertising opportunities to businesses seeking to reach our core target audience of active entertainment consumers, with a particular focus on men and women ages 18 to 34 and families.

Sponsorships and Promotions
 
We provide sponsorship opportunities that allow advertisers a wide range of promotional vehicles on-site and through our public relations efforts. For example, we offer advertisers the ability to: (i) display signage at our Comic Conventions, (ii) include their desired logos on all direct mail that is sent in connection with one or more Comic Conventions, (iii) be included in press releases to the media, (iv) obtain sponsor tags on the radio spots or in the print or online ads where we advertise, and (v) obtain advertising space in our digital media. We also provide the opportunity for advertisers to sponsor events at the Comic Conventions, such as costume contests or gaming tournaments and the ability to brand “step-and-repeats” for photo opportunities, meet and greets with celebrities, VIP packages, and giveaways. Sponsors pay a fee based upon the position of their advertising media and the exposure it will receive. We are able to increase our revenue by utilizing a strategic floor layout that maximizes the amount of highly profitable booth, advertising, and sponsorship opportunities. We are focused on increasing our sponsorship revenue and we are currently actively engaged in enhancing our capabilities in that regard.
Marketing
 
Our Comic Conventions are marketed through a variety of media outlets, including social media, websites, public relations, television, radio, out-of-home (OOH), email, “street-teams”, and by flyers, and postcards. Our Comic Conventions usually obtain publicity through coverage of the events at our Comic Conventions by local TV stations, radio stations, newspapers, national press, fan websites, blogs, and social network channels such as Twitter, Facebook, Flickr, and Tumblr. In certain instances, we do not pay for advertising because we can provide desirable content to media outlets. For example, we typically invite local TV stations to our Comic Conventions so that they can interview the celebrities featured at our Comic Conventions. As a result, we receive TV coverage at no cost and the TV stations obtain content for their shows. In addition, we arrange for celebrities to call into local radio stations. As a result, we receive on-air promotion of our events and the radio station reaches a larger audience who want to tune in to hear our celebrities. We also receive on-air promotion by exchanging air time for admission giveaways to our Comic Conventions. With respect to the internet and online advertising, we advertise throughout our website www.wizardworld.com about upcoming Comic Conventions. We also send out emails to our fans on a regular basis.
Trademarks and Copyrights
 
We have a portfolio of trademarks and service marks and maintain a catalog of copyrighted works. Such marks include “Wizard World”, “Where Pop FI Comes to Life” and “WizPop”.
Regulation
 
Typically, we do not have to obtain permits to operate the Comic Conventions. The convention centers at which such events occur obtain any required permits and cover fire safety and occupancy matters as part of the rental agreement. Crowd control varies by location and is either provided by the convention center’s personnel or by a third-party security service recommended by the convention center. The convention centers do, however, require liability insurance, which Conventions has obtained and maintained.
Customers
 
We derive revenue from both Comic Convention attendees and clients that purchase sponsor opportunities and take part in our Comic Conventions as exhibitors.
 
Show Attendees
 
Our Comic Conventions are attended primarily by men and women in the 18 to 34-year-old demographic, together with families of all ages who are fans of various types of entertainment and media, including movies, music, toys, video games, consumer electronics, computers, and lifestyle products (e.g. clothes, footwear, digital devices, and mobile phones). We are seeking to develop a positive reputation for hosting quality events in order to build brand loyalty among our show attendees and ensure repeat attendance.

Corporate Sponsors and Exhibitors
 
We identify and target some of the leading movie studios, video game producers, comic book publishers, television broadcasters, and toy manufacturers as future exhibitors and sponsors. In addition, our digital media business will provide sales opportunities across the Fortune 1000 corporate sector, as these brand advertisers look to leverage our media properties to reach our target audience.
 
No single advertiser, promoter or sponsor comprises a significant portion of our revenues.
 
Competition; Competitive Strengths
 
In the live, regionally-based consumer conventions market, the strength of a competitor is measured by the location and size of the region or city, the frequency of live events per year, the guest and VIP list (e.g. celebrities and artists), the number of paying attendees, the physical size of the convention, the extent of the public relations outreach (through traditional media, digital media and social media), and the quantity and quality of exhibitors and dealers. We believe that we have a strong competitive position because our Comic Conventions take place in well-known major cities across the United States throughout the year. Our strategy of providing multiple conventions per year enable us to market our events throughout the entire year, create a large amount of high-quality content that can be distributed through our digital media outlets, and market in not only the regional consumer areas, but nationally as well. The multiple locations also allow us to work with more celebrities, artists and writers and host them in multiple cities.
 
There are a number of Comic Convention providers that produce events across the country. We are unique in that we produce more Comic Conventions in the United States annually than any other organization. We reach audiences coast-to-coast, north-to-south markets in the United States. We believe that creates an advantage over other event producers because our Comic Conventions are not limited to one city, but rather span well-known cities across the United States.
 
We also believe that we have an advantage over competitors because our Comic Conventions are well known and well respected in the Comic Convention and pop culture industry. We have a reputation among fans, exhibitors, and celebrities for producing high-quality and well attended Comic Conventions that provide consumers with a good value proposition for an entertainment experience.
 
Sales Channels and Pricing Policies
 
We have outsourced our admission sales to a national ticketing service. Admission prices typically range from $50 for a single day pass to $80 for a general weekend pass. Entry for children ten years old and under is free at Wizard Comic Conventions.
Sales and Marketing Strategy
 
We promote our Comic Conventions through a wide variety of media outlets, such as local radio and TV stations, newspapers, fan websites, and blogs. We also use online social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube, to reach our fans and provide updates. Further, we promote our Comic Conventions on our website www.wizardworld.com and through our email database. We currently sell to prospective corporate sponsors and advertisers through our direct sales force.
Growth Strategy
 
Aggressive steps taken by the Company’s new management throughout 2017 and 2018 including but not limited to cost containment and the reduction of corporate staff and overhead, have now provided a stable and reliable base of operations from which the Company can grow. The Company plans to pursue expansion by carefully evaluating various strategies that are now under consideration and utilizing knowledge gained throughout the Company’s history.
 
We plan to organically develop new Comic Conventions. We also seek to increase revenues of our existing Comic Conventions through improving the fan experience by highly curating the entertainment, exhibitors, celebrities, panels, gaming tournaments, genres of fandom and opportunities for VIP experiences. Internalizing various services provided at our Comic Conventions we believe we can also lead to increased revenues. For example, all photo-operations at our Conventions are now owned and controlled by the Company. To help us provide a better customer experience, and in order to address the logistics of hosting additional and more profitable Comic Conventions, the Company has entered into a relationship with a sophisticated ticket sales company. We have focused on the cost of production of each Convention and we have taken material strides to improve operating efficiencies.

The Company is also looking to leverage its existing resources and exposure, both online and at Comic Conventions, to generate revenue through new business opportunities. For example, the Company intends to move into the area of e-commerce and collectibles.
 
Additionally, we are attempting to increase revenue through increasing corporate sponsorships with national Fortune 1000 marketers by offering these advertisers a wide range of promotional vehicles, both on-site and through our digital media and online offerings. We believe that we will be able to further enhance our relationships with our existing dealers, exhibitors, celebrities, and VIPs while, at the same time, developing new relationships with national brand marketers looking to connect with our growing audiences. Currently the Company has embarked on a major initiative to identify potential local, regional and national sponsors and to conclude sponsorship arrangements with them.
 
To help facilitate our growth, we have undertaken more sophisticated and more cost-effective marketing techniques. We have also upgraded our internal accounting department which has adopted the use of sophisticated accounting software and PO systems in order to better handle the accounting matters associated with a larger company.
 
The Wizard World Comic Convention digital marketing platform extends across online and social media outlets with a growth strategy that is fueled by continually producing content for and harnessing content from the growing Comic Convention consumers. For example, the platform includes: (i) the website www.wizardworld.com (ii) our Facebook page, www.facebook.com/wizardworld, (iii) Twitter at www.twitter.com/wizardworld, (iv) video social websites such as www.youtube.com/wizardworld, and (v) Instagram at www.instagram.com/wizardworld. Through the distribution of our content via digital media, we offer advertisers the ability to display their sponsorship messages in immersive and integrated ways, including, but not limited to, our large e-mail database of fans. Through sales varying from digital display advertising space on our digital media properties, to title sponsorship positioning on key aspects for the live events, we plan to generate new forms of sponsorship revenues and thus strengthen our financial condition. It is our further intention to expand the Company’s digital offerings by curating and producing high quality content for digital distribution which will broaden the Company’s position and reputation as an authentic voice of pop culture. The new digital initiatives will enhance the Company’s live event activities and will become a major force in their own right. We will also greatly increase our presence as a disseminator of collectible products as a part of a greatly augmented and expanded e-commerce initiative.
 
In the Fall of 2017, we announced two agreements with the CN Live platform in China. Under these agreements we will provide English language programs across mainland China on an ad-supported and SVOD basis, work is continuing on that initiative. We also plan to include the development of IP with a major motion picture studio, in addition to exploring immersive media opportunities.
 
Employees
 
We currently have 12 full-time equivalent employees. Additionally, we engage 8 part-time freelance consultants providing us with greater core competence in the disciplines of Marketing, Sponsorship Sales, Event Production and e-commerce.
