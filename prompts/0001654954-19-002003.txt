  Item 1. Business
 
  You should read the following discussion in conjunction with our financial statements as of December 31, 2018 and the notes to such financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Overview
 
 We are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing proprietary therapeutics designed to improve clinical outcomes for cancer patients. We are building a drug development pipeline through licensing and acquisition of oncology therapeutics in late preclinical and clinical development stages. We leverage our scientific and clinical expertise to help de-risk and accelerate the clinical development of our drug product candidates.
 

 We intend to begin a Phase 3 clinical development program for our lead product candidate, Validive (clonidine mucobuccal tablet; clonidine MBT), in mid-2019. Validive is designed to be used prophylactically to reduce the incidence, delay the time to onset, and decrease the duration of severe oral mucositis (“SOM”) in patients undergoing chemoradiotherapy (“CRT”) for oropharyngeal cancer (“OPC”). SOM is a painful and debilitating inflammation and ulceration of the mucous membranes lining the oral cavity and oropharynx. Patients receiving CRT to treat their OPC often develop SOM, which remains one of the most common and troubling side effects of treatment in this indication. The potential clinical benefits to patients of reducing or delaying the incidence of SOM, or reducing the duration of SOM, include: reduced treatment discontinuations leading to potentially improved overall survival outcomes; reduced mouth and throat pain avoiding the need to receive parenteral nutrition; and decreased long-term and often permanent debilitation arising from swallowing difficulties, neck and throat spasms, and lung complications due to food aspiration. Our mucobuccal tablet (“MBT”) formulation is a novel delivery system for clonidine that allows for prolonged and enhanced local delivery of drug in the regions of mucosal radiation damage in patients with OPC. Validive has been granted fast track designation in the U.S., orphan drug designation in the EU, and has global intellectual property patent protection through mid-2029 not accounting for possible extensions.
 

 In September 2017, we exercised an option to license Validive from Onxeo S.A., the company that developed Validive through its Phase 2 clinical trial. In the completed Phase 2 clinical trial, Validive demonstrated clinically meaningful efficacy signals within the 64-patient OPC population randomized to placebo, Validive 50 µg dose and Validive 100 µg dose. The absolute incidence of SOM in OPC patients who received a dose of Validive 100 µg once per day was reduced by 26.3% (incidence rate of 65.2% in placebo, 45.0% in Validive 50 µg group, and 38.9% in Validive 100 µg group). The median time to onset of SOM was 37 days in the placebo cohort; 45 days in the Validive 50 µg cohort and no median time of onset was reached in the Validive 100 µg group since fewer than half of this cohort of patients developed SOM. There was also a 37.8% reduction in the median duration of the SOM for the Validive 100 µg group versus placebo (41.0 days placebo group, 34.0 days Validive 50 µg group, and 25.5 days Validive 100 µg group) in patients that developed SOM. Median duration of SOM across all patients, inclusive of both those that did and did not develop SOM, was 17 days in the placebo group and 0 days in each of the Validive 50 and 100 µg groups. A positive dose response was seen in each of these three clinical endpoints. Additionally, patients in the Validive cohorts in the Phase 2 clinical trial demonstrated a safety profile similar to that of placebo. While not designed by us, Onxeo’s preclinical studies and Phase 2 clinical trial have informed the design and conduct of what we believe will be an effective Phase 3 clinical program.
 

 SOM typically arises in the macrophages-rich immune tissue located at the back of the tongue and throat, which comprise the oropharynx, resulting in acute severe tissue damage and pain that prevents patients from swallowing, eating and drinking. Validive stimulates the alpha-2 adrenergic receptor (alpha-2AR) on macrophages (white blood cells that comprise the immune tissues of the oropharynx) suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. Validive exerts its effects locally in the mouth over a prolonged period of time through its unique MBT formulation. Patients who develop SOM are also at increased risk of developing late onset toxicities, including trismus (jaw, neck, and throat spasms), dysphagia, and lung complications, which are often irreversible and lead to increased hospitalization and the need for further interventions sometimes years after completion of chemoradiotherapy. We believe that a reduction in the incidence and duration of SOM by Validive will have the potential for both near- and long-term clinical impact in the OPC patient population by minimizing mouth and throat pain, improving the ability to tolerate food and liquid by mouth (and avoid parenteral feeding tube placement) during chemoradiation, reducing treatment discontinuation and/or delay thereby leading to improved survival outcomes, and reducing long-term morbidities.
 

 The OPC target population for Validive is the most rapidly growing segment of head and neck cancer (“HNC”) patients, with an estimated 40,000 cases of OPC in the U.S alone in 2019. The increasing prevalence of oral human papilloma virus (“HPV”) infections in the U.S. and around the world is the major driver for the increasing incidence of OPC. Despite the availability of a pediatric/adolescent HPV vaccine, due to low adoption of the vaccine to date, the rate of OPC incidence in adults is not anticipated to be impacted for many decades. As a result, the incidence of HPV-driven OPC is projected to increase for many years to come and will continue to support a clinical need for Validive for the prevention of chemoradiotherapy-induced SOM in patients with OPC.
 

 A pre-Phase 3 meeting with the FDA was held in early May 2018. Based on the meeting discussion, a Phase 3 clinical protocol and accompanying statistical analysis plan (“SAP”) was submitted to the FDA for review and comments. We also received protocol assistance and advice on our Phase 3 protocol and SAP from the European Medicines Agency Committee on Human Medicinal Products (EMA/CHMP/SAWP) in June 2018. Based on comments and guidance provided by FDA and EMA, we intend to initiate a Phase 3 clinical development program in mid-2019 to support registration. This program will consist of an adaptive design trial with an interim analysis planned for approximately twelve months after the first patient is dosed, and a confirmatory second trial planned to commence shortly after completion of this interim analysis.

 Our second product candidate, MNPR-201, is a novel analog of doxorubicin that has been designed to eliminate the cardiotoxic side effects typically generated by doxorubicin and other anthracycline cancer drugs. MNPR-201 is not metabolized to the derivatives that are believed to be responsible for doxorubicin’s cardiotoxic effects but retains anti-cancer activity. A Phase 2 clinical trial for MNPR-201 has been completed in patients with unresectable or metastatic sarcoma, showing 6-month progression free survival (“PFS”) of 38%, compared to doxorubicin historical values of 23-33%. No irreversible cardiotoxicity was observed. Based on this preliminary clinical evidence of anti-cancer activity at a well-tolerated dose and schedule, we plan to continue the development of MNPR-201 in one of the cancer settings for which doxorubicin is currently used as the standard of care but cumulative exposure is limited due to concerns over cardiotoxicity. The aim is to provide MNPR-201 for more cycles of administration than can be used for doxorubicin, improving efficacy.
 

 In addition, we plan to advance the development of MNPR-101, a novel first-in-class humanized monoclonal antibody to the urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (“uPAR”) for the treatment of advanced cancers. The IND-enabling work is nearly completed and we anticipate requesting a pre-IND meeting with the FDA once we have engaged a clinical manufacturer for the production of MNPR-101 clinical material.
 

 Our management team has extensive experience in developing therapeutics through regulatory approval and commercialization. In aggregate, companies they co-founded have achieved four drug approvals in the U.S. and the EU, successfully sold an asset developed by management which is currently in Phase 3 clinical trials, and completed the sale of a company for over $800 million in cash. Understanding the preclinical, clinical, regulatory and commercial development processes and hurdles are key factors in successful drug development and the expertise demonstrated by our management team across all of these areas increases the probability of success in advancing the product candidates in our product pipeline.
 

  Our Product Pipeline
 

 Our Product Candidates
 
  Validive (clonidine mucobuccal tablet; clonidine MBT)
 
 Validive is a MBT of clonidine. The MBT formulation was developed to enhance the oral mucosal drug delivery and significantly increase the salivary concentrations of the active ingredient while minimizing systemic absorption. The Validive tablet is tasteless and administered once daily by affixing it to the inner side of the patient’s upper lip where it dissolves slowly over the period of several hours, resulting in the extended release of clonidine into the oral cavity and oropharynx, the site of SOM following chemoradiation treatment for OPC. Validive therapy is designed to begin on the first day of chemoradiation treatment and continue daily through the last day of treatment.
 

 SOM is a painful and debilitating inflammation and ulceration of the mucous membranes lining the oral cavity and oropharynx. Patients receiving CRT to treat their OPC often develop SOM, which remains one of the most common and troubling side effects of treatment in this indication. We believe Validive has the potential to address several critical elements that affect SOM patients, including:
 

  Reduction in the incidence of SOM. SOM can increase the risk of acute and chronic comorbidities, including dysphagia, trismus and lung complications, which are often irreversible and lead to increased hospitalization and the need for additional interventions. In a Phase 2 clinical trial, the OPC patient cohort treated with Validive 100 µg demonstrated a reduction in the absolute incidence of SOM compared to placebo of 26.3% (incidence rate of 65.2% in placebo, 45.0% in Validive 50 µg group, 38.9% in Validive 100 µg group). A reduced incidence of SOM in OPC patients may lower the risk of acute and chronic morbidities and improve quality of life.
 

  Delay in the time to onset of SOM. SOM can cause cancer treatment delay and/or discontinuation, which may impact overall survival outcomes. In a Phase 2 clinical trial, the OPC patients had a time to onset of SOM of 37 days in the placebo cohort; 45-day time to onset of SOM in the Validive 50 µg cohort; and median was not reached as fewer than half of the patients developed SOM in the Validive 100 µg group. Prolonging time to onset of SOM may lead to fewer missed chemoradiotherapy treatments, resulting in improved overall survival outcomes.
 

  Decrease in the duration of SOM. Longer duration of SOM leads to a higher risk of the need for parenteral nutrition and lower quality of life. SOM patients experience inability to drink and/or eat, and difficulty swallowing often resulting in malnourishment and feeding tube intervention. The Phase 2 clinical trial data demonstrated a 15.5-day reduction (by 37.8%) in the duration of SOM for patients treated with Validive 100 µg (41 day median duration with placebo, 34 days with the Validive 50 µg group, and 25.5 days for the Validive 100 µg group) in patients that developed SOM. Median duration across all patients, inclusive of both those that did and did not develop SOM, was 17 days in the placebo group and 0 days in each of the Validive 50 and 100 µg groups. Reduced duration of SOM may result in lower risk of malnourishment and feeding tube intervention, and fewer treatment terminations/delays.

  MNPR-201 (GPX-150; 5-imino-13-deoxydoxorubicin)
 
 MNPR-201 (5-imino-13-deoxydoxorubicin) is a proprietary doxorubicin analog that is selective for topoisomerase II-alpha. Doxorubicin is used to treat adult and pediatric solid and blood (hematologic) cancers, including breast, gastric, ovarian and bladder cancers, soft tissue sarcomas, leukemias and lymphomas. The optimal clinical efficacy of doxorubicin has historically been limited by the risk of patients developing irreversible, potentially life-threatening cardiotoxicity despite clinical studies demonstrating the anti-cancer benefit of higher doses of doxorubicin administered for longer periods of time. For example, several clinical studies completed in the 1990s demonstrated that concurrent doxorubicin (60 mg/m2, 8 cycles) and paclitaxel gave a 94% overall response rate in patients with metastatic breast cancer but led to 18% of these patients developing congestive heart failure. Reduction of doxorubicin to 4-6 cycles of treatment decreased occurrence of congestive heart failure, but also reduced response rates to 45-55%.
 

 MNPR-201 has been engineered specifically to retain the anticancer activity of doxorubicin while minimizing the toxic effects on the heart. We believe the results of these studies, along with the potential to combine a less or non-cardiotoxic analog of doxorubicin with other anticancer agents, offer the opportunity to develop a large market opportunity for MNPR-201 in a broad spectrum of cancer types.
 

 The antitumor effects of MNPR-201 are mediated through the stabilization of the topoisomerase II complex after a DNA strand break and DNA intercalation leading to apoptosis (cell death) through a mechanism similar to doxorubicin and other anthracycline drugs. Inhibiting the topoisomerase II-alpha isoform is desired for the anti-cancer effect, while inhibiting the topoisomerase II-beta isoform has been demonstrated to mediate, at least in part, the cardiotoxicity associated with all anthracycline drugs currently used in the clinic. MNPR-201 is substantially more selective than doxorubicin for inhibiting topoisomerase II-alpha versus topoisomerase II-beta. This selectivity may at least partly explain the minimal cardiotoxicity that has been observed for MNPR-201 in preclinical and clinical studies to date.
 

  MNPR-101 (formerly huATN-658)
 
 MNPR-101 is a novel, preclinical stage drug candidate. It is a first-in-class humanized monoclonal antibody to the urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (“uPAR”), a well-credentialed cancer therapeutic target. uPAR is a protein receptor that sits on the cell surface of, and is overexpressed in, many deadly cancers, but has little to no expression in healthy tissue; several Phase 1 imaging studies in human advanced cancer patients show that uPAR can only be detected in the tumor and not in normal tissues.
 

 In normal cells, uPAR is transiently expressed as part of a highly regulated process required for the breakdown of extracellular matrix during normal tissue remodeling. In cancer, however, uPAR is constitutively over-expressed by the tumor cell and the uPAR extracellular matrix degrading function is hijacked by the tumor to support tissue invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis. It is important to tumor cell survival, and the uPAR expression increases in high grade and metastatic disease.
 

 MNPR-101 has demonstrated significant anti-tumor activity in numerous preclinical models of tumor growth, both as a monotherapy and in combination with other therapeutics and is being advanced toward an IND. Based on the selective expression of uPAR in numerous tumor types, we anticipate MNPR-101 will be well-tolerated and amenable to a variety of combination treatment approaches in the clinic.
 
 Our Strategy
 
 Leveraging the experience and the demonstrated competencies of our management team, our strategic goal is to acquire, develop and commercialize promising oncology product candidates that address the unmet medical needs of cancer patients. The key elements of our strategy to achieve this goal are to:
 

  ●
 Leverage data generated from the Phase 2 Validive clinical trial to position us well for a successful Phase 3 clinical trial program for Validive for SOM in OPC. In a Phase 2 clinical trial the absolute incidence of SOM in OPC patients was reduced by 26.3%, the time to onset was delayed, and the duration in patients that developed SOM was decreased by 15.5 days in the Validive 100 µg cohort versus placebo. In addition to the data from the Phase 2 clinical trial, we believe the guidance from our key opinion leaders (“KOLs”) as well as from the FDA and EMA, and our own internal clinical trial design expertise, position us well for a successful Phase 3 clinical trial program.


  ●
 Obtain FDA approval of Validive and maximize the commercial potential of Validive in the U.S. and the EU, seeking partnerships outside these markets. Following a potentially successful Phase 3 clinical program of Validive and potential FDA approval, we intend to commercialize Validive in the U.S. and the EU which may include establishing our own specialty sales force and seeking partnerships outside of these territories for regulatory approval and drug sales and distribution.


  ●
 Advance the clinical development of MNPR-201, by pursuing existing clinical settings where doxorubicin has demonstrated efficacy. We plan to expand on the data generated in a Phase 2 clinical trial of MNPR-201 in patients with unresectable or metastatic sarcoma. In this study, the 6-month progression free survival (“PFS”) was 38%, compared to doxorubicin historical values of 23-33%. We anticipate being able to treat patients with MNPR-201 at higher doses for longer periods of time given the reduced cardiotoxicity observed thus far in human clinical studies, which may lead to improved clinical outcomes.


  ●
 Continue the development of MNPR-101 and expand our drug development pipeline through in-license and acquisition of oncology product candidates. We plan to continue the development of MNPR-101 and the expansion of our drug development pipeline through acquiring or in-licensing additional oncology product candidates, particularly those that leverage existing scientific and clinical data that helps de-risk the next steps in clinical development.


  ●
 Utilize the expertise and prior experience of our team in the areas of asset acquisition, drug development and commercialization to establish ourselves as a leading biopharmaceutical company. Our senior executive team has relevant experience in biopharmaceutical in-licensing and acquisitions as well as developing product candidates through approval and commercialization. In aggregate, our team has co-founded BioMarin Pharmaceutical (Nasdaq: BMRN), Raptor Pharmaceuticals ($800 million sale to Horizon Pharma), and Tactic Pharma, LLC (“Tactic Pharma”) (sale of lead asset, choline tetrathiomolybdate, which was ultimately acquired by Alexion in June 2018 for $764 million).

 Risks Associated with our Business
 
 Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described in Item 1-A “Risk Factors” before making a decision to invest in our common stock. If any of these risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects would likely be materially adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment. Below is a summary of some of the principal risks we face:
 

  ●
 We have a limited operating history, no revenues from operations, expect to incur significant operating losses and are dependent upon raising capital to continue our drug development programs. We have a high risk of never being profitable.


  ●
 We do not have and may never have any approved products on the market. Our business is highly dependent upon receiving approvals from various U.S. and international governmental agencies and will be severely harmed if we are not granted approval to manufacture and sell our product candidates.


  ●
 Our clinical trials may not yield sufficiently conclusive results for regulatory agencies to approve the use of our products.


  ●
 If we experience delays or difficulties in the enrollment of subjects in clinical trials, our receipt of necessary regulatory approvals could be delayed or prevented, which could materially affect our financial condition.


  ●
 We rely on third parties to conduct our non-clinical studies and our clinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may be unable to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our current product candidates or any future products and our financial condition will be adversely affected.


  ●
 Funds raised in the near term may not be sufficient to complete our Phase 3 clinical development of Validive, which would require that we raise additional funds. If we raise additional funds in the future to complete our Phase 3 clinical program for Validive, it may not be at favorable terms. If we are unable to raise enough funds in the future, we may have to discontinue or delay our operations.


  ●
 We face significant competition from other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, and our operating results will suffer if we fail to compete effectively. Competition and technological change may make our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive.


  ●
 The termination of third-party licenses could adversely affect our rights to important compounds or technologies.


  ●
 If we and our third-party licensors do not obtain and preserve protection for our respective intellectual property rights, our competitors may be able to take advantage of our development efforts to develop competing drugs.


  ●
 If we lose key management leadership, and/or scientific personnel, and if we cannot recruit qualified employees or other significant personnel, we may experience program delays and increased compensation costs, and our business may be materially disrupted.


  Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company
 
 We qualify as an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act of 2012 (“JOBS Act”). An emerging growth company may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other burdens that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. These provisions include:
 
  ●
 inclusion of only two years, as compared to three years, of audited financial statements in addition to any required unaudited interim financial statements with correspondingly reduced “Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” disclosures;


  ●
 an exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Sarbanes-Oxley Act”);


  ●
 an exemption from compliance with any new requirements adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”) requiring mandatory audit firm rotation;


  ●
 reduced disclosure about executive compensation arrangements; and


  ●
 an exemption from the requirement to seek non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements.


 We may take advantage of these provisions until we are no longer an emerging growth company. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (1) the last day of the year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of an initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period.
 

 We have taken advantage of the reduced reporting requirements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Accordingly, the information contained herein is different from the information you receive from other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.
 

 The JOBS Act permits an emerging growth company such as us to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected to opt out of this provision and, as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards when they are required to be adopted by public companies that are not emerging growth companies. In addition, we are also a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and have elected to take advantage of certain of the scaled disclosure requirements available to smaller reporting companies such as extensive narrative disclosure required of other reporting companies, particularly in the description of executive compensation.

  Validive (clonidine mucobuccal tablet; clonidine MBT)
 
  Validive U.S. Market Opportunity
 
 The incidence of HNC (all anatomical types, including larynx, oral cavity, oropharynx, etc.) in the U.S. was estimated to be approximately 65,000 cases in 2017 (American Society of Clinical Oncology, cancer.net). The most rapidly growing type of HNC is OPC. The oropharynx is comprised largely of immune tissue and includes the soft palate, the base (rear one third) of the tongue, and the tonsils. In the U.S., the incidence of OPC is estimated to be around 40,000 cases in 2019. The majority of these OPC patients (approximately 70%) are HPV+. The incidence of OPC is also increasing in the rest of the world (>30% of HNC), with >50% of all OPC being HPV+. While certain types of HNC have been in decline in the U.S., such as laryngeal cancer as a result of a reduction in the smoking population, the total incidence of HNC has been growing steadily primarily due to OPC. The increase in OPC is directly associated with increased infection with the human papilloma virus. The incidence of HPV+ OPC has outpaced the incidence of HPV– HNC by 4-5-fold over the past decade. This trend of HPV+ OPC driving an increase in overall HNC is expected to continue for some time as the relatively recent introduction of a vaccine designed to prevent the transfer and colonization with HPV is only effective if administered prior to infection, and it is recommended only for those under the age of 26. Even for those under the age of 26 who are eligible for the vaccine, oral HPV infections are predicted to increase due to the lack of adequate use of HPV vaccinations. Only around 50% of eligible females and 33% of eligible males are presently being vaccinated.
 

 Most OPC is caused by the HPV16 strain, with virus detectable in the tumor. More than 3% of adult men and 1% of adult woman have HPV16 detectable in their saliva at any one time. The virus is transmitted through sexual contact and studies estimate 3-5% of adolescents and 5-10% of all adults in the U.S. have an active oral HPV infection. The latency period for that proportion that does go on to develop HPV+ OPC is 15-20+ years. This HPV+ OPC population is expected to be a long-term driver of the incidence of OPC and the resultant SOM associated with what is frequently curative therapy for this serious malignancy.
 

 In previous studies describing SOM in OPC patients receiving the CRT regimen we are proposing for our Validive Phase 3 clinical program, patients had a SOM incidence rate of 55%-90% across studies. In the Validive Phase 2 trial, the incidence of SOM in OPC patients receiving placebo was 65.2% (see “Validive Phase 2 Clinical Trial Data” section below). Currently there is no way to predict which patients will develop SOM, so any preventive treatment for SOM will likely be used in most OPC patients receiving CRT. With approximately 40,000 annual cases of OPC in the U.S., and a consistently growing incidence rate of OPC as a result of the human papillomavirus, there is the potential for a substantial and growing market for Validive.
 

  Validive Mechanism of Action
 

 Validive is designed to deliver high local concentrations of clonidine, an agonist of alpha-2AR, to the oral cavity and oropharynx, the site of irradiation in the treatment of OPC. In the oropharynx, alpha-2AR is expressed on macrophages, immune cells that produce inflammatory cytokines, the molecules that are responsible for the development of SOM, in response to chemoradiation. A recent clinical study demonstrated that radiation treatment substantially increased salivary cytokine levels and that these were positively associated with the formation of SOM in patients with head and neck cancer. Patients with human papilloma virus positive (“HPV+”) OPC demonstrate an increased accumulation of macrophages in the tumor microenvironment compared to patients with OPC without human papilloma virus (“HPV–”), thus further priming HPV+ OPC patients for the development of SOM. The alpha-2AR regulates the expression of cytokines by macrophages, and clonidine reduces this cytokine production. Macrophages are the primary immune cells in the oropharynx that express alpha-2AR, making clonidine’s mechanism of cytokine suppression macrophage selective and distinct from the mechanism of other anti-inflammatory drugs. Further, Validive delivers clonidine to the mucosal surface, the site of radiation treatment in OPC. This results in high salivary concentrations of clonidine, minimizing systemic absorption, and allowing for maximal exposure of drug to the at-risk oral mucosa and the OPC microenvironment. Preclinical studies and a Phase 2 clinical trial of Validive have provided data that support Validive’s mechanism of action and therapeutic potential for reducing the development of SOM in patients with OPC, improving oral mucositis-related symptoms, and decreasing chemoradiotherapy-related adverse events, while exhibiting a favorable safety profile and high compliance rate in patients.
 Validive Development Strategy
 

 A pre-Phase 3 meeting with the FDA was held in early May 2018. Based on the meeting discussion, a Phase 3 clinical protocol and accompanying statistical analysis plan (“SAP”) were submitted to the FDA for review and comments. Based on guidance received from the FDA after review of these documents, we plan to initiate a Phase 3 clinical development program in mid-2019 to support registration. This program will consist of an adaptive design trial with an interim analysis planned for approximately twelve months after the first patient is dosed, and a confirmatory second trial planned to commence shortly after completion of this interim analysis. Each trial will be randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, with a two-sided alpha of 0.05 (p <0.05). The dose for both trials will be Validive 100 µg, once daily. The primary endpoint will be the proportion of subjects that develop SOM (World Health Organization grade ≥ 3).

  Validive Phase 2 Clinical Trial Data
 
 In October 2015, the results from an international Phase 2 clinical trial of Validive were announced, demonstrating encouraging signs of clinical activity and safety compared to placebo. The trial enrolled 183 patients and was conducted in more than thirty centers in Europe and the United States. HNC patients who had undergone surgical resection of their head and neck cancer with curative intent and who were planned to receive at least 50 Gray (Gy) of radiation in combination with chemotherapy, regardless of anatomical location of disease, were included in this study. This global, multi-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, three-arm study (NCT01385748) compared the efficacy and safety of Validive 50 µg and 100 µg to placebo in patients with HNC receiving chemoradiotherapy. Of the 183 HNC patients, 64 had OPC (placebo = 24, Validive 50 µg = 21, Validive 100 µg = 19). Validive and placebo were applied to the gum of the mouth once daily beginning 1 to 3 days prior to chemoradiotherapy and continuing until the end of chemoradiation.
 

 We believe the Phase 2 clinical trial data support the development of Validive for reducing the incidence, delaying the time to onset, and reducing the duration of SOM in OPC patients. We believe there is the potential for an enhanced benefit in HPV+ patients. These patients have an increased prevalence of macrophages in the oropharynx, and a 6.9-fold higher risk of developing SOM. The onset of SOM also occurs sooner in HPV+ patients than in HPV– OPC patients, likely due to the increased accumulation of immune cells such as macrophages in the tumor due to the presence of the HPV infection. These cells express oral mucosa damaging cytokines in response to chemoradiation, and Validive exerts its effect by suppressing this expression.
 

 The analysis of OPC patients in this study showed:
 

  ●
 The incidence of SOM (primary endpoint) was reduced by 26.3% (40% relative to placebo) in OPC patients treated with Validive 100 µg (p=0.09(1)), a meaningful trend but not statistically significant). 65.2% of OPC patients on placebo experienced SOM compared to only 38.9% of OPC patients on Validive 100 µg.


 


■  Incidence of SOM in OPC Patients
 

 Validive has demonstrated reduced incidence of SOM in a Phase 2 clinical trial
 
  
  ●
 Patients on Validive experienced a delay in the time to onset of SOM. Patients receiving placebo experienced a median time to onset of SOM of 37 days; patients receiving Validive (50 µg one per day) experienced a 45 day median time to onset of SOM; and patients receiving Validive (100 µg once per day) did not reach a median time to onset. A comparison of hazards for time to onset demonstrated that patients that received Validive 100 µg had a hazard ratio (HR)=0.48 compared to placebo.


  ●
 Patients receiving Validive experienced a decrease in the median duration of SOM. In patients that developed SOM, a 15.5 day reduction (by 37.8%) in the median duration of SOM was observed in patients treated with Validive 100 µg (41 day median duration with placebo, 34 days in the Validive 50 µg group, and 25.5 days in the Validive 100 µg group). Median duration across all patients, inclusive of both those that did and did not develop SOM, was 17 days in the placebo group and 0 days in each of the Validive 50 and 100 µg groups.

 Severe drinking, eating, and speaking limitations due to mouth and throat soreness (“MTS”) score were also reduced in the Validive 100 µg treated cohort.


  ●
 Improvements in other indicators of clinical benefit, including decreased weight loss, decreased opiate use and increased cumulative dose of radiation received, strongly favored the Validive 100 µg treated group.


  ●
 A dose response was observed with the Validive 100 µg dose, demonstrating a trend toward superiority over the Validive 50 µg dose as well as placebo.



 (1) p-value is a conventional statistical method for measuring the statistical significance of experimental results. A p-value of less than 0.05 is generally considered to represent statistical significance, meaning that there is a less than five percent likelihood that the observed results occurred by chance.

 Patients treated with Validive experienced less nausea and dysphagia compared to placebo. No clinically meaningful decreases in systolic blood pressure or diastolic blood pressure were noted between the placebo and Validive arms. There was no statistical difference in the number of patients having experienced at least one treatment emergent adverse event related to the study treatment between placebo and Validive. Additionally, patients in the Validive cohorts in the Phase 2 clinical trial demonstrated a safety profile similar to that of placebo. Two patients in the placebo group and 2 patients in the Validive 50 µg group experienced serious adverse events ("SAEs") that were assessed as treatment related. No patients in the Validive treated cohorts were discontinued due to study drug. The 2-year survival rate was similar between patients treated with placebo and Validive indicating that Validive did not interfere with primary disease treatment.
 

 The mean overall patient compliance was approximately 90% across all treatment groups. Overall compliance according to patient diaries was similar in all treatment groups and consistent with the compliance according to the investigator’s evaluation.
 

 Our review of the Phase 2 clinical trial data suggests that the effect of Validive was much greater in OPC compared to non-OPC patients. We believe the Phase 2 data along with the mechanism of action of Validive provide a rationale for developing Validive for the treatment of radiation induced SOM in OPC patients as a first indication. The most rapidly growing sub-population of HNC in the U.S. and Europe are patients with OPC, largely driven by HPV+ disease. The oropharynx is the part of the throat at the back of the mouth, which includes the soft palate, the base (rear one third) of the tongue, and the tonsils. HPV+ OPC is a molecularly defined population of HNC characterized by the expression of a protein biomarker, p16 INK4a, and the presence of HPV DNA in the tumor. Evaluation of HPV status is part of the routine clinical assessment of patients with OPC prior to initiating treatment.
 

 For the full 183 patient Phase 2 population, which included various types of head and neck cancer such as oral and laryngeal cancer in addition to OPC, the incidence of SOM was lower in patients treated with Validive (45.3% when the 50 and 100 µg dose groups were pooled together) than in patients receiving placebo (60.0%) (p = 0.064). Additionally, Validive was very well tolerated, with occurrence of adverse events of any type or grade being similar between placebo (98.4%) and Validive treated groups (90.8%).
   

  Validive Phase 1 Clinical Trial Data
 
 A Phase 1 clinical trial in 36 healthy volunteers comparing the pharmacokinetics of the systemic (oral tablet) clonidine HCl with clonidine MBT (local delivery of clonidine to oral mucosa and oropharynx – Validive’s formulation) was completed. This single-center, Phase 1, single-blind randomized, three-period, three-sequence, single-dose crossover study was conducted between August and November 2015. Healthy volunteers receiving Validive had far less systemic exposure to clonidine with the 50 µg and 100 µg clonidine MBTs (Validive) versus 100 µg clonidine HCl tablets (oral tablet). In contrast, levels of clonidine in saliva in volunteers receiving a single dose of 50 and 100 µg clonidine MBT (Validive) was much greater than saliva levels in volunteers receiving a single dose of 100 µg clonidine HCl tablets. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the MBT formulation (Validive) is targeted in the mouth, as opposed to distributed systemically. Additionally, no significant effects on blood pressure were observed with the clonidine MBTs (Validive). Blood pressure effects were tested because clonidine is known to lower blood pressure when absorbed systemically.
 

  
 Both Validive 50 µg and 100 µg showed high salivary exposure, with low systematic and blood pressure effect as seen below:

  Validive Preclinical Data
 
 The anti-inflammatory properties of clonidine were studied in a human oral mucosa organotypic culture model, as pro-inflammatory cytokines are believed to drive the development of SOM. Samples of healthy non-keratinized human oral mucosa were obtained from patients undergoing surgery. The experimental oral mucosa pro-inflammatory process was mediated by the addition of neuropeptide substance P (“SP”) to the culture medium. The addition of SP on human gingiva induced a significant increase in TNF-alpha, an important pro-inflammatory molecule involved in mucositis pathogenesis. Overall, on human gingiva stimulated by SP, a concentration dependent decrease in TNF-alpha production was observed with clonidine, which was statistically significant at 3 µg/ml clonidine; see below:

  MNPR-201 (GPX-150; 5-imino-13-deoxydoxorubicin)
 
 MNPR-201 (5-imino-13-deoxydoxorubicin) is a proprietary doxorubicin analog that is selective for topoisomerase II-alpha. Doxorubicin is used to treat adult and pediatric solid and blood (hematologic) cancers, including breast, gastric, ovarian and bladder cancers, soft tissue sarcomas, leukemias and lymphomas. A number of clinical studies have demonstrated the anti-cancer benefit of higher doses of doxorubicin administered for longer periods of time. The optimal clinical efficacy of doxorubicin, however, has historically been limited by the risk of patients developing irreversible, potentially life-threatening cardiotoxicity. For example, several clinical studies completed in the 1990s demonstrated that concurrent doxorubicin (60 mg/m2, 8 cycles) and paclitaxel gave a 94% overall response rate in patients with metastatic breast cancer but led to 18% of these patients developing congestive heart failure. Reduction of doxorubicin to 4-6 cycles of treatment decreased occurrence of congestive heart failure, but also reduced response rates to 45-55%.
 

 MNPR-201 has been engineered specifically to retain the anticancer activity of doxorubicin while minimizing the toxic effects on the heart. We believe the results of these studies, along with the potential to combine a less or non-cardiotoxic analog of doxorubicin with other anticancer agents, offer the opportunity to develop a large market opportunity for MNPR-201 in a broad spectrum of cancer types.
 
  
 The antitumor effects of MNPR-201 are mediated through the stabilization of the topoisomerase II complex after a DNA strand break and DNA intercalation leading to apoptosis (cell death) through a mechanism similar to doxorubicin and other anthracycline drugs. Inhibiting the topoisomerase II-alpha isoform is desired for the anti-cancer effect, while inhibiting the topoisomerase II-beta isoform has been demonstrated to mediate, at least in part, the cardiotoxicity associated with all anthracycline drugs currently used in the clinic. MNPR-201 is substantially more selective than doxorubicin for inhibiting topoisomerase II-alpha versus topoisomerase II-beta. This selectivity may at least partly explain the minimal cardiotoxicity that has been observed for MNPR-201 in preclinical and clinical studies to date.
 

  MNPR-201 U.S. Market Opportunity
 
 MNPR-201 is an analog of doxorubicin, the first anthracycline to gain FDA approval. Anthracyclines are a class of drugs that are among the most commonly used agents in the treatment of cancer. They have demonstrated efficacy in a wide variety of cancers, including breast cancer, lung cancer, ovarian cancer, sarcomas, and lymphomas. Although doxorubicin was approved decades ago, it is still widely used. According to Grand View Research, in 2015 the global Doxorubicin market was $809.6 million, with $349.7 million of those sales in the U.S. According to IMS Health (now known as IQVIA), in 2015 the European Union had over $270 million in sales between doxorubicin HCl and liposomal doxorubicin. Liposomal versions of doxorubicin (e.g. Doxil) demonstrated that a different formulation of doxorubicin with improved clinical benefits can command a significantly higher price premium compared to generic doxorubicin HCl.
 MNPR-201 Development Strategy
 
 We plan to initiate Phase 2 trial(s) that will evaluate MNPR-201 in cancer indications where doxorubicin has shown efficacy, but its utility is sub-optimal due to concerns over the potential for cardiotoxicity. The objective of these trial(s) would be to test for signals of efficacy with cumulative doses of MNPR-201 for which a comparable cumulative dose of doxorubicin would be expected to cause cardiotoxicity. A potential Phase 2 screening trial in patients with metastatic breast cancer would evaluate concurrent MNPR-201 plus paclitaxel to evaluate response rate vs. the 45-55% reported in historical controls as well as the incidence of irreversible cardiotoxicity. The absence of cardiotoxicity with concomitant administration of paclitaxel and MNPR-201 would provide a rationale for this combination in other clinical settings. Similar studies are also under consideration for the combination of MNPR-201 + trastuzumab in metastatic HER2+ breast cancer patients. Additional studies will evaluate cross-over to MNPR-201 in patients benefiting from doxorubicin that have reached their lifetime limit of doxorubicin exposure in soft tissue sarcoma (“STS”) and other cancer indications including several pediatric cancer indications. The results of these Phase 2 clinical trials would be used to inform an initial registration strategy for MNPR-201, as well as to support collaborative clinical development efforts with cooperative groups and cancer-focused foundations.

  MNPR-201 Clinical Data
 
 Several clinical studies of MNPR-201 have been completed.
 
 In January 2015, a multi-center open label single arm Phase 2 clinical trial was completed in doxorubicin-naïve patients with non-resectable or metastatic STS. Doxorubicin has historically been the standard of care for the treatment of leiomyosarcoma and other STS. This Phase 2 clinical trial enrolled 22 patients and was completed in August 2016. MNPR-201 was administered intravenously at 265 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for up to 16 doses and there was clear indication of anticancer activity at this well-tolerated dose and schedule. One patient went on compassionate use and received 20 cycles of MNPR-201, many more than the 6 to 8 cycles patients on doxorubicin are typically limited to. The progression free survival at 6 months was 38%, versus doxorubicin’s 6-month progression free survival of 25%, 33%, and 23% in three separate studies in this patient. Progression free survival at 12 months was 12%, overall survival at 12 months was 45%, and 52.7% of patients experience stable disease or partial response. The median overall survival was 8 months.
 
  MNPR-201 was well tolerated. Apart from one patient that developed febrile neutropenia and severe leukopenia, there were no grade 4 toxicities reported and no grade 3 side effects other than from anemia. A transient decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction (“LVEF”) was observed in four patients treated with MNPR-201. These decreases in LVEF in MNPR-201 treated patients were not serious adverse events and were transient, with LVEF subsequently returning to normal levels in all four subjects. Despite some subjects in this study receiving MNPR-201 for up to 20 cycles, effects on cardiac function were of no clinical significance and there was no evidence of irreversible heart failure in any subject.
 
  In October 2013, a Phase 1 dose escalation study conducted at the University of Iowa completed enrolment of 24 patients who received one of 5 different dose levels of MNPR-201 ranging from 14 to 265 mg/m2. No evidence of irreversible cardiotoxicity was observed in any of these patients, including 4 patients who received prior anthracycline (doxorubicin or related molecules) treatment. In the four highest dose levels (>84 mg/m2), 9/17 patients showed a stabilization of disease including 3 out of 4 patients with leiomyosarcoma, which is a type of cancer that originates in connective tissue and smooth muscle most commonly in the uterus, stomach and small intestine.
 

  MNPR-201 Preclinical Data
    
 In preclinical studies, MNPR-201 showed a lack of acute as well as chronic functional cardiotoxicity, and did not cause the cardiac histopathologic lesions observed with doxorubicin in a chronic rabbit model. Below is in vitro data showing the lack of altered contractility with acute exposure of rabbit atria to MNPR-201 even at increased concentrations:

 MNPR-201 demonstrated limited effect on cardiac contractility, in-line with placebo.

 Chronic administration of MNPR-201 two times per week through IV administration into New Zealand white rabbits over 13 weeks also showed a lack of cardiotoxicity of MNPR-201. Echocardiography was performed weekly to obtain left ventricular fractional shortening (“LVFS”) measurements to assess cardiac function. At sacrifice, all six doxorubicin-treated rabbits showed cardiac dysfunction by echocardiography, and LVFS was significantly different from control values (P < 0.001). In contrast, none of the MNPR-201-treated rabbits exhibited cardiac dysfunction by echocardiography at any time during the study. Below is a graph of the results:
Weekly Cardiac Echos
 


 None of the MNPR-201 treated rabbits showed significant cardiac dysfunction compared to the control, saline.
   

 At the conclusion of the 13 weeks of drug dosing, the rabbits were sacrificed and the left atria were studied to assess cardiac function ex vivo. Atria from the doxorubicin-treated rabbits had impaired cardiac contractility (dF/dt) compared to controls over the entire force-frequency range (1, 2 and 3 Hz). Cardiac contractility for the MNPR-201 treated cohort was not significantly different than the vehicle control. Below is a graph of the results:
MNPR-201 Cardiac Contractility

Values are mean, error bars are standard error of the mean (SEM). MNPR-201 demonstrated limited effect on cardiac contractility, in-line with placebo.
  

 Finally, cardiac scoring by a histopathologist of the left ventricle walls obtained from the rabbits in this study showed increased microscopic injury in hearts from doxorubicin-treated rabbits compared to hearts from rabbits administered the vehicle control. Heart tissues from MNPR-201-treated rabbits were the same as the vehicle controls.

  MNPR-101 (formerly huATN-658)
 
 MNPR-101 is a humanized monoclonal antibody designed to bind a specific cell surface receptor found on cancer cells, the urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (“uPAR”), and to interrupt several pathways required for tumor growth and progression. MNPR-101 represents a novel approach for drug targeting of uPAR as it does not interfere with normal binding of uPA to uPAR. It blocks the CD11b (alpha-M)-uPAR interaction, a possible regulator of tumor immunity expressed by myeloid derived suppressor cells. MNPR-101 is believed to have potential activity against many different cancer types because it:
 
  ●
 is selectively expressed on metastatic tumor, tumor-associated immune and angiogenic endothelial cells, but not on most normal cells (several Phase 1 positron emission tomography (PET) imaging studies in human advanced cancer patients show that uPAR can only be detected in the tumor and not in normal tissues);


  ●
 is central to several extracellular and intracellular oncogenic pathways required for metastasis (inhibiting the uPA system in turn inhibits many other downstream targets, such as MAPK, AKT, MEK, and FAK, that are currently being targeted by other companies);


  ●
 is expressed on immune cells that allow the tumor to evade recognition by the immune system; and


  ●
 has the potential to interfere at several different signaling pathways that converge at uPAR.

 


  MNPR-101 Preclinical Studies
  

■  Pancreatic Cancer L3.6pl



  
 MNPR-101 has demonstrated significant anti-tumor activity as a monotherapy in numerous preclinical models of tumor growth as well as enhanced effect of multiple approved chemotherapeutics when used in combination in vivo.
 MNPR-101 Development Strategy
 
 Based upon the non-overlapping toxicity and distinct mechanism of action, we plan to develop MNPR-101 in combination with existing cancer therapies. The selective expression of uPAR in tumors underpins our expectation that MNPR-101 will be well-tolerated and amenable to a variety of combination treatment approaches. Published preclinical data have shown the ability of MNPR-101 to enhance the anti-tumor activity of chemotherapies such as paclitaxel and gemcitabine. The expression and targeting of uPAR, in general, also suggests that MNPR-101 may combine with other targeted agents that mediate signaling leading to tumor growth including the ability of tumors to evade immune response. In particular, uPAR is selectively expressed on cells of the myeloid lineage such as myeloid derived suppressor cells, neutrophils and macrophages, all of which drive tumor progression and may mediate resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors.
 
  Aside from manufacturing, we expect to conduct IND-enabling studies in order to file an IND with the FDA, depending on external funding and collaboration opportunities.

  Partnerships, Licensing, and Acquisition
 
 Since our inception, we have entered into three material business development agreements, one with Onxeo S.A., one with XOMA (US) LLC, and one with Cancer Research UK, which has since been terminated. None of the agreements have required any issuance of equity or any annual maintenance fee. See the summary of the two ongoing material agreements below.
 

  Onxeo, S.A.
 
 In June 2016, we executed an agreement with Onxeo S.A., a French public company, which gave us the option to license Validive (clonidine mucobuccal tablet), a mucoadhesive tablet of clonidine based on the Lauriad® mucoadhesive technology to potentially prevent and treat severe oral mucositis in patients undergoing treatment for head and neck cancers. The pre-negotiated license terms included as part of the option agreement included clinical, regulatory, developmental and sales milestones that could reach up to a total of $108 million if we achieve all milestones, and in addition escalating royalties on net sales from 5 - 10%. On September 8, 2017, pursuant to the Onxeo license option agreement, we exercised the option to license Validive for $1 million. The exercise of the option assigns all of Onxeo’s rights to the Validive intellectual property to us, which allows us to commence the planning of our Phase 3 clinical development program in severe oral mucositis. Under the agreement, we are required to pay royalties to Onxeo on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis until the later of (1) the date when a given product is no longer within the scope of a patent claim in the country of sale or manufacture, (2) the expiry of any extended exclusivity period in the relevant country (such as orphan drug exclusivity, pediatric exclusivity, new chemical entity exclusivity, or other exclusivity granted beyond the expiry of the relevant patent), or (3) a specific time period after the first commercial sale of the product in such country. In most countries, including the U.S., the patent term is generally 20 years from the earliest claimed filing date of a non-provisional patent application in the applicable country, not taking into consideration any potential patent term adjustment that may be filed in the future or any regulatory extensions that may be obtained. The royalty termination provision pursuant to (3) described above is shorter than 20 years and is the least likely cause of termination of royalty payments.
 

 The Onxeo license agreement does not have a pre-determined term, but expires on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis; that is, the agreement expires with respect to a given product in a given country whenever our royalty payment obligations with respect to such product have expired. The agreement may also be terminated early for cause if either we or Onxeo materially breach the agreement, or if either we or Onxeo become insolvent. We may also choose to terminate the agreement, either in its entirety or as to a certain product and a certain country, by providing Onxeo with advance notice.
 

  XOMA
 

 To humanize our MNPR-101 antibody, we have taken a non-exclusive license to XOMA (US) LLC’s humanization technology and know-how. Humanization involves replacing most of the non-critical parts of the mouse sequence of an antibody with the human sequence to minimize the ability of the human immune system to recognize this antibody as foreign. As such, MNPR-101 has been engineered to be 95% human sequence using the XOMA technology. Under the terms of the license, we are to pay only upon developmental and sales milestone achievements which could reach up to $14.925 million if we achieve all milestones. The agreement does not require the payment of sales royalties. There can be no assurance that we will reach any milestones. The first milestone payment is payable upon first dosing of a human patient in a Phase 2 clinical trial.
 Intellectual Property Portfolio and Exclusivity
 
 An important part of our strategy is obtaining patent protection to help preserve the proprietary nature of our product candidates, and to prevent others from developing competitive agents that are similar. Our patent portfolio includes issued patents and pending patent applications in the U.S. and in foreign countries. Our general practice is to seek patent protection in major markets worldwide.
 Validive
 
 We license all intellectual property related to Validive from Onxeo S.A., a French public company. See “Business - Partnerships, Licensing and Acquisition”. Validive is covered by 31 issued patents in 30 jurisdictions, including the U.S., EU, Japan, and other Asian countries, and has orphan drug designation in the EU as well as Fast Track designation from the FDA. These patents are method of use patents that cover the use of Validive to prevent and/or treat inflammation and inflammatory pain of the mucosa including cancer therapy-induced mucositis, and have been assigned to us pursuant to our license agreement with Onxeo. These patents expire in 2029 not accounting for possible extensions.
 

  MNPR-201
 
 MNPR-201 (GPX-150) is covered by manufacturing process patents. We have a patent for chemical synthesis technology that efficiently converts cardiotoxic "13-keto" anthracyclines such as doxorubicin, daunorubicin, epirubicin, and idarubicin into novel, patentable, and most likely less-cardiotoxic "5-imino-13-deoxy" analogs. A novel chemical composition of an intermediate for this synthesis is also patented. In addition, we have a patent covering the combination of MNPR-201 with paclitaxel for the treatment of cancer, plus covering the method of use of these two drugs for this purpose. Our MNPR-201 patent portfolio contains seven issued U.S. patents (two of which have expired) and one U.S. pending patent application. We have certain corresponding patents and applications in twenty-nine foreign jurisdictions, including the U.S., EU, Japan, and other Asian countries. The process patents for the synthesis of MNPR-201 intermediates will expires in 2024 and the patents covering the combination use of MNPR-201 and its analogs with taxanes will expire in 2026. We may pursue patent term extensions where appropriate. We have obtained patent protection around the intermediates and process used to manufacture MNPR-201 and we expect to obtain Hatch-Waxman exclusivity (applicable to new chemical entities) for 5 years that will prevent generic competition. We have also obtained U.S. orphan drug status in soft tissue sarcoma with additional orphan cancer indications expected to follow. In addition, we have a pending International Nonproprietary Name (“INN”) request with the World Health Organization for a non-proprietary (generic) name for MNPR-201.
 

  MNPR-101
 
 Our patent portfolio for our MNPR-101 antibody (huATN-658), as well as its epitope, consists of two issued U.S. composition of matter and their methods of use patents and corresponding (granted and pending) patents and patent applications in twenty-two foreign jurisdictions, including the European Union, Japan, and other Asian countries. These patents are owned by us. The patents covering the composition of matter of MNPR-101 will expire in 2025 and the patents covering the MNPR-101 epitope will expire in 2027. Being a novel biologic, it is eligible for 12 years of exclusivity in the U.S. under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (“BPCI Act”), and in numerous other countries it will benefit from varying durations of similar exclusivity, as well.
 

 Patent life determination depends on the date of filing of the application and other factors as promulgated under the patent laws. In most countries, including the U.S., the patent term is generally 20 years from the earliest claimed filing date (the priority date) of a non-provisional patent application in the applicable country, not taking into consideration any potential patent term adjustment that may be filed in the future or any regulatory extensions that may be obtained. Some of our patents are currently near expiration and we may pursue patent term extensions for these where appropriate. See “Risk Factors – Risks Related to our Intellectual Property”.
   

  Manufacturing
 
 We do not currently own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production or testing of Validive, MNPR-201, or MNPR-101, nor do we have plans to develop our own manufacturing operations in the foreseeable future. We presently depend on third party contract manufacturers for all our required raw materials, Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (“API”), and finished drug products for our preclinical and clinical studies. We have executed a manufacturing agreement for the next clinical batch of drug product for Validive, which will provide sufficient drug to complete the Phase 3 trials. We have also secured a manufacturing agreement for MNPR-101, but we have not yet secured a manufacturing agreement for MNPR-201.
 Sales and Marketing
 
 In light of our stage of development, we have not yet established a commercial organization or distribution capabilities. We have retained worldwide commercial rights for our product candidates. If our product candidates receive marketing approval, we plan to commercialize them in the U.S. and potentially in Europe with our own focused, specialty sales force. We would expect to conduct most of the buildout of this organization following approval in the U.S. or following similar marketing authorizations in Europe of any of our product candidates. We expect to explore commercialization of Validive and potentially other product candidates in certain markets outside the U.S., including the EU, utilizing a variety of collaboration, distribution and other sales and marketing arrangements with one or more third parties.

  Oncology Market Competition
 
 The pharmaceutical industry in general, and the oncology therapeutics sector in particular, are characterized by intense competition. We face competition from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, many of which are larger and better financed than us. We also face competition in our efforts to develop and commercialize new oncology therapeutics from academic and government laboratories. The therapeutics that we are developing, if successfully commercialized, will have to compete with existing therapeutics already on the market and novel therapeutics currently in development, as well as new therapeutics that may be discovered and developed in the future. Our product candidates will also have to compete with alternate treatment modalities, such as radiation, which is also subject to continual innovation and improvement. Additional information can be found in the section entitled “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Business Operations and Industry.”
 

 There is no effective standard of care or FDA approved preventive or therapeutic treatments for patients that develop radiation-induced SOM. Only symptomatic treatments such as opioids and palliative mouthwashes are available but have no effect on the occurrence, time to onset, or duration of SOM. Our primary competitor is a dismutase mimetic entering Phase 3 clinical development, which is administered through a daily 60-minute intravenous (“IV”) infusion to be completed within an hour before each radiation treatment. Validive, in comparison, acts locally at the sites of SOM and is a once a day self-administered oral/buccal tablet.
 

 For our MNPR-201 program, we believe, if approved, it would compete with a number of currently available anthracycline-based drugs on the market. These are largely derivatives of doxorubicin, or reformulations of doxorubicin such as liposomal doxorubicin (e.g. Doxil, owned by Johnson & Johnson). All of these have the issue of cardiotoxicity. In addition to approved products, there are a number of product candidates in development, largely as new formulations or derivatives of doxorubicin.
 

 For our MNPR-101 program, it is in the very early stages of development and the most susceptible to all of the competitive factors listed in the first paragraph of this section.
 
  
 Government Regulation and Product Approval
 
 Government authorities in the U.S., at the federal, state and local level, and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing. The pharmaceutical product candidates that we develop must be approved by the FDA before they may be legally marketed in the U.S. See “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Clinical Development and Regulatory Approval”.
U.S. Pharmaceutical Product Development Process
 
 In the U.S., the FDA regulates pharmaceutical products under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and implementing regulations. Pharmaceutical products are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial enforcement. FDA enforcement could result in refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. The process required by the FDA before a non-biological pharmaceutical product may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following:
 

  ●
 Completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies according to Good Laboratory Practices (“GLP”), or other applicable regulations;


  ●
 Submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug application (“IND”), which must become effective before human clinical studies may begin;


  ●
 Performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical studies according to the FDA’s current Good Clinical Practices (“GCP”), to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed pharmaceutical product for its intended use;


  ●
 Submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application (“NDA”) or Biologics License Application (“BLA”), for a new pharmaceutical product;


  ●
 Satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the pharmaceutical product is produced to assess compliance with the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practice standards (“cGMP:”), to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the pharmaceutical product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;


  ●
 Potential FDA audit of the preclinical and clinical study sites that generated the data in support of the NDA or BLA; and


  ●
 FDA review and approval of the NDA.


 The lengthy process of seeking required approvals and the continuing need for compliance with applicable statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial resources and approvals are inherently uncertain.

 Before testing any compounds with potential therapeutic value in humans, the pharmaceutical product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the pharmaceutical product candidate. These early proof-of-principle studies are done using sound scientific procedures and thorough documentation. The conduct of the single and repeat dose toxicology and toxicokinetic studies in animals must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLP. The sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA has concerns and notifies the sponsor. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical study can begin. If resolution cannot be reached within the 30-day review period, either the FDA places the IND on clinical hold or the sponsor withdraws the application. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a pharmaceutical product candidate at any time before or during clinical studies due to safety concerns or non-compliance. Accordingly, it is not certain that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical studies to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such clinical studies.
 

 During the development of a new drug, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2, and before an NDA or BLA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the sponsor to ask specific questions to the FDA, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the end of Phase 2 meeting to discuss their Phase 2 clinical results and present their plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical (registration) trial(s) that they believe will support approval of the new drug. A sponsor may be able to request a Special Protocol Assessment (“SPA”), the purpose of which is to reach agreement with the FDA on the Phase 3 clinical trial protocol design and analyses that will form the primary basis of an efficacy claim.
 

 According to FDA guidance for industry on the SPA process, a sponsor which meets the prerequisites may make a specific request for a SPA and provide information regarding the design and size of the proposed clinical trial. The FDA’s goal is to evaluate the protocol within 45 days of the request to assess whether the proposed trial is adequate, and that evaluation may result in discussions and a request for additional information. A SPA request must be made before the proposed trial begins, and all open issues must be resolved before the trial begins. If a written agreement is reached, it will be documented and made part of the IND record. The agreement will be binding on the FDA and may not be changed by the sponsor or the FDA after the trial begins except with the written agreement of the sponsor and the FDA or if the FDA determines that a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or efficacy of the drug was identified after the testing began.
 

 Clinical studies involve the administration of the pharmaceutical product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the clinical study sponsor’s control. Clinical studies are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical study, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, how the results will be analyzed and presented and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical studies must be conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (“GCP”) guidelines. Further, each clinical study must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board (“IRB”), at, or servicing, each institution at which the clinical study will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of study participants and is tasked with considering such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical studies are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical study subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical study until completed.
 

 Human clinical studies are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
 

  ●
 Phase 1. The pharmaceutical product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion.


  ●
 Phase 2. The pharmaceutical product is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases, to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule and to identify patient populations with specific characteristics where the pharmaceutical product may be more effective.


  ●
 Phase 3. Clinical studies are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These clinical studies are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. The studies must be well-controlled and usually include a control arm for comparison. One or two Phase 3 studies are required by the FDA for an NDA or BLA approval, depending on the disease severity and other available treatment options.


  ●
 Post-approval studies, or Phase 4 clinical studies, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication.


  ●
 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical studies must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events or any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk for human subjects. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical studies may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical study at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical study at its institution if the clinical study is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the pharmaceutical product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.


 Concurrent with clinical studies, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the pharmaceutical product as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the pharmaceutical product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final pharmaceutical product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the pharmaceutical product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.

 U.S. Review and Approval Processes
 
 The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical studies, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the pharmaceutical product, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an NDA or BLA is subject to the payment of substantial user fees; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances.
 

 In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (“PREA”), an NDA, BLA or a supplement thereof must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the pharmaceutical product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any pharmaceutical product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.
 

 The FDA reviews all NDAs and BLAs submitted before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting an NDA or BLA for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA or BLA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”), the FDA has 10 months in which to complete its initial review of a standard NDA or BLA and respond to the applicant, and six months for a priority NDA or BLA. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority NDAs or BLAs. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or if the NDA or BLA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA goal date.
 

 After the NDA or BLA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the NDA or BLA application to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel pharmaceutical products or pharmaceutical products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the pharmaceutical product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (“REMS”), is necessary to assure the safe use of the pharmaceutical product. If the FDA concludes that a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA or BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the NDA or BLA without a REMS, if required.
 

 Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites as well as the site where the pharmaceutical product is manufactured to assure compliance with GCP and cGMP. If the FDA determines the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. In addition, the FDA will require the review and approval of product labeling.
 

 The NDA and BLA review and approval process is lengthy and difficult and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA or BLA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical data or other data and information. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical studies are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than the sponsor interprets the same data. The FDA will issue a complete response letter if the agency decides not to approve the NDA or BLA. The complete response letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA or BLA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical studies. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA or BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application.
 

 If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, the FDA may require Phase 4 testing which involves clinical studies designed to further assess pharmaceutical product safety and effectiveness and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.

 Expedited Development and Review Programs
 
 The FDA has a Fast Track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new pharmaceutical products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new pharmaceutical products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. The Fast Track designation must be requested by the sponsor. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. With a Fast Track designated product, the FDA may consider for review sections of the NDA or BLA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA or BLA, if the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA or BLA and determines that the schedule is acceptable and if the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA or BLA.
 

 Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing approval, including a Fast Track program, may also be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. Any product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new pharmaceutical product designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. Additionally, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Pharmaceutical products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval, which means that the products may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical studies establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a pharmaceutical product receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. Fast Track designation, priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.
 

 Breakthrough Therapy Designation
 
 The FDA is also required to expedite the development and review of the application for approval of drugs that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. Under the breakthrough therapy program, the sponsor of a new product candidate may request that the FDA designate the product candidate for a specific indication as a breakthrough therapy concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the product candidate. The FDA must determine if the product candidate qualifies for breakthrough therapy designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request. Validive and MNPR-101 may both be eligible for breakthrough therapy designation.
European Union Drug Review and Approval
 
 In the European Economic Area (“EEA”) (which is comprised of the 28 Member States of the European Union plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein), medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization (“MA”). There are two types of MA:
 

 The Community MA, which is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the CHMP, or Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, of the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”), is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes and auto-immune and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU.
 

 National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in other Member States through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure. Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.
  
 
  
17


 


  PRIME Designation
 
 The EMA launched its PRIME regulatory initiative to enhance support for the development of therapies that target an unmet medical need. The initiative focuses on drugs that may offer a major therapeutic advantage over existing treatments, or benefit patients with no treatment options. These therapies are considered priority medicines within the EU. Through PRIME, the EMA offers early, proactive and enhanced support to drug developers to optimize the generation of robust data on a therapy’s benefits and risks and enable accelerated assessment of drug applications. MNPR-101 may be eligible for PRIME designation.
   

 Post-Approval Requirements
 
 Any pharmaceutical products for which a sponsor receives FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements and complying with FDA and FTC promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, prohibitions on promoting pharmaceutical products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the pharmaceutical product’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Failure to comply with FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, enforcement letters from the FDA, actions by the U.S. Department of Justice and/or U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties. Although physicians may prescribe legally available pharmaceutical products for off-label uses, manufacturers may not directly or indirectly market or promote such off-label uses.
 

 Manufacturers of FDA approved products are required to comply with applicable FDA manufacturing requirements contained in the FDA’s cGMP regulations. cGMP regulations require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance, as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Pharmaceutical product manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved pharmaceutical products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA or BLA, including withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, risk minimization action plans and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product.
 

 U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
 
 The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), prohibits certain individuals and entities from promising, paying, offering to pay, or authorizing the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, directly or indirectly, to obtain or retain business or an improper advantage. The U.S. Department of Justice and the SEC have increased their enforcement efforts with respect to the FCPA. Violations of the FCPA may result in large civil and criminal penalties and could result in an adverse effect on a company’s reputation, operations, and financial condition. A company may also face collateral consequences such as debarment and the loss of export privileges.
Federal and State Pharmaceutical Legislation
 
 In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal laws have been applied to restrict certain business practices in the biopharmaceutical industry.
 
   
18


  
 

 Anti-Kickback Statute of 1972
 
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for the purchase, lease, or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federally financed healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including for example, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payment, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and a company’s practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for statutory exemptions or safe harbor protection. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated. The reach of the Anti-Kickback Statute was also broadened by the PPACA, which, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Pursuant to the statutory amendment, a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the PPACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act (discussed below) or the civil monetary penalties statute, which imposes penalties against any person who is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
   

 False Claims Act of 1986
 
 The federal False Claims Act prohibits any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government. Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of the product for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses. Many states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and False Claims Act, which state laws apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payer.
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”)
 
 The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payers and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute’s safe harbors, it is possible that some of a company’s business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. Such a challenge could have a material adverse effect on a company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. See “Risk Factors - Risks Related to Commercialization of Our Product Candidates”.
Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (“HITECH”)
 
 HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), and its implementing regulations, imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates”—independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, complicating compliance efforts. See “Risk Factors - Risks Related to Commercialization of Our Product Candidates”.

 The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (“MMA”)
 
 In the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system, in particular, there have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the U.S. federal and state levels that seek to reduce healthcare costs. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (“MMA”), imposed new requirements for the distribution and pricing of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities, which will provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Part D plans include both stand-alone prescription drug benefit plans and prescription drug coverage as a supplement to Medicare Advantage plans. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payers often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from Medicare Part D may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payers.
The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
 
 The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides funding for the federal government to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same illness. A plan for the research will be developed by the Department of Health and Human Services, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Institutes for Health, and periodic reports on the status of the research and related expenditures will be made to Congress. Although the results of the comparative effectiveness studies are not intended to mandate coverage policies for public or private payers, it is not clear what effect, if any, the research will have on the sales of any product, if any such product or the condition that it is intended to treat is the subject of a study.
Physician Payments Sunshine Act of 2010
 
 The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals, and applicable manufacturers and applicable group purchasing organizations to report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by the physicians and their immediate family members.
Patent Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (“PPACA”)
 
 In March 2010, the PPACA was enacted, which includes measures to significantly change the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among the provisions of the PPACA of importance to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry are the following:
 

  ●
 extension of manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;


  ●
 expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the Federal Poverty Level beginning in 2014, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability;


  ●
 expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program;


  ●
 new requirements under the federal Open Payments program, created under Section 6002 of the PPACA and its implementing regulations, that manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) report annually to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), information related to “payments or other transfers of value” made or distributed to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, and that applicable manufacturers and applicable group purchasing organizations report annually to HHS ownership and investment interests held by physicians (as defined above) and their immediate family members, with data collection required beginning August 1, 2013 and reporting to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), required by March 31, 2014 and by the 90th day of each subsequent calendar year;


  ●
 a requirement to annually report drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians, effective April 1, 2012;


  ●
 expansion of health care fraud and abuse laws, including the False Claims Act and the Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers, and enhanced penalties for noncompliance;


  ●
 a licensure framework for follow-on biologic products;


  ●
 a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research;


  ●
 creation of the Independent Payment Advisory Board which, beginning in 2014, will have authority to recommend certain changes to the Medicare program that could result in reduced payments for prescription drugs and those recommendations could have the effect of law even if Congress does not act on the recommendations; and


  ●
 establishment of a Center for Medicare Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending that began on January 1, 2011.

 Budget Control Act of 2011
 
 In August 2011, the President signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, or joint committee, to recommend proposals in spending reductions to Congress. The joint committee did not achieve its targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion and for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering automatic reductions to several government programs. These reductions include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, starting in 2013.
American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012
 
 In January 2013, the President signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding.
 

 Proposals in Congress to repeal or replace parts of the PPACA
 
 There have been a number of proposals in the U.S. Congress to repeal or replace parts of the PPACA. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act became law. One of its provisions repealed what is known as the individual mandate under PPACA, which could have the effect of negating such law. Other proposals include the repeal of the tax on prescription medications, repeal of the medical device excise tax for sales, and repeal of the elimination of a deduction for expenses allocable to Medicare Part D subsidy. It is uncertain whether any repeal or replace legislation will be passed and signed into law or what effect any such legislation may have on our commercialization strategy. See “Risk Factors - Future Legislation or Executive or Private Sector Action May Increase the Difficulty and Cost for us to Commercialize our Products and Affect the Prices Obtained for Such Products”.
 

 Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
 
 Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of the use of our pharmaceutical product candidates, some of our products to be licensed under U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permits a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA or BLA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA or BLA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved pharmaceutical product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”), in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration.
 
  Market exclusivity provisions under the U.S. Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act can also delay the submission or the approval of certain applications of other companies seeking to reference another company’s NDA or BLA.
 

 The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (“BPCI Act”)
 
 The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, (“BPCI Act”), authorizes the FDA to license a biological product that is biosimilar to an FDA-licensed biologic through an abbreviated pathway. The BPCI Act establishes criteria for determining that a product is biosimilar to an already-licensed biologic, or reference product, and establishes a process by which an abbreviated BLA for a biosimilar product is submitted, reviewed and approved. The BPCI Act provides periods of exclusivity that protect a reference product from biosimilars competition. Under the BPCI Act, the FDA may not accept a biosimilar application for review until four years after the date of first licensure of the reference product, and the biosimilar may not be licensed until at least 12 years after the reference product’s approval. Additionally, the BPCI Act establishes procedures by which the biosimilar applicant provides information about its application and product to the reference product sponsor, and by which information about potentially relevant patents may be shared and litigation over patents may proceed in advance of approval. The BPCI Act also provides a period of exclusivity for the first biosimilar determined by the FDA to be interchangeable with the reference product.
 
  We anticipate that the contours of the BPCI Act will continue to be defined as the statute is implemented over a period of years. This likely will be accomplished by a variety of means, including decisions related to the statute by the relevant federal courts, FDA issuance of guidance documents, and FDA decisions in the course of considering specific applications. The FDA has to date issued various guidance documents and other materials indicating the agency’s thinking regarding a number of issues implicated by the BPCI Act. Additionally, the FDA’s approval of several biosimilar applications in recent years has helped define the agency’s approach to certain issues.

 Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
 
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any pharmaceutical product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the U.S. and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part upon the availability of reimbursement from third-party payers. Third-party payers include government payers such as Medicare and Medicaid, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payer will provide coverage for a pharmaceutical product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payer will pay for the pharmaceutical product. Third-party payers may limit coverage to specific pharmaceutical products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved pharmaceutical products for a particular indication. Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmaco-economic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of its products, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. A payer’s decision to provide coverage for a pharmaceutical product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved.
 

 In 2003, the federal government enacted legislation providing a partial prescription drug benefit for Medicare recipients, which became effective at the beginning of 2006. However, to obtain payments under this program, a company would be required to sell products to Medicare recipients through prescription drug plans operating pursuant to this legislation. As part of their participation in the Medicare prescription drug program, these plans negotiate discounted prices for prescription drugs. Federal, state and local governments in the U.S. continue to consider legislation to limit the growth of health care costs, including the cost of prescription drugs. Future legislation and regulations could limit payments for pharmaceuticals such as the product candidates that we are developing.
 

 Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the European Community, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed upon. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular pharmaceutical product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
 

 International Regulation
 
 In addition to regulations in the U.S., there are a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical studies and commercial sales and distribution of our future product candidates. Whether or not FDA approval is obtained for a product, approval of a product must be obtained by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before clinical studies or marketing of the product can commence in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical studies, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country. In addition, certain regulatory authorities in select countries may require us to repeat previously conducted preclinical and/or clinical studies under specific criteria for approval in their respective country which may delay and/or greatly increase the cost of approval in certain markets targeted for approval by us.
 

 Under E.U. regulatory systems, marketing applications for pharmaceutical products must be submitted under a centralized procedure to the EMA. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all E.U. member states. The EMA also has designations for Orphan Drugs, which, if applicable, can provide for faster review, lower fees and more access to advice during drug development. While the marketing authorization in the European Union is centralized, the system for clinical studies (application, review and requirements) is handled by each individual country. Approval to run a clinical study in one country does not guarantee approval in any other country. The pharmaceutical industry in Canada is regulated by Health Canada. A New Drug Submission (“NDS”) is the equivalent of a U.S. NDA and must be filed to obtain approval to market a pharmaceutical product in Canada. Marketing regulations and reimbursement are subject to national and provincial laws. In Japan, applications for approval to manufacture and market new drugs must be approved by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare. Nonclinical and clinical studies must meet the requirements of Japanese laws. Results from clinical studies conducted outside of Japan must be supplemented with at least a bridging clinical study conducted in Japanese patients.
 

 In addition to regulations in Europe, Canada, Japan and the U.S., there are a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical studies, commercial distribution and reimbursement of future product candidates which we may be subject to as we pursue regulatory approval and commercialization of Validive, MNPR-201, MNPR-101, or any future product candidates internationally.
 

 Employees
 
 Our operations are currently managed (including our executive chairman and Acting Chief Medical Officer) by five individuals, of whom three have a PhD, two have an MD, one has an MBA, one has an MSc in health economics and policy, and one was a former CPA. They have worked at industry leading companies such as BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc., Raptor Pharmaceuticals, Abbott Laboratories, and Onyx Pharmaceuticals. As of February 26, 2019, we had five employees; four of them were full-time. We anticipate hiring additional employees in clinical operations and regulatory to help manage our clinical studies, regulatory submissions, and manufacturing to support Validive program development. In addition, to complement our internal expertise, we have contracts with medical and scientific consultants, manufacturers, laboratories, and contract research organizations that specialize in various aspects of drug development including clinical development, preclinical development, manufacturing and regulatory affairs. For information regarding our executive officers, see the section entitled “Executive Officers and Board Members.”
 Compliance with Environmental Laws
 
 Since we do not have our own laboratory facilities, we do not estimate any annual costs of compliance with environmental laws.
