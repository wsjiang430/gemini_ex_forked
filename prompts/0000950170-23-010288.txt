Overview
 We are a late clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing and commercializing transformative treatments for patients with serious immunological diseases. Our lead product candidate, atacicept, is a self-administered fusion protein that blocks both B lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS) and a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) with best-in-class potential for the treatment of IgA nephropathy (IgAN). The Phase 2b ORIGIN clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of atacicept in patients with IgAN completed enrollment in mid-2022 and reported positive 24-week topline results in January 2023. Atacicept met its primary endpoint at 24 weeks, achieved statistical significance in the 150 mg dose group, and showed a trend towards deeper reductions in proteinuria with available data at 36 weeks, for which full results will read out in the second quarter of 2023. Additionally, atacicept’s safety profile was comparable to placebo. The trial will remain blinded through 36 weeks, after which all patients will roll onto the open label portion of the study and receive atacicept 150 mg through 96 weeks. We plan to advance atacicept 150 mg in a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial in IgAN in the second quarter of 2023. We also are planning a Phase 3 clinical trial of atacicept in lupus nephritis (LN), a severe renal manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), based on feedback from the FDA’s review of clinical results in a Phase 2 clinical trial of atacicept in SLE patients with high disease activity (HDA). In December 2021, we obtained worldwide, exclusive development and commercial rights to MAU868, a potentially first-in-class monoclonal antibody to treat reactivated BK virus (BKV) infections. MAU868 is a clinical-stage neutralizing monoclonal antibody that is directed against BKV, a polyoma virus that can have devastating consequences in certain settings such as kidney transplant and hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). In final results from the Phase 2 clinical trial of MAU868 versus placebo in BK viremia among kidney transplant recipients, MAU868 was shown to be well tolerated and demonstrated a clinically meaningful BKV antiviral activity through 36 weeks. We believe that our current pipeline programs leverage the deep expertise of our team and have strong commercial synergies. We hold global developmental and commercial rights to all of our pipeline molecules.
 In January 2023, we announced our plan to prioritize and focus our current resources on the advancement of atacicept in IgAN into a pivotal Phase 3 trial. As a result, we are delaying enrollment in the pivotal Phase 3 trial for LN and commitment of resources to the MAU868 program.
 
Atacicept in IgAN
 IgAN is a serious and progressive autoimmune disease of the kidney that is driven by the production of immunogenic galactose-deficient IgA1 (Gd-IgA1), which is associated with increased risk of kidney-related morbidity and mortality. We estimate there are approximately 126,000 biopsy-confirmed IgAN patients in the United States, 136,000 in the European Union, and 130,000 in Japan. Up to 50% of patients diagnosed with IgAN develop end-stage renal disease (ESRD) within 20 years from initial diagnosis, requiring dialysis or kidney transplant. ESRD causes considerable morbidity and impact on patients’ lives and represents a significant health economic burden, which was estimated to be $49.2 billion in the United States in 2018. Despite this high level of morbidity, only two treatments have been approved for this indication: TARPEYO (developed by Calliditas Therapeutics AB under the name Nefecon), a recently approved reformulated steroid, and FILSPARI (developed by Travere Therapeutics under the name sparsentan), a recently approved dual endothelin angiotensin receptor antagonist. The current standard of care continues to consist of off-label use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors, including angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), and potentially steroids. We estimate the U.S. market opportunity for novel therapeutics in IgAN is approximately $4.0 billion to $8.0 billion annually, based on the disease prevalence and the segment of IgAN patients at high risk of progressing to ESRD. In Europe and Japan, we estimate the annual market opportunity for novel IgAN therapeutics to be $1.0 billion and $600 million, respectively.
 Atacicept is a fusion protein self-administered as a subcutaneous injection once weekly that blocks both BLyS and APRIL, which stimulate B cells and plasma cells to produce autoantibodies contributing to certain autoimmune diseases. We believe that atacicept’s mechanism has the potential to drive clinical success by measures designed to assess efficacy in IgAN and other immunologic diseases. BLyS inhibition has been clinically and commercially validated through the approval of Benlysta (belimumab) in both SLE and LN. Preclinical and clinical evidence support that atacicept’s mechanism of dual inhibition of BLyS and APRIL may provide improved clinical outcomes, measured by endpoints designed to assess efficacy, compared to inhibiting either signal alone. Atacicept has the potential to be the first disease-modifying therapy for IgAN due to its ability to act on core pathophysiology processes. As reported in a Phase 2a clinical trial of 16 patients conducted by Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, atacicept is the first and only molecule in development to demonstrate a 60% reduction in serum Gd-IgA1, which is central to the pathogenesis of IgAN, in a randomized controlled study in IgAN patients.
 We have worldwide, exclusive rights to atacicept from Ares, an affiliate of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, pursuant to the Ares Agreement, which advanced atacicept in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials for several autoimmune diseases in over 1,500 patients, in which it was well tolerated. In IgAN, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2a trial known as JANUS. Results from the JANUS trial showed a dose-dependent effect of

atacicept 25 mg and 75 mg weekly on serum Gd-IgA1, proteinuria, and key biomarkers, including serum Ig levels. As reported at the American Society of Nephrology (ASN) conference in 2022, atacicept is also the first known therapeutic in IgAN to show reduction in all first three hits of disease pathogenesis—serum Gd-IgA1, anti-Gd-IgA1, and immune complex levels.
 We are conducting a multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2b clinical trial in IgAN, which we refer to as ORIGIN. The ORIGIN trial is evaluating three subcutaneous weekly doses of atacicept (25 mg, 75 mg and 150 mg) and their impact on the reduction of proteinuria as the primary endpoint. A significant reduction in proteinuria, as measured by urine protein: creatinine ratio (UPCR) in a 24-hour urine collection, is associated with improved renal outcomes in patients with IgAN. UPCR is a surrogate endpoint endorsed by the FDA for primary glomerular diseases associated with significant proteinuria, including IgAN. The ORIGIN trial is powered to demonstrate a statistically significant difference between atacicept and placebo in decrease of proteinuria. Given the FDA’s recent approval of TARPEYO, we believe this validates the use of proteinuria as a surrogate for accelerated approval. Secondary endpoints include the difference in kidney function between treated and placebo patients as measured by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and reduction in Gd-IgA1. We completed enrollment of the Phase 2b ORIGIN trial in mid-2022, enrolling a total of 116 patients at multiple global sites. In January 2023, we announced that atacicept met the primary endpoint: the pooled 75 mg and 150 mg arms achieved a statistically significant reduction in proteinuria versus placebo at 24 weeks. In a prespecified per-protocol (PP) analysis, a blinded third-party CRO identified patients with protocol deviations that potentially confounded proteinuria measure. In the PP population excluding these patients, atacicept 150 mg achieved a 41% mean reduction in proteinuria versus baseline, resulting in a statistically significant 34% placebo-adjusted reduction. Available data show a trend towards deeper reductions in proteinuria at 36 weeks for patients on atacicept, for which full results will read out in the second quarter of 2023. Atacicept was well tolerated, and its safety profile in IgAN patients was also comparable to placebo. The ORIGIN trial will remain blinded through 36 weeks, after which all patients will roll onto the open label portion of the trial and receive atacicept 150 mg through 96 weeks, allowing for the evaluation of long-term safety and durability of response of atacicept in IgAN.
 We plan to advance atacicept into a pivotal Phase 3 trial in the second quarter of 2023, using the same formulation of the 150 mg dose. Phase 2b learnings will inform the Phase 3 study design and management to ensure a de-risked trial that accurately assesses treatment efficacy. With the ongoing data from the Phase 2b trial through 2024 and Phase 3 topline results expected in the first half of 2025, if positive, we expect to submit a biologics license application (BLA) for atacicept in IgAN to the FDA in the second half of 2025.

Atacicept in LN
 Based on feedback from the FDA’s review of clinical results in a Phase 2 clinical trial of atacicept in HDA SLE patients, we are planning a Phase 3 clinical trial of atacicept as a potential treatment for patients with LN, a severe renal manifestation of SLE. We estimate that there are approximately 120,000 LN patients in the United States, 70,000 in the European Union, and 21,000 in Japan. We estimate the market for novel LN therapeutics annually to be approximately $2.0 to $5.0 billion, $600 million and $200 million in United States, Europe and Japan, respectively. Significant unmet need for improved efficacy persists for these patients despite the recent approval of the first two LN-specific therapies. Fewer than half of patients treated for LN have a complete response to therapy, and among patients without a complete response, over half will have non-functioning kidneys within five years. Benlysta (belimumab), a BlyS-only inhibitor, is one of the two therapies approved for patients with LN. Both BLyS and APRIL levels are increased in patients with SLE, suggesting that dual inhibition by atacicept may be more potent than blocking BLyS alone and has the benefit of targeting plasma cells in addition to B cells. Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany previously initiated a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2/3 clinical trial of atacicept in LN, the APRIL-LN trial, evaluating the efficacy and safety of atacicept 150 mg twice weekly for four weeks—then weekly—in patients with active LN. However, this trial was terminated early due to three patients developing hypogammaglobulinemia with induction therapy (mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and corticosteroids (CS)) which continued to worsen when initiating atacicept and subsequently two patients developed pneumonia. In prior Phase 2 clinical trials of atacicept in SLE also conducted by Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, despite missing its primary endpoint in the broader SLE study population, atacicept achieved positive clinical data on multiple measures within the pre-specified patient segment with HDA (defined as Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000 [SLEDAI-2K] ≥10 at screening), including reduction of renal flares, which we believe supports atacicept’s applicability in LN. Because both preclinical and clinical evidence suggest atacicept’s dual inhibition of BLyS and APRIL may provide improved clinical outcomes, measured by endpoints designed to assess efficacy, compared to inhibiting either signal alone, we believe there is a strong rationale to conduct a clinical trial of atacicept in LN.
Our Phase 3, randomized, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, multinational study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of atacicept vs placebo in patients with LN. The clinical trial consists of a 104-week double blind treatment period, followed by a 52-week open label treatment period and a 26-week safety follow-up period. The trial will assess once weekly subcutaneous injections of 150 mg atacicept versus placebo. The primary endpoint is complete renal response at 52 weeks.
 
MAU868 in BK viremia among kidney transplant recipients
 We are developing MAU868 as a potential treatment for reactivated BK infection in kidney transplant recipients. While up to 90% of healthy adults have been infected with BKV at some point in their lives, it remains latent in everyone except severely immunocompromised populations such as kidney transplant recipients. BKV is a polyoma virus that can cause BKV nephropathy (BKVN), a condition in which BK infection, typically first identified as BK viremia, triggers inflammation, which then progresses to

fibrosis and tubular injury; BKVN is a leading cause of allograft loss. Currently, there are no approved treatment options for BK viremia or BKVN. We estimate that approximately 80,000 kidney transplants are conducted globally each year, with approximately 20,000 in the United States, 20,000 in Europe, 1,500 in Japan, and 10,000 in China. Approximately 15% of kidney transplant recipients develop BK viremia; 3–4% of kidney transplant recipients develop BKVN. We estimate the market for a novel agent to treat reactivated BK infection in kidney transplant recipients to be a large commercial opportunity worldwide. We believe that MAU868 has the potential to become standard of care for the treatment of reactivated BK infection in order to prevent devastating consequences following kidney transplantation such as BKVN and graft loss.
 At ASN 2022, final results from the Phase 2 clinical trial of MAU868 versus placebo showed that MAU868 was well tolerated and demonstrated clinically meaningful reductions in BK antiviral activity through 36 weeks in kidney transplant patients with BK viremia.

MAU868 in BK cystitis among HSCT patients
 We are exploring the development of MAU868 to treat BKV cystitis in HSCT patients. Patients undergoing HSCT are at risk for BKV reactivation due to immunodeficiency; in this setting, BK reactivation and subsequent viruria and viremia can lead to cystitis, including hemorrhagic cystitis. Cystitis is characterized by dysuria, urgency, and/or frequency, while hemorrhagic cystitis indicates the presence of microscopic or gross hematuria. Both BKV cystitis and hemorrhagic cystitis are associated with high patient morbidity and prolonged hospitalization, yet there are no approved treatment options. An estimated 50,000 allogeneic HSCTs are conducted globally each year, with approximately 10,000 in the United States, 16,000 in Europe, 3,500 in Japan, and 2,500 in China. An estimated 57,000 autologous HSCTs are conducted globally each year, with approximately 17,000 in the United States, 27,000 in Europe, 2,500 in Japan, and 1,800 in China. Approximately 15% of allogeneic recipients and 5% of autologous recipients develop BK cystitis, including hemorrhagic cystitis. We believe that MAU868 may represent an important future treatment option for these patients.
 
Our business principles and strategy
 Our goal is to develop and commercialize transformative treatments for patients suffering from severe immunological diseases. We believe the successful translation of biomedical science into innovative therapeutic products for patients with immunological diseases will enable outsized growth over the next decade and beyond. Specifically, our strategy is based on the following business principles:
 •Develop disease-modifying medicines to improve patients’ lives. Our team seeks to bring transformative medical products to patients with severe immunological diseases, who often receive steroids for treatment. The non-specific immunologic effect of steroids, with known acute and chronic side effects, presents an important opportunity for innovation. We aim to develop and commercialize disease-modifying drugs that target the source of disease, minimize side effects, and have high potential to meaningfully change standard medical care and improve patients’ lives.
 •Establish clear line-of-sight to successful products. We apply our deep drug development experience, scientific rigor, and disciplined decision making to establish clear line-of-sight along the full spectrum of drug development. We pursue biologic targets, product candidates, and disease indications with a de-risked profile and capital-efficient development pathway, and optimize for high probability of clinical, regulatory, and commercial success.
 •Build a leading biotech company that delivers innovative medicines to patients. We believe our team’s expertise and our business culture are fundamental to our success. Our Research and Development team is led by experienced drug development executives with proven track records in clinical and commercial development who have led or been involved in the approvals of more than 12 medicines from leading companies, including Gilead Sciences and Genentech. We leverage our team’s know-how with additional outsourced resources and enable focused clinical development of our product candidates with the goal of improving patients’ lives.
 These principles have guided us to the successful in-licensing of atacicept from Ares and obtaining the rights to MAU868 from Amplyx, in each case with worldwide rights for development and commercialization in all indications. We take a gated-capital raise approach and scale product candidate investment and exposure in close step with key development milestones to ensure high return on development costs.
The near- and long-term objectives to achieve our goal include:
 •Complete global development of atacicept in IgAN. We reported positive 24-week topline results from the ORIGIN Phase 2b clinical trial in January 2023, will report results from 36-week data in the second quarter of 2023, and plan to initiate a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial in the second quarter of 2023.
 •Complete global development of atacicept in LN. We are planning a Phase 3 clinical trial of atacicept as a potential treatment for patients with LN. LN is a frequent but devastating complication of SLE. The FDA approval of the anti-BLyS antibody, Benlysta (belimumab), provides clinical and regulatory precedent upon which to build our program. We believe 


that atacicept could offer a significant efficacy advantage for LN patients with its dual anti-BLyS and anti-APRIL mechanism.
 •Complete global development of MAU868 in BK viremia in kidney transplant recipients and explore treatment of BK cystitis in HSCT patients. We reported final results from our Phase 2 clinical trial in kidney transplant recipients in 2022. Pending alignment with regulatory authorities, we plan to initiate a Phase 2b or Phase 3 clinical trial.
 •Build and scale organizational capabilities to support commercialization of atacicept and MAU868. Under the leadership of our experienced management team, we have begun building a specialized commercial organization with deep launch experience in nephrology, B-cell, autoimmune, and transplant therapeutics, to launch atacicept and MAU868 in the United States and other key markets, if approved. 
 •Explore additional disease areas where atacicept holds significant therapeutic promise. By targeting BLyS and APRIL, atacicept’s ability to reduce disease-causing autoantibodies may provide clinical benefit. We intend to explore additional immunologic diseases where BLyS and APRIL are abnormally elevated, or where autoantibodies play an important role.
 •Expand our pipeline by acquiring or in-licensing product candidates for immunologic diseases with unmet needs. We believe our expertise and track record will enable us to identify and acquire or in-license additional product candidates that represent opportunities to expand the potential value of our pipeline. We will leverage our lean clinical development operation to bring to market additional product candidates to address immunologic diseases.
 
Management team
 We were founded and are led by a team of experienced drug development professionals who have proven track records in clinical and commercial development and have led or been involved in the approvals of 10 medicines from Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Gilead) and Genentech, Inc. (Genentech), including numerous drugs within Gilead’s multi-billion-dollar blockbuster HIV and HCV franchises. Our President and Chief Executive Officer, Marshall Fordyce, M.D., brings more than 15 years of experience leading teams in clinical translation, development, and commercialization of new treatments. Earlier in his career, Dr. Fordyce served as Gilead’s Senior Director of Clinical Research where he contributed to seven new drug approvals and served as project lead for Gilead’s tenofovir alafenamide development program that led to five commercial products, including Genvoya and Descovy, which collectively generated over $12.0 billion in worldwide sales in 2019. Our senior management team also includes: Chief Financial Officer, Sean Grant, who was previously Vice President, Corporate Strategy and Business Development at CareDx, Inc. and Vice President in the Global Healthcare Investment Banking Division at Citigroup where he specialized in public and private capital raising as well as M&A, and executed a broad range of transactions for many of the world’s leading life sciences companies; Chief Medical Officer, Celia Lin, M.D., who joined from Genentech and was previously at Amgen Inc., where she led Phase 3 global trial execution in various therapeutic areas, as well as a regulatory filing in an orphan disease; Chief Development Officer, Joanne Curley, Ph.D., who was formerly head of Portfolio Management at Gilead; Chief Business Officer, Lauren Frenz, who held positions of increasing responsibility within Gilead’s commercial organization; Senior Vice President, Development Operations, Tom Doan, who was formerly Executive Director of Clinical Operations and Therapeutic Area Head of Inflammation and Respiratory at Gilead; Senior Vice President and Head of Product Development and Manufacturing, Neeraj Pakala, PhD, MBA, who served most recently as the VP of Product Development and Manufacturing at Aimmune Therapeutics (acquired by Nestlé), and prior to Aimmune, spent six years at Alexza Pharmaceuticals culminating as their Executive Director of Manufacturing and Engineering; and Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Accounting Officer, Joseph Young, who was formerly Senior Vice President, Finance and Treasurer at Plexxikon Inc.
 
Intellectual property
 As of December 31, 2022, our licensed patent portfolio related to atacicept contains approximately seven issued U.S. patents, one pending U.S. patent application, as well as foreign counterparts of a subset of these patents and pending U.S. patent application in several foreign countries, including countries within the European Patent Convention, the Eurasian Patent Organization, and Taiwan. Because atacicept is a biologic, marketing approval would also provide 12 years of market exclusivity from the approval date of a BLA in the United States. Additionally, we plan to seek orphan drug designation for atacicept in IgAN from the FDA and European Medicines Agency (EMA), which would allow us to obtain regulatory exclusivity protection from the approval date for seven years in the United States and ten years in the European Union. Our licensed patent portfolio covering MAU868 includes three issued U.S. patents, a pending U.S. patent application, as well as certain foreign counterparts of a subset of these patents and pending U.S. patent application, in Australia, China, Mexico, Japan, Europe and Canada. The pending U.S. application and foreign counterpart applications are co-owned by Novartis.
 
Atacicept in IgAN
We are developing atacicept as a potential treatment for patients with IgAN, a serious and progressive autoimmune disease of the kidney with a high unmet medical need and limited treatment options available. Up to 50% of confirmed IgAN patients progress to ESRD, requiring dialysis or kidney transplant. ESRD causes significant morbidity and impact on patients’ lives and represents a

significant health economic burden estimated to be over $40 billion annually in the United States. Despite this high level of morbidity, the current standard of care consists of off-label use of RAAS inhibitors, including ACE inhibitors and ARBs, and potentially steroids. IgAN is driven by the production of pathogenic Gd-IgA1, and patients with elevated Gd-IgA1 are at increased risk of kidney-related morbidity and mortality. As reported in the Phase 2a JANUS trial, atacicept is the first molecule in development to demonstrate a 60% or greater reduction in serum Gd-IgA1 in IgAN patients, suggesting atacicept targets the source of disease in these patients. Based on these encouraging results, we are conducting the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2b ORIGIN trial to further evaluate the efficacy and safety of atacicept in patients with IgAN. We reported positive topline results in January 2023, and we plan to initiate a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial in the second quarter of 2023. We believe that atacicept has the potential to be the best-in-class and the leading B cell-targeted therapy for IgAN.

Pathophysiology of IgAN
 The IgA antibody plays a key role in the immune system by protecting the body from foreign substances such as bacteria and viruses. Patients with IgAN produce elevated levels of Gd-IgA1. This abnormal glycosylation pattern of IgA1 is of central importance to the disease etiology.
 
As shown in Figure 1 below, a multi-step process leads to the ultimate development of progressive renal injury.
 
Figure 1: IgAN pathophysiology—overview
 


(1)B cells, which mature into plasma cells, are abnormally primed in the Peyer’s patch region of the ileum of the intestines, potentially due to a combination of genetic predisposition and environmental, bacterial or dietary factors. BLyS promotes B cell maturation and survival, increasing the number of disease-causing B cells.
 (2)APRIL, a factor important for plasma cell survival, becomes upregulated, resulting in increased numbers of disease-causing plasma cells.
 (3)APRIL increases the number of plasma cells and increases antibody class switching, a mechanism that changes cells’ production from one immunoglobulin to another, causing an increase in the production of immunogenic Gd-IgA1. 
 (4)The Gd-IgA1 antibodies are immunogenic when found in the systemic circulation, which triggers autoantibodies, or antibodies created by the body in response to a constituent of its own tissue. 
 (5)Autoantibodies against Gd-IgA1 lead to the formation of pathogenic immune complexes, or clusters of antibodies. 
 (6)Pathogenic immune complexes are deposited, become trapped in the kidney’s glomeruli, and initiate an inflammatory response that damages the membranes, resulting in protein and blood leaking into the urine. 


(7)As the glomeruli are destroyed, the kidney’s ability to remove waste products from the blood is reduced, which can result in potentially life-threatening complications that lead to the need for dialysis or kidney transplant in many patients. 
 

 Gd-IgA1 is central to the pathogenesis of IgAN
 Gd-IgA1 is a subclass of IgA antibodies that lack units of galactose, a type of sugar, at the O-linked glycans of their hinge region, as shown in Figure 2 below. The hinge region is a stretch of amino acids in the IgA antibody. Circulating immune complex-containing Gd-IgA1 proteins have been shown to be the target antigens for IgG antibodies with specificity for the hinge region.
 
Figure 2: Components of Gd-IgA1
 


A histopathological hallmark of IgAN is deposition of Gd-IgA1 in the glomerular mesangium, either alone or in combination with IgG and/or IgM. Sampling of the serum of patients with IgAN has confirmed the presence of elevated levels of circulating immune complex-containing Gd-IgA1.
 Clinical trials of patients with IgAN have correlated higher serum levels of Gd-IgA1 with greater severity of IgAN disease, suggesting that reduction in serum Gd-IgA1 may slow disease progression. Compared with healthy subjects, patients with IgAN have an increased proportion of Gd-IgA1 O-glycoforms in the serum. As published in Kidney International, in a prospective study of 275 patients with IgAN, higher serum levels of aberrantly glycosylated IgA1 demonstrated correlation with a higher likelihood of developing progressive renal failure, as shown in Figure 3 below. A separate clinical trial of patients with IgAN of varying severity found that higher titers of autoantibodies specific for Gd-IgA1 corresponded to both absolute renal risk score and risk of ESRD or death.
 

Figure 3: Renal survival by serum Gd-IgA1 quartiles in IgAN patients
 



In addition, high serum APRIL levels correlate with increased expression of serum Gd-IgA1 in IgAN patients and high serum BLyS levels are associated with more severe clinical features, as well as more severe histopathological features. For these reasons, we believe a fusion protein that blocks both BLyS and APRIL, which has the potential to reduce serum Gd-IgA1, would address the upstream source of IgAN, and represent the first disease-modifying approach for IgAN.
 
Disease burden, diagnosis, and predictors of disease progression
 IgAN is a rare disease in the United States and European Union and is also the predominant cause of primary glomerulonephritis.
 Patients with IgAN are diagnosed throughout life, but most commonly in the second and third decades. There are three common ways in which patients present:
 •40–50% present with one or more episodes of gross (visible) hematuria, often linked to an upper respiratory tract infection.
 •30–40% present with microscopic hematuria and mild proteinuria, which is detected in a routine physical or during chronic kidney disease evaluation.
 •Less than 10% present with either nephrotic syndrome or an acute, rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis with symptoms including edema, hypertension, renal insufficiency, and hematuria.
 Once IgAN is suspected based on clinical history and laboratory data, kidney biopsy, which is the gold standard for IgAN diagnosis, is performed.
 
IgAN market opportunity
 We estimate there are approximately 126,000 biopsy-confirmed IgAN patients in the United States, 136,000 in the European Union, and 130,000 in Japan, and that growth in the diagnosed prevalent population is due to overall population growth. Underlying genetic differences may contribute to the significantly higher rate in Japan. As therapies become commercially available, however, an increase in diagnosis rate or longer time to progression, due to better treatments, may increase the diagnosed population over time.
 We estimate the U.S. market opportunity for novel therapeutics in IgAN is approximately $4.0 billion to $8.0 billion annually, based on the prevalence of the disease in the United States and the segment of IgAN patients at high risk of progressing to ESRD. In Europe and Japan, we estimate the annual market opportunity for novel IgAN therapeutics to be $1.0 billion and $600 million, respectively.
 
Current standard of care for IgAN patients


Despite the high unmet medical need in IgAN, there are limited treatment options available. The following two general approaches are typically employed for the treatment of patients with IgAN:
 •Non-specific measures to slow progression, including blood pressure control, and in patients with proteinuria, RAAS inhibitors, including ACE inhibitors or ARBs.
 •Steroids with or without other immunosuppressive agents to non-specifically reduce inflammation as a result of immune complex deposition in the glomeruli.
 Treatment is selected based on perceived risk of progressive kidney disease, and clinical measures such as hematuria, proteinuria, and eGFR are used to monitor patients while on treatment. The current standard of care is seen as insufficient by physicians and patients; these treatment approaches have limited clinical efficacy and are not well tolerated. Approximately 50% of patients fail to achieve controlled UPCR on ACE inhibitors, ARBS, or steroids. The use of steroids may cause significant side effects, including serious infections, high blood pressure, weight gain, diabetes, and osteoporosis. As such, there is a high unmet medical need for targeted therapies that impact the underlying disease pathophysiology and more tolerable, steroid-sparing treatment options for IgAN patients.
 
Emerging therapies in development
 There are two agents approved for the treatment of IgAN and there are several treatments in clinical development. The multistep IgAN pathogenesis hypothesis offers potential target points and approaches for therapeutic intervention. Most therapeutic candidates in clinical development have employed various approaches to target inflammation and the downstream effects. Atacicept is the first agent in development for IgAN that has demonstrated a 60% reduction of Gd-IgA1, the upstream source of IgAN pathogenesis.
 These agents can be grouped mechanistically into the following categories: glucocorticoid receptor agonists, endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs), complement inhibitors, B-cell modulators, and a variety of other approaches that are earlier in development.
 Glucocorticoid receptor agonists. Glucocorticoid receptor agonists are a well-known class of molecules that have broad anti-inflammatory effects, and well-established acute and chronic side effects. Though reduction in the risk of eGFR decline was shown in clinical trials, there is no consensus on whether glucocorticoids may improve renal survival. The glucocorticoid, budesonide, has been reformulated to concentrate steroid effects locally on the gut mucosa, theoretically suppressing the abnormal B-cell activity and reducing systemic steroid toxicity. Currently in a Phase 3 clinical trial in IgAN, reformulated budesonide has demonstrated statistically meaningful reduction of proteinuria, though systemic steroid side effects have been observed in prior clinical trials and the ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial.
 ERAs. Aberrant endothelin signaling is implicated in structural podocyte changes and increased mesangial proliferation in chronic kidney diseases, including IgAN. ERAs block endothelin-induced cell proliferation and hence may reduce renal perfusion pressure and proteinuria. Since this mechanism of action works downstream of disease-related immune activities, it is not expected to reduce Gd-IgA1 or the resulting immune complexes that cause the disease. Several ERAs, which have previously been approved for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension and erectile dysfunction and make use of a vasodilatory effect, are currently in Phase 3 development and have been shown to reduce proteinuria in patients with IgAN. However, ERAs have been associated with edema, significant liver toxicity and increased risk of heart failure.
 Complement inhibitors. Increased complement activation is commonly observed in patients with IgAN. It is hypothesized that immune-complex deposition in glomeruli may contribute to complement activation, though the exact mechanism is not well understood. Several agents that inhibit complement activation are in clinical development for IgAN. Modest reduction of proteinuria has been observed in early clinical trials. As complement inhibition works downstream of immune complex formation, these agents are not expected to impact the upstream cause of disease and reduce Gd-IgA1 or the resulting immune complexes that cause inflammation and complement activation in the kidney.
 B-cell modulators. B-cell modulators, including atacicept, are an important category of emerging therapies for IgAN. The disease-causing Gd-IgA1 is predominantly produced by B cells and plasma cells. Therefore, control of B-cell activation may reduce production of Gd-IgA1 and the downstream formation of autoantibodies and immune complexes. Preclinical models have shown that dual inhibition of BLyS and APRIL offers improved suppression of B-cell activities than blocking BLyS or APRIL alone. Atacicept blocks both BLyS and APRIL and has shown substantial reduction (60%) in Gd-IgA1. We believe that dual inhibition may also confer a potential dosing advantage versus APRIL-only inhibition.
 
Our solution: Atacicept
 Atacicept is a fusion protein that blocks both BLyS and APRIL, which play key roles in the upstream pathway that causes IgAN, and is dosed once weekly via a 1-mL subcutaneous injection. As a result, we believe atacicept has the potential to be the first disease-modifying therapy for IgAN. Through an integrated analysis of randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials in multiple autoimmune diseases with over 1,500 patients to date, atacicept has a well-characterized clinical safety profile. In a Phase 2a clinical trial in patients with IgAN, atacicept substantially reduced Gd-IgA1 and demonstrated a clinically meaningful reduction in proteinuria

and stable eGFR parameters at week 24. We completed enrollment of patients in the Phase 2b ORIGIN trial in 2022, and we reported positive topline results in January 2023.
 
Our approach to IgAN: Reducing Gd-IgA1, the source of autoantibodies
 Atacicept is a fully humanized fusion protein that impacts the B-cell pathway, which has well characterized implications in immunologic diseases. Specifically, as shown in Figure 4 below, atacicept contains the soluble transmembrane activator and CAML interactor (TACI) receptor that binds to the cytokines BLyS and APRIL. These cytokines are members of the tumor necrosis factor family that promote B-cell survival and autoantibody production associated with IgAN and other immunologic diseases. Dual blockade of BLyS and APRIL by TACI has been shown to be more potent than blocking BLyS alone or APRIL alone and has the benefit of targeting long-lived plasma cells, in addition to B cells, thus reducing autoantibody production, including Gd-IgA1, IgA, IgG and IgM. Therefore, atacicept’s mechanism acts directly on the source of IgAN, which we believe will significantly mitigate the downstream effects of the disease.

 Atacicept: Potential to address the core processes underlying IgAN pathogenesis
 
Atacicept’s specific actions on IgAN disease pathogenesis are shown in Figure 5 below.
 
Figure 5: Atacicept impact on IgAN pathogenesis
 




(1)Atacicept blocks BLyS, a factor important for B cell survival and maturation, resulting in reduced numbers of disease-causing B cells.
 (2)Atacicept blocks APRIL, a factor important for plasma cell survival, resulting in reduced numbers of disease-causing plasma cells.
 (3)Reductions in plasma cells and in antibody class switching to IgA reduce production of immunogenic Gd-IgA1.
 (4)Reductions in B cells, plasma cells, and Gd-IgA1 work together to reduce production of autoantibodies to Gd-IgA1.
 (5)Therefore, formation of pathogenic immune complexes is greatly reduced.
 (6)This in turn, reduces immune complex deposition in glomeruli and reduces complement activation.
 (7)Ultimately, progressive renal injury is reduced, which we believe will significantly lower the morbidity and mortality associated with IgAN.
 Atacicept’s disease-modifying mechanism addresses the upstream processes that cause IgAN, while most other molecules in development act downstream. Therefore, we believe that the clinical outcomes of atacicept, measured by endpoints designed to assess efficacy and durability, will be favorable over competitors, with a demonstrated tolerability profile. Once weekly 1 mL subcutaneous dosing also provides an attractive target product profile for patients.
 
Atacicept in IgAN: clinical development
 Atacicept was the subject of a collaboration agreement between Ares and ZymoGenetics, Inc. in 2001, and was licensed on an exclusive basis to Ares in 2008. It was advanced by Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, in clinical trials for several autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), multiple sclerosis, SLE, and IgAN, and in totality studied in double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials in over 1,500 patients to date. Safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and clinical efficacy of the weekly 25 mg, 75 mg and 150 mg doses administered subcutaneously have been studied.
 Atacicept is being studied in the Phase 2b ORIGIN clinical trial, a multinational, 36-week randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial, with a 60-week open label extension.
 
On January 3, 2023, and January 30, 2023, Vera reported positive week 24 primary results and shared the following results:
 •Atacicept met its primary endpoint with a statistically significant reduction in proteinuria in the pooled 75/150 mg arms versus placebo
 •In a prespecified per-protocol (PP) analysis, a blinded third-party CRO identified patients with protocol deviations that potentially confounded proteinuria measure. In the PP population excluding these patients, atacicept 150 mg achieved a 41% 


mean reduction in proteinuria versus baseline, resulting in a statistically significant 34% placebo-adjusted reduction (p=0.025) at an early week 24 timepoint
•There was a trend towards deepening reductions in proteinuria at week 36 with available data in patients on atacicept.
 •eGFR was stable through week 24 for all patients on atacicept
 •Atacicept was well tolerated, and its safety profile in IgAN patients was comparable to placebo
 •There was a 60% reduction in Gd-IgA1 at week 24 with atacicept 150 mg
 
Based on these Phase 2b ORIGIN trial results, the atacicept 150 mg dose was selected for a forthcoming Phase 3 clinical trial, which we expect to initiate in the second quarter of 2023. We will use the same formulation as the Phase 2b trial, while incorporating learnings from Phase 2b subgroup analyses to design a de-risked Phase 3 trial that accurately assesses treatment efficacy while minimizing potential confounders for proteinuria measure.

Atacicept safety and tolerability profile: Integrated analysis
 Though there was a limited number of patients in the JANUS trial, in an integrated safety analysis of clinical trials in multiple indications with over 1,500 patients in a number of indications, atacicept was well tolerated, shown in Figure 6 below. Serious treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) reported in the highest proportions were those in infections and infestations (placebo 3.9% versus atacicept 4.4%), musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (placebo 1.9% versus atacicept 1.3%), and nervous system disorders (placebo 2.1% versus atacicept 1.2%). The most frequently reported TEAE was pneumonia (placebo 1.2% versus atacicept 1.3%). We believe that this large and established data set is a competitive advantage for atacicept versus other approved and emerging therapies in development, many of which lack extensive safety data.
 
Figure 6. Integrated safety analysis: Summary of treatment-emergent adverse events > 5% in any arm, by dose
 


The safety profile of atacicept 25 mg, 75 mg and 150 mg has been characterized in healthy subjects and patients with RA, multiple sclerosis, optic neuritis, SLE, and B-cell malignancies, and is considered acceptable in IgAN. Over 1,940 individuals have been enrolled in 22 clinical trials, of which over 1,425 individuals have received at least one dose of atacicept. In the three Phase 2/3 clinical trials, 590 patients with SLE and 11 patients with IgAN have received at least one dose of atacicept.
 We believe the benefit-risk balance of atacicept to be favorable for further development in IgAN and certain additional autoimmune diseases, and we intend to explore additional immunologic diseases where BLyS and APRIL are abnormally elevated, or where autoantibodies play an important role.
 
Ongoing phase 2b ORIGIN clinical trial design
 ORIGIN, our ongoing Phase 2b randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging trial, will evaluate the efficacy and safety of atacicept in patients with IgAN. The clinical trial consists of a 36-week double-blind treatment period, followed by a 60-week open-label treatment period and a 26-week safety follow-up period. The trial assesses multiple doses (25 mg, 75 mg and 150 mg) of once weekly 1-mL subcutaneous injections of atacicept versus placebo on impact of renal function as measured by proteinuria. The primary endpoint is change from baseline in UPCR at 24 weeks based on 24-hour urine collection, with a secondary endpoint of UPCR at 36 weeks. Other endpoints include change from baseline in UPCR at 12, 48, and 96 weeks, change from baseline in eGFR at 12, 24, 36, 48, and 96 weeks, change from baseline in IgA, IgG, IgM, C3, C4, and Gd-IgA1 levels at 12, 24, 36, 48, and 96 weeks, number of

participants with adverse events during the double-blind treatment period through 36 weeks, and the serum concentration of atacicept through study completion.
 
Figure 7. Phase 2b ORIGIN trial design
 


UPCR is an accepted surrogate primary endpoint for clinical trials in IgAN, which allows for a faster path to commercialization than rate of change/slope in eGFR, which is measured after two years. The recommendation for usage of this surrogate endpoint was put forward by the ASN, partnering with the FDA under the auspices of the Kidney Health Initiative, and the EMA, and has now been implemented in five Phase 3 clinical trials in IgAN and in the two FDA approvals granted. Accelerated and/or conditional approval may be granted on the UPCR endpoint, with full approval to be granted upon longer-term data demonstrating stabilization of eGFR with treatment.
 In mid-2022 we completed enrollment of the Phase 2b ORIGIN trial, enrolling a total of 116 patients at multiple global sites. In January 2023, we announced positive topline 24-week results. Atacicept met the primary endpoint: the pooled 75 mg and 150 mg arms achieved a statistically significant reduction in proteinuria versus placebo at 24 weeks. In a prespecified PP analysis, a blinded third-party CRO identified patients with protocol deviations that potentially confounded proteinuria measure. In the PP population excluding these patients, atacicept 150 mg achieved a 41% mean reduction in proteinuria versus baseline, resulting in a statistically significant 34% placebo-adjusted reduction (p=0.025) at an early week 24 timepoint. Available data show a trend towards deeper reductions in proteinuria with atacicept at 36 weeks, for which full results will read out in the second quarter of 2023. eGFR was stable through week 24 for all patients on atacicept. The 150 mg dose achieved a 60% reduction in Gd-IgA1 at week 24. Atacicept was well tolerated, and its safety profile in IgAN patients was also comparable to placebo. Treatment will remain blinded through 36 weeks, after which all patients will roll onto the open label portion of the study and receive atacicept 150 mg through 96 weeks, providing the opportunity to assess long-term safety of atacicept in patients with IgAN.
We plan to advance atacicept 150 mg into a pivotal Phase 3 trial in the second quarter of 2023, using the same formulation from the Phase 2b trial and learnings from the Phase 2b subgroup analyses to design a de-risked Phase 3 trial that accurately assesses treatment efficacy while minimizing potential confounders for proteinuria measure. With the ongoing data from the Phase 2b trial through 2024 and Phase 3 topline results expected in the first half of 2025, if positive, we expect to submit a BLA for atacicept in IgAN to the FDA in the second half of 2025.
 
Atacicept in LN: A severe renal manifestation of SLE
 Based on discussions with the FDA following the review of Phase 2 data in SLE, we are planning a Phase 3 clinical trial of atacicept as a potential treatment for patients with LN, a severe renal manifestation of SLE. We estimate that there are approximately 120,000 LN patients in the United States, 70,000 in the European Union, and 21,000 in Japan. Significant unmet need for improved efficacy persists for these patients despite the recent approval of the first two LN-specific therapies. Fewer than half of patients treated for LN have a complete response to therapy, and among patients without a complete response, over half will have non-functioning kidneys within five years. Benlysta (belimumab), a BLyS-only inhibitor, is one of the two therapies approved for patients with LN. Both BLyS and APRIL levels are increased in patients with SLE, suggesting that dual inhibition by atacicept may be more potent than blocking BLyS alone and has the benefit of targeting plasma cells in addition to B cells. Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany previously initiated a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2/3 clinical trial of atacicept in LN, the APRIL-LN trial, aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of atacicept at 150 mg twice weekly for four weeks—then weekly—in patients with active LN. However, this trial was terminated early due to three patients developing hypogammaglobulinemia with induction therapy (MMF and CS) which continued to worsen when initiating atacicept and subsequently two patients developed pneumonia. In prior Phase 2 clinical

trials of atacicept in SLE also conducted by Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, despite missing its primary endpoint of improved SLE responder index 4 (SRI-4) at week 24, in the broader SLE study population, atacicept achieved positive clinical data on multiple measures within the prespecified HDA patient segment, including reduction of renal flares, which we believe supports atacicept’s applicability in LN. Because both preclinical and clinical evidence suggests atacicept’s dual inhibition of BLyS and APRIL may provide improved clinical outcomes, measured by endpoints designed to assess efficacy, compared to inhibiting either signal alone, we believe there is a strong rationale to conduct a clinical trial of atacicept in LN.
 
Pathophysiology of LN
 LN is a severe renal manifestation of SLE (also referred to as lupus). SLE is a chronic and disabling autoimmune disease in which the body’s own immune system attacks itself. SLE predominantly affects women and is more prevalent in women of color. When LN is diagnosed in a patient, mortality risk dramatically increases.
 LN pathogenesis involves a variety of disease-causing mechanisms, including the formation of immune deposits within the kidneys that are primarily due to anti-double stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibodies, which atacicept has been shown to reduce in a dose-dependent manner. However, there are also instances in which induction of LN by anti-dsDNA may not require immune complex formation— autoreactive plasma cells in the kidney may be another cause of nephritis. Certain genes and genetic factors may also predispose patients.
 
LN disease burden and diagnosis
 LN has a strong influence on morbidity and mortality within SLE, with up to 26% of patients progressing to ESRD within 15 to 20 years from initial diagnosis. LN is characterized by abnormal proteinuria, hematuria, and impaired kidney function.
 Diagnosed SLE patients are routinely monitored by rheumatologists, who will refer to nephrologists upon suspicion of renal manifestations. In the United States and European Union, LN patients without a prior SLE diagnosis will typically first present to a primary care physician (U.S.) or internist (EU) with hematuria or proteinuria before ultimate referral to a nephrologist. For confirmatory diagnosis, nephrologists perform renal biopsy—of which the results are analyzed to determine histologic class and relevant treatment course.
 
LN patients are segmented in Classes I–VI based on histopathology and degree of renal impairment, and this classification drives treatment decisions. Class I, or Minimal mesangial LN, is rarely diagnosed as these patients have normal urinalysis and therefore biopsy is not typically performed. Class II, Mesangial proliferative LN, refers to microscopic hematuria and/or proteinuria. Patients with Class III, or Focal LN, tend to have both hematuria and proteinuria, and may have hypertension, decreased eGFR, and nephrotic syndrome. Class IV, or Diffuse LN, is the most commonly diagnosed and severe form of LN, with patients exhibiting hematuria, proteinuria, nephrotic syndrome, hypertension, and decreased eGFR. Patients with Class V, or lupus membranous nephropathy, tend to have nephrotic syndrome, and may have microscopic hematuria and hypertension, but normal UPCR. Class VI, or advanced sclerosing LN, refers to a slow progression of kidney dysfunction correlated with proteinuria.
 As shown in Figure 8 below, LN typically develops early in the disease course, though the rate of SLE patients who develop LN increases over time.
 
Figure 8: LN progression
 


LN market opportunity
 According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there are approximately 322,000 people living with SLE in the United States.


Approximately half of individuals living with SLE develop LN within 15 years of their initial diagnosis, as shown in Figure 8 above.
 We estimate that there are approximately 120,000 LN patients in the United States, 70,000 in the European Union, and 21,000 in Japan at present. In the United States, higher prevalence rates occur in the heterogeneous population, as both SLE and LN occur more frequently among non-White patients—with the highest frequency of LN occurring in Black and Hispanic populations after adjustment for socioeconomic factors. In all three geographies, women account for the majority of LN cases.
 Based on primary market research with physicians and payors and extensive secondary research, we estimate the market for novel LN therapeutics annually to be approximately $2.0 to $5.0 billion, $600 million and $200 million in United States, Europe and Japan, respectively.
 
Current standard of care for LN patients
 Current LN treatment is largely cyclical, with induction versus maintenance therapy dictated by the severity of disease and frequency of flares. Treatment is driven by histologic class and can be influenced by the treatments that the patient has been on since SLE diagnosis. Class I and II LN do not generally need LN-specific treatment. Within Class III–V, patients tend to receive induction therapy for approximately one year to achieve complete or partial remission. Induction therapy for Class III–IV patients include several immunosuppressive agents, such as MMF ± CS or cylophosphamide (CYC) ± CS in the first line of treatment, switching to either CYC or MMF in the second line, whichever was not administered first line. Third line induction therapy has generally consisted of rituximab for Class III–V patients. For induction therapy of Class V LN patients, patients typically receive MMF ± steroids in the first line, a calcineurin inhibitor in the second line, and rituximab for third line. Maintenance therapy, which typically consists of MMF, azathioprine (AZA), or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), is typically prescribed to well controlled patients after any line of induction to reduce flares. Immunosuppressive therapy is unlikely to be beneficial for Class VI, or advanced sclerosing LN.
 Patients on maintenance still experience flares approximately every year, resulting in cycling back to induction therapy. Many of the therapies used in the treatment paradigm today have limited efficacy and poor tolerability profiles—and therefore there is significant unmet need for safe and specific therapies that have a direct impact on LN disease activity without a high risk of infection.
 
Recently approved and emerging therapies in development
 Until recently, there were no approved therapies for the treatment of LN. In December 2020, the FDA approved Benlysta (belimumab), an anti-BLyS antibody, for treatment of adult patients with active LN who are receiving standard therapy. In January 2021, the FDA approved Lupkynis (voclosporin), a calcineurin inhibitor, to be used in combination with a background immunosuppressive therapy regimen for adult patients with active LN. Clinical guidelines on how these two medicines may be incorporated into standard of care remain to be updated. In addition to Benlysta (belimumab) and Lupkynis (voclosporin), there are several other cytokine inhibitors and complement inhibitors in development for LN.
 B-cell Modulators. Benlysta (belimumab) is an anti-BLyS antibody, belonging to the class of B-cell modulators. Within the B-cell modulator class, there is a desire for different mechanisms to target the complex pathophysiology of LN. The results shared to date for these agents reveal statistically significant efficacy, but complete response rates are only achieved in fewer than 50% of the patients studied.
 Calcineurin Inhibition. Lupkynis (voclosporin) is a calcineurin inhibitor, a mechanism which has been commonly used in generic form as induction therapy for Class V patients. Calcineurin inhibition has been shown to reduce cytokine activation of T-cells and protect against proteinuria, however it may pose serious infection risks and nephrotoxicity is a known class effect.
 Cytokine Inhibitors. The other cytokine inhibitors under investigation offer blockade of key pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL17A, IL23, Type 1 IFNs) involved in the pathogenesis of LN, however, they are early in their development.
 Complement Pathway Inhibitors. Complement pathway inhibitors are also early in their development, but unlikely to be disease-modifying, since complement activation is one result of the inflammation caused by immune-complex deposition in the kidneys, downstream of key steps in disease pathophysiology.
 

Our solution: Atacicept
 Targeting both BLyS and APRIL is key to reduce autoantibodies produced by B cells and plasma cells in LN. Autoantibodies play a large role in the pathogenesis of LN. Autoantibodies target tissue or form immune complexes, leading to tissue and organ damage. Both short-lived and long-lived plasma cells are responsible for generating high levels of autoantibodies in LN.
 Short-lived plasma blasts are the main B cell effector subset dependent on activation of various B cell receptors such as TACI, B cell maturation agent (BCMA) and BLyS. Therefore, B cell blocking agents such as Rituxan (rituximab; anti-CD20) and Benlysta (belimumab; anti-BLyS) can reduce short-lived plasma cells and the resulting autoantibody production.


Long-lived plasma cells are in bone marrow and inflammatory tissue niches, and form antibodies in the absence of B-cell activation. Inflammatory tissue has high levels of BLyS and APRIL, which serve to maintain long-lived plasma cells. Inhibiting APRIL blocks long-lived nonproliferating plasma cell activities to further reduce autoantibody formations in LN.
 Atacicept contains the soluble TACI receptor that binds to the cytokines BLyS and APRIL and prevents their interaction with TACI, BCMA and BLyS receptors (BLyS-R is also known as B cell activating factor receptor or BAFF-R). Atacicept thus inhibits survival of immature and mature B cells and antibody-producing plasma cells and prevents immunoglobulin class switching. In contrast to a range of available biologics directed at B cells only, we believe atacicept has a prompt and marked effect on antibody production by inhibiting both short-lived and long-lived plasma cells.
 Preclinical evidence indicates that dual inhibition of BLyS and APRIL is superior to either BLyS or APRIL alone. Animal models of kidney disease have confirmed that atacicept reduces plasma cell numbers and reduces autoantibodies more effectively than BLyS and APRIL antibodies given individually. In a mouse model of collagen-induced arthritis, soluble atacicept inhibited development of collagen-specific antibodies and reduced the incidence of the disease better than BLyS (also known as BAFF) agents alone. In a mouse model of SLE, soluble atacicept decreased the number of B cells, increased survival time and reduced severity of disease symptoms. Furthermore, in a mouse model of SLE, atacicept administered after onset of autoimmunity decreased the number of bone marrow plasma cells and slowed down further formation of autoantibodies. Atacicept prevented renal damage during a 12-week treatment period regardless of autoantibody levels, while the BLyS-only inhibitor did not. Atacicept also decreased established plasma cells in an immunization model better than single inhibitors of BLyS or APRIL.
 In patients with active SLE, targeting BLyS and APRIL with atacicept appears to have improved clinical outcomes, measured by endpoints designed to assess efficacy, compared to BLyS alone (Benlysta [belimumab]). While atacicept and Benlysta (belimumab) have not been studied head-to-head in clinical trials, each has been studied in similar populations of patients with SLE, and results of a Phase 2 clinical trial of 150 mg of atacicept compared favorably to published reports on changes in SLE responder index (SRI-4) of belimumab. In a Phase 2 clinical trial of atacicept, the magnitude of efficacy as measured by the difference between treatment and placebo in SRI-4 at 24 weeks was approximately 39% (25% placebo, 64% atacicept 75 mg, 65% atacicept 150 mg, both p=0.005). For Benlysta (belimumab), in a Phase 3 clinical trial of SLE patients, a published analysis of patients with HDA and serologically active disease, clinical efficacy for Benlysta (belimumab) 10 mg/kg showed a difference between treatment and placebo in SRI-4 at 24 weeks of approximately 12%.
Figure 9: Evidence for atacicept performance in SLE
 


Atacicept consistently demonstrated improved clinical outcomes, measured by endpoints designed to assess efficacy, versus placebo in SLE patients with HDA (SLEDAI-2K ≥10) across additional clinical measures, and consistently across all SRI cut-offs, as well as using the separate clinical assessment, British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG)-based Combined Lupus Assessment (BICLA). In the HDA population in ADDRESS II, the BICLA delta at week 24 was 20% (atacicept 150 mg 49%, placebo 29.2%, p=0.035), which compares very favorably to BICLA data from other late-stage SLE clinical trials, such as anifrolumab (week 24 BICLA in 16%). We believe that based on these results, an improved clinical benefit may be observed in patients with LN.
 
Prior clinical development of atacicept in LN


Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2/3 clinical trial of atacicept in LN, the APRIL-LN trial, aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of atacicept in patients with active LN. As per trial protocol, patients initiated high-dose CS (the lesser of 0.8 mg/kg/day or 60 mg/day prednisone) and MMF (1 g daily, increased by 1 g/day each week to 3 g daily) at the time of screening (day -14). From day 1, atacicept (150 mg, subcutaneously, twice weekly for four weeks, then weekly) was initiated with MMF along with a tapered dose of CS.
 Four of the six enrolled LN patients developed decreases in serum IgG levels following the initiation of MMF and CS in the setting of significant proteinuria, which are contributing factors of hypogammaglobulinemia. After initiation of atacicept, serum IgG levels further declined; two patients developed severe hypogammaglobulinemia, defined as IgG <3 g/L, and pneumonia. These two patients recovered after treatment discontinuation and received antibiotics therapy. This trial was terminated. Based on the detailed assessment of results from this trial, plans to develop atacicept for the treatment of LN will explore alternatives to the induction regimen studied previously, including not dosing atacicept 150 mg twice weekly; clearly defining the dosing regimen for CS and MMF; and closely monitoring immunoglobulin levels during induction therapy.
 
Evaluation of safety and efficacy profile of atacicept in SLE
 Atacicept 75 mg and 150 mg, dosed once per week with subcutaneous auto-injection, have demonstrated improved clinical outcomes, measured by endpoints designed to assess efficacy, in patients with SLE in the Phase 2 APRIL-SLE and ADDRESS II trials. In these trials, autoantibody titers were significantly reduced, and prespecified and post hoc analyses revealed prevention of flare and reduction of active disease with atacicept treatment, despite the fact that the primary endpoints in these trials were not met.
In ADDRESS II, SLE patients with HDA (SLEDAI-2K ≥10) had an increase in SRI-6 response, attainment of low disease activity (LDA), or SLEDAI-2K ≤2, and a reduction of the risk of a first new severe flare (defined by SLEDAI Flare Index [SFI] or by BILAG A) when treated with atacicept 150 mg. Furthermore, the 024 long-term extension (LTE) trial showed durability of these effects through a median duration of treatment of 96 weeks.
Following the release of the HDA data, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany pursued the planning and initiation of a global Phase 3 registrational program for atacicept 150 mg once per week in SLE. This program, including two large Phase 3 randomized placebo-controlled trials of atacicept 150 mg compared to placebo, were reviewed by FDA via end-of-phase-2 communication and scientific advice communication with EMA, prior to Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany terminating the SLE program and the IgAN program for business strategy reasons.
 
Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with SLE for 24 weeks
 ADDRESS II, a Phase 2b SLE trial of 306 patients, evaluated the efficacy and safety of atacicept at two subcutaneous doses (150 mg and 75 mg) versus placebo over the course of 24 weeks, with an LTE arm continuing an additional 96 weeks.
 Atacicept demonstrated consistent reductions in IgG, IgA, and IgM serum levels, and reductions in anti-dsDNA antibodies, as well as improvements in serum C3 and C4 levels, as shown in Figure 10 below.
 
Figure 10: Atacicept impact on key biomarkers in the phase 2 ADDRESS II trial
 



Though atacicept missed its primary endpoint of SRI-6 reduction versus placebo in all comers, in a prespecified analysis of HDA patients, which comprised approximately half of those enrolled, atacicept 150 mg showed improved clinical outcomes, measured by multiple endpoints designed to assess efficacy, including a 26% improvement (p=0.005) in SRI-6 versus placebo, flare risk reduction, and serologic marker normalization. SRI-6 response is defined as ≥6-point reduction in the SELENA-SLEDAI score, no new BILAG A organ domain score or two new BILAG B organ domain scores, and no worsening (<0.30-point increase) in Physician’s Global Assessment score.
 
Figure 11: SRI-6 response among HDA patients in the phase 2 ADDRESS II trial
 

Also, among this HDA patient segment, significantly more patients on the atacicept 150 mg arm reached LDA, as measured by SLEDAI-2K ≤2, as shown in Figure 12 below.
 
Figure 12: HDA patients reaching LDA in the phase 2 ADDRESS II trial





Furthermore, Figure 13 below demonstrates the durable clinical outcomes observed in the HDA segment: more patients reached LDA by multiple measures at both week 24 and week 48. Significantly more patients treated with atacicept 150 mg once weekly versus placebo demonstrated clinical improvement (as shown by SRI-6), achieved LDA, and remission.
 
Figure 13: Durable clinical outcomes observed in HDA patients in the phase 2 ADDRESS II trial
 



We believe that the clinical outcomes, measured by multiple endpoints designed to assess efficacy within the HDA segment of the SLE population in the ADDRESS II trial—and a favorable tolerability profile observed in ADDRESS II, as well as the integrated safety analysis in over 1,500 patients—provide the foundation of our rationale for developing atacicept further in LN, a severe renal manifestation of SLE.
 
Planned phase 3 clinical trial design
 
Our Phase 3, randomized, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, multinational study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of atacicept vs placebo in patients with LN. The clinical trial consists of a 104-week double blind treatment period, followed by a 52-week open label treatment period and a 26-week safety follow-up period. The trial, as shown in Figure 14 below, will assess atacicept 150 mg once weekly subcutaneous injections versus placebo. The primary endpoint is complete renal response at 52 weeks.
 
Figure 14: Planned phase 3 clinical trial design



MAU868 in reactivated BK infection among kidney transplant recipients
 We are developing MAU868 as a potential treatment for reactivated BK infection in kidney transplant recipients. While up to 90% of healthy adults have been infected with BKV at some point in their lives, it remains latent in everyone except severely immunocompromised populations such as kidney transplant recipients. There are approximately 80,000 kidney transplants annually worldwide, with approximately 20,000 in the United States. Approximately 225,000 kidney allograft recipients are living in the United States. Waitlists to receive kidneys are long: approximately 3–5 years and 75,000 people long in the United States. Up to 12% of transplants per year are re-transplants, which further limits organ availability for new patients. BKV is a polyoma virus that is tropic to the kidney and bladder tissue and can reactivate with the immunosuppression required for kidney transplant. This reactivation can cause BKVN, a condition in which BK infection, typically first identified as BK viremia, triggers inflammation, which then progresses to renal fibrosis and tubular injury; as shown in Figure 15, BKVN is a leading cause of allograft loss, a devastating outcome for kidney transplant recipients.
 
Figure 15: Graft survival (%) in kidney transplant patients is worse with BKVN
 

Currently, there are no approved treatment options for BK viremia or BKVN. We shared full Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 results in 2022 from the Phase 2 trial conducted by Amplyx, and plan to initiate a Phase 2b or Phase 3 clinical trial, pending alignment with regulatory authorities. We believe that MAU868 has the potential to become standard of care for the treatment of BK viremia in order to prevent devastating consequences such as BKVN.
 
Pathophysiology of BK virus in kidney transplant
 BKV has a worldwide seroprevalence of up to 90%. Primary BK infection is typically acquired during childhood, after which the virus establishes lifelong infection in the kidney and bladder tissue. Most people do not experience any known adverse effects from either primary or persistent infection. Control of infection is dependent on CD4+ and CD8+ T cell immunity, which immunosuppressants can displace. In the setting of kidney transplant and related immunosuppression, latent virus can be reactivated or new virus can be transmitted via the donor kidney. BKV reactivation is marked first by viruria—or detection of virus in the urine, and then viremia—detection of viral DNA in the blood, and most commonly occurs within the first year of transplant.


Viremia typically occurs in 15% of kidney transplant recipients, after which BKVN may occur. Approximately 3-4% of kidney transplant recipients develop BKVN.
 
BKVN disease burden and diagnosis
 BKVN may lead to allograft injury and in some cases, allograft loss. Up to 24–60% of all graft losses are due to BKV-associated disease. The average cost of a kidney transplant in the United States is over $440,000. Pre-transplant, recipients are typically on dialysis, for which the cost is approximately $90,000 per year; there is an approximate 450% increase in annual medical cost to treat transplant recipients who experience graft loss.
 Most institutions monitor for BK in both the urine, through PCR and urinalysis, and plasma, via PCR. It is common practice to screen kidney transplant recipients for BK viremia via PCR test monthly in the first six months post-transplant and then every three months until two years post-transplant, after which patients are typically screened annually. Also, at any sign of allograft dysfunction, physicians will test for BK viremia. Viral load levels >1000 copies/mL are considered positive for BK viremia, and levels >10,000 copies/mL are considered presumptive BKVN. Kidney allograft biopsy is considered the gold standard for diagnosing BKVN. Late diagnosis of BKV can lead to irreversible renal function decline and poor treatment outcomes.
 
Kidney transplant market opportunity
 An estimated 80,000 kidney transplants are conducted globally each year, with approximately 20,000 in the United States, 20,000 in Europe, 1,500 in Japan, and 10,000 in China. Approximately 225,000 kidney allograft recipients are living in the United States. Waitlists to receive kidneys are long: 3–5 years and 75,000 people deep in the United States. Up to 12% of transplants per year are re-transplants, which further limits organ availability for new patients. Approximately 15% of kidney transplant recipients develop BK viremia. Patients can be risk stratified for BK viremia based on the degree of immunosuppression employed, which is related to the degree of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) match between the graft and recipient; the greater the mismatch, the more intense immunosuppression required, which increases the risk of BKV reactivation.
 We estimate the market for a novel agent to treat reactivated BK infection in kidney transplant recipients to be a large commercial opportunity. We believe that MAU868 has the potential to become standard of care for the treatment of reactivated BK infection in order to prevent devastating consequences following kidney transplantation such as BKVN and graft loss.

Current standard of care for kidney transplant patients with BK viremia
 Currently, there is no approved treatment specific to BKV. Upon detection of BK viremia, physicians’ first line of defense is to reduce immunosuppression with the goal of restoring CD4+ and CD8+ T cell immunity without causing acute rejection. Initial modification will typically consist of lowering MMF by 50% followed by a reduction in tacrolimus by 50%. If no improvement is observed, use of MMF and tacrolimus will be stopped and dose of prednisone will be increased. Other agents such as intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), leflunomide, and cidofovir, are occasionally used—but all have limited data and both leflunomide and cidofovir have serious safety concerns. After development of BKVN, patients have limited options and may continue to receive antivirals or IVIG. Physicians are not satisfied with current treatment options for BKV and highlight that there is a significant unmet need for a viable therapy.
 
Emerging therapies in development
 Despite the high level of unmet need in treating BK viremia and preventing devastating consequences, there is limited development in the space. There is only one alternate industry-sponsored program in clinical development: Allovir’s posoleucel (formerly known as ALVR-105 and Viralym-M), a multi-virus specific T-cell therapy, which is currently being evaluated in a Phase 2 clinical trial. While this approach may have the potential to treat BKV and other opportunistic infections, logistics and distribution are likely to render this approach less feasible than a monoclonal antibody, for instance. Therefore, posoleucel may be reserved for second line of therapy and/or treatment of presumptive BKVN rather than BK viremia.
 
Our solution: MAU868 / scientific rationale
 MAU868 is a human monoclonal antibody (IgG1/l isotype subclass) directed against the major viral capsid protein of BKV, VP1, which is essential for binding to and infection of new cells, as shown in Figure 16. MAU868 neutralizes all four serotypes of BKV at sub-nanomolar concentrations and has a high barrier to resistance in vitro (resistant isolates of BKV were not selected in vitro at any of the concentrations of MAU868 investigated). MAU868 is being developed for the treatment of BKV disease in kidney transplant recipients (BKV nephropathy) and being considered for HSCT recipients (BKV-associated hemorrhagic cystitis). MAU868 also has neutralizing activity in vitro against the closely related JC virus, the cause of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.

Clinical development of MAU868
 
Phase 1
 A first-in-human, randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose study to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of MAU868 following IV or SC administration to healthy adult subjects was performed. Administration of up to 100 mg/kg MAU868 IV and 3 mg/kg MAU868 SC were safe and well tolerated. No deaths or serious adverse events were reported, and there were no adverse events that led to the discontinuation of the drug or the study.
 
Ongoing phase 2
 A Phase 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial designed to assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of MAU868 for the treatment of allograft-threatening BKV infection in kidney (or kidney-pancreas) transplant recipients is ongoing. Up to 36 patients with BK viremia will participate in 1 of 3 sequential cohorts. As shown in Figure 17, each cohort was designed to randomize approximately 12 patients (8 to MAU868 and 4 to placebo), for which Cohort 1 (1350 mg IV approximately every 28 days for a total of 4 doses) and Cohort 2 (6750 mg IV on Day 1, 1350 mg IV every 28 days for 3 additional doses) have completed dosing.
 The primary objective of the clinical trial is to assess the safety and tolerability of MAU868, with secondary objectives to assess the impact of MAU868 on BKV related outcomes. MAU868 has been shown in an interim analysis of week 12 data from Cohorts 1 and 2 to be well-tolerated and showed a greater proportion of patients with decrease in BK plasma viral load versus placebo.
 At ASN 2022, final results from the Phase 2 clinical trial of MAU868 versus placebo showed that MAU868 was well tolerated and demonstrated clinically meaningful reductions in BK antiviral activity through 36 weeks in kidney transplant patients with BK viremia.

   Future clinical trials
 We plan to initiate a Phase 2b or Phase 3 clinical trial.
 
MAU868 in BKV cystitis among HSCT recipients
 We are exploring development of MAU868 to treat BKV cystitis in HSCT patients. Patients undergoing HSCT are at risk for BKV reactivation due to immunodeficiency; in this setting, BK reactivation and subsequent viruria and viremia can lead to cystitis, including hemorrhagic cystitis. Cystitis is characterized by dysuria, urgency, and/or frequency, while hemorrhagic cystitis indicates the presence of microscopic or gross hematuria. Both BKV cystitis and hemorrhagic cystitis are associated with high patient morbidity and prolonged hospitalization, yet there are no approved treatment options. We believe that MAU868 may represent an important future treatment option for these patients.
 
Pathophysiology of BK virus reactivation in HSCT
 HSCT patients, particularly those who have received allogeneic transplants, are at high risk of various infectious diseases due to immunodeficiency. During the early post-engraftment period, BKV is a common cause of hemorrhagic cystitis. Patients are at highest risk for BKV cystitis three to six weeks following HSCT. Myeloablative conditioning regimen in the setting of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) mismatch is a particular risk factor for BK reactivation. Viruria occurs in approximately half of allogeneic and less than 10% of autologous HSCT recipients. BK viremia > 10,000 copies/mL has been shown to be predictive of renal and urologic outcomes in HSCT patients.
 
BKV cystitis disease burden and diagnosis
 Moderate to severe BKV cystitis may occur prior to discharge and prolong hospital stay and/or result in readmission to the hospital if already discharged. Currently HSCT patients are not routinely monitored for BKV reactivation given the lack of treatments available. BKV testing and monitoring is initiated only in patients who become symptomatic and present with cystitis symptoms, which may emerge several weeks or months following engraftment. Patients who are symptomatic would then be monitored for BKV via urine and/or blood testing monthly for six months, and then at longer intervals. BK viruria alone is not concerning unless the viral load is rapidly accelerating; BKV viremia is more concerning and may trigger physicians to actively treat the cystitis symptoms. In our market research, physicians estimate that 15% of allogeneic HSCT patients and approximately 5% of autologous HSCT patients develop BKV cystitis, including hemorrhagic cystitis.
 
HSCT market opportunity
 The primary addressable patient segment initially is for the treatment of symptomatic BKV cystitis, including hemorrhagic cystitis. Other potential segments may include prophylaxis in high-risk patients and treatment of BK viremia. BK viremia is not currently screened for until symptoms of cystitis occur, but this is likely to change once physicians have an effective treatment available.
 An estimated 50,000 allogeneic HSCTs are conducted globally each year, with approximately 10,000 in the United States, 16,000 in Europe, 3,500 in Japan, and 2,500 in China. An estimated 57,000 autologous HSCTs are conducted globally each year, with approximately 17,000 in the United States, 27,000 in Europe, 2,500 in Japan, and 1,800 in China. Approximately 15% of allogeneic recipients and 5% of autologous recipients develop BK cystitis, including hemorrhagic cystitis.

Current standard of care for BKV cystitis in HSCT patients
 Upon diagnosis of BKV-associated cystitis, physicians consider reducing immunosuppression—with initial modification typically consisting of lowering MMF by 50% or modifying the tacrolimus dose. This reduction of immunosuppression must be balanced with

consideration for increased risk of acute Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD). Antivirals such as low-dose cidofovir and leflunomide as well as IVIG are used in patients whose BKV does not resolve after a reduction of immunosuppression, or in patients where reduction in immunosuppression is viewed as too high risk (i.e., instances of HLA mismatch or prior history of GvHD). However, there is not robust clinical trial evidence supporting use of these agents in this setting. Symptomatic treatments for severe bleeding due to hematuria include red blood cell transfusions, bladder embolization or cystectomy. For HSCT patients, physicians’ primary concerns are acute GvHD and cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation moreso than BKV, though they continue to view BKV cystitis as an area of high unmet need.
 
Emerging therapies in development
 There is limited clinical development of new agents targeting BKV in the HSCT setting. Allovir’s posoleucel (formerly known as ALVR-105 and Viralym-M), a multi-virus specific T-cell therapy, is currently in a Phase 3 clinical trial for the treatment of virus-associated hemorrhagic cystitis. This therapy has the potential to treat six viral pathogens: BKV, CMV, adenovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, human herpesvirus 6 and JC virus, and therefore may have utility when physicians are concerned about multiple viral reactivations. Posoleucel is also in two Phase 2 clinical trials: one in kidney transplant recipients with BK viremia and another in multi-virus prevention following allogeneic HSCT.
 We believe that MAU868 may represent an important future treatment option for HSCT patients with BKV cystitis and that its relative ease of distribution and administration may provide a competitive advantage over other emerging therapies.
 
Exclusive license agreement with Ares Trading S.A.
 On October 29, 2020, we entered into the Ares Agreement with Ares, an affiliate of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, pursuant to which Ares granted us an exclusive worldwide license to certain patents and related know-how to research, develop, manufacture, use and commercialize therapeutic products containing atacicept or any other compound that is covered by a claim of such licensed patents. Pursuant to the Ares Agreement, Ares also transferred inventory of licensed product to us for use in our clinical development of atacicept.
 Per the Ares Agreement, we have obligations to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop at least one licensed product, to launch at least one licensed product in a major market country within a specified time frame after receiving marketing approval for such product and to maintain sufficient resources to manufacture and supply licensed products to meet the market demand in each country for which a licensed product has received marketing approval.
 In consideration for the rights granted under the Ares Agreement, we issued 22,171,553 shares of our Series C redeemable convertible preferred stock to Ares at the time of the initial closing of our Series C redeemable convertible preferred stock financing in October 2020, representing ownership of approximately 10% on a fully diluted basis. As additional consideration under the Ares Agreement, we paid Ares $25.0 million upon delivery and initiation of the transfer of specified information and supply of drug product and drug substance and we are required to pay Ares aggregate milestone payments of up to $ 176.5 million upon the achievement of specified BLA filing or regulatory approvals in the United States, Europe and Japan (the first of which consists of a $15.0 million payment upon filing of the BLA), and aggregate milestone payments of up to $515.0 million upon the achievement of specified commercial milestones. Commencing on the first commercial sale of licensed products, we are obligated to pay tiered royalties of low double-digit to mid-teen percentages on annual net sales of the products covered by the license. Our obligation to pay royalties will expire on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis until the latest of (i) 15 years after the first commercial sale of such licensed product in such country; (ii) the expiration of the last valid claim of a licensed patent that covers such licensed product in, or its use, importation or manufacture with respect to, such country; and (iii) expiration of all applicable regulatory exclusivity periods in such country with respect to such licensed product.

 The term of the Ares Agreement will expire on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis upon the expiration of our obligation to pay royalties to Ares with respect to such licensed product in such country. We have the right to terminate the Ares Agreement at will upon a specified notice period, provided that such termination is not within two years of the effective date of the Ares Agreement. Ares has the right to terminate the Ares Agreement in the event we challenge the validity of the licensed patents. Additionally, either party can terminate the Ares Agreement for the other party’s uncured material breach or bankruptcy.
 
Asset purchase agreement with Amplyx and exclusive license with Novartis
 On December 16, 2021, we entered into an asset purchase agreement (the Amplyx Agreement) with Amplyx, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pfizer.
 Pursuant to the terms of the Amplyx Agreement, we acquired all of Amplyx’s right, title and interest in and to certain assets of Amplyx related to MAU868, a monoclonal antibody that was under development by Amplyx for the treatment of BKV infections (the Purchased Assets). The Purchased Assets include an investigational new drug application filed with the U.S. Food and Drug

Administration, patents, contracts, including the Novartis License, chemical and biological materials, and development and regulatory files, documentation, data, results and other electronic records related to MAU868. We also assumed certain liabilities of Amplyx arising out of the Purchased Assets. We and Amplyx have made customary representations and warranties and agreed to customary covenants in the Amplyx Agreement. Subject to certain limitations, each of we and Amplyx has also agreed to indemnify the other for breaches of representations and warranties and other specified matters.
 In partial consideration for the Asset Acquisition, we made an upfront initial payment of $5.0 million to Amplyx. In addition, we are also obligated to make certain milestone payments to Amplyx in an aggregate amount of up to $7.0 million based on certain regulatory milestones. Further, we are required to pay Amplyx low single digit percentage royalties based on net sales on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis.
 MAU868 is subject to the Novartis License, which was assigned to us by Amplyx. Pursuant to the terms of the Novartis License, we obtained a worldwide, exclusive license from Novartis to develop, manufacture and commercialize MAU868, subject to certain retained rights for research and development by Novartis, provided that Novartis may not develop or sell products incorporating monoclonal antibody targeting BKV and treating BKV disease within a certain period. We will be solely responsible for all research, development, regulatory, manufacturing and commercialization activities of MAU868. Pursuant to the Novartis License, we are obligated to make certain milestone payments to Novartis in an aggregate amount of up to $69.0 million based on certain clinical development, regulatory and sales milestones. Further, we are required to pay Novartis mid- to high-single digit percentage royalties based on net sales on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis. Unless terminated earlier, the Novartis License will remain in effect with respect to each MAU868 product until the expiration of the royalty term for such product. We may terminate the Novartis License for convenience with 60 days’ prior written notice. We or Novartis may terminate the Novartis License for the other party’s uncured material breach. Novartis may terminate the Novartis License for our insolvency. Upon termination, any license granted by Novartis to us will terminate.
 
Intellectual property
 Our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To protect our intellectual property rights, we rely on patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, and employee disclosure and invention assignment agreements. Our intellectual property is critical to our business and we strive to protect it through a variety of approaches, including by obtaining and maintaining patent protection in the United States and internationally for our product candidate, and other inventions that are important to our business. For our product candidates, we generally intend to pursue patent protection covering compositions of matter, including new formulations, methods of making and methods of use. As we continue the development of our product candidates, we intend to identify additional means of obtaining patent protection that would potentially enhance commercial success, including through claims covering additional methods of use.
 As of December 31, 2022, we have licensed, including pursuant to sublicenses, from Ares, an affiliate of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, a patent portfolio related to atacicept that contains approximately seven issued U.S. patents, as well as certain foreign counterparts of a subset of these patents in foreign countries, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Hong Kong, Israel, India, Japan, Mexico, Singapore, South Korea, South Africa, and countries within the European Patent Convention and the Eurasian Patent Organization. The issued patents include claims covering methods of purifying atacicept, formulations and various methods of treatment, and are expected to expire between 2027 and 2029, without considering any patent term extension.
 There is also a pending U.S. application as well as certain foreign counterparts directed to treatment of IgAN and proteinuria. Patents that issue in this family are expected to expire in 2041.
Because atacicept is a biologic, marketing approval would also provide 12 years of market exclusivity from the approval date of a BLA in the United States. We are currently seeking orphan drug designation for atacicept in IgAN from the FDA and EMA, which, if secured, would provide seven and ten years, in the United States and European Union, respectively, of regulatory exclusivity protection from the approval date.
 As of December 31, 2022, our patent portfolio licensed from Novartis and covering MAU868 includes three issued U.S. patents with claims covering the composition of matter of MAU868, and methods of neutralizing BKV or JC virus as well as methods of treating or reducing the likelihood of BKV or JC virus associated disorders. The U.S. patents are expected to expire in 2036. Corresponding foreign counterparts are granted in Australia, China, Japan, Mexico, Macau and Taiwan, and pending in other jurisdictions such as Canada, Mexico, Europe, Israel and Japan. The foreign patents are expected to expire in 2036.
 In addition, an application co-owned with and licensed from Novartis that is directed to dosing regimens for MAU868 is pending as a U.S. application as well as certain foreign counterparts. Patents that issue in this family are expected to expire in 2041.
 In addition to patents, we may rely upon unpatented trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. However, trade secrets and know-how can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, by executing confidentiality agreements with our collaborators and scientific advisors, and non-solicitation, confidentiality, and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants. We have also executed agreements requiring assignment of inventions with selected scientific advisors and collaborators. The confidentiality agreements we

enter into are designed to protect our proprietary information and the agreements or clauses requiring assignment of inventions to us are designed to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through our relationship with the respective counterparty. We cannot guarantee, however, that we have executed such agreements with all applicable counterparties, such agreements will not be breached, or that these agreements will afford us adequate protection of our intellectual property and proprietary rights. For more information, see “Risk factors—Risks related to our intellectual property.”
 Furthermore, we seek trademark protection in the United States and internationally where available and when we deem appropriate.
 
Manufacturing and supply
 We manage a number of external CMOs to develop and manufacture our product candidates.
 Atacicept is a fully humanized fusion protein that impacts the B-cell pathway, which has well characterized implications in immunologic diseases. The human IgG1-Fc was modified to reduce the Fc binding to the C1q component of complement and the interaction with Fc receptors.
 Atacicept is manufactured following cGMPs using a process that is similar to that used routinely for production of monoclonal antibodies.
 The atacicept drug product is available as a ready-to-use injection solution in a prefilled syringe (PFS) at strengths of 25 mg/mL, 75 mg/mL, or 150 mg/mL of trial drug. Each atacicept PFS is designed to deliver a 1 mL solution of drug product. All formulation components are pharmacopeia grade. An atacicept prefilled syringe/autoinjector combination is in late-stage development and will be introduced into future clinical trials when appropriate.
 The Ares Agreement includes the transfer of all existing inventory of atacicept drug substance and drug product, for our use in planned and future clinical trials.
 We acquired approximately 35,000 PFS of atacicept, representing all three strengths, 25 mg, 75 mg and 150 mg, of atacicept and approximately 25,000 PFS of placebo, as part of the Ares Agreement. This drug product was used to initiate the Phase 2b ORIGIN trial. Additionally, we acquired 6 kg of atacicept drug substance which has subsequently been converted into drug product to supply both the ongoing Phase 2b ORIGIN trial and to support our future clinical trials through the first quarter of 2026.
 MAU868 is an IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds to BKV protein VP1. It is manufactured according to cGMP using a high expression CHO cell and a standard antibody manufacturing process that is completely free from animal or human derived raw materials. The MAU868 manufacturing supply chain is fully established using contract manufacturing organizations with contracts that are assignable to Vera Therapeutics
The fully formulated MAU868 drug product is provided as a 3 mL fill in a 6 mL vial which can be combined with multiple vials to prepare infusions at different dosage strengths for use in clinical trials. The drug product formulation is composed of MAU868 as the active substance, a buffering agent, and both a sugar and a surfactant as stabilizing agents.
 The Amplyx Agreement includes the transfer of all existing inventory and work-in-process of MAU868 drug product for use in clinical trials. This includes 2,777 unlabeled vials and work-in-process expected to yield approximately 5,300 vials with release targeted for March 2022. These materials will support both the completion of the ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial and initiation of a future clinical trial.
 
Commercialization plans
 
Atacicept
 We estimate the market opportunity for novel therapeutics in IgAN across the United States, Europe and Japan to be approximately $5.6 billion to $9.6 billion annually, based on our assumptions, secondary research, and primary market research with physicians and payors. In order to capitalize on this opportunity, we plan to build a specialty commercial infrastructure focused on IgAN, engaging treating physicians, including nephrologists, educating and engaging patients, and ensuring market access for patients.
 For novel therapeutics in LN, we estimate the market opportunity across the United States, Europe and Japan to be $2.8 billion to $5.8 billion annually, based on a similar methodology. If we receive regulatory approval for atacicept in both IgAN and LN, we plan to assess call point overlap for the two indications and selectively build out our future commercial infrastructure to address any gaps to optimize our coverage of LN treating physicians. We also plan to build out LN-specific patient and market access programs, leveraging synergies where possible.
 Through the Ares Agreement, we were granted worldwide rights to the development and commercialization of atacicept in all indications. We intend to commercialize atacicept ourselves in the United States and other key markets, if approved. Within certain ex-U.S. markets, we may consider strategic collaborations to facilitate commercialization.



MAU868
 We plan to develop MAU868 for the treatment of BK viremia in kidney transplant as an initial indication, which has strong commercial synergies with our plans for atacicept. We believe that the prescribing physicians for MAU868 in renal transplant, if approved, will be a subset of the IgAN treating physicians, and plan to conduct an assessment of call point overlap. The launch of this indication, if prior to the atacicept launch, would require a smaller specialty commercial infrastructure build focused on educating and engaging treating physicians, including transplant nephrologists, partnering with kidney transplant organizations, and ensuring market access for patients. If prior to the atacicept launch, we would plan to leverage this infrastructure for eventual atacicept sales and marketing activities.
 Through the Amplyx Agreement, we obtained worldwide rights to the development and commercialization of MAU868 in all indications.
 Similar to our plans with atacicept, we intend to commercialize MAU868 ourselves in the United States and other key markets, if approved.
 We also may consider strategic collaborations to facilitate commercialization in certain ex-U.S. markets.
 
Competition
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly changing technologies, significant competition and a strong emphasis on intellectual property. This is also true for the development and commercialization of treatments for immunologic diseases. Though we believe that our focus, experienced team, scientific knowledge, and intellectual property provide us with competitive advantages, we face competition from a number of sources, including large and small biopharmaceutical companies, universities, and other research institutions.
 Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we do and may be better equipped to develop, manufacture and market technologically superior products. In addition, many of these competitors have significantly greater experience than we have in undertaking nonclinical studies and human clinical trials of new pharmaceutical products and in obtaining regulatory approvals of human therapeutic products. Accordingly, our competitors may succeed in obtaining FDA approval for superior products. Many of our competitors have established distribution channels for the commercialization of their products, whereas we have no such channel or capabilities. In addition, many competitors have greater name recognition and more extensive collaborative relationships. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.
 Our competitors may obtain regulatory approval of their products more rapidly than we do or may obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that limit our ability to develop or commercialize our product candidates or any future product candidates. Our competitors may also develop drugs that are more effective, more convenient, more widely used and less costly or have a better safety profile than our products and these competitors may also be more successful than we are in manufacturing and marketing their products. If we are unable to compete effectively against these companies, then we may not be able to commercialize our product candidates or any future product candidates or achieve a competitive position in the market. This would adversely affect our ability to generate revenue. Our competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, management and commercial personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
 
Atacicept in IgAN
 Despite a high level of morbidity for IgAN, the current standard of care consists of off-label use of RAAS inhibitors, including ACE inhibitors and ARBs, and potentially steroids. Atacicept, if and when approved and successfully commercialized, may compete with these existing approaches and with any new therapies that may become available in the future. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, including AstraZeneca plc’s (AstraZeneca) Farxiga, which is approved for chronic kidney disease, is becoming the standard-of-care in some geographies including the United States. Among emerging therapies, we consider our most direct competitors with respect to atacicept in IgAN to be approved products: the reformulated steroid from Calliditas Therapeutics AB, and endothelin and angiotensin II receptor antagonist from Travere Therapeutics, Inc.; programs in Phase 3 clinical development: Visterra Inc., Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Novartis, Omeros Corporation, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc., and Chinook Therapeutics Inc.; and the following companies with programs in Phase 2 of clinical development: Chinook Therapeutics Inc., Reata Pharmaceuticals, Inc., RemeGen Co., Ltd., Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., AstraZeneca, and DiaMedica Therapeutics, Inc.

Atacicept in LN


In LN, prior to December 2020, there had been no approved therapies, and the standard-of-care has consisted of a number of non-specific therapies, including MMF, steroids, CYC, rituximab, calcineurin inhibitors, AZA, and HCQ, dependent on class of disease and whether a patient was cycling through the induction or maintenance phase of therapy. Paradigms are evolving with the FDA approvals of GlaxoSmithKline plc’s Benlysta (belimumab) and Aurinia Pharmaceuticals Inc.’s Lupkynis (voclosporin), both of which we consider to be direct competitors. Our competitors include: Roche Holding AG and Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, each of which have programs in Phase 3 clinical development; and BeiGene Ltd., Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., AstraZeneca, Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Alexion), Omeros Corporation, Kezar Life Science Inc., Bristol Myers Squibb, Boehringer, and Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, each of which have programs in Phase 2 clinical development.
 
MAU868
 There are currently no anti-BKV therapies approved, either in the kidney transplant or HSCT setting. The standard of care in both settings is to reduce immunosuppression as a first line, and potentially to offer IVIG in kidney transplant recipients or antivirals with limited clinical evidence, including leflunomide and cidofovir, in either setting. There are few industry-sponsored programs in development for these indications; we consider our most direct competitor to be Allovir’s multi-virus specific T-cell therapy, posoleucel, which is in a Phase 2 clinical trial for BK viremia in kidney transplant recipients, a Phase 3 clinical trial for treatment of virus-associated cystitis, and a Phase 2 clinical trial in multi-virus prevention following allogeneic HSCT.
 
Government regulation
 Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of drug and biological products, such as our investigational medicines and any future investigational medicines. Generally, before a new drug or biologic can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific for each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority.
 
Regulatory approval in the United States
 In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post- approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Biological products used for the prevention, treatment or cure of a disease or condition of a human being are subject to regulation under the FDCA, except the section of the FDCA that governs the approval of a new drug application (NDA). Biological products are approved, or licensed, for marketing under provisions of the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) via a BLA. The application process and requirements for approval of BLAs for originator biological products are similar to those for NDAs for new chemical entities, and biologics are associated with similar approval risks and costs as drugs. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as clinical hold, FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs or BLAs, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution.
 Our investigational medicines and any future investigational medicines must be approved by the FDA pursuant to a BLA before they may be legally marketed in the United States. The process generally involves the following:
 •completion of extensive preclinical laboratory and animal studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including studies conducted in accordance with good laboratory practices (GLP) requirements;
 •submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug Application (IND), which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
 •approval of the protocol and related documents by an IRB or independent ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each clinical trial may be commenced;
 •performance of adequate and well controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, GCP requirements and other clinical trial-related regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for each proposed indication;
 •preparation of and submission to the FDA of a BLA for marketing approval that includes sufficient evidence of establishing the safety, purity, and potency of the proposed biological product for its intended indication, including from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials;
 •payment of any user fees for FDA review of the BLA;


•a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to accept the filing for review;
 •satisfactory completion of one or more FDA pre-approval inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biologic, or components thereof, will be produced to assess compliance with current cGMP requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biologic’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
 •satisfactory completion of any potential FDA audits of the clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA to assure compliance with GCPs and integrity of the clinical data;
 •potential FDA audit of the nonclinical study and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA;
 •FDA review and approval of the BLA, including consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee; and
 •compliance with any post-approval requirements, including a REMS, where applicable, and post- approval studies required by the FDA as a condition of approval.
 The preclinical and clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, or at all.
 
Preclinical studies
 Before testing any biological product candidates in humans, the product candidate must undergo rigorous preclinical testing. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential for adverse events and in some cases to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations for safety/toxicology studies.
 Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate in the United States, an IND must be submitted to the FDA and the FDA must allow the IND to proceed. An IND is an exemption from the FDCA that allows an unapproved product candidate to be shipped in interstate commerce for use in an investigational clinical trial and a request for FDA allowance that such investigational product may be administered to humans in connection with such trial. Such authorization must be secured prior to interstate shipment and administration. In support of a request for an IND, applicants must submit a protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND sponsor must also submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some long-term preclinical testing may continue after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
 
Clinical trials
 The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the investigational product to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with GCPs, an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators and monitors; as well as (iii) under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated in the trial. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
 Furthermore, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. An IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 Some trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee (DSMB). This group provides authorization as to whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access that only the group maintains to available data from the study.
 There also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries. Information about certain clinical trials, including clinical trial results, must be submitted within specific timeframes for publication on the www.clinicaltrials.gov website. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, clinical

trial sites and investigators and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Disclosure of the results of these clinical trials can be delayed in certain circumstances for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial.
 A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside of the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of a BLA. The FDA will accept a well- designed and well-conducted foreign clinical trial not conducted under an IND if the clinical trial was conducted in accordance with GCP requirements, and the FDA is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection if deemed necessary.
 Clinical trials are generally conducted in three sequential phases, known as Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3:
 •Phase 1 clinical trials generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers or disease-affected patients who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the product candidate. The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to assess the metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacologic action, side effect tolerability, safety of the product candidate, and, if possible, early evidence of effectiveness.
 •Phase 2 clinical trials generally involve studies in disease-affected patients to evaluate proof of concept and/or determine the dosing regimen(s) for subsequent investigations. At the same time, safety and further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information is collected, possible adverse effects and safety risks are identified, and a preliminary evaluation of efficacy is conducted.
 •Phase 3 clinical trials generally involve a large number of patients at multiple sites and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of the product for its intended use, its safety in use and to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the biologic.
 These Phases may overlap or be combined. For example, a Phase 1/2 clinical trial may contain both a dose-escalation stage and a dose-expansion stage, the latter of which may confirm tolerability at the recommended dose for expansion in future clinical trials.
 A single Phase 3 or Phase 2 trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in rare instances to provide substantial evidence of effectiveness (generally subject to the requirement of additional post-approval studies).
 In some cases, FDA may require, or firms may voluntary pursue, post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, after initial marketing approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up.
 During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events, any findings from other studies, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information.
 Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3 and other types of clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including non-compliance with regulatory requirements or a finding that the patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug or biologic has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and also must develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug or biologic as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product and, among other things, companies must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the investigational medicines do not undergo unacceptable deterioration over their shelf life.
 
FDA review processes
 Following completion of the clinical trials, the results of preclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA, along with proposed labeling, chemistry and manufacturing information to ensure product quality and other relevant data. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product to the satisfaction of the FDA. FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before a biologic or drug may be marketed in the United States.


The cost of preparing and submitting a BLA is substantial. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), each BLA must be accompanied by a substantial user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication. The applicant under an approved BLA is also subject to an annual program fee.
 Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the FDA accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review to determine if it is substantially complete before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the BLA. The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe, pure and potent, for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to ensure its continued safety, purity and potency.
 Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA has 10 months, from the filing date, in which to complete its initial review of an original BLA for a new molecular entity and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date of an original BLA designated for priority review. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority BLAs, and the review process can be extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
 Before approving a BLA, the FDA will conduct a pre -approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with cGMP requirements. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications.
 The FDA also may audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements and the integrity of the data supporting safety and efficacy. Additionally, the FDA may refer applications for novel products or products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions, if any. The FDA is not bound by recommendations of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations when making decisions on approval. The FDA likely will reanalyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant during the review process.
 After the FDA evaluates a BLA, it will issue either an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the biologic with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the BLA and may require additional clinical data, additional pivotal clinical trial(s) and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing in order for FDA to reconsider the application. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application or request an opportunity for a hearing. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months, depending on the type of information included. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval.
 If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, including to subpopulations of patients, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Furthermore, as a condition of BLA approval, the FDA may require a REMS to help ensure that the benefits of the biologic outweigh the potential risks to patients. A REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals and elements to assure a product’s safe use (ETASU). An ETASU can include, but is not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing the product, dispensing the product only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patient-specific registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. Moreover, the FDA may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the product’s safety or efficacy.
 
Orphan drug designation
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States but for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product in the United States.
 Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation on its own does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.


If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same product for the same indication for seven years from the date of such approval, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity by means of greater effectiveness, greater safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care, or in instances of drug supply issues. A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. Orphan drug exclusivity may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective. Further, competitors may receive approval of either a different product for the same indication or the same product for a different indication. In the latter case, because healthcare professionals are free to prescribe products for off-label uses, the competitor’s product could be used for the orphan indication despite another product’s orphan exclusivity.
 
Expedited development and review programs
 The FDA is authorized to designate certain products for expedited review if they are intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition.
 Fast track designation may be granted for products that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition for which there is no effective treatment and preclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast track designation applies to both the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a new biologic candidate can request the FDA to designate the candidate for a specific indication for fast track status concurrent with, or after, the submission of the IND for the candidate. The FDA must determine if the biologic candidate qualifies for fast track designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request. For fast track products, sponsors may have greater interactions with the FDA and the FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast track product’s BLA before the application is complete. This “rolling review” is available if the FDA determines, after preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by the sponsor, that a fast track product may be effective. The sponsor must also provide, and the FDA must approve, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the sponsor must pay applicable user fees. Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a fast track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval.
 Breakthrough therapy designation may be granted for products that are intended, alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over currently approved therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. Under the breakthrough therapy program, the sponsor of a new biologic candidate may request that the FDA designate the candidate for a specific indication as a breakthrough therapy concurrent with, or after, the submission of the IND for the biologic candidate. The FDA must determine if the biological product qualifies for breakthrough therapy designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request. The FDA may take certain actions with respect to breakthrough therapies, including holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process, providing timely advice to the product sponsor regarding development and approval, involving more senior staff in the review process, assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the review team and taking other steps to design the clinical trials in an efficient manner.
 Priority review may be granted for products that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety and effectiveness compared to available therapies. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. Under priority review, the FDA’s goal is to review an application in six months once it is filed, compared to ten months for a standard review. Priority review designation does not change the standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval.
 Accelerated approval may be granted for products that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and that generally provide a meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments. A product eligible for accelerated approval may be approved on the basis of either a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. In clinical trials, a surrogate endpoint is a measurement of laboratory or clinical signs of a disease or condition that substitutes for a direct measurement of how a patient feels, functions or survives. The accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long, and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a product, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. Use of the accelerated approval pathway entails submission of a BLA with the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint data while continuing to conduct the trial(s) to completion and is contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to complete and/or conduct additional post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the product’s clinical benefit. These confirmatory trials must be completed with due diligence and, in some cases, the FDA may require that the trial be designed, initiated and/or fully enrolled prior to approval. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or to confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, would allow the FDA to withdraw the product from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for product candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA.


Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or the time period for FDA review or approval may not be shortened. Furthermore, fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the development or approval process.
 
Additional controls for biologics
 To help reduce the increased risk of the introduction of adventitious agents, the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing controls for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The PHSA also provides authority to the FDA to immediately suspend licenses in situations where there exists a danger to public health, to prepare or procure products in the event of shortages and critical public health needs, and to authorize the creation and enforcement of regulations to prevent the introduction or spread of communicable diseases in the United States and between states.
 After a BLA is approved, the product may also be subject to official lot release as a condition of approval. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot. The FDA may also perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products, such as viral vaccines, before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency and effectiveness of biological products. As with drugs, after approval of biologics, manufacturers must address any safety issues that arise, are subject to recalls or a halt in manufacturing, and are subject to periodic inspection after approval.
 
Combination products
 A combination product is a product comprised of two or more regulated components, e.g., drug and medical device, that are physically combined and produced as a single entity, packaged together in a single package, or packaged separately but intended to be labeled for use together. Atacicept in a prefilled autoinjector would be such a combination of therapeutic and delivery device.
 FDA is divided into various branches, or Centers, by product type. Different Centers typically review drug, biologic, or device applications. In order to review an application for a combination product, FDA must decide which Center should be responsible for the review. FDA regulations require that FDA determine the combination product’s primary mode of action, or PMOA, which is the single mode of a combination product that provides the most important therapeutic action of the combination product. The Center that regulates that portion of the product that generates the PMOA becomes the lead evaluator. If there are two independent modes of action, neither of which is subordinate to the other, FDA makes a determination as to which Center to assign the product based on consistency with other combination products raising similar types of safety and effectiveness questions or to the Center with the most expertise in evaluating the most significant safety and effectiveness questions raised by the combination product. When evaluating an application, a lead Center may consult other Centers but still retain complete reviewing authority, or it may collaborate with another Center, by which the Center assigns review of a specific section of the application to another Center, delegating its review authority for that section. Typically, FDA requires a single marketing application submitted to the Center selected to be the lead evaluator, although the agency has the discretion to require separate applications to more than one Center. We believe that our prefilled autoinjector would have a biologic PMOA.
 
Pediatric information
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA), BLAs or supplements to BLAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the biological product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the biological product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA generally does not apply to any biological product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.
 The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) provides a six-month extension of any exclusivity—patent or non-patent—for a biologic if certain conditions are met. Conditions for exclusivity include the FDA’s determination that information relating to the use of a new biologic in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population, FDA making a written request for pediatric studies, and the applicant agreeing to perform, and reporting on, the requested studies within the statutory timeframe. Applications under the BPCA are treated as priority applications, with all of the benefits that designation confers.
 
Post-approval requirements
 Once a BLA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of biologics, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the Internet. Biologics may be marketed only for the approved indications and in a manner consistent with the provisions of the approved labeling. Although

physicians may prescribe products for off-label uses as the FDA and other regulatory agencies do not regulate a physician’s choice of drug treatment made in the physician’s independent medical judgment, they do restrict promotional communications from companies or their sales force with respect to off-label uses of products for which marketing clearance has not been issued. Companies may only share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with a product’s FDA approved labeling.
 Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic safety summary reports is required following FDA approval of a BLA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, REMS, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control, biological product manufacture, packaging and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Biologic manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects a biologic product’s manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with required regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered.
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
 •restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, suspension of the approval, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
 •fines, warning or other enforcement-related letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
 •refusal of the FDA to approve pending BLAs or supplements to approved BLAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
 •product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
 •injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
 
U.S. marketing exclusivity
 The BPCIA created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed reference biological product. Biosimilarity, which requires that the biological product be highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components and that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies and a clinical trial or trials. Interchangeability requires that a biological product be biosimilar to the reference product and that the product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products administered multiple times to an individual, that the product and the reference product may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biological product without such alternation or switch.
 A reference biological product is granted 12 years of data exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the product and the FDA will not accept an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until four years after the date of first licensure of the reference product. “First licensure” typically means the initial date the particular product at issue was licensed in the United States. Date of first licensure does not include the date of licensure of (and a new period of exclusivity is not available for) a biological product if the licensure is for a supplement for the biological product or for a subsequent application by the same sponsor or manufacturer of the biological product (or licensor, predecessor in interest or other related entity) for a change (not including a modification to the structure of the biological product) that results in a new indication, route of administration, dosing schedule, dosage form, delivery system, delivery device or strength, or for a modification to the structure of the biological product that does not result in a change in safety, purity or potency.
 
Regulatory approval in the European Union
 The EMA is a decentralized scientific agency of the European Union. It coordinates the evaluation and monitoring of centrally authorized medicinal products. It is responsible for the scientific evaluation of applications for EU marketing authorizations, as well as the development of technical guidance and the provision of scientific advice to sponsors. The EMA decentralizes its scientific assessment of medicines by working through a network of about 4,500 experts throughout the European Union, nominated by the Member States. The EMA draws on resources of over 40 national competent authorities of European Union Member States.


The process regarding approval of medicinal products in the European Union follows roughly the same lines as in the United States and likewise generally involves satisfactorily completing each of the following:
 •preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies all performed in accordance with the applicable EU Good Laboratory Practice regulations;
 •submission to the relevant national competent authorities of a clinical trial application (CTA) for each trial in humans, which must be approved by such national authorities and at least one independent ethics committee before the trial may begin in each country where patient enrollment is planned;
 •performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for each proposed indication;
 •submission to the relevant competent authorities of a marketing authorization application (MAA) which includes the data supporting safety and efficacy as well as detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the product in clinical development and proposed labelling;
 •satisfactory completion of an inspection by the relevant national authorities of the manufacturing facility or facilities, including those of third parties, at which the product is produced to assess compliance with strictly enforced cGMP;
 •potential audits of the non-clinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the MAA; and
 •review and approval by the relevant competent authority of the MAA before any commercial marketing, sale or shipment of the product.
 
Preclinical studies
 Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as studies to evaluate toxicity in animal studies, in order to assess the quality and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests and formulation of the compounds for testing must comply with the relevant international, E.U. and national legislation, regulations and guidelines. The results of the preclinical tests, together with relevant manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted as part of the CTA.
 
Clinical trials
 Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 is an authorization procedure based on a single submission via a single E.U. portal, an assessment procedure leading to a single decision, as well as transparency requirements (the proactive publication of clinical trial data in the E.U. database).
 Manufacturing and import into the E.U. of investigational medicinal products for use in clinical trials is subject to the holding of appropriate authorizations and must be carried out in accordance with cGMP.
 
Review and approval
 Authorization to market a product in the European Economic Area (EEA), comprising the European Union Member States plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, proceeds under one of four procedures: a centralized authorization procedure, a mutual recognition procedure, a decentralized procedure or a national procedure. Since our products by their virtue of being antibody-based biologics fall under the centralized procedure, only this procedure will be described here.
 Certain drugs, including medicinal products developed by means of biotechnological processes, must be approved via the centralized authorization procedure for marketing authorization. The centralized procedure is also mandatory for orphan medicinal products, advanced-therapy medicinal products (i.e. gene-therapy, somatic cell -therapy or tissue-engineered medicines) and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. The centralized procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health. A successful application under the centralized authorization procedure results in a marketing authorization from the European Commission, which is automatically valid throughout the EEA. The other European Economic Area member states (namely Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein) are also obligated to recognize the European Commission decision. The EMA and the European Commission administer the centralized authorization procedure.
 Under the centralized authorization procedure, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) serves as the scientific committee that renders opinions about the safety, efficacy and quality of human medicinal products on behalf of the EMA. The CHMP is composed of experts nominated by each member state’s national drug authority, with one of them appointed to act as Rapporteur for the co-ordination of the evaluation with the possible assistance of a further member of the CHMP acting as a Co-Rapporteur. After approval, the Rapporteur(s) continue to monitor the product throughout its life cycle. The CHMP is required to issue

an opinion within 210 days of receipt of a valid application, though the clock is stopped if it is necessary to ask the applicant for clarification or further supporting data. Clock stops may extend the timeframe of evaluation of a marketing authorization application considerably beyond 210 days. The process is complex and involves extensive consultation with the regulatory authorities of Member States and a number of experts. Once the procedure is completed, a European Public Assessment Report is produced. If the CHMP concludes that the quality, safety and efficacy of the medicinal product is sufficiently proven, it adopts a positive opinion. The CHMP’s opinion is sent to the European Commission, which uses the opinion as the basis for its decision whether or not to grant a marketing authorization. The European Commission’s decision is issued within 67 days of receipt of the CHMP’s recommendation. If the opinion is negative, information is given as to the grounds on which this conclusion was reached
After a drug has been authorized and launched, it is a condition of maintaining the marketing authorization that all aspects relating to its quality, safety and efficacy must be kept under review. Sanctions may be imposed for failure to adhere to the conditions of the marketing authorization. In extreme cases, the authorization may be revoked, resulting in withdrawal of the product from sale.
 Now that the UK (which comprises Great Britain and Northern Ireland) has left the EU, Great Britain will no longer be covered by centralized MAs (under the Northern Irish Protocol, centralized MAs will continue to be recognized in Northern Ireland). All medicinal products with a current centralized MA were automatically converted to Great Britain MAs on January 1, 2021. For a period of two years from January 1, 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), the UK medicines regulator, may rely on a decision taken by the European Commission on the approval of a new marketing authorization in the centralized procedure, in order to more quickly grant a new Great Britain MA. A separate application will, however, still be required.
 
Conditional approval and accelerated assessment
 As per Article 14(7) of Regulation (EC) 726/2004, a medicine that would fulfill an unmet medical need may, if its immediate availability is in the interest of public health, be granted a conditional marketing authorization on the basis of less complete clinical data than are normally required, subject to specific obligations with defined timelines being imposed on the authorization holder. The list of these obligations shall be made publicly accessible. In order for a conditional marketing authorization to be granted, the CHMP must find that all of the following criteria are met: (i) the benefit-risk balance of the medicine is positive; (ii) it is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data post-authorization; (iii) the medicine fulfils an unmet medical need; and (iv) the benefit of the medicine’s immediate availability to patients is greater than the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. Such an authorization shall be valid for one year, on a renewable basis.
When an application is submitted for a marketing authorization in respect of a drug for human use which is of major interest from the point of view of public health and in particular from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation, the applicant may request an accelerated assessment procedure pursuant to Article 14(9) of Regulation (EC) 726/2004. Under the accelerated assessment procedure, the CHMP is required to issue an opinion within 150 days of receipt of a valid application, subject to clock stops, but it is possible that the CHMP may revert to the standard time limit for the centralized procedure if it determines that the application is no longer appropriate to conduct an accelerated assessment. We believe that some of the disease indications in which our product candidates are currently being or may be developed in the future qualify for this provision, and we will take advantage of this provision as appropriate.
 
Period of authorization and renewals
 A marketing authorization is initially valid for five years and may then be renewed on the basis of a re-evaluation of the risk-benefit balance by the EMA or by the national competent authority of the authorizing Member State (where the centralized procedure is not used). To this end, the marketing authorization holder shall provide the EMA or the competent authority with a version of the file in respect of quality, safety and efficacy, including all variants introduced since the marketing authorization was granted, at least six months before expiry of the initial five year period. Once renewed, the marketing authorization shall be valid for an unlimited period, unless the European Commission or the relevant national competent authority decides, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one additional five-year renewal. Any authorization which is not followed by the actual placing of the drug on the EEA market (if the centralized procedure is used) or on the market of the authorizing Member State (if the centralized procedure is not used) within three years after authorization shall cease to be valid (the so-called sunset clause).
 Without prejudice to the law on the protection of industrial and commercial property, marketing authorizations for innovative medicinal products benefit from an 8+2+1 year period of regulatory protection. This regime consists of a regulatory data protection period of eight years plus a concurrent market exclusivity of 10 years plus an additional market exclusivity of one further year if, during the first eight years of those 10 years, the marketing approval holder obtains an approval for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their approval, are determined to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. Under the current rules, a third party making a generic or biosimilar application may not reference the preclinical and clinical data of the reference product until the expiry of eight years after first approval of the reference product, and the third party may only market a generic or biosimilar version of the reference product after 10 (or 11) years have lapsed since the first authorization of the reference product.
 
Orphan drug designation


Regulation (EC) 141/2000 states that a drug shall be designated as an orphan drug if its sponsor can establish (i) that it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition; (ii) either such condition affects not more than five in 10,000 persons in the European Union when the application is made, or, without incentives, it is unlikely that the marketing of the drug in the European Union would generate sufficient return to justify the necessary investment in its development; and (iii) that there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition in question that has been authorized in the European Union or, if such method exists, the drug will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition.
 Regulation (EC) 847/2000 sets out provisions for the implementation of the criteria for the designation of orphan drugs. An application for designation as an orphan product can be made any time prior to the filing of an application for approval to market the product. Marketing authorization for an orphan drug leads to a 10-year period of market exclusivity, which means that no similar medicinal product can be authorized in the same indication. A “similar medicinal product” is defined as a medicinal product containing a similar active substance or substances as contained in an authorized orphan medicinal product, and which is intended for the same therapeutic indication. This period may, however, be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan drug designation, for example because the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify continued market exclusivity. In addition, derogation from market exclusivity may be granted on an individual basis in very select cases, such as with consent from the marketing authorization holder, inability to supply sufficient quantities of the authorized product or demonstration of “clinically relevant superiority” by a similar medicinal product. Medicinal products designated as orphan drugs pursuant to Regulation (EC) 141/2000 are eligible for incentives made available by the European Union and by the Member States to support research into, and the development and availability of, orphan drugs.
 If the MAA of a medicinal product designated as an orphan drug pursuant to Regulation (EC) 141/2000 includes the results of all studies conducted in compliance with an agreed pediatric investigation plan, and a corresponding statement is subsequently included in the marketing authorization granted, the 10-year period of market exclusivity will be extended to 12 years.
 
European and United Kingdom data collection and processing
The collection, receipt, storage, generation, transfer, access, protection, securing, disposal, transmittal, sharing, use, disclosure and other processing (commonly referred to as processing) of health-related and other personal information about clinical trials participants and other individuals in Europe is governed by the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR and in the UK, is governed by the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 and the UK Data Protection Act 2018 (UK GDPR)). The GDPR and UK GDPR require companies to, among other things, give detailed disclosures about how they are processing personal information; ensure any consents relied on to process personal information (including special categories of personal information, such as health information) meet the stricter GDPR requirements; contractually impose data protection measures on vendors entrusted with personal information; maintain adequate data security measures; notify regulators and affected individuals of certain data breaches; meet extensive privacy governance and documentation requirements; honor individuals’ data protection rights, including their rights to access, correct and delete their personal information; and refrain from transferring personal information from Europe or the UK to most other countries unless specific safeguards can be implemented. Companies that violate the GDPR or UK GDPR can face private litigation, prohibitions on data processing and heavy fines. Complying with the GDPR and UK GDPR may be costly and require us to limit our activities in Europe. If our efforts to comply are not successful, we may face litigation, reputational harm, significant penalties and other liabilities.
 
Marketing
 Much like the Anti-Kickback Statute prohibition in the United States, as described below, the provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order or use of medicinal products is also prohibited in the E.U. The provision of benefits or advantages to induce or reward improper performance generally is governed by the national anti-bribery laws of European Union member states and the Bribery Act 2010 in the UK. Infringement of these laws could result in substantial fines and imprisonment. EU Directive 2001/83/EC, which is the EU Directive governing medicinal products for human use, further provides that, where medicinal products are being promoted to persons qualified to prescribe or supply them, no gifts, pecuniary advantages or benefits in kind may be supplied, offered or promised to such persons unless they are inexpensive and relevant to the practice of medicine or pharmacy. This provision has been transposed into the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 and so remains applicable in the UK despite its departure from the EU.
 Payments made to physicians in certain European Union member states must be publicly disclosed. Moreover, agreements with physicians often must be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician’s employer, his or her competent professional organization and/or the regulatory authorities of the individual European Union member states. These requirements are provided in the national laws, industry codes or professional codes of conduct, applicable in the European Union member states. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk, public reprimands, administrative penalties, fines or imprisonment.
 
Brexit and the regulatory framework in the United Kingdom
 In June 2016, the electorate in the UK voted in favor of leaving the EU (commonly referred to as Brexit). Thereafter, in March 2017, the country formally notified the EU of its intention to withdraw pursuant to Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty and the UK formally

left the EU on January 31, 2020. A transition period began on February 1, 2020, during which EU pharmaceutical law remained applicable to the UK, which ended on December 31, 2020. Since the regulatory framework in the UK covering the quality, safety and efficacy of medicinal products, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of medicinal products is derived from EU Directives and Regulations, Brexit could materially impact the future regulatory regime which applies to products and the approval of product candidates in the UK, as UK legislation now has the potential to diverge from EU legislation. It remains to be seen how Brexit will impact regulatory requirements for product candidates and products in the UK in the long-term. The MHRA, the UK medicines and medical devices regulator, has recently published detailed guidance for industry and organizations to follow from January 1, 2021 now the transition period is over, which will be updated as the UK’s regulatory position on medicinal products evolves over time.
 
International regulation
 In addition to regulations in the United States and Europe, a variety of foreign regulations govern clinical trials, commercial sales and distribution of product candidates. The approval process varies from country to country and the time to approval may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA or European Commission approval.
 
Other healthcare laws and regulations and legislative reform
 
Healthcare laws and regulations
 Healthcare providers and third-party payors will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Our operations, including any arrangements with healthcare providers, third-party payors and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws that may affect the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we conduct research and would market, sell and distribute our products. The healthcare laws that may affect our ability to operate include, but are not limited to:
 •The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute has also been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other hand. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, but the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and require strict compliance in order to offer protection. Additionally, the intent standard under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, Affordable Care Act), to a stricter standard such that a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Further, the Affordable Care Act codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act.
 •Federal civil and criminal false claims laws, such as the False Claims Act, which can be enforced by private citizens through civil qui tam actions, and civil monetary penalty laws prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false, fictitious or fraudulent claims for payment of federal funds, and knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. For example, pharmaceutical companies have been prosecuted under the False Claims Act in connection with their alleged off-label promotion of drugs, purportedly concealing price concessions in the pricing information submitted to the government for government price reporting purposes, and allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal healthcare programs for the product. In addition, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act. As a result of a modification made by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. In addition, manufacturers can be held liable under the False Claims Act even when they do not submit claims directly to government payors if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims.
 •The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), among other things, imposes criminal liability for executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and creates federal criminal laws that prohibit knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or 


representation, or making or using any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
 •HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (HITECH), and their implementing regulations, which impose privacy, security and data breach reporting obligations with respect to individually identifiable health information upon entities subject to the law, such as health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and certain healthcare providers, known as covered entities, and their respective business associates and subcontractors that perform services for them that involve individually identifiable health information. HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in U.S. federal courts to enforce HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.
 •Federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers.
 •The federal transparency requirements under the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, created under the Affordable Care Act, which requires, among other things, certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies reimbursed under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) information related to payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), other health care professionals (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners) and teaching hospitals, as well as information regarding ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
 •State and foreign laws that are analogous to each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws, that may impose similar or more prohibitive restrictions, and may apply to items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers.
 •State and foreign laws that require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs, comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or to track and report gifts, compensation and other remuneration provided to physicians and other healthcare providers; state laws that require the reporting of marketing expenditures or drug pricing, including information pertaining to and justifying price increases; state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives; state laws that prohibit various marketing-related activities, such as the provision of certain kinds of gifts or meals; state laws that require the posting of information relating to clinical trials and their outcomes; and other federal, state and foreign laws that govern the privacy and security of health information or personal information in certain circumstances, including state health information privacy and data breach notification laws which govern the processing of health-related and other personal information, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not pre-empted by HIPAA, thus requiring additional compliance efforts.
 If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other current or future healthcare laws that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could substantially disrupt our operations. Although effective compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, these risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Any action against us for an alleged or suspected violation could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and could divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business, even if our defense is successful. In addition, if any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found not to be in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to significant criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs.
 
Legislative reform
 We operate in a highly regulated industry, and new laws, regulations and judicial decisions, or new interpretations of existing laws, regulations and decisions, related to healthcare availability, the method of delivery and payment for healthcare products and services could negatively affect our business, financial condition and prospects. There is significant interest in promoting healthcare reforms, and it is likely that federal and state legislatures within the United States and the governments of other countries will continue to consider changes to existing healthcare legislation.
 For example, the United States and state governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reduce the cost of healthcare. In 2010, the U.S. Congress enacted the Affordable Care Act, which included changes to the coverage and reimbursement of drug products under government healthcare programs such as:


•increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program;
 •established a branded prescription drug fee that pharmaceutical manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs must pay to the federal government;
 •expanded the list of covered entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program by adding new entities to the program;
 •established a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must now agree to offer 70% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;
 •extended manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;
 •expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability;
 •created a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for certain drugs and biologics, including our product candidates, that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;
 •established a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research;
 •established a Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation at the CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending; and
 •created a licensure framework for follow-on biologic products.
 There have been executive, judicial and congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act as well as efforts to repeal or replace certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. For example, on June 17, 2021 the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress. Prior to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order that initiated a special enrollment period for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the Affordable Care Act marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the Affordable Care Act. In addition, on August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the IRA) into law, which among other things, extends enhanced subsidies for individuals purchasing health insurance coverage in ACA marketplaces through plan year 2025. The IRA also eliminates the “donut hole” under the Medicare Part D program beginning in 2025 by significantly lowering the beneficiary maximum out-of-pocket cost and creating a new manufacturer discount program. It is possible that the Affordable Care Act will be subject to judicial or Congressional challenges in the future. It is unclear how such challenges and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the Affordable Care Act.
 In addition, there have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the United States federal and state levels that seek to reduce healthcare costs. In 2011, the U.S. Congress enacted the Budget Control Act, which included provisions intended to reduce the federal deficit. The Budget Control Act resulted in the imposition of 2% reductions in Medicare payments to providers beginning in 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, including the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, will remain in effect through 2031, absent additional congressional action. Under current legislation the actual reduction in Medicare payments will vary from 1% in 2022 to up to 4% in the final fiscal year of this sequester. Additionally, on March 11, 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 into law, which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100% of a drug’s average manufacturer price, for single source and innovator multiple source drugs, beginning January 1, 2024. If government spending is further reduced, anticipated budgetary shortfalls may also impact the ability of relevant agencies, such as the FDA, to continue to function at current levels, which may impact the ability of relevant agencies to timely review and approve research and development, manufacturing and marketing activities, which may delay our ability to develop, market and sell any product candidates we may develop. In addition, any significant spending reductions affecting Medicare, Medicaid or other publicly funded or subsidized health programs that may be implemented, or any significant taxes or fees that may be imposed on us, as part of any broader deficit reduction effort or legislative replacement to the Budget Control Act, could have an adverse impact on our anticipated product revenues.
 Furthermore, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several congressional inquiries and proposed legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient assistance programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. At the federal level, in July 2021, the Biden administration

released an executive order, “Promoting Competition in the American Economy,” with multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to Biden’s executive order, on September 9, 2021, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform and sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue as well as potential administrative actions HHS can take to advance these principles. In addition, the IRA, among other things, (i) directs HHS to negotiate the price of certain high-expenditure, single-source drugs and biologics covered under Medicare, and subject drug manufacturers to civil monetary penalties and a potential excise tax by offering a price that is not equal to or less than the negotiated “maximum fair price” for such drugs and biologics under the law, and (ii) imposes rebates with respect to certain drugs and biologics covered under Medicare Part B or Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation. The IRA permits HHS to implement many of these provisions through guidance, as opposed to regulation, for the initial years. These provisions will take effect progressively starting in fiscal year 2023, although they may be subject to legal challenges. It is currently unclear how the IRA will be implemented but is likely to have a significant impact on the pharmaceutical industry. Further, the Biden administration released an additional executive order on October 14, 2022, directing HHS to submit a report on how the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation can be further leveraged to test new models for lowering drug costs for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. It is unclear whether this executive order or similar policy initiatives will be implemented in the future. Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare programs. It is difficult to predict the future legislative landscape in healthcare and the effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. However, we expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, particularly in light of the new presidential administration.
 
Environmental, health and safety laws and regulations
 We and our third-party contractors are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the use, generation, manufacture, distribution, storage, handling, treatment, remediation and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. Hazardous chemicals, including flammable and biological materials, are involved in certain aspects of our business, and we cannot eliminate the risk of injury or contamination from the use, generation, manufacture, distribution, storage, handling, treatment or disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. In particular, our product candidates use PBDs, which are highly potent cytotoxins that require special handling by our and our contractors’ staff. In the event of contamination or injury, or failure to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, fines and penalties associated with such liability could exceed our assets and resources. Environmental, health and safety laws and regulations are becoming increasingly more stringent. We may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations.
 
Pharmaceutical coverage, pricing and reimbursement
 The availability and extent of coverage and adequate reimbursement by governmental and private third-party payors are essential for most patients to be able to afford expensive medical treatments. In both domestic and foreign markets, sales of our product candidates will depend substantially on the extent to which the costs of our product candidates will be covered by third- party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. These third-party payors decide which products will be covered and establish reimbursement levels for those products.
 Coverage and reimbursement by a third-party payor may depend upon a number of factors, including the third-party payor’s determination that use of a product is:
 • a covered benefit under its health plan;
 •safe, effective and medically necessary;
 •appropriate for the specific patient;
 •cost-effective; and
 •neither experimental nor investigational.
 Obtaining coverage approval and reimbursement for a product from a government or other third-party payor is a time-consuming and costly process that could require us to provide supporting scientific, clinical and cost- effectiveness data for the use of our products to the payor. We may not be able to provide data sufficient to gain acceptance with respect to coverage and reimbursement at a satisfactory level. If coverage and adequate reimbursement of our future products, if any, are unavailable or limited in scope or amount, such as may result where alternative or generic treatments are available, we may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability. Adverse

coverage and reimbursement limitations may hinder our ability to recoup our investment in our product candidates, even if such product candidates obtain regulatory approval.
 There is significant uncertainty related to the insurance coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products. There is no uniform policy for coverage and reimbursement in the United States and, as a result, coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor. In the United States, the principal decisions about reimbursement for new medicines are typically made by the CMS, which decides whether and to what extent a new medicine will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare. Private payors often, but not always, follow the CMS’s decisions regarding coverage and reimbursement. It is difficult to predict what third-party payors will decide with respect to coverage and reimbursement for fundamentally novel products such as ours, as there is no body of established practices and precedents for these new products. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage and adequate reimbursement for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage and adequate reimbursement for that product. We may need to conduct expensive pharmaco-economic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our product candidates. There can be no assurance that our product candidates will be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. Therefore, it is possible that any of our product candidates, even if approved, may not be covered by third-party payors or the reimbursement limit may be so restrictive that we cannot commercialize the product candidates profitably.
 Reimbursement agencies in Europe may be more restrictive than payors in the United States. In Europe, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. For example, some countries provide that products may be marketed only after an agreement on reimbursement price has been reached. Such pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after receipt of marketing approval for a product. Political, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Other countries require the completion of additional health technology assessments that compare the cost- effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. In addition, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. European Union member states may approve a specific price for a product, may adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the product on the market or monitor and control prescription volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Reference pricing used by various European Union member states and parallel distribution, or arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced member states, can further reduce prices. Furthermore, many countries in the European Union have increased the amount of discounts required on pharmaceutical products, and these efforts could continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures, especially in light of the severe fiscal and debt crises experienced by many countries in the European Union. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, and prescription products in particular, has become increasingly intense. As a result, there are increasingly higher barriers to entry for new products. There can be no assurance that any country that has reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products, if approved in those countries. Accordingly, the reimbursement for any products in Europe may be reduced compared with the United States and may be insufficient to generate commercially reasonable revenues and profits.
 Furthermore, the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of foreign and domestic governments as well as private third-party payors. The prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Governments and private third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications, which could affect our ability to sell our product candidates profitably. We also expect to experience pricing pressures due to the trend towards managed healthcare, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations and additional legislative changes. These and other cost-control initiatives could cause us to decrease the price we might establish for products, which could result in lower-than-anticipated product revenues. In addition, the publication of discounts by third-party payors or authorities may lead to further pressure on the prices or reimbursement levels within the country of publication and other countries. If pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels or if coverage and adequate reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, our revenues and the potential profitability of our product candidates in those countries would be negatively affected.
 
Employees and human capital resources
 As of December 31, 2022, we had a total of 46 full-time employees. We employ physicians, professionals in research and development, clinical, regulatory, manufacturing, marketing, finance and legal and other functions that are important to our business. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements. We use temporary workers such as consultants and advisors in certain instances when we think it is in the best interests of our business.
 Attracting, developing, and retaining highly qualified individuals are key to our success. To do so, we believe we offer competitive compensation packages—inclusive of base salary, bonus, and equity, and benefits. We also sought to establish a values-based culture centered around our core values of collaboration, accountability, and empathy for patients to enhance the working environment for our current employees and to attract our desired candidates.
 
Facilities


We are occupying 9,885 square feet of office space at 8000 Marina Boulevard in Brisbane, California though November 2024. We also have leased 24,606 square feet of office and lab space at 170 Harbor Way in South San Francisco, California. This space is currently subleased through the term of the lease, ending September 2025.
 
Legal proceedings
 From time to time, we may become involved in legal proceedings or be subject to claims arising in the ordinary course of our business. We are not currently a party to any material legal proceedings. Regardless of outcome, such proceedings or claims can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of resources and other factors, and there can be no assurances that favorable outcomes will be obtained.
