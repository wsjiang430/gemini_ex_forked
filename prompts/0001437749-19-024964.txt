Services
 
Revenue from Digital Engagement Services
 
Revenue from all digital engagement services is reported as digital engagement services in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
 
Digital Engagement Services
 
Digital engagement services address specific customer needs such as digital strategy, web design and web development, usability engineering, information architecture, and Search Engine Optimization (SEO) for their mission critical web site, intranet or online store. Application development engagements are often sold as part of a multiple element arrangement that includes our software products, hosting arrangements (i.e. Managed Service Hosting) that provide for the use of certain hardware and infrastructure through our partnership with Amazon Web Services, or retained professional services subsequent to completion of the application development.
Digital Strategy Services
 
Bridgeline helps customers maximize the effectiveness of their online marketing activities to ensure that their web applications can be exposed to the potential customers that use search engines to locate products and services. Bridgeline’s SEO services include competitive analysis, website review, keyword generation, proprietary leading page technology, ongoing registration, monthly reports, and monitoring. Bridgeline’s web analytics experts offer consulting and assistance in implementing Bridgeline Unbound Insights or any other type of web analytics package.
Usability Design
 
By integrating usability into traditional development life cycles, we believe our usability experts can significantly enhance a user’s experience. Our usability professionals provide the following services: usability audits, information architecture, process analysis and optimization, interface design and user testing. Our systematic and user-centered approach to application development focuses on developing applications that are intuitive, accessible, engaging, and effective. Our goal is to produce a net effect of increased traffic, improved visitor retention, increased user productivity, reduced user error, lower support cost, and reduced long-term development cost.
Information Architecture
 
Information Architecture is a design methodology focused on structuring information to ensure that users can find the appropriate data and can complete their desired transactions within a website or application. Understanding users and the context in which users will be initiating with a web application is central to information architecture. Information architects try to put themselves in the position of a typical user of an application to better understand a user’s characteristics, behaviors, intentions and motivations. At the same time, the information architect develops an understanding of a web application’s functionality and data structures. The understanding of these components enables the architect to make customer centric decisions about the end user and then translate those decisions into site maps, wire frames and clickable prototypes.
 
Information architecture forms the foundation of a web application’s usability. The extent to which a web application is user-friendly and is widely adopted by a user base is primarily dependent on the success of the information architecture. Information architecture defines how well users can navigate through a website or application and how easily they can find the desired information or function. As digital engagement becomes more standard and commoditized, information architecture will increase as a differentiator for application developers.

Competition
 
The markets for our products and services, including software for web content management, eCommerce platform software, eMarketing software, web analytics software and digital engagement services are highly competitive, fragmented, and rapidly changing. Barriers to entry in such markets remain relatively low. The markets are significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants. With the introduction of new technologies and market entrants, we expect competition to persist and intensify in the future.
 
We believe we compete adequately with others and we distinguish ourselves from our competitors in a number of ways, including:
 

● | We believe our competitors generally offer their web application software typically as a single point of entry type product (such as content management only, or commerce only) as compared to the deeply integrated approach as provided by the Bridgeline Unbound platform.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We believe our competitors can generally only deploy their solutions in either a Cloud/SaaS environment or in a dedicated server environment. The Bridgeline Unbound platform’s architecture is flexible and is capable of being deployed in either a Cloud/SaaS or dedicated server environment.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We believe the majority of our competitors do not provide interactive technology development services that complement their software products. Our ability to develop mission critical web sites and online stores on our own deeply integrated Bridgeline Unbound platform provides a quality end-to-end solution that distinguishes us from our competitors.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We believe the interface of the Bridgeline Unbound platform has been designed for ease of use without substantial technical skills.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Finally, we believe the Bridgeline Unbound platform offers a competitive price-to-functionality ratio when compared to our competitors.
