ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Description of the Business of Acquired Sales Corp.
 
Acquired Sales Corp. (hereinafter sometimes referred to as “Acquired Sales”, the “Company”, “AQSP”, “Acquired”, the “Company”, “we”, “us”, “our”, etc.) was organized under the laws of the State of Nevada on January 2, 1986. 
 
The Company currently is a shell corporation and does not currently have any business or any sources of revenue.
 
The Company wants to acquire all or a portion of one or more operating businesses. 
 
Management of the Company currently is exclusively exploring potential acquisitions of all or a portion of one or more operating businesses involving the manufacture and sale of cannabidiol (CBD)-infused products such as beverages, muscle/joint rubs, oils, crystals, tinctures, bath bombs, isolate, relief balms, elixirs, body washes, med sticks, lotions, vape pens and cartridges, shatter, and gummies (a “CBD-Infused Products Company”). 
 
In order to consummate a particular acquisition of a CBD-Infused Products Company, management of the Company is open-minded to the concept of also acquiring all or a portion of one or more operating businesses and/or assets that are related to such CBD-Infused Products Company, for example operating businesses and/or assets involving distilled spirits, beer, wine, hemp, paraphernalia, cannabis, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)-infused products, and real estate.

Execution of Stock Purchase Agreement to Purchase up to 19.99% of CBD-Infused Beverage Maker Ablis, and of Craft Distillers Bendistillery and Bend Spirits
 
On February 27, 2019, the Company signed a Stock Purchase Agreement to purchase up to 19.99% of the common stock of CBD-infused beverage maker Ablis Inc. (formerly Ablis LLC) (www.AblisBev.com), and of craft distillers Bendistillery Inc. d/b/a Crater Lake Spirits (www.CraterLakeSpirits.com) and Bend Spirits, Inc. (www.Bendistillery.com), Bend, Oregon, for a total of $7,596,200 in cash.
 
Founded in 1996, Bendistillery is America's most award winning craft distillery, with an outstanding reputation for producing Crater Lake Spirits brands including vodkas, gins, whiskeys, and white label brands offered through Bend Spirits. 
 
Ablis is a rapidly growing leader in the exciting CBD-infused beverage industry. Ablis' all-natural, shelf-stable, GMO-free, non-alcoholic, lemon ginger, cranberry blood orange, and 0 calorie lemon water beverages target the mainstream health market and contain no THC. Ablis also manufactures and sells CBD-infused rubs, oils and crystals. Ablis' beverages are now being distributed in 11 states, online throughout the country, Puerto Rico and Guam. Also, Ablis has recently received state approval to co-brand with a local brewery in Bend to produce Oregon's first hemp CBD-infused draft beer. 
 
Closing of the purchase is subject to a number of conditions, including the completion of mutually acceptable due diligence, completion of a capital raise, execution of definitive documentation, obtaining necessary third party approvals, and completion of all necessary securities filings.
 
The Company expects to close the purchase in tranches, starting with a first tranche purchase of 4.99% of the common stock of each of Ablis, Bendistillery and Bend Spirits for an aggregate purchase price of $1,896,200. The Company has raised sufficient capital through the sale of convertible preferred stock to allow the Company to close this first tranche purchase, and this first tranche purchase is expected to close during March 2019. 
 
Following the expected closing of this first tranche purchase of 4.99% of the common stock of each of Ablis, Bendistillery and Bend Spirits, the Company desires to purchase up to an additional 15% of the common stock of each of Ablis, Bendistillery and Bend Spirits under the Stock Purchase Agreement, but doing so will only be possible if the Company closes on the sale of additional preferred stock or otherwise raises capital, and receives approval to do so from the Oregon Liquor Control Commission. 
 
The stock purchase will make capital available for expanded off-line and online advertising, additional staff and equipment, and repayment of debt, for Bendistillery, Bend Spirits, and Ablis. 
 
The management teams of Ablis, Bendistillery and Bend Spirits will continue to lead their respective companies following the closing of the transaction. Gerard M. Jacobs, CEO of the Company, will join the board of directors of each of the companies, and William C. Jacobs, CFO of the Company, will be paid quarterly by the companies in regard to financial oversight of the

companies.
 
Acquisition Process
 
The structure of our participation in business opportunities and ventures will continue to be situational. We are likely to structure future acquisitions as a purchase of 19.99% or less, or 50.01% or more, of a target company’s equity ownership interest, or as a merger. It is likely that the anticipated value of the business and/or securities that we acquire relative to the current value of our securities will result in the issuance of a relatively large number of newly issued shares of the Company, and, as a result, substantial additional dilution to the percentage ownership of our current stockholders. Moreover, our present management and shareholders may not have control of a majority of our voting shares following a merger or purchase of stock. It is possible that the shareholders of the acquired entity or the persons who provide the capital to us to finance a merger or purchase of stock will gain control of our voting stock and our directors may resign and new directors may be appointed without any vote by the shareholders. Those directors are entitled to replace our officers without stockholder vote.
 
In regard to nearly all of our potential acquisitions, we are typically focused upon acquiring 19.99% or less, or 50.01% or more, of existing privately held businesses whose owners are willing to consider selling a percentage of the equity ownership interest of their businesses, or merging their entire businesses into our Company, and whose management teams are enthusiastic about continuing to operate their businesses following the transactions with us. 
 
Closing such purchases of stock or mergers will likely require us to raise millions of dollars of capital, in order to pay the cash portion of the transaction consideration. We can provide no assurance or guaranty whatsoever that we will be able to raise such millions of dollars of capital on acceptable terms and conditions, if at all. 
 
An Investment Committee appointed by our Board of Directors, currently consisting of our CEO Gerard M. Jacobs, director Thomas W. Hines, CPA CFA, and our CFO William C. Jacobs, CPA, will review material furnished to it and will ultimately decide if a transaction is in our best interests and the interests of our shareholders. We intend to source acquisition opportunities through our Chief Executive Officer and directors and their contacts, and in some cases through finders. These contacts include the shareholders of Ablis, professional advisors such as attorneys and accountants, securities broker dealers, venture capitalists, members of the financial community, other businesses and others who may present solicited and unsolicited proposals. Management believes that business opportunities may become available to us due to a number of factors, including, among others: (1) Our ownership of shares in one or more CBD-Infused Products Companies; (2) management’s historical experience building large public companies; (3) management’s contacts and acquaintances; and (4) our flexibility with respect to the manner in which we may be able to structure, finance, merge with or acquire any business opportunity.
 
The analysis of new business opportunities will be undertaken by or under the supervision of an Investment Committee appointed by our Board of Directors. Inasmuch as we will have limited funds available to search for business opportunities, and we will not be able to expend significant funds on a complete and exhaustive investigation of such business or opportunity. We will, however, investigate, to the extent believed reasonable by such Investment Committee, such potential business opportunities by conducting a so-called “due diligence investigation”.
 
In a due diligence investigation, we intend to obtain and review materials regarding the business opportunity. Typically, such materials will include information regarding a target business’ products, services, contracts, management, ownership, and financial information. In addition, we intend to cause our Investment Committee to meet personally with management and key personnel of target businesses, ask questions regarding the target businesses’ prospects, tour facilities, and conduct other reasonable investigation of the target businesses to the extent of our limited financial resources and management and technical expertise.
 
There is no guarantee that we can obtain or maintain the funding needed for our operations, including the funds necessary to search for and investigate acquisition candidates, and to close an acquisition including paying the substantial costs of legal, accounting and other relevant professional services.
 
As of March 4, 2019, we have cash on hand of $2,340,936, which are proceeds from the sale of preferred stock of the Company on February 27, 2019. In prior years, our payables have been greater than our cash on hand. We have inconsistent income generating ability and are therefore reliant on raising money from loans or stock sales.
 
Offices
 
Our corporate headquarters are located at 31 N. Suffolk Lane, Lake Forest, Illinois 60045. We currently do not have a dedicated corporate office for our Company. There are no agreements or understandings with respect to any office facility subsequent to the completion of an acquisition. We may relocate our corporate headquarters in connection with a change in the management of our Company, or in connection with the completion of a merger or acquisition.

Employees
 
Our Chief Executive Officer, Gerard M. Jacobs, runs our operations on a part-time basis and is compensated with equity; see Item 11 “Executive Compensation”. Mr. Gerard M. Jacobs has not historically received cash compensation, but is expected to receive cash salary and bonuses in the future, which cash salary and bonuses may serve as compensation to him for successfully introducing the Company to acquisition candidates. Such compensation for successfully introducing the Company to acquisition candidates is expected to include cash, salary and bonuses of up to 10% of the purchase price of closed acquisition transactions. Our President and Chief Financial Officer, William C. Jacobs, CPA, who is the son of our Chief Executive Officer, Gerard M. Jacobs, handles our financial matters on a part-time basis and is currently compensated at the rate of $5,000 per month, but is expected to receive a larger cash salary and bonuses in the future. Both Gerard M. Jacobs and William C. Jacobs are entitled to reimbursement for all of their business related expenses. We currently have no full-time employees.
    In the future, we may engage full-time employees with full-time salaries, bonuses and benefits appropriate to the nature and scope of our future business operations. We expect to continue to use consultants, attorneys, accountants and independent contractors as necessary. Such consultants may include director Thomas W. Hines, CPA CFA, who is a member of our Investment Committee.
