ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
Historical Development 
 
On February 27, 1996, PCT LTD, formerly known as Bingham Canyon Corporation (“PCT LTD”) was incorporated in the State of Delaware as Hystar Aerospace Marketing Corporation of Delaware (“Hystar-Delaware”) and was a subsidiary of Nautilus Entertainment, Inc., (now called VIP Worldnet, Inc.), a Nevada corporation. Hystar-Delaware completed a change of domicile merger on August 26, 1999 with then named Bingham Canyon Corporation, now named PCT LTD, a Nevada corporation.
 
On August 31, 2016, Bingham (PCT LTD) entered into a Securities Exchange Agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) with Paradigm Convergence Technologies Corporation, a Nevada corporation (“PCT Corp.”). Pursuant to the terms of the Exchange Agreement, PCT Corp. became the wholly-owned subsidiary of PCT LTD after the exchange transaction. PCT LTD is a holding company which, through PCT Corp., is engaged in the business of marketing new products and technologies through licensing and joint ventures.
 
PCT Corp. is located in Little River, SC and was formed June 6, 2012 under the name of EUR-ECA, Ltd. PCT Corp. specializes in environmentally safe solutions for global sustainability. The company holds patents, intellectual property and/or distribution rights to innovative products and technologies. PCT Corp. provides innovative products and technologies for eliminating biocidal contamination from water supplies, industrial fluids, hard surfaces, food processing equipment, and medical devices. PCT Corp.’s overall strategy is to market new products and technologies through the use of equipment leasing, joint ventures, licensing, distributor agreements and partnerships. On September 11, 2015, its Board of Directors authorized EUR-ECA Ltd to file with the Nevada Secretary of State to change the Eur-Eca Ltd. name to Paradigm Convergence Technologies Corp. (“Paradigm” or PCT Corp.”)
 
Business Strategy
 
PCT LTD’s wholly-owned operating subsidiary, PCT Corp., is a technology development, design, and manufacturing company specializing in providing cleaning/sanitizing/disinfectant equipment that creates environmentally safe solutions for global sustainability. PCT Corp. markets new products and technologies for the Healthcare, Agriculture, and Oil & Gas industries through multi-year system and service contracts that provide equipment and support for our customers.
 
The Company holds patents, trademarks, intellectual property and distribution rights to our innovative products and technologies. While a direct-sales capability is in place and will be expanded, it is not PCT Corp.’s intent to be the sole distributor of our technology products. In addition to the direct sales program, senior management is responsible for continuing to develop the distribution and licensing program operations for the technology; to develop new opportunities and applications for the products, and to promote the brands. Paradigm’s senior management intends to also continue the pursuit of new technologies – particularly technologies which are complementary to or enhance applications opportunities for its existing products - upon which it will build and expand its business.
 
Paradigm has developed several commercially-ready product generator systems for Hydrolyte®, an EPA registered, highly effective sanitizer/disinfectant microbiocide that is safe and non-toxic for use around humans and animals. Hydrolyte® has been market tested with commercial customers is ready for and is involved in the initial stage of full-scale commercial launch. Management intends to focus on leveraging the opportunities presented by Hydrolyte® in the short term and is in the first stage of a full commercial launch, commencing now, in the first half of 2018.
 
Paradigm’s revenue stream is expected to be derived primarily from service contracts and equipment leasing and sales as well as licensing and distributor agreements. In the 2017 “soft” launch, management focused on establishing distributor operations and direct sales in addition to expanding its production capabilities. Initially, direct sales are being managed by members of the senior management team. Subsequently, direct sales may be conducted by a subsidiary company(s) with existing customer relationships and targeted marketing and sales operations. Paradigm has finalized agreements with four distributors and is in negotiations with three additional distributors who are preparing to undertake commercial operations in their respective regional markets. The existing distributors are based in New Jersey/New York, North Carolina, Ohio, and Florida. Management expects to add more distributors throughout the year and in in negotiations with several potential distributors for certain market segments including regional markets in the southeastern portion of the U.S., Texas, mid-Atlantic region and the Caribbean.
 
In building out its production capabilities, Paradigm has developed strategic operating relationships with firms that are leaders in production, manufacturing, and distributions within the various industries where the markets for our technologies exist. Management believes that this strategy, properly executed, should allow for the most rapid possible rollout of the products and solid capture of market share.

Principal Technology: Hydrolyte® and Catholyte
 
Paradigm’s generator systems make two products in the cleansers, sanitizers and disinfectants category:
 
• | Hydrolyte®, the highly effective sanitizer / disinfectant with the lowest EPA toxicity rating possible (4); and, 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Catholyte, a similarly safe and non-toxic mild detergent, degreaser and surfactant that is easily applied using mop buckets, sprayers and floor cleaning machines for basic janitorial cleaning purposes. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Both products are outputs of a single generation production process using Paradigm’s technology. Commercially, the primary product is Hydrolyte® and the second product of the process, Catholyte, is a very useful and effective product for which parallel markets exist and profitable revenue streams can be developed. Both products are generated using a single process of electrochemical activation (“ECA”) of the input ingredients derived from naturally-occurring salt minerals and water. 
 
The company has two registrations of Hydrolyte® with the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) as a microbial biocide and the company is in the process of completing a third. Hypochlorous acid solutions such as Hydrolyte® are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for cleaning and sanitizing applications and by the United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) for use in food processing. 
 
Hydrolyte® is a metastable, aqueous solution of hypochlorous acid, generated through the electrochemical process. It has a high redox potential (900 millivolts) and a greater biocidal effect than chlorine and other toxic chemicals. Hydrolyte® is 99.5% water + salt, rendering it safe and non-toxic to humans, yet it is effective against the various classes of pathogens comprising bacteria, viruses, spores, and yeast. Organisms in these categories include C. diff, TB, Parvovirus. Norovirus, Listeria, E. Coli, HIV, Hepatitis C, Influenza A, Candida and antibiotic resistant strains such as MRSA, VRE, and CRE. Using non-toxic Hydrolyte® in decontamination and sterilization processes generally eliminates the need for the use of other highly toxic chemical biocides (such as ammonia, chlorine bleach and glutaraldehyde) which are commonly used in sanitizing, disinfection and decontamination.
 
Although it has been well known for many years that an aqueous solution of hypochlorous acid (HOCL), commonly known as “anolyte”, can deliver extremely effective decontamination and disinfectant results, previous problems in anolyte production technology had rendered its use economically infeasible in most applications. The primary drawbacks with previous anolyte production technology were: the inability to generate anolyte in high enough concentrations (Parts Per Million – PPM) of the active ingredient, HOCL; high enough commercial volumes from the generators (as opposed to 1 quart to 1 gallon, small volume batch or low flow generators); reliability of the generators or fluids; and, the relatively short time that the product maintained its maximum decontaminative efficacy.
 
Paradigm’s new proprietary production, distribution and applications technologies have solved these problems. Its production equipment allows the Hydrolyte® solution to be produced consistently with specific, predetermined concentration of HOCL within the range of concentrations typically employed (50 to 600 PPM) as well as the desired pH level (the pH scale measures how acidic or Alkaline a substance is) that may be desirable for any given application. To resolve the maintenance of efficacy issue, Paradigm has perfected generation (production) equipment which is small enough to be located on the customer’s facility, allowing for production-on-demand rather than maintaining stored product inventory. For customers who will not use enough product to justify the on-site equipment, the company intends to engage industry-specific distribution and commercial services companies to provide the products to end-user customers on a regular delivery schedule. The combination of the on-site generation and delivery solutions should assure end-users will always be supplied with fresh, full strength product.
 
Production: Hydrolyte® is generated with the company’s proprietary equipment. The production technology for Hydrolyte® generates a product with predetermined PPM and pH properties, i.e., the equipment can be calibrated to deliver any desired PPM level; and, we believe it is superior to any other known production process or equipment available in the market today. The scalable Hydrolyte® generation systems technology largely will be housed in portable and mobile units, which can be readily moved within a building or from site to site, although more permanent installations, probably employing larger generation systems, will be made in situations where such installation is appropriate or required.

Markets: The primary applications for the Hydrolyte® technology are in cleaning, sanitizing, and disinfecting in a variety of market sectors and settings, including:
 

• | Institutional facilities, such as hospitals, nursing homes, hotels, correctional facilities and schools; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The agriculture industry for pre- and post-harvest disinfection of crops, sanitization in food processing, and certain applications in animal husbandry; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The oil and gas industry where Hydrolyte® can provide a process to disinfect water used in hydraulic fracking processes (“frac water”) and to kill sulfate reducing bacteria in “sour” oil and gas wells; and Catholyte can be used to clean equipment and aid in product recovery when applied “down hole”; and. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Other potential market opportunities are available, e.g., disinfecting and sanitizing of water in public and private water systems and industrial waste-water systems. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Management has determined that the most direct paths to rapid revenue and earnings growth are in the institutional facilities and agriculture markets. The preponderance of business development and marketing resources are currently being devoted to these two markets. Management intends to also work to maintain the company’s position and expertise in the oil and gas industry to assure that current customer relationships are maintained, business opportunities at hand are pursued and that the company is properly positioned for a roll-out as, and when, drilling activity increases as anticipated.
 
Institutional Facilities: Hospitals, Health Care Facilities & Schools
 
Paradigm senior research and development personnel have developed several models of Paradigm’s equipment to be deployed as a state-of-the-art integrated product dispensing, tracking and management systems for applications in the institutional facilities market. This integrated technologies solution, branded as PCT’s Annihilyzer® System, has been designed most particularly for hospitals, large long-term care, assisted living and nursing home facilities. In various configurations in can be deployed in other health care facilities including urgent care centers, medical, dental and veterinary offices. It is adaptable to deployment in schools, prisons, hotels and many other facilities, although the primary marketing and sales goal for Paradigm remains with the hospital market. A complete and custom turn-key cleaning, disinfection and sterilization program solution can be provided to each facility.
 
At the physical core of the Annihilyzer System is Paradigm’s on-site generation equipment, which is Paradigm’s housed in the Annihilyzer® Station, also containing the Company’s Patented tracking system, managed disbursement and bottling system for fluid production, containerization and use. Spray bottles and other containers are labeled when filled or refilled with product identification and date of production using printed labels and radio-frequency identification (“RFID”) tags. Reading these labels and tags before use assures that the correct and “fresh” product is always being used. Each room is also given an RFID tag. By reading the RFID room tags with a mobile app in a Mobile Data Terminal (ruggedized smartphone), the system tracks what is cleaned and disinfected, when, with what product, and by whom. The station is Wi-Fi connected to smart phones, which are tied to cloud-based data storage for consistent backup and retrieval. The Cloud-based data can be used to generate a complete record of all cleaning, disinfecting and sanitizing activity, including personnel time and task data – a cost saving convenience to management.
 
Paradigm has also created an automated state-of-the-art Electrostatic Spray Cart along with a suite of Electrostatic Applicators for use in Healthcare allowing for rapid disinfecting of rooms once a patient has vacated the room. This system is designed to reduce the turnover time required between patients, potentially increase revenue opportunities, and improve efficiency of hospital personnel.
 
Paradigm deploys its on-site production equipment under service contracts, charging an installation and set-up fee followed by monthly contract fees over a contract period of approximately 3 years. The equipment will be deployed and maintained through Paradigm’s personnel at first, then through Paradigm-licensed commercial services companies that provide the on-site support as required. The product generators and other components of the on-site systems will be monitored remotely by a contracting company which is highly experienced and expert in remote monitoring and response systems. The precise nature of any functional problems that may occur with any of the system’s components will be automatically communicated via the internet to the monitoring and control center. The problems are then resolved through a three-tiered problem response system: first by remote access to the computerized system controls, second by an on-site technician call, and third through a “rapid replacement” program. If problems are not resolved by the first or second tier responses, in the tier three rapid replacement response, Paradigm would overnight ship replacement parts or, if necessary, a complete station or system and have the defective unit returned for repair.

Agricultural Antimicrobial Pesticide
 
In the agricultural sector our microbicide is branded as “Hydrolyte® Green.” Our testing and field trials indicate that it can provide pre-harvest disinfection and decontamination solutions for any number of field crops that are affected by various bacterial and fungal pathogens. Through USDA grants and multiple studies by universities around the world, hypochlorous acid solutions have been tested and proven effective in post-harvest applications to include sanitizing at point of harvest, point of packing, and points of sale.
 
While Hydrolyte Green® is effective in these post-harvest applications, Paradigm’s major objective is to deliver solutions for pre-harvest pathogen contaminations, where a multitude of microbial infestations of many crops still need effective solutions that will qualify for regulatory approvals necessary to bring the treatment solution into commercial use. Paradigm’s agricultural research program is intended to support a continuous rollout of scientifically tested and certified applications for the treatment and prevention of numerous specific microbial infestations of a wide variety of crops. This research activity is expected to capture the test data required for regulatory approvals, and market acceptance of, the specific uses for the specific crops. During 2018, we executed a distribution and license agreement with an agricultural chemical specialty company and are actively involved in additional field trials of Hydrolyte Green®.
 
While company management and technical staff and consultants are certain of the ability of Hydrolyte® to kill virtually any microbe; substantial testing and documentation are required to determine optimal protocols for treatment, including application concentrations, volumes, and frequency, as well as optimal delivery techniques (which could be any or all of: root drenching, foliar spray or injection) needed to produce the most effective and least costly solutions to microbial infestations. It must also be demonstrated and certified by independent third-party testing that the treatment does no harm to the plants or the crops to be harvested and leaves no chemical residual inside the crop.
 
Paradigm has undertaken the establishment of a long-term testing and field trial program with an independent agricultural pesticide research firm to determine the feasibility of pre-harvest use of Hydrolyte® to treat various microbial infestations in as many different crops as possible. Management has identified several microbial crop infestation problems for which safe and effective treatment solutions have yet to be found and for which there is preliminary evidence that a properly researched Hydrolyte® treatment protocol could provide such a solution. Management anticipates positive results from independent testing leading to the creation, over time, of multiple business opportunity targets on which to build a solid consistent, long-term revenue stream with solid growth potential for the foreseeable future.
 
Testing/Research: In the third quarter of 2015, an opportunity was identified for research into a possibly significant opportunity for commercialization of a formulation of the company’s Hydrolyte® product. A critical agricultural market was seeking solutions to eradicate a serious and threatening microbial infestation. The company’s management determined that our product’s microbicide capability could provide a readily deployable and effective solution to the problem. Three months (late 2015 and early 2016) were spent determining the research requirements, target-market requirements and the potential for successful commercialization in the identified market. Two seasoned professionals with the necessary expertise were brought on board, and the project was launched from the company’s facility in Little River, South Carolina, during the fourth quarter of 2015.
 
To demonstrate that the company could provide a viable solution, research protocols were developed, and a series of laboratory tests and preliminary trials were performed at a major university by agricultural scientists who were experts on the crop and the infestation. The results of these tests and the trial analysis were very favorable, showing a >97% percent kill rate on the treated microbes in the laboratory and a >88% kill rate in the field trial environment.
 
Encouraged by early laboratory and field trial results, management secured the services of a consulting specialist in the target crop and the microbial pathogen causing the disease. Working with the consultant, management determined the market to be viable for the use of the company’s Hydrolyte® in effectively treating the disease.
 
The second field trial, for nine months of 2016, was extensive and involved a larger-scale operation over a greater length of time. Specific third-party reports to the company indicated “good to excellent control of the disease source, economically feasible, EPA registration possible” and a continuing very high field kill rate. Upon receiving these results, the Company began developing plans to make certain it will be prepared to “supply fluid product in commercial quantities.”
 
Preventive, curative and health maintenance programs for the application of the Company’s Hydrolyte® were discussed and developed, with input and encouragement by the fruit’s national growing association, as well as from nationally recognized educational and research institutions.

In March 2017, the company began a much larger-scale field trial of our product on a 20-acre plot that has trees showing widespread presence of the disease. We, and our consulting specialist, expect to replicate and to validate previous results and further define the best possible methodology and protocols for effective application of the Hydrolyte® solution. Because the results of the trial were positive, as expected, management continued to expand its commercial field trial usage of Hydrolyte Green ® with its agriculture distributor and licensee and is gaining valuable research data to be used in further commercialization efforts during 2019:
 

• | Finalize regulatory approvals to enter the market as the only-known resource for resolving this agricultural disease with no known negative effects to the fruit; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Finalize designs for, and assemble, large volume product generation and delivery systems best suited to the agricultural working environment; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pursue additional EPA approvals for additional applications in the agricultural markets; and, 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Forecast, with greater accuracy, product deployment protocols through research and development input for use in the distribution and sales of product in this market.

Oil and Gas Industry
 
World market prices for oil decreased during the past several years in response to increased production coming on line simultaneously with a softening of the growth in demand. The oil and gas industry in the U.S. and elsewhere have experienced unprecedented expansion and prosperity due to an influx of technological advances enabling the discovery and accurate location and identification of significant domestic oil and gas reserves. Advances in drilling technology, fracturing equipment and chemical methodology greatly enhanced recovery rates and revenue growth. This growth surge in supply reduced the United States’ dependency on foreign oil, and, we believe, contributed to lowering the U.S. trade deficit, reducing unemployment rates in oil producing areas, reducing heating and cooling costs, and providing lucrative investment opportunities. However, during 2014 and 2015 the steadily increasing supply of oil on a global scale led to reduced prices and decreased drilling activity in the U.S. From a June 20, 2014 price of $115 per barrel, the price dropped to historic lows below $30 in February 2016. The drop in the market price of oil led to a great reduction in drilling activity causing a corresponding loss of opportunities to sell the company’s products and services in the oil & gas industry. By the end of 2017, the price of oil had recovered to the $50 to $55 range. A stable market in this price range is expected to lead to renewed opportunities in this industry in 2018. As opportunities emerge, we plan to use oil-field service companies to market and distribute our Hydrolyte® and Catholyte products to their clients/customers. Management is currently seeking an appropriate opportunity to re-enter this market.
 
Management believes that the benefits of our proven technologies continue to be desirable for, and should continue to be used in, hydraulic fracturing drilling worldwide. Some of the benefits of our products and systems include elimination of highly toxic chemicals currently used for decontamination, reduced negative environmental impact, reduced recovery costs, improved product quality, and potentially opening new areas for oil and gas retrieval. As a result, management is preparing for expanding business opportunities in this sector in the mid-term future. As part of this preparation, Paradigm is developing a large-scale system utilizing Hydrolyte® to decontaminate water and fluid going “down hole” in oil and gas-well drilling; and to decontaminate recovered “frac” water for reuse in the fracking process. Operational experience has shown that Hydrolyte® not only effectively decontaminates the water supply of microbes, but also does not cause corrosive damage to gas and oil recovery equipment; nor does it cause any loss of performance to the other chemicals, additives, and propellants currently used in drilling and fracking processes.
 
Hydrolyte® also addresses another problem in the oil and gas industry. In a separate application, Hydrolyte® can be used to reduce the sulfur content of crude oil in the ground. There are sulfite-producing microbes in crude oil which cause higher levels of hydrogen sulfide (“H2S”) and “sour” wells with sour crude oil which is less valuable than “sweet” crude which has low H2S. It has been demonstrated that Hydrolyte® is effective in reducing or eliminating these microbes, thus improving the quality and value of the oil recovered from the treated well.

Hydrolyte® can reduce the costs of transporting contaminated water from the wellbore to a treatment facility and back for reuse, thus reducing the need for construction of water processing capacity, providing a substantial reduction in the costs of drilling, and enabling a sustainable increase in efficiency. The company intends to maintain an active marketing program; and, expects that there will be renewed opportunities for revenue growth from the frac drilling and related oil-field applications.
 
We delivered a large volume order of Hydrolyte® to a distributor of oilfield chemicals for use by one of its customers during 2018 and continue to have conversations regarding models of delivery of the fluids to the oil and gas market. In addition, we engaged in a contract for the sale of a large volume piece of Hydrolyte® equipment, which is being used by the purchaser for the generation of Hydrolyte® in specific applications within this market.
 
Marketing, Sales and Distribution of Hydrolyte®
 
Marketing and sales activities were minimal in 2017 but increased during the 2018 year, as management focused on the final stage of product development, establishing supply chain agreements, and building sufficient physical production capacity to meet expected demand. Distributor and customer relationships were established through management’s existing contacts and are anticipated to provide a solid base of sales and revenue after the first half 2019 launch of this new and expanded stage of operations. Paradigm has agreements with distributors in the Northeast, in Florida and in Ohio with manufacturers’ representative firms and expects to be in full commercial distribution operations in the second half of 2019. Management has additional distribution opportunities under development in multiple markets and intends to more fully expand the distribution network in 2019. Management, working with consultants well-known to management, intends to continue to seek and establish distributor and/or joint venture opportunities and agreements for the marketing and sales of Paradigm’s products and services.
 
While a major portion of the sales effort is expected to be provided directly by our internal sales team and distributors, Paradigm intends to put in place its own formal marketing program with expanded participation in industry trade shows, advertising in trade publications, internet marketing and sales support, and an impactful and credible company image, which integrates all products and technologies under one cohesive appearance. All marketing and branding material will incorporate a consistent look and display prominent logo recognition.
 
A direct sales function with clinical expertise is expected to be established to support large customers and pursue promising joint venture opportunities. Paradigm expects to use its production, operations and research and development facility in Little River, South Carolina to display its products and technologies. This will provide a meeting and demonstration area where working models and simulations will allow first-hand interaction and live demonstrations for interested parties. We may sponsor on-site visits to existing installations and technology partner’s facilities. 
 
The Institutional program for Healthcare sales program has begun with agreements with prospective customers for pilot/demonstration installations at their facilities. It is expected that the pilot installations will be completed in the second quarter. The pre-deployment preparation has been completed for the first hospital installation in the North Carolina area that is under a system and service agreement that started December 2017 and continued throughout 2018 with three additional contracts within the Healthcare market. The sales pipe line for this market is more complete and we are gleaning solid information and becoming more adept at determining the length of time from inception-to-“contract” within this complex market.
 
Production, Assembly and Principal Suppliers
 
Hydrolyte® Generation and Equipment Production: Paradigm moved into its new operations, research and development and production facility in Little River, South Carolina on December 15, 2016. The research, development and testing space were suitable and functional as already built. Paradigm’s systems consist of large volume units capable of producing up to 1,000 gallons per day for the Agriculture and Oil & Gas industries. Paradigm’s Annihilyzer Infection Control Systems, which are medium to low volume units, are more suitable for the Healthcare market. Testing and assembly of the large volume systems for the Agriculture and Oil & Gas industries is currently being conducted at the new facility. A new design and layout for a final systems assembly area and an expanded testing area was finalized in January 2018.
 
Annihilyzer® Infection Control Systems Assembly: Annihilyzer generator systems are tested and assembled in Little River and the other outsourced components for the Annihilyzer® Infection Control System are shipped to Werks Manufacturing Inc., Ft. Wayne, Indiana for final assembly in the Annihilyzer® Station cabinet. The Stations and the ESS Carts are manufactured by Werks who specializes in manufacturing and fabricating fiberglass products and Kiosks. The Annihilyzer® Station and ESS Cart manufacture and system assembly is performed by Werks on a purchase order basis.

Competition 
 
In all our target markets, Paradigm will compete directly with large firms selling competing, but toxic, legacy cleanser and disinfectant products that are manufactured off-site and shipped to customers or distributors. These competitors have longer operating histories, more experience, substantially greater financial and human resources, greater size, more substantial research and development and marketing operations, established distribution channels and are well positioned in the market to fight aggressively to defend their market share. However, the combined markets in which Paradigm is engaged are so massive that its competitive position as non-toxic and, in a significant number of applications, less expensive should allow Paradigm to prosper. Paradigm’s on-site generation technology and Patented RFID Tracking and Reporting System provides a substantial competitive advantage in addition to its non-toxic properties.
 
There are a limited number of potential competitors providing some form of anolyte-based biocide. Based on management’s research these companies are largely in early operating stages, concentrated in local or regional markets and have no advanced technology or pricing advantage. These include Aquaox, Ecologic Solutions, and MIOX Corporation.
 
In the institutional facilities and agricultural industries, Paradigm believes that its proprietary integrated technologies solutions in production, distribution, applications management and tracking should provide a competitive advantage in direct competition. In the oil and gas industry Paradigm has demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiencies of its products and processes and commercial acceptance from its customers. It is well positioned with respect to other companies providing anolyte-based biocides.
 
Intellectual Property
 
EPA product registrations of disinfectants and pesticides allow the registered products to be sold and distributed with labels identifying specific laboratory tested and proven kill claims of its effectiveness against specific microbial pathogens. Below is a summary of recent EPA registrations, EPA sub-registrations and other intellectual property the Company has acquired. The Company continues to hold certain intellectual properties relative to the Soloplax biodegradable plastics technology but does not anticipate pursuing commercialization of the technology associated in the foreseeable future.
 
On December 15, 2016, Paradigm acquired an EPA sub-registration (#82341-1-92108), which provides for entry into the facilities and agricultural markets described previously in this document. The company is actively pursuing sales under this registration and label. In addition, the Company has registered its products in several states, under its US EPA No. 92108-1.
 
On March 13, 2017, the Company entered into a Registration Transfer Agreement (“Transfer Agreement”) and a Data License and Assignment Agreement (“Data Agreement”) with a third party. Pursuant to the Transfer Agreement, the Company received United States Environmental Protection Agency’s (“EPA”) Registration number 82341-4 for Excelyte® VET for a one-time fee of $125,000.
 
On April 6, 2017, Paradigm, acquired the complete intellectual property, including know-how, trade secrets and patent rights to the hardware, firmware and software comprising the product inventory generation, disbursement, containerization, tracking and reporting system, trademarked as the Annihilyzer® System. The Annihilyzer® System is designed to be employed on-site in healthcare facilities. The company already owns IP rights in the generation system employed in this integrated technology system.
 
Paradigm has developed proprietary know-how related to the reactor cells and generation systems that generate our Hydrolyte® and Catholyte products. Paradigm continues, through its research and development program, to perfect the production innovation, know-how, trade secrets and patentable innovations incorporated into the improved production, inventory management and reporting systems. Current focus is on customizing system and equipment design to suite the production parameters and conditions in various specific venues and applications, e.g., agricultural field setting vs. packing house or oil and gas field.
 
On April 12, 2018 the Company entered into a Purchase Agreement with a third party to purchase its exclusive rights to US EPA Product Registration No 83241-1 for a fixed fee. The Company paid $5,000 on execution of the agreement and has continued to make periodic installment payments for the purchase of this Registration. At December 31,2018, the Company owed $45,000 of installment payments.

Research and Development
 
Paradigm’s research and development costs for the years ended 2018 and 2017 were $14,000, and $315,385, respectively. During that period, Paradigm concluded ongoing research and development of the application of the Hydrolyte® technology in the oil and gas industry; as a biocide in institutional facilities, such as, hospitals, jails and medical facilities; and continued in trial tests in agriculture and food processing.
 
In 2017 Paradigm invested $315,385 in products and systems for the institutional facilities market to supply the 2018 launch. Management estimated that 2018 research and development expenditures would be approximately $250,000 to support on-going laboratory and field-trial work in the agricultural sector and continued generator and other equipment and systems engineering and testing for future products. During 2018, we spent significantly less than anticipated. In 2019, we expect to maintain a robust research and development program in agricultural, commercial and industrial opportunities and applications in the foreseeable future as we overcome certain regulatory obstacles.
 
In October 2015, Paradigm entered an agreement with Florida Pesticide Research, Inc. to conduct agricultural research intended to support an aggressive rollout of tested and certified applications for the treatment and prevention of numerous specific microbial infestations of a wide variety of crops. While company management, technical staff and consultants are confident of Hydrolyte®’s ability to kill virtually any microbe, testing is required to determine proper application concentrations, volumes, frequency and delivery techniques (which could be any or all of: root drenching, foliar spray or injection) needed to be most effective and least costly. It also must be demonstrated that the treatment does no harm to the plants or the product to be harvested and that no harmful residual remains in the crop because of the treatment. Management intends to maintain and expand the testing and demonstration program currently in place to other crops to target various additional crop infestation problems for the foreseeable future.
 
Government Regulations and Compliance with Environmental Laws
 
Paradigm is not aware of any existing or probable government regulations that would negatively impact our operations. As a licensor of water treatment technology, Paradigm is not subject to government regulations for the removal of oils, solids and pathogens from water, other than normal safety standards and certifications (such as UL or CE) for goods that we manufacture for demonstrations and joint ventures, and our product lines. However, prospective customers are subject to local, state and federal laws and regulations governing water quality, environmental quality and pollution control. To date, compliance with government regulations has had no material effect on the company’s operations, capital, earnings, or competitive position, and the cost of such compliance has not been material. Paradigm is unable to assess or predict at this time what effect additional regulations or legislation could have on its activities.
 
In addition, Paradigm’s prospective customers will be subject to the Clean Water Act which regulates the discharge of pollutants into streams and other waters of the U.S. (as defined in the statute) from a variety of sources. If wastewater or runoff from facilities or operations may be discharged into surface waters, the Clean Water Act requires that person to apply for and obtain discharge permits, conduct sampling and monitoring and, under certain circumstances, reduce the quantity of pollutants in those discharges. The federal government may delegate Clean Water Act authority to the states.
 
Employees
 
As of the date of this Report, Paradigm has ten full-time employees, no part-time employees and various contract consultants who are engaged as needed. Management confers with outside expert consultants, attorneys and accountants as necessary. The company anticipates engaging additional full-time employees in 2019. We anticipate that a portion of employee compensation likely would include direct stock grants, or the right to acquire stock in the company through an employee stock purchase program, which would dilute the ownership interest of holders of existing shares of our common stock.
