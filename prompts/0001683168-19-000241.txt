ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Company History and Overview
 
History of Sibannac, Inc., a Nevada corporation
 
Sibannac, Inc. ("Sibannac" or "Company" or "we") was incorporated in June 1999 in the State of Nevada as Naprodis, Inc. for the purpose to engage in any lawful activity for which corporations may be formed. On August 25, 2014, the Company transferred all of its assets to Naprodis, Inc., a Colorado corporation (“Colorado Naprodis”). In consideration for the transfer of these assets, Colorado Naprodis agreed to assume a substantial amount of the Company’s liabilities. On November 25, 2014, the Company changed its name to Sibannac, Inc.
 
On August 19, 2015, Sibannac, Inc. (“the Company” or “Sibannac”), a Nevada corporation, entered into an Asset Acquisition Agreement with Apollo Media Network, Inc. (“Apollo”), a Delaware corporation, whereby all of the assets of Apollo would be acquired by the Company from Apollo. Pursuant to the Asset Acquisition Agreement, the closing of the Acquisition was effective August 31, 2015, although completed later. Apollo issued to the Company an Assignment Agreement and Bill of Sale for the Assets, duly executed by Apollo. Sibannac, Inc. delivered to Apollo Media Network, Inc. three million, one hundred thousand (3,100,000) shares of the Company’s Common Stock, duly issued, fully paid and non-assessable which were distributed to its shareholders in liquidation of Apollo pursuant to IRC Section 368c. There has been no merger, however, the assets and intellectual property of Apollo were transferred in liquidation to Sibannac.
 
We have short operating history in the Apollo business (only in the startup mode in 2015) and no representation is made, nor is there any assurance that our Company will be able to successfully raise the necessary capital to successfully carry out its business plans.
 
After fiscal year end we acquired Protection Cost, Inc. for two million, three hundred thousand (2,300,000) shares which intends to provide labor and accounting management systems for the cannabis industry.
 
Proposed Business Plan of Sibannac, Inc.
 
Sibannac intends to become a media and management services company, whose purpose is to service businesses with online marketing, advertising, sales tracking, management consulting and other informational services. Additionally, Sibannac provides accounting and expense and labor management systems to assist in compliance in the highly regulated industry environment.
 
We intend to fully comply with all federal laws and regulations, including those enforced by the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in our operations. We are NOT a “marijuana” sales company attempting to operate outside of federal “marijuana” prohibitions.

Divisions of Sibannac, Inc.
 
1. Sibannac Media
 
Our division, Sibannac Media, into which the Apollo assets were merged is in the business of developing and promoting web content. We currently own 15 domains that in total frequently rank high as 250 visited websites on the web according to Quantcast analytics. We are currently generating revenue from these sites and expect to expand into offering direct advertising sales in the near future.
 
a. Overview
 
Sibannac Media is a media company that produces websites, targeting specific consumer and B2B interests. It leverages these platforms to sell advertising and to generate an average audience of over 1 million unique users each month per web site, thereby reaching niche audiences interested in categories such as science, sports, health, parenting, news and business. Sibannac Media is a wholly owned subsidiary of Sibannac and intends to develop and drive the advertising and technology side of the Sibannac brands and products.
 
Sibannac Media intends to leverage technology to measure audience trend, behavior and social media to best determine desired content and advertiser demand. Sibannac Media intends to use Real Time Bidding (RTB) networks for media buying and selling of advertising. This is known as programmatic advertising, which is a system similar to how stocks trade on Wall Street where computers automate the process of buying and selling inventory and improve results.
 
According to eMarketer last year programmatic programming hit approximately $15 billion in advertising revenue accounting for 50% of the US digital display market. However, eMarketer sees significant growth coming from programmatic direct, which will reach $8.57 billion in spending by 2016 to represent 42.0% of programmatic ad expenditure in the US—up from 8.0% this year. 
 
Sibannac Media has achieved a number of key business objectives including the successful prototype deployment of Sibannac Media's proprietary marketing tactics, the development of an expanding customer base, and a clearly identifiable path to profitability, growth, and long-term success. The vision for Sibannac Media is to develop a network of relevant lifestyle sites to businesses and consumers. The plan for Sibannac Media is to not only build a top shelf network but to acquire some of the best applications, sites and online technology for this industry. The plan leverages the online advertising space as it relates to exchanges, ad networks and RTB (Real Time Bidding) and introduces a real value and necessary advertising service to the business community.
 
The immediate goal is to continue marketing the completed 15 sites. Each site will generate users interested in a specific content category, advertisers through Sibannac Media’s ad network will be able to reach these users based on their interests, behavior, geography, time of day and various other methods. Sibannac Media has launched SibannacIndex.com, LigaStars.com, YouScube.com, FullCourStars.com, CyclerLife.com, DynoMoves.com, LeafExaminer.com, Live2100.com, ScienceFly.com, MobilityPress.com, Lifeisaboard.com, SpyChatter.com, CagePound.com, ChildCompass.com and nputgaming.com. Collectively these sites typically generate over 15 million unique users monthly. These sites already have more eyeballs per month than the Discover.com, msnbc.com and Weedmaps.com (2.1 MUU) a leading site in the marijuana industry. By creating a system of testing and innovating to increase traffic, Sibannac Media will scale by continuously adding more sites.
 
Sibannac Media will pursue three main components to drive growth:
 

1. | Digital Media Publishing Company – This division owns and operates web sites for multi-screen (desktop, mobile, TV, tablet) audiences
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Ad Network – As Sibannac Media scales in site development they will build an Ad Network for advertisers to reach their highly targeted online audience.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Ad Exchange / Platform – Sibannac Media will use 3rd party platform technology allowing them access to ad exchanges for the purpose of buying and selling ad inventory.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The core product of Sibannac Media is the online audience generated through Sibannac Media’s proprietary ad network through marketing tactics and organic growth. This online audience generates ad impressions as they visit Sibannac Media’s network of sites. The Sibannac Media advantages are:
 

· | Cost — Using 3rd party technology and outsourcing platforms Sibannac Media will pass on significant savings to the advertiser without sacrificing quality.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Quality — Sibannac Media will be able to match advertiser campaigns to a targeted audience based on behavior, location, time and content. The Sibannac Media network will offer rich media ad units, interstitials, road blocks, sliding home page banners and other unique ad formats to deliver high performing metrics.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Exposure — Video mobile and display ads are displayed on a vast network of web pages.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Reliability — Sibannac Media uses 3rd party anti-fraud technology to provide high quality audiences to advertisers and has an internal human auditing team to ensure traffic quality
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Flexibility — Sibannac Media plans to allow advertisers an automated system where they can manage their own campaigns or a Sibannac Media account manager to successfully set up and manage their campaigns.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

b. Sibannac Media Market:
 
Global digital ad spend is predicted by eMarketer to rise from $132 billion in 2014 to $194 billion in 2018 surpassing television revenue. The US Internet publishing, broadcasting, and search portal industry includes about 3,200 companies with combined annual revenue of about $58 billion. The most significant trend is the emergence of online ad network companies using state-of-the-art cloud computing environments and high-performance ad server technology to deliver superior returns and savings for both advertisers and website publishers. Three basic methods marry advertising demand with website publisher supply.

1. | First is the direct sales method. Some website publishers have a sales force that actively sells website real estate. This method is more costly however, generates a higher value for ad inventory.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Second is the use of Ad networks. These are systems of lower paying, lower quality advertisements tapped by the publisher to fill remnant inventory. This ensures more ad space is sold and generating revenue, albeit at a fairly low cost. Today, most large online publishers (websites) sell remnant inventory of ad space through ad networks. Typically, 10% to 60% of a large publisher's total inventory is classified as remnant and sold through advertising networks. Smaller publishers often sell their entire inventory through ad networks.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Real time bidding (RTB) has emerged as the third method to match the supply of Internet publishers with advertising demand based upon specific user characteristics. Real time bidding (RTB) is an online enabling technology for media purchases.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
RTB enables media buyers to find audiences on a massive scale at an advantaged price through much-reduced effort. This, in turn, helps drive performance by ensuring an advertiser’s ad is seen by the audiences most likely to respond, while minimizing marketing costs and human resource investment. Website owners are able to make their ad inventory available to a broad array of buyers and to sell their website real estate to the highest bidder.
 
The following chart shows the projected growth of Real Time Bidding market:

c. Sibannac Media Marketing & Sales Plan
 
As a business, Sibannac Media's “product” is essentially websites; an ad network and a software solution combining 3rd party technology with custom solutions. Sibannac Media will offer these solutions in a 100% self-service system that enables customers to do everything including selling and buying an ad, funding their accounts, and generating real-time reports.
 


Sibannac Media will sell industry standard ad units on a Cost Per Thousand (CPM) basis. This is achieved through a programmatic system of Ad Networks and Ad Exchanges using Agency Trading Desks (ATD), Supply Side Platforms (SSP) and Demand Side Platforms (DSP). Sibannac Media's principal customers are advertisers that generally fall into three overlapping categories:
 

1. | Advertising Agencies — Companies that place ads on behalf of other companies.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Direct Advertisers — Companies that place ads for their own products or services.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Ad Networks / Publishers — Publishers wanting to participate in the Sibannac Media Network and Networks wanting to participate in the Sibannac Media Exchange.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Sibannac Media envisions and will pursue a three-phase marketing program as follows:
 
1.       Phase One: Sibannac Media develops and markets responsive websites (desktop, mobile, tablet) to generate audiences for the purpose of generating quality ad inventory, which is monetized through programmatic advertising, direct sales and content marketing services. Sibannac Media plans to scale from 10 million unique users in the first quarter of operations to 30 million monthly unique users by end of 2016.
 
2.       Phase Two: Sibannac Media develops additional marketing tactics, including direct sales, press releases, content updates, article submittals, testimonials, endorsements, social media marketing (i.e. blogs, podcasts, webinars, and videos), an affiliate program, link campaigns, and a direct e-mail marketing program (with the help of an e-mail marketing service) to generate greater brand awareness for The Company and its advertisers.
 
3.       Phase Three is all about Sibannac Media leveraging technology and relationships to meet the needs of online publishers, advertisers and ad agencies. Advertisers and ad agencies are seeking consistent and quality web sites suitable for their brand’s advertising campaigns. Online publishers are driven to maximize their site’s exposure to select audiences so they can increase their value to advertisers. Sibannac Media will be a facilitator for both advertisers and publishers to achieve their goals.

--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Sibannac Media will invest resources towards mobile technology and emerging markets.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

d. Sibannac Media Competition
 
Sibannac Media competition falls into two broad categories; competition for advertisers against other digital advertising platforms and competition for the consumers (eyeballs) that advertisers want to reach against other marijuana industry related websites.
 
From the standpoint of other digital advertising platforms, Google attracts 40 percent of total US digital advertising spending, according to eMarketer. Facebook holds the second-largest share, with about 7 percent. Other market leaders include Microsoft (6 percent), Yahoo! (6 percent), and IAC (3 percent).  Highlights of other advertising networks are presented as follows:
 
Google AdSense: Google’s AdSense is one of the largest and perhaps the best known display advertising network. This platform allows publishers to monetize standard display ads, mobile and video, and search results as well. It’s free to sign up for AdSense and the program will accept the smallest of publishers provided they meet certain quality guidelines. AdSense also integrates into other Google products and generally pays publishers monthly for revenue generated the previous month.
 
AdBlade: This network of premium publishers currently consists of about 1,000 high profile publishers. It offers publishers an opportunity to fill IAB standard ad units (such as the 300×250 rectangle or 728×90 leaderboard) as well as a proprietary “NewsBullet” unit designed to increase engagement and CPMs. For smaller publishers, AdBlade isn’t much use. This network accepts only ultra-premium publishers such as Fox News, Daily News, etc.
 
Advertising.com: A unit of AOL, this network has nearly 2 billion impressions monetized daily and offers opportunities for publishers to monetize display ads, video, mobile, and some custom implementations. It also offers Display University, an online educational resource for publishers and advertisers looking to learn more about display ads, the process of building a campaign, and executing on creative.
Chitika: Chitika boasts a network of more than 300,000 publishers, making it one of the largest networks. Chitika ads can be used on their own, or alongside ads from other networks (such as AdSense). Chitika is also open to just about anyone, and the process for getting approval and ad implementation is generally fast. Chitika is a popular alternative for advertisers unable to use or frustrated with AdSense, with great results in certain niches and less impressive earnings in others.
Clicksor: Clicksor ads can be served alongside ads from other networks. If the minimum price of an ad is not met, the placement can be filled with default ads to ensure a 100% fill rate. When Clicksor is able to provide an ad that meets the specified CPM or CPC threshold, that ad will run. Clicksor features traditional display ads, inline text links, and more custom implementations such as pop-unders and interstitials. Publishers get paid every 15 days, can get a revenue split as high as 85%, and can participate in a referral program.

Google became popular with advertisers in part through the comparative accessibility and affordability of their AdWords program, which essentially made it possible for nearly anyone to advertise online. Over time, Google's AdWords program has become increasingly complex. Although Yahoo! and Microsoft deliver much lower click volumes — many advertisers find their conversion rates better than Google, and hence profitability is higher.
 
Several issues like these have already opened the door to a new generation of online marketing providers. New companies (including Sibannac Media) can offer better terms, and have better technology through the use of open-source applications and cloud-based computing environments. Freed from server and software maintenance and challenging capacity issues — second-generation companies like Sibannac Media are now able to provide substantially greater ROI for their customers at much more competitive rates.

PLAN OF OPERATIONS
 
Our Budget for operations in next fiscal year, 2016, is as follows:
 

APPLICATION OF FUNDS (1) | | 
-------------------------+---+----------
Working Capital | $ | 250,000 
General & Administrative | $ | 250,000 
Marketing & PR | $ | 500,000 
Total | $ | 1,000,000

 (1) These items are variable and no commitment has been obtained from any source.
  We may change any or all of the budget categories in the execution of its business model. None of the line items are to be considered fixed or unchangeable. We may need substantial additional capital to support its budget. We have recognized minimal revenues from our existing operational activities.
 
We may need to raise additional funds to support not only our expected budget, but our continued operations. We cannot make any assurances that we will be able to raise such funds or whether we would be able to raise such funds with terms that are favorable to us. We may seek to borrow monies from lenders at commercial rates, but such lenders will probably be at higher than bank rates, which higher rates could, depending on the amount borrowed, make the net operating income insufficient to cover the interest.
 
If we are unable to begin to generate enough revenue to cover our operational costs, we will need to seek additional sources of funds. Currently, we have no committed source for any funds as of date hereof. No representation is made that any funds will be available when needed. In the event funds cannot be raised if and when needed, we may not be able to carry out our business plan and could fail in business as a result of these uncertainties.
 
We intend to conduct research and development, market research, product formulation, and will investigate regionally compounding licensed pharmacies for potential acquisition.
