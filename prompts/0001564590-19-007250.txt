Item 1. Business. 
Overview 
 We are a genetic medicines company dedicated to transforming the lives of patients suffering from rare genetic diseases with significant unmet medical needs by curing the underlying cause of the disease. Our proprietary platform is designed to utilize our human hematopoietic stem-cell derived adeno-associated virus vectors, or AAVHSCs, to precisely and efficiently deliver single administration genetic medicines in vivo either through a gene therapy or nuclease-free gene editing modality across a broad range of genetic disorders. The unique properties of our proprietary suite of 15 novel AAVHSCs enable us to focus on a method of gene editing called gene correction, either through the replacement of an entire diseased gene in the genome with a whole functional copy or the precise repair of individual mutated nucleotides, by harnessing the naturally occurring DNA repair process of homologous recombination, or HR. We believe our HR-driven gene editing approach will allow us to efficiently perform gene correction at therapeutic levels without unwanted on- and off-target modifications, and to directly measure and confirm those modifications in an unbiased manner to ensure only the intended changes are made. By utilizing the body’s natural mechanism of correcting gene defects, we also avoid the need for exogenous nucleases, or bacteria-derived enzymes used in other gene editing approaches to cut DNA, that are known to significantly increase the risk of unwanted modifications. Our diverse set of AAVHSCs allows us to precisely target, via a single injection, a wide range of disease-relevant tissues, including the liver, central nervous system, or CNS, bone marrow, lung, muscle and eye, across both modalities—gene editing and gene therapy. We believe these advantages will allow us to safely provide transformative cures using either modality. 
 We have generated compelling preclinical data for our first and lead product candidate, HMI-102, a gene therapy for the treatment of phenylketonuria, or PKU, and expect to advance HMI-102 into a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in adult PKU patients and report initial clinical data in 2019. We continue to advance our gene editing modality and have generated in vivo preclinical data demonstrating achievement of gene correction efficiencies in the liver that are significantly greater than both nuclease-based and other adeno-associated virus, or AAV, based approaches and are at a therapeutic level. We have nominated a lead gene editing product development candidate, HMI-103, for the treatment of PKU in pediatric patients. We have also nominated a lead gene therapy CNS product development candidate, HMI-202, for the treatment of metachromatic leukodystrophy, or MLD. We have initiated IND-enabling studies for both programs. 
 Our management team has a successful track record of discovering, developing and commercializing therapeutics with a particular focus on rare diseases. Our genetic medicines platform is based on gene editing and gene therapy technologies resulting from the pioneering work conducted on AAVHSCs in the laboratory of the City of Hope Medical Center in California, or COH. We have a robust intellectual property portfolio with issued composition of matter patents in the United States for our suite of 15 AAVHSCs and we believe the breadth and depth of our intellectual property is a strategic asset that has the potential to provide us with a significant competitive advantage. We continue to build on our intellectual property estate through our ongoing product and platform development efforts. We have internal process development and Good Manufacturing Practices, or GMP, manufacturing capabilities and recently completed the build-out of a current GMP, or cGMP, manufacturing facility to support our clinical development programs in both gene therapy and gene editing and expect to commence manufacturing in the first half of 2019. In November 2017, we entered into a collaboration with Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, Inc., or Novartis, to develop new genetic medicines using our HR-based gene correction approach in ophthalmology, which leverages our platform technology into a new therapeutic area, as well as other exploratory areas.
 Since our inception in 2015, we have raised approximately $288 million in net proceeds through our initial public offering, or IPO, in April 2018 and preferred stock financings. We will require additional capital in order to advance HMI-102 and our other product candidates through clinical development and commercialization. We believe that our compelling preclinical data, scientific expertise, product development strategy, manufacturing capabilities, and robust intellectual property position us as a leader in the development of genetic medicines. 
 Our Opportunity in Genetic Medicines 
 We are currently focused on monogenic diseases where the genetic abnormality is known to occur in a single diseased gene. The majority of monogenic diseases harbor thousands of individual mutations within the diseased gene, each resulting in a loss of function. Replacing an entire diseased gene with a whole functional gene is the optimal therapeutic approach for addressing these monogenic disorders. This can be accomplished either through a method of gene therapy called gene transfer in slowly or non-dividing cells, or through a method of gene editing called gene correction in rapidly dividing cells. 
 1


The current focus of most nuclease-based gene editing methods is gene knockout, or knocking out a diseased gene to prevent the expression of an undesired protein. Since gene knockout does not result in a fully-corrected gene, this method can only potentially address the minority of monogenic diseases where a diseased protein requires knock-down or inactivation. In addition to our knockout capabilities, our HR-driven gene correction method allows us to achieve integration into the patient’s genome and potentially address the significant majority of monogenic diseases by replacing an entire diseased gene with a whole functional gene or repairing a single mutation to fully correct the defect. Gene therapy, on the other hand, seeks to introduce a functional copy of a defective gene or gene sequence into a patient’s own cells, but not incorporate such copy into the patient’s genome. This method, called gene transfer, results in the expression of the therapeutic protein of interest without changing the genome. 
 DNA Repair Pathways 
 Human cells harbor two primary independent pathways to maintain the integrity of DNA: homologous recombination, or HR, and non-homologous end joining, or NHEJ, which are described below: 

• | HR is a process in which cells repair DNA through highly precise incorporation of correct DNA sequences that are homologous, or matching, to the site of damage. HR has evolved to repair DNA with high fidelity and avoids the introduction of unwanted mutations at the site of correction. In the late 1990’s, researchers discovered that certain adeno-associated virus, or AAV, vectors deliver gene sequences into the genome specifically through the HR process. These AAV vectors delivered long single strands of homologous DNA to specific regions in the genome and induced the HR pathway, but their low efficiency of approximately 1% limited their use as a viable option for in vivo therapeutics.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | NHEJ is a less selective, error-prone process that rapidly joins the ends of broken DNA resulting in a high frequency of insertions or deletions at the break site. The discovery of nuclease-based gene editing technologies provided researchers with novel tools to specifically introduce DNA breaks into the genome. The most common repair pathway following a DNA break is NHEJ. Despite high potential for error, the majority of nuclease-based gene editing companies primarily utilize the NHEJ pathway.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 While the introduction of nuclease-based gene editing technologies provides the capability to initiate DNA repair pathways in the cell and further increase the frequency of targeted gene modification, we believe its major limitation is the preferential utilization of the error-prone NHEJ pathway instead of the HR pathway. Because of this preference, the greatest utility of nuclease-based gene editing technologies may lie in their ability to knockout genes rather than replace an entire diseased gene in the genome with a whole functional copy. Furthermore, the use of nuclease-based gene editing technologies for insertion of a corrective sequence requires the separate delivery of both nuclease and homologous DNA template to the same location at the same time, and carries the risk of unwanted mutations from NHEJ including insertions and deletions or opposite orientation insertion of the template DNA. 
 We believe the unique characteristics of our genetic medicines platform will allow us to focus on the HR pathway, enabling precise nuclease-free gene correction with improved efficiency and a broader set of disease targets.

Our Approach 
 Our unique genetic medicines platform is designed to provide us the flexibility to choose the best suited method from either gene correction or gene transfer for each disease we pursue, based on such factors as the targeted disease biology, the biodistribution of our AAVHSCs to key tissues, and the rate of cell division the tissues exhibit. Our product development strategy is to continue to develop in parallel both gene therapy and gene editing modalities, while initially leveraging the experience from our gene transfer modality to further advance our gene correction modality. Refer to Figure 1 below for a graphical depiction of our platform.
Figure 1. Our Genetic Medicines Platform. 
 While others are working on identifying and testing ways to mitigate the inherent risk in working with nucleases, our approach avoids the use of nucleases entirely. By targeting the HR pathway, our proprietary AAVHSCs mitigate the risks of nuclease-based technologies and have the potential to overcome other AAV vector limitations by combining the precision and high fidelity of HR with highly efficient in vivo gene correction, which we believe is capable of providing potential cures for a wide range of rare genetic diseases.

Our novel AAVHSCs are packaged with either a gene editing or traditional gene therapy construct. The gene editing construct includes lengthy guide sequences, or homology arms, which are designed to enable the specific alignment to the desired genomic location and then, through the natural process of HR, enable correction of the diseased gene in the genome by replacement with a whole functional copy. Our gene therapy construct includes a functional copy of the gene and a promotor sequence that is designed to enable the gene to be turned on in the cell and ultimately transcribed to express the therapeutic protein of interest without integrating into the genome. Refer to Figure 2 below for a graphical depiction of how our AAVHSCs enable each therapeutic modality.

Figure 2. How Our AAVHSCs Enable Each Therapeutic Modality. 
 We believe our approach has several key advantages that include: 
  
• | Our proprietary AAVHSC platform enables both gene therapy and gene editing modalities. Our platform provides us the flexibility to deliver genetic medicines through the best suited modality from either gene therapy or gene editing for each disease we pursue, based on such factors as the targeted disease biology, the biodistribution of our AAVHSCs to key tissues, and the rate of cell division the tissues exhibit. Our AAVHSCs are naturally occurring as they were originally isolated from normal human CD34 cells and have the potential to result in an improved safety profile.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ability to perform nuclease-free gene editing mediated by HR with high gene correction efficiency. Our suite of 15 novel AAVHSCs are designed to enable us to take advantage of the precise and high-fidelity process of HR-directed gene insertion for nuclease-free gene editing while achieving gene correction efficiencies that are in therapeutic ranges and significantly higher than both nuclease-based and other AAV-based approaches. While nuclease-based gene editing technologies have achieved high gene knockout efficiencies in preclinical studies, they have shown limited published evidence of gene correction efficiencies to date.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ability to introduce an entire gene into the genome or the precise repair of individual mutated nucleotides in addition to gene knockout. Our HR-based gene editing approach provides the flexibility to introduce an entire copy of a functional gene into the genome in addition to repairing single mutations or knocking out entire genes, thus allowing us to potentially address the significant majority of monogenic diseases.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | High precision and lack of unwanted off-target or on-target DNA modifications. Our gene editing approach leverages HR, which makes DNA repairs with high fidelity, and enables us to precisely perform gene correction without unwanted off- and on-target modifications. Furthermore, we are able to directly measure and confirm those modifications throughout the entire genome to ensure only the intended changes are made.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Ability to target multiple tissues. In preclinical studies, intravenous administration of our suite of AAVHSCs have demonstrated ability to target a wide variety of tissues including the liver, CNS, muscle, bone marrow, eye, heart and lung, enabling us to potentially address a broad range of monogenic diseases.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In vivo administration with a single component delivery system. Our platform is designed to perform gene editing at high efficiency without the use of a nuclease, enabling us to deliver genetic medicines in vivo using a single vector system that contains everything required to edit DNA. These characteristics simplify the manufacturing and delivery of our therapeutic candidates relative to existing nuclease-based gene editing approaches.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ability to target a broad range of patients given low frequency of preexisting neutralizing antibodies. We believe our AAVHSCs can target a broad range of patient populations given the low prevalence of preexisting neutralizing antibodies relative to other AAV vectors.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Pipeline Strategy 
 We believe our genetic medicines platform can be applied broadly to treat and potentially cure a wide range of genetic diseases, and we have carefully designed and prioritized our pipeline strategy to maximize this opportunity. We are initially pursuing monogenic diseases where we know exactly what we are seeking to correct and exactly which gene to insert into patients’ cells, thus mitigating the uncertainty of the disease biology. We are prioritizing monogenic diseases with significant unmet medical needs, validated regulatory pathways, well-accepted biomarkers and significant commercial opportunities. We are currently focused on developing product candidates to treat monogenic diseases in the liver, CNS, bone marrow, and the eye, given that our AAVHSCs naturally show a high degree of tropism or ability to preferentially target cells in these organs and organ systems. These tissues are affected in many rare genetic diseases. 
 Our initial focus areas include developing product candidates for intracellular, inborn errors of metabolism and other genetic conditions that are especially well suited to correction by our gene editing or gene therapy methods. In slow- or non-dividing cells (e.g., CNS and adult liver cells), gene therapy can potentially be curative, while rapidly dividing cells (e.g., hematopoietic CD34+ cells and pediatric liver cells) require a gene editing approach to provide a permanent correction in the genome that can be replicated with each cell division. We are purposefully deploying our proprietary AAVHSCs in certain indications first with a gene therapy approach followed by a gene editing approach, in order to maximize the likelihood of translating our platform into widespread clinical and commercial success. 
 We are advancing into the clinic with our first and lead product candidate, HMI-102, for the treatment of PKU, a rare, inherited metabolic disorder that causes a buildup of the amino acid phenylalanine, or Phe, throughout the body, including the brain. Elevated Phe levels in children lead to impaired brain development, severe intellectual disability and behavior problems with a high frequency of seizures. To date, no treatment addresses the core genetic defect in PKU. The current standard of care consists of a highly restrictive diet, which is not always effective in normalizing the levels of serum Phe and its important metabolite, tyrosine, which is a precursor to several neurotransmitters. Low adherence to the diet leads to significant cognitive and behavioral problems, such as impairments in executive function, including planning, problem solving, information processing, and ability to focus. There are currently two FDA approved products for the treatment of PKU. Kuvan, in conjunction with dietary supplementation, provides limited or no benefit to approximately 90% of patients with PKU. Palynziq, approved in 2018, is a pegylated plant-derived enzyme called phenylalanine ammonia lyase, or PAL. This approach using PAL does not correct the underlying genetic disorder (human phenylalanine hydroxylase, or PAH, deficiency) and does not reconstitute the natural pathway that is needed to address the neurocognitive defects associated with PKU. 
 PKU has an easily measurable and translatable biomarker (blood Phe levels), facilitating both a rapid path to the clinic and characterization of therapeutic response. Our PKU program is initially focused on adults using the gene therapy approach. This strategy is designed to help us to further characterize the delivery, expression, safety, and manufacturing of our AAVHSCs, and to apply these learnings to our gene editing approach in the pediatric PKU population and to our broader platform. Preclinical studies in a well-established mouse model of PKU, called the ENU2 mouse, treated with HMI-102 showed a reduction in serum Phe to normal levels within one week following a single intravenous administration and the reduction in serum Phe persisted for 48 weeks, consistent with the lifespan of this model. We anticipate entering into a Phase 1/2 clinical trial and reporting initial clinical data for HMI-102 in adult PKU patients in 2019. We have also received orphan drug designation for the use of AAVHSCs expressing PAH for the treatment of PAH deficiency, which is the primary cause of PKU, from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and from the European Medicines Agency, or EMA.
 We are building a deep pipeline across a wide range of diseases and tissue types to leverage the broad potential of our platform. We have nominated lead development candidates in both gene editing for the treatment of PKU in pediatric patients, HMI-103, and gene therapy for a CNS indication, metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD), HMI-202, and have initiated IND-

enabling studies for these programs. We also may selectively enter into strategic alliances with pharmaceutical or biopharmaceutical companies to expand indications and accelerate development of programs where collaborators can contribute further disease-specific expertise to our platform.
 Our Product Pipeline 
 The current status of our programs is summarized in the table below: 
 
Our Strategy 
 Our goal is to transform the lives of patients suffering from severe genetic diseases by using gene editing and gene therapy to cure the underlying cause of the disease. The critical components of our strategy to achieve this goal include: 

• | Transform the treatment paradigm for rare genetically-defined diseases with the delivery of single-administration curative therapies. Utilizing our proprietary AAVHSCs, we intend to deliver genetic medicines in vivo via a single administration to address the underlying genetic problem in a given disease. For each of the programs in our pipeline, we have identified the mutations of a specific gene that we believe can potentially be addressed by replacing an aberrant gene with a healthy one via HR-driven gene correction, resulting in specific integration into the patient’s genome, or by introducing a functional copy of a defective gene via gene therapy. Our genetic medicines platform allows us to choose the best suited modality for each disease we pursue, and we believe our nuclease-free editing approach will provide life-long clinical benefits for patients.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Advance our pipeline programs through clinical proof-of-concept and commercialization. We intend to advance our lead product candidate, HMI-102, into a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in adult PKU patients in 2019. We believe that our approach of initially utilizing our AAVHSCs for gene therapy in adult PKU patients while, in parallel, advancing gene editing for pediatric PKU patients will maximize the efficiency of our pipeline development while providing potential solutions for the unique needs of each particular PKU patient population. Given the well-defined nature of PKU and the concentration of treatment centers, we intend to bring HMI-102, if approved, to patients through a small, targeted internal commercial organization.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continue to expand our pipeline within existing therapeutic areas and expand into new therapeutic areas. We are focused on applying the transformative potential of our genetic medicines platform to developing treatments for patients with monogenic diseases. Initially, we are targeting diseases occurring in the liver, the CNS and hematopoietic system. Given the ability of our AAVHSCs to deliver to a wide range of disease-relevant tissues, we believe there are many additional indications for which our technology may be applicable, including other inborn errors of metabolism, lysosomal storage diseases, hematological diseases, and ophthalmic diseases, as well as for ex vivo cell therapy. Our research and development collaboration with Novartis for select ophthalmic targets and other exploratory disease areas illustrates the broad potential of our platform. In addition to our Novartis collaboration, we may also choose to selectively collaborate to

expand the indications we can pursue and accelerate development of programs where collaborators can contribute further disease-specific expertise to our platform.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Strengthen our platform by leveraging our discovery and development capabilities and selectively collaborating. We are committed to investing in our research and development activities to expand the capabilities of our platform, specifically our AAVHSCs as well as HR gene editing technology. We are optimizing our AAVHSC genetic medicines platform with focused efforts on AAVHSC characterization, gene therapy and editing construct design and screening, and genomic assays to characterize and quantify our editing technology. To augment our own efforts, we intend to continue to collaborate with academic institutions to pursue new scientific and therapeutic insights and strengthen our position as a leader in gene correction.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Control manufacturing through our in-house capabilities. We have developed an internal process development platform that accommodates both gene therapy and gene editing technologies. We have constructed a 25,000 square foot cGMP manufacturing facility that is designed to accommodate all pipeline programs, and we expect to start manufacturing in the first half of 2019. We believe the quality, reliability and scalability of our gene editing and gene therapy manufacturing approach is a core competitive advantage crucial to our long-term success and that internal manufacturing capabilities will further safeguard our intellectual property.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continue to strengthen and expand our intellectual property portfolio. We have exclusive worldwide rights to our technologies including issued composition of matter patents in the United States for 15 of our novel AAVHSCs for both gene editing and gene therapy. We exclusively acquired rights to this foundational intellectual property for the AAVHSCs from COH for developing and commercializing therapeutics based on these vectors. We continue to focus on strengthening our intellectual property estate through the discovery of new AAVHSCs, further characterization around our existing AAVHSCs as well as the core technology involved in delivering our product candidates to patients. To further advance our leadership in nuclease-free gene editing and gene therapy, we actively explore opportunities to collaborate with other leading scientific institutions in the field.

Genetically Defined Disease and Genetic Medicine 
 Each person’s genetic material, or genome, is encoded by DNA in sequences of genetic code called genes. Genes, in turn, through a process called gene expression, produce proteins that perform a vast array of functions within all living organisms. The human genome consists of roughly three billion base pairs of nucleotides, which are the basic structural unit of nucleic acids like DNA, and small changes, or mutations, routinely occur in the base pairs of our DNA. A mutation in the gene or in sequences that control the expression of that gene can cause proteins to be produced aberrantly in the cell—for example, too little or too much protein can be produced in the cell—which can cause disease. 
 Significant investments in the human genome project, clinical data collection and analysis, and the development of affordable and efficient DNA sequencing and informatics tools have transformed the scientific community’s understanding of genetically defined diseases and brought significant advancement to the field of genetic medicine. For example, many diseases previously thought to be genetically complex in nature have now been re-categorized as multiple distinct diseases that present with similar clinical dispositions, but are caused by different single-gene defects. Currently, there are approximately 3,600 diseases that are understood to be caused by single-gene mutations, which vary dramatically in their pathologies, their sites of manifestation, and the specific natures of their root causes. 
 According to the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man database, a majority of genetically defined diseases are autosomal recessive in nature (meaning two copies of an abnormal gene must be present in order for the disease or trait to develop) resulting in a loss of function, whereas the remaining diseases are autosomal dominant (meaning you need only one copy of the mutated gene to be affected) with a gain of function. In loss of function-based diseases, the mutation results in a protein that is not adequately produced; conversely, in the case of gain of function diseases the mutated gene product is inappropriately or excessively active. The majority of genetic diseases harbor thousands of individual mutations within a single gene, each resulting in a loss of function, thus treatment requires replacing or supplementing the diseased gene with the whole correct gene. Two approaches are currently used to restore function—gene therapy and gene editing. 
 Current Treatment Modalities and their Limitations 
 Traditional genetic medicines have focused on the addition of new genes to human cells without integration into the genome, or gene therapy. Recent advances in the field, however, have led to the development of gene editing technologies that enable the introduction of DNA breaks to potentially achieve a therapeutic effect. However, nuclease-based gene editing 
 7


approaches have been limited due to high rates of unwanted on- and off-target modifications and low gene correction efficiency due to the cell trying to rapidly repair the introduced DNA break. Other therapeutic approaches to genetic disease do not address the underlying genetic cause of the disease and offer solutions that typically only treat symptoms and require chronic administration, and as a result most genetic diseases tend to have significant unmet need. 
 Gene Therapy Overview 
 Gene therapy, through the process of gene transfer, seeks to introduce a functional copy of a defective gene or gene sequence into a patient’s own cells alongside the existing genome, without integration, as an episome within a cell. The episome drives functional gene expression using engineered promoters that can be designed to limit expression to specific cell types or be expressed in all cell types. Gene therapy is a viable option for delivery of potential cures in diseases where the target cell type does not divide frequently (e.g., neurons in the CNS and adult liver cells). However, since gene therapy works through an episome that does not integrate into the genome, each time a cell divides, the number of episomes per cell decreases by 50%. After a few rounds of cell division, the episomes will be lost, limiting therapeutic relevance in rapidly dividing cells (e.g., blood, lung and pediatric liver cells). 
 Gene therapy has been studied for over 50 years, and the first therapeutic use of gene transfer in humans occurred in 1990. Since then, more than 2,300 gene therapy trials have been planned or completed, covering a broad range of disease targets. Recently, gene therapies have progressed beyond academic trials to regulatory approvals, resulting in a growing acceptance and de-risking of the modality. In 2012, UniQure’s Glybera became the first gene therapy to be approved by the EMA and was followed by the EMA approval of GlaxoSmithKline’s Strimvelis in 2016. Spark Therapeutics’ Luxturna is the first directly administered gene therapy approved in the U.S. that targets a disease caused by mutations in a specific gene. 
 Gene Editing Overview 
 Gene editing is a powerful new approach that has been developed in the last few years to change the course of genetic disease by physically correcting aberrant genes in a variety of tissues in the body. Gene editing is the process of replacing, deleting, or repairing defective DNA in its native location. The current focus of gene editing is knocking out a diseased gene or correcting an individual mutation within a gene that is frequent within the disease population, neither of which can address the larger population of recessive genetic diseases that would require the insertion of a full corrective gene. 
 Unlike the gene therapy approach, in gene editing the repaired genetic region is replicated through normal cell division and allows the protein to be expressed using its natural regulators. There are two approaches to gene editing, the traditional nuclease-based approach and our nuclease-free HR-driven gene correction approach. 
 Gene editing technologies to date primarily leverage two independent pathways to modify DNA: HR and NHEJ. HR is a process in which cells repair DNA through highly precise incorporation of correct DNA sequences complementary to the site of damage. HR has evolved to repair DNA with high fidelity and avoids the introduction of unwanted mutations at the site of correction. NHEJ is a less selective, error-prone process that rapidly joins the ends of broken DNA resulting in a high frequency of insertions or deletions at the break site. 
 Nuclease-Based Gene Editing 
 Nuclease-based gene editing utilizes nucleases, which are enzymes that were initially identified in bacteria and evolved to act like “molecular scissors.” Nuclease-based gene editing is fundamentally a two-step process. First, a nuclease, which is capable of cutting one or both strands in the double-stranded DNA, is directed to the desired site and makes a specific cut. After the desired cut or cuts are made, the cell’s DNA repair machinery responds to complete the edit through one of two possible repair mechanisms—the more common NHEJ or the less common HR—that can be leveraged for therapeutic effect. 
 NHEJ occurs in the absence of a DNA template for the cell to copy as it repairs a DNA cut. This is the primary or default pathway that the cell uses to repair double-stranded breaks. The NHEJ mechanism can be used to introduce small insertions or deletions, or indels, resulting in the knocking out of the function of the gene. NHEJ creates indels due to its mode of repair and can also result in the introduction of off-target, unwanted mutations including chromosomal aberrations. 
 8


Nuclease-based HR occurs with the co-delivery of the nuclease and a DNA template that is similar to the DNA that has been cut. Consequently, the cell can use this template to construct reparative DNA, resulting in the replacement of defective genetic sequences with correct ones. The HR mechanism is the preferred repair pathway when using a nuclease-based approach to insert a corrective sequence due to its high fidelity. However, a majority of the repair to the genome after being cut with a nuclease continues to go through the NHEJ mechanism and is the more frequent repair pathway, even in the presence of a DNA template. This has the potential to result in unwanted mutations at the cut site including: 
  
• | insertion of the template DNA in the wrong orientation;
--+--------------------------------------------------------


• | unwanted mutations added at the site of integration;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


• | integration of template DNA fragments; and
--+-------------------------------------------


• | insertion of inverted terminal repeat sequences if AAV is used as the delivery vehicle.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Figure 3. Non-Homologous End Joining and Homologous Recombination. 
 Much of the early recognition for gene editing’s potential has come in response to these nuclease-based approaches, which include: Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nucleases, or TALENs; Clustered, Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) Associated protein-9, or CRISPR/Cas9; Zinc Finger Nucleases, or ZFN; and Transcription Activator-Like meganuclease, or megaTAL. While these approaches have already made and will likely continue to make an impact on biology research, we believe they face significant shortcomings. 
 Limitations of Nuclease-Based Gene Editing 
  
• | Unwanted on- and off-target DNA modifications. The use of exogenous nucleases results in DNA breakage which is predominantly repaired via NHEJ, an error-prone process involving the insertion or deletion of DNA residues as well as the possibility that DNA will be cut in the wrong place, resulting in unwanted mutations driven through NHEJ instead of a therapeutic correction at the precise location. This process coupled with the ability of these nucleases to break the DNA at off-target sites comprises one of the major safety concerns about these gene editing methods.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Inability to efficiently and precisely introduce an entire gene to the genome. Current gene editing approaches are unable to achieve high efficiencies of targeted gene correction in vivo.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Complexity of vector delivery and manufacturing to achieve gene insertion. In order to deliver an entire functional gene, existing nuclease-based gene editing approaches require co-delivery of multiple constructs of editing machinery into the same cell at the right place and at the same time. The need to use multiple vectors also increases the complexity and cost of manufacturing.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nuclease-Free Gene Editing Opportunity 
 Gene editing through the precise HR pathway can also be conducted without the use of nucleases. Although such approaches were pioneered in the 1990’s before the advent of the nuclease-based gene editing platforms, their use and progression to clinical trials since has been held back by issues including gene correction efficiencies that are typically well below those needed to achieve potential therapeutic effect. Nevertheless, early work in the field of nuclease-free gene editing elucidated some of the key characteristics of various platforms that are now providing higher editing frequencies. However, the published efficiency of this technology for gene correction is approximately 1%, significantly below levels that are typical for generating a therapeutic effect. This underscores a clear need for novel nuclease-free gene editing technologies capable of achieving higher gene correction efficiencies. 
Our Genetic Medicines Platform 
 Our proprietary genetic medicines platform is built on our novel AAVHSCs, which allow us to choose the best suited modality from either gene correction or gene therapy for each disease we pursue, based on such factors as the targeted disease biology, the biodistribution of our AAVHSCs to key tissues, and the rate of cell division the target tissues exhibit. The unique characteristics of our platform enable nuclease-free gene editing, specifically gene correction, and broad, systemic tissue distribution. Our AAVHSCs are designed to directly integrate corrective DNA through HR with therapeutically relevant efficiencies. Our HR-based gene editing approach utilizes a single component AAV system that contains everything required to selectively edit DNA with no need for exogenous nucleases or editing machinery. This single-component system simplifies the manufacturing and delivery of our therapeutics. Our AAVHSCs are naturally occurring and have been modified to be non-replicating to minimize potential safety issues. We believe our platform’s combined attributes will allow us to develop more efficient and safer therapeutics for a wide range of genetic diseases. 
Homologous Recombination—A Powerful Basis for Gene Editing 
 Unlike other gene editing approaches, our technology is based on the natural DNA repair process of HR, and is designed to enable precise and efficient correction or replacement of gene mutations without an exogenous nuclease. HR is a process that is used by cells to repair DNA through the incorporation of a template of homologous DNA. This pathway is not prone to the nucleotide insertions and/or deletions that occur frequently in the NHEJ process. 
 By pursuing one-time correction of underlying genomic defects using a nuclease-free, naturally occurring DNA repair process that addresses the underlying genetic problem in a given disease, we believe our approach has the potential to simplify production and delivery of therapeutics, minimize the risk of unwanted mutations and provide life-long clinical benefits for patients. Our gene editing approach has the potential to be curative in both dividing and non-dividing cells as it provides a permanent correction in the genome that is then replicated with each cell division so that new generations of cells will carry the corrected gene. 
 Our genetic medicines platform induces the endogenous HR cellular process using our AAVHSCs to insert replacement or corrective genes into cells that contain mutated or deleterious genes. We engineer our AAVHSCs to contain long, single-stranded DNA corrective sequences highly specific to the target region in the genome. These single-stranded DNA molecules are then delivered to cells in our AAVHSC vectors, which we believe results in precise and efficient gene correction via the HR pathway. The design of our long and specific sequences, up to the 4.7 kilobase packaging limit of our AAVHSCs, is intended to significantly reduce the risk of off-target integration. Based on the packaging size of our AAVHSCs, we believe our caspids are capable of accommodating and delivering up to approximately 85% of the genes in the human genome and thus have the ability to address a significant majority of genetic disorders. The engagement of the HR pathway to drive gene correction results in a highly precise and efficient on-target integration, without introducing unwanted mutations at the corrective site. These guide sequences can be engineered to be as long as necessary to deliver highly efficient HR-based on-target correction while significantly minimizing off-target effects. We typically use homology arms as long as 1,600 base pairs of DNA to target corrective gene sequences into precise regions of the genome, in contrast to the guide sequences used in CRISPR/Cas 9-based gene editing, which are typically less than 30 base pairs in length. We also benefit from the ability of our platform to utilize HR to precisely insert gene sequences into the DNA of cells, similar to how mammalian cells repair their own DNA. This is a key distinction from approaches that rely on exogenous nucleases that were initially identified in organisms, such as bacteria, and evolved just to cut DNA. In order to bring about the excision and subsequent replacement that some forms of gene editing 
 10


require, those other approaches must combine multiple additional techniques and deliver into the cell the requisite cellular machinery at the right place at the same time, increasing the complexity of the task, introducing the possibility of integrating the wrong DNA due to non-HR-based repair mechanisms, and reducing the likelihood of success.

 Our Proprietary AAVHSCs 
 Our genetic medicines platform is based on a suite of 15 proprietary AAVHSCs which we can deploy with either gene editing or gene therapy constructs. Both applications rely on a unique ability of our AAVHSCs to efficiently target multiple tissues in the body. Our AAVHSCs were isolated from human stem cells and we believe they can direct nuclease-free gene correction with higher efficiency and precision relative to that indicated in published data for other AAV-based gene editing approaches. Our genetic medicines platform is based on gene editing and gene therapy technologies resulting from the pioneering work conducted on AAVHSCs in the laboratory of COH. Our AAVHSCs display the following advantages: 
Single AAVHSC Platform for Both Gene Therapy and Gene Editing Modalities 
 Our platform provides us the flexibility to deliver genetic medicines through the best suited modality from either gene therapy or gene editing for each disease we pursue, based on such factors as the targeted disease biology, the biodistribution of our AAVHSCs to key tissues, and the rate of cell division the tissues exhibit.

Ability to Perform Nuclease-free Gene Editing Mediated by HR with Higher Efficiency 
 A 2016 study conducted by COH assessed the ability of AAVHSCs to carry out gene editing in vivo using a luciferase gene that lacked a promoter sequence. A vector with homology arms was designed to introduce D-luciferin, or luciferase, into the Rosa26 locus in the mouse genome. Rosa26 is a locus in the mouse genome that is known to have a strong promoter capable of driving constitutive expression of genes in all cell types. AAVHSC15 constructs with (N=3) and without (N=2) homology arms and an AAV8 construct with homology arms (N=3), were injected into mice intravenously at a dose of 1e13 vector genomes per kilogram, or vg/kg. High levels of luciferase expression were detected throughout the mouse up to 63 days after injection of the AAVHSC15 construct with homology arms. Luciferase expression was not seen if the homology arms were not present and was barely detectable when AAV8 was used instead of AAVHSC15. These data were published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, or PNAS, in July 2018.
 
Figure 5. In vivo Gene Editing. Mice treated with our AAVHSC15 construct with homology arms specific to Rosa26 showed high expression of luciferase up to 63 days. Control mice injected without homology arms or with AAV8 constructs had none or limited luciferase expression. 
 12


Factor 8, or F8, is a locus in the mouse genome that is known to have a strong promoter but is expressed only in the liver. In a study we conducted in 2017 at our headquarters, AAVHSC15 and AAVHSC17 constructs, at a dose of 5e12vg/kg (N=3), containing homology arms specific to the murine F8 locus were injected into mice intravenously. Live luciferase imaging was conducted pre-dosing and weekly thereafter through week nine, with the exception of week four. Murine biodistribution data with AAVHSC15 and AAVHSC17 both show tropism to multiple tissues beyond the liver. However, in this study only liver-specific expression of luciferase was observed as early as 24 hours and sustained through 60 days post-injection, suggesting significant editing in the murine F8 locus. To assess the evidence of F8 gene correction, genomic DNA from the livers were extracted at 60 days post-injection and integration was assessed molecularly confirming editing of the promoterless luciferase into 6% to 12% of the F8 alleles, which we believe to be therapeutically relevant, as depicted in Figure 6 below. 
 
Figure 6. In vivo Gene Editing. In the active groups, liver-specific expression of luciferase was observed up to 60 days and gene correction efficiencies were observed in a range of 6% to 12%.
 In a subsequent study we conducted in 2017 using our internal manufacturing process, an AAVHSC15 construct, at a dose of 1.5e14vg/kg, containing homology arms specific to the murine F8 locus was injected into mice (N=3) intravenously. Genomic DNA from the livers were extracted at seven days post-injection in this study and editing efficiency was determined molecularly. As depicted in Figure 7 below, F8 gene correction editing efficiencies averaging 19.5% were observed. 
 
Figure 7. In vivo Gene Editing. In the dosed group, liver-specific expression of luciferase was observed up to seven days post-injection and gene correction efficiencies were observed averaging 19.5%.
Ability to Introduce Entire Gene into the Genome Mediated via HR 
 In order to generate evidence regarding this gene editing capability, we carried out cellular assays with the widely used reporter protein green fluorescent protein, or GFP, which glows visibly green when it is expressed in a cell. In this study, which was conducted in 2016 at Charles River Labs in the Netherlands in collaboration with Charles River Labs and COH, a series of AAV vectors using sequences from widely used strains such as AAV2, AAV6, and AAV8, as well as our AAVHSC strains was constructed such that a promoterless copy of the gene for GFP was surrounded by 1,600 base pairs of an endogenous human gene, PPP1R12C. Previous work demonstrated that these surrounding sequences or homology arms can direct the process of HR into the genomic DNA at the desired site. Genes require promoters to signal the cell machinery to copy the gene instructions into messenger RNA or mRNA, which is then turned into protein. The artificial GFP construct alone is unable to direct the synthesis of mRNA and therefore no GFP protein can be synthesized from the episomal vector. The PPP1R12C gene sequences are homologous to a specific region in the human genome and are meant to direct the incorporation of GFP into the 
 13


genome of the human near a particular, known endogenous promoter. The synthesis of GFP protein, as detected by its fluorescence, can be used as a surrogate for the successful integration of the GFP gene downstream of this promoter. 
 These GFP constructs were introduced into a broad panel of human cell lines and primary cells and recombination frequencies were determined using bioluminescence from expression of GFP. All cells were treated with a multiplicity of infection of 150,000. AAVHSCs resulted in much higher GFP positive cells and thus HR events than other AAV strains. This high level of HR has been observed with multiple genomic targets and independently confirmed in multiple laboratories. These data were published in PNAS in July 2018. 
 
Figure 8. Targeted gene correction of AAVHSCs vs. other AAV strains was measured by assaying for the expression of GFP. Our AAVHSCs resulted in significantly higher GFP expression compared to other AAV strains, indicating higher levels of HR. 
 Direct confirmation of HR was observed using a DNA-based assay that can detect the insertion of the GFP gene at the desired location in the genome. The level of GFP expression was found to directly correlate to the recombination frequency. Furthermore, studies in cell lines with various mutations in DNA repair and recombination genes identified BRCA2 as a critical gene in AAVHSC-directed gene editing. Mutations in BRCA2, a gene that encodes a protein known to be essential for HR, completely eliminate gene editing but have no effect on transduction efficiencies, thereby providing evidence that the gene editing is accomplished through HR. 
 We believe our approach, when compared to published third party data, can result in significantly higher and therapeutically meaningful in vivo gene correction efficiencies than those provided by existing methods, although we have not conducted any head-to-head studies comparing our AAVHSCs with existing products or treatment methods. In a 2015 study described in Nature and depicted in the second bar from the right in figure below for illustrative purposes, third-party researchers injected a gene editing construct, packaged in AAV8, targeting the murine albumin gene with a cDNA encoding human Factor 9, a gene responsible for encoding the production of a protein called coagulation factor IX, into a C57BL6 mouse at a dosage of 5e13vg/kg (N=7). Genomic DNA was harvested from the livers at 14 weeks post-dosing and a two-step nested qPCR assay was used to quantify the percentage of alleles with the integration of human Factor 9. The efficiency was determined to be approximately 0.5%. A qPCR assay was then used to measure the percentage of mRNA transcripts with the integration of human Factor 9. This assay was based on primers specific for the wild type albumin transcript and another set specific to the albumin transcript with the integration of human Factor 9. In this assay, the estimated proportion of transcripts from the edited allele was determined to be approximately 0.1%. 
 14


In an unrelated 2017 study described in EMBO Molecular Medicine and depicted in the far right bar in the figure below for illustrative purposes, third-party researchers injected a gene editing construct, packaged in AAV8, targeting the murine albumin gene with a cDNA encoding human UGT1A1, a gene belonging to a family of genes responsible for encoding the production of certain enzymes, into a mouse model at a dosage of 1e12 total vg (N=6). In this study, the estimated editing efficiency was determined through immunohistochemical assessment of hepatocytes staining positive for human UGT1A1. Using this method, the estimated efficiency was determined to range from 0.033% at one month post-dosing to 0.015% at one year post-dosing. 
 
Figure 9. Significantly higher and therapeutically meaningful in vivo gene correction efficiencies observed in the livers of mice using our approach compared to published third party data.
 We have successfully inserted full-length cDNA encoding luciferase and PAH into two separate genomic regions in vivo reaching levels of efficiency required for therapeutic efficacy. The ability to introduce entire genes specifically into the genome at these efficiencies provides an opportunity to target multiple monogenic diseases where the correction of a defective gene would result in therapeutic benefit. Given that a majority of monogenic diseases harbor mutations that render the gene inactive, we believe our gene correction modality can be expanded well beyond our initial focus on liver-based inborn errors of metabolism.
 High Precision and Lack of Unwanted Off-target or On-target DNA Modifications 
 Using next-generation sequencing, we have developed methodologies to test for on-target mutations at the site of integration. Using these methods, we observed that HR using our AAVHSCs is very precise at the site of correction. We have amplified the corrected region in the genome and sequenced more than 2 million reads and were not able to detect any indels or traces of viral sequence at the detection limit of this sequencing. 
 We developed a method to enable whole genome unbiased next-generation sequencing for the detection and mapping of off-target integration sites. By leveraging the potential ability of our AAVHSCs to drive HR-based targeted integration we can utilize next-generation sequencing technologies to identify and quantify where the inserted sequence maps. Using this method, and based on over 2.2 million sequence reads, we estimate that 99.967% of insertions are at the targeted site and that the balance is within expected background of the assay.
 Ability to Target Multiple Tissues 
 Through intravenous administration of our AAVHSCs into rodents and non-human primates, we have generated evidence of their ability to target a number of tissues including: 
  
• | crossing the blood-brain barrier to neurons throughout the brain, spinal cord, and dorsal root ganglion;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | retinal ganglion cells and neurons of the retinal outer nuclear layer; we have also demonstrated the ability to target retinal tissue via intravenous injection as well as multiple layers of target cells through sub-retinal injection;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | skeletal muscle myocytes in all skeletal muscle tissues examined, including gastrocnemius, soleus, diaphragm, esophagus, and biceps;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | cardiomyocytes throughout the heart; and
--+-----------------------------------------


• | extensive liver tropism.
--+-------------------------

 In vivo Administration with a Single Component Delivery System
Our platform is designed to perform gene editing at higher efficiency without the use of a nuclease, enabling us to deliver genetic medicines in vivo using a single vector system. Existing nuclease-based gene editing technologies, when replacing a defective gene with a functional gene through gene editing, require the use of two or more different vector constructs in combination to perform their gene editing functions. One or more vector constructs house the nuclease, and the other vector construct houses the DNA template, and all vectors must reach and penetrate the specific target cell at the same time to edit the DNA. In contrast to these nuclease-based gene editing technologies, our AAVHSC technology is a single component system that contains everything required to selectively edit DNA across all gene editing methods with no need for additional exogenous nucleases, template DNA or editing machinery. 
 We believe our ability to perform gene editing at efficiencies that are significantly greater than both nuclease-based and other AAV-based approaches, coupled with our single component delivery system, enable us to administer genetic medicines in vivo. We believe the advantages of in vivo administration of therapeutics via a single component delivery system include the following: 
  
• | simpler and faster manufacturing relative to ex vivo resulting in reduced manufacturing costs;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | improved delivery of therapeutic as only a single vector is required to reach a cell instead of multiple vectors;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ease of use for the patient, eliminating the need for bone marrow extraction, a common requirement for many ex vivo gene editing therapies; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | improved safety profile, eliminating the risk of rejection or other unwanted immune response that can result from the administration of an ex vivo therapy.

 Ability to Target a Broad Range of Patients Given Low Frequency of Preexisting Neutralizing Antibodies 
 A potential concern for all AAV vectors is the presence of preexisting neutralizing antibodies that have the potential to reduce their effectiveness. We conducted a study across 100 human serum donors representing different ethnic segments of the U.S. population. Based on the initial results, we believe the findings suggest that approximately 80% of individuals lack antibodies that recognize AAVHSCs, which is comparable to AAV9, a commonly used vector for development of other gene therapies. These findings were published in Human Gene Therapy Clinical Development in March 2018.Our Product Candidates 
 We believe our genetic medicines platform can be applied broadly to treat and cure a wide range of genetic diseases, and have carefully designed and prioritized our pipeline strategy to maximize this opportunity. We are initially pursuing diseases where the genetic abnormality is known and is found in a single gene. These are also known as monogenic diseases. We therefore know exactly what we are correcting and exactly what gene to insert into the patient’s cells, thus mitigating against the uncertainty of the disease biology. We are prioritizing monogenic diseases with significant unmet medical needs, validated regulatory pathways and significant commercial opportunities. We are currently focused on developing product candidates to treat monogenic diseases in the liver, bone marrow and the CNS, given that our AAVHSCs naturally show a high degree of tropism or ability to preferentially target cells in these organs and organ systems. These tissues are affected in many rare genetic diseases. 
 HMI-102 for Treatment of PKU in Adult Patients and HMI-103 for Treatment of PKU in Pediatric Patients
 Our lead program, HMI-102, is an AAVHSC vector gene therapy candidate designed to treat PAH deficiency, the underlying genetic cause of PKU. We have received orphan drug designation from the FDA and the EMA for the use of AAVHSCs expressing PAH for the treatment of PAH deficiency, the primary cause of PKU. We expect to initiate a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in PKU patients and to report initial clinical data in 2019. HMI-102 is intended to treat adult patients with deficiencies in PAH regardless of the specific underlying PAH mutation. We are also developing HMI-103, an AAVHSC vector gene editing candidate, to address the pediatric PKU population. HMI-103 is designed to replace the defective PAH gene through the targeted integration of a normal copy into the PAH genomic region. We are in IND-enabling studies with HMI-103.
 PKU Disease Overview 
 PKU is an inborn error of metabolism that results from mutations in the PAH gene. PAH is an enzyme that is normally expressed in the liver and is necessary to metabolize dietary phenylalanine, or Phe, to the amino acid tyrosine, which is a precursor to several neurotransmitters including dopamine. PKU results from mutations in PAH that render its enzymatic activity deficient. If it is not metabolized by PAH, Phe builds up throughout the body, including in the blood and the nervous system. Approximately 75% of all dietary Phe is typically metabolized by PAH so the absence of PAH leads directly to the pathological excess of Phe as well as a deficiency of tyrosine. Excessive blood Phe and low levels of tyrosine result in intellectual disability, which is possibly caused by a variety of mechanisms including effects on neuronal development, myelination, and neurotransmitter synthesis. Blood Phe is an easily measurable and translatable biomarker. It is also a surrogate clinical endpoint in clinical trials for PKU, facilitating both a rapid path to the clinic and characterization of therapeutic response.
 Newborns in all 50 states are screened for PKU. It has been estimated that the incidence of PKU in the United States is one in 12,707, which translates to approximately 300 cases per year with an overall prevalence of 15,000. It has also been estimated that the prevalence of PKU in the European Union is 25,000. Worldwide, the estimated prevalence is 50,000. 
 The majority of patients are identified soon after birth and are primarily treated by dietary restriction of Phe. While Phe-restricted diets have dramatically reduced the intellectual deficiencies associated with this disease, they fail to address the cognitive and behavioral problems that continue throughout a patient’s life. Lifetime adherence to a Phe-restricted diet is challenging and blood Phe is not achievable within the recommended range for the vast majority of patients. The inability to achieve recommended levels of Phe results in neurological as well as metabolic problems. Long-term studies in adults identify neurocognitive, psychosocial, quality of life, growth, nutrition, bone pathology and maternal PKU outcomes that are suboptimal despite early and continuous treatment. In a retrospective study of PKU patients, young children were adherent to Phe-restricted diet, whereas most adolescents (79%) did not achieve recommended Phe levels, and 88% of adults were no longer on a Phe-restricted diet. Relaxing of dietary restrictions beyond preschool years, or failure to adhere to physician-
 17


assigned diets, which is the current guideline for most adolescents and adults, results in loss of metabolic control and wide fluctuations in Phe levels that are both directly associated with progressive neurological damage.
 We conducted a five-year retrospective chart review of PKU patients, which confirmed key elements of our proposed Phase 1/2 clinical trial design. Consistent findings from two PKU academic centers of excellence in the U.S. in 152 PKU patients showed that actively monitored patients, including those on restrictive low Phe diet, had Phe levels well-above the generally accepted threshold of 360 umol/L, underscoring the need for treatments that restore the normal biochemical pathway. Furthermore, we established that elevated Phe was higher in the classic PKU population, defined as patients with Phe levels greater than 1200 umol/L (66% of the study population), and was significantly elevated in the adult population compared to those patients who were less than 18 years of age.
 
Figure 12. Retrospective five-year chart review demonstrates actively monitored Classic PKU patients across two academic centers have Phe levels >700 umol/L.
 Current Treatments 
 There are currently no available treatments that address the core underlying genetic biochemical defect in PKU, the deficiency of PAH. 
 Saproterin dihydrochloride, or Kuvan, is an FDA approved therapy to reduce elevations in serum Phe. Saproterin is a synthetic version of BH4, a cofactor that is required for PAH activity. The addition of saproterin helps deficient PAH to metabolize some Phe. However, clinical data suggests that saproterin is not fully effective in lowering high serum levels of Phe back to normal levels and must be used in conjunction with a low Phe diet. Kuvan reported worldwide sales of $434 million in 2018. 
 Pegvaliase, or Palynziq, is a pegylated plant-derived enzyme called phenylalanine ammonia lyase that was approved in the U.S. by the FDA in 2018. This approach does not correct the underlying genetic disorder (PAH deficiency) and will not reconstitute the natural pathway that is needed to address the neurocognitive defects associated with PKU. We believe Palynziq to have certain limitations including that it must be administered via multiple daily injections and its label contains a black box warning that it causes severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) that may be life threatening and can happen at any time during treatment with Palynziq. The label states that patients must carry auto-injectable epinephrine with them at all times during Palynziq treatment. In 2016, BioMarin reported that patients in its Phase 3 trials did not meet the secondary efficacy endpoints for cognitive benefit. 
 Our Gene Therapy and Gene Editing Approaches to PKU 
 We are taking two approaches towards developing a potential therapy for PKU. The first is a gene therapy in which a gene construct encoding human PAH is delivered to liver cells where it directs production of normal PAH via episomal expression driven off an exogenous promoter. The second potential therapy involves true gene correction of the defect found in the chromosomes of affected patients. We believe that the gene therapy approach offers an expedited clinical development path towards delivery of a therapeutic to adult patients where the majority of target cells are non-dividing in the liver. We believe the gene correction approach would be more efficient in newborn and pediatric patients due to the higher rate of dividing cells 
 18


as the child grows. The goal of both approaches is to enable production of functional PAH, thus restoring the normal biochemical pathway of Phe metabolism. This can reduce the abnormally high levels of Phe in the blood, while also increasing tyrosine levels, the product of PAH-driven Phe metabolism. Using gene editing to correct the defective PAH gene in young patients has the potential to provide long-term benefit as the corrected gene will persist as cells replicate. Correcting the gene while it remains under the control of its natural promoter early in disease progression has the potential to normalize not only Phe levels, but also tyrosine levels, the product of the PAH enzyme and a precursor to neurotransmitter synthesis. This may allow affected children to avoid many of the serious neurological consequences associated with PKU. 
 We believe that an effective gene therapy or gene correction for PKU has the potential to eliminate the need for Phe restricted diet and may lead to significant improvements in the morbidity and quality of life for patients. Published estimates suggest that restoration of PAH activity to 10% or more of normal levels would lead to significant improvements in serum Phe levels and potentially represent a curative therapy. 
 HMI-102: Our Gene Therapy Approach for PKU
 We identified HMI-102 as our lead product candidate after screening multiple vector constructs. HMI-102 consists of an AAVHSC15 vector containing the coding sequence of human PAH under control of a promoter designed to continuously express PAH, specifically in the liver. We chose AAVHSC15 as the basis of this product candidate because of its observed propensity to target liver cells, the normal site for PAH protein expression.
 The potential of an AAVHSC15-delivered PAH gene was assessed in a well-established mouse model of PKU called the ENU2 mouse. This model contains a mutation in the murine Pah gene that results in abolished activity and results in elevated serum Phe levels. Baseline levels of serum Phe in these mice are approximately 1,500 micromoles per liter compared to normal levels of 80 micromoles per liter, levels that are similar to those seen in classic PKU patients and normal controls, respectively. Single intravenous injections of HMI-102 into these deficient mice resulted in reductions of serum Phe to levels that are within the range for normal mice. As depicted in Figure 13, the reduction in serum Phe levels persisted for 48 weeks in treated mice on a normal protein diet, consistent with the lifespan of the model. In addition to a reduction in serum Phe, the administration of our gene therapy candidate also resulted in elevations of serum tyrosine due to the restoration of the normal biochemical pathway.
 

19


Figure 13. A single injection of HMI-102 resulted in rapid and sustained reductions in serum Phe and increased tyrosine levels in PAH deficient mice that are on a regular diet. 
 A subsequent study was performed to further characterize the effect of HMI-102 on normalizing levels of Phe and neurotransmitter metabolism in the brain. As shown in Figure 14, a single administration of HMI-102 in the ENU2 mouse model reduced levels of Phe in the brain to normal levels as measured at 4 weeks post-dosing. Furthermore, the brain concentrations of 5-HIAA, a metabolite of serotonin, was increased to normal levels. These results indicate that HMI-102 administration directly impacts the metabolic pathway associated with loss of PAH.

Figure 14. HMI-102 normalizes key neurological measures underscoring restoration of normal biochemical pathway.
 During the development of our AAVHSC15 genetic medicine candidates, we tested for liver transduction comparisons across species, specifically in mice and non-human primates, to establish a dosing rationale based on weight. Vector genomes were measured in the livers of both mice and non-human primates from multiple studies across two doses that result in restoration of the normal Phe biochemical pathway in mice. The results of these studies, shown in Figure 15 below, demonstrate that dosing based on weight resulted in equivalent levels of vector genomes in the livers of mice and non-human primates, suggesting that one-to-one weight-based scaling is appropriate for our AAVHSC15 candidates as we project doses for the clinical development of our candidates.

20

 HMI-103: Our Gene Editing Approach for PKU
 In order to address the pediatric PKU population, we are developing a gene editing therapy for PKU that is designed to replace the defective PAH gene with a normal copy. This therapy is designed to correct the defect in treated liver cells, such that they would be indistinguishable from those from an unaffected individual. These cells would direct the synthesis of PAH from its natural promoter, and therefore would be capable of normal regulation of its expression. The corrected copy of the PAH gene would be retained as these cells divide into daughter cells as the liver grows. Screening for PKU of all newborns in the United States allows the identification of affected individuals before serious neurological complications develop. We believe our AAVHSC vector HR approach possesses the efficacy and safety characteristics that would be appropriate to treat PKU in newly identified patients. As we further develop our expertise in treating PKU by correcting the defective PAH gene in the liver, we intend to develop treatments for other inborn errors of metabolism in the liver. 
 We have conducted in vivo experiments showing the integration of a promoterless human PAH cDNA into the human PAH gene locus using a humanized liver mouse model. In this model, human hepatocytes constitute the majority of the liver cells, providing an in vivo model to test human specific editing constructs for the integration and expression of human PAH. Injection of our lead human AAVHSC PAH editing candidate in this model results in the insertion of a promoterless PAH cDNA into the human PAH gene and mRNA expression of the corrected PAH. Figure 16 below shows a comparison of the levels of corrected PAH gene expression from the human liver model to that observed using a murine-specific editing construct in the ENU2 PKU model that is known to restore Phe metabolism. As depicted, we can achieve levels of human-specific PAH gene editing and expression of the corrected PAH in the human liver that are known to correct the phenotype in the mouse. Furthermore, the human-specific editing candidate does not edit in the murine cells that are in the humanized liver model, showing selectivity to human only.
 Based on these data, we have nominated HMI-103 as a product development candidate consisting of an AAVHSC15 vector and the PAH gene with flanking homology arms and have initiated IND-enabling studies using our gene editing approach for the treatment of the pediatric PKU population.

Figure 16. HMI-103 targets human PAH gene and results in corrective levels of gene expression as measured by edited mRNA in an in vivo humanized murine model.
 Additional Product Opportunities 
 CNS Diseases 
 Our CNS programs, which are initially focused on MLD, are designed to take advantage of our AAVHSCs’ natural ability to cross the blood-brain barrier in non-human primates. 
 21


HMI-202: Our Gene Therapy for MLD
 We have nominated a product development candidate, HMI-202, for the treatment of MLD, our lead CNS program and have initiated IND-enabling studies. MLD is a lysosomal storage disease caused by mutation of a gene called arylsulfatase A, or ARSA. The protein ARSA is required for the breakdown of cellular metabolic products that in MLD accumulate in all cells of the body. Cells responsible for the production of myelin are especially sensitive to the toxic build-up of these cellular metabolic products, leading to progressive serious neurological deterioration. The late infantile form of MLD, which is the most common form, includes rapidly progressive motor and cognitive decline and loss of vision. The majority of these patients do not survive past the first decade of life. Stem cell transplants are currently the only effective treatment but have significant drawbacks, including the use of immunosuppression therapy, delayed onset of ARSA expression post engraftment, conditioning regimens, and the risk of death from the stem cell transplant.
 We have generated preclinical data showing that a single intravenous dose of HMI-202 crossed the blood-brain-barrier in a mouse model and had broad tissue tropism in physiologically relevant regions of the CNS, resulting in increased human ARSA enzyme activity to levels well-above the therapeutic threshold when compared to average adult human enzyme activity. Human ARSA enzyme activity levels between 10 to 375% of normal were observed and well-tolerated in a dose responsive manner after IV administration, as depicted in Figure 17. It is believed that levels of enzyme activity of 10 to 15% of normal could potentially be curative, based on human data from healthy subjects with enzyme activity levels in this range. 

Figure 17. Single IV administration of HMI-202 gene therapy MLD development candidate results in therapeutic levels of ARSA in relevant brain regions.
 Other CNS Diseases
 Another CNS disease we are evaluating is Friedreich’s ataxia or FA. In FA, mutations in a gene called frataxin, or FXN, lead to progressive deterioration of the spinal cord leading to difficulty walking and eventual complete incapacitation and shortened life-span. FA is the most common form of inherited ataxia with a prevalence of 1:40,000. Other diseases in this area include a subset of Parkinson’s disease which is associated with Gaucher disease. Gaucher disease patients have a defect in the gene for glucocerebrosidase which is important for various processes in the body and in certain patients these mutations also lead to the development of Parkinson’s disease. We believe our gene therapy technology has the potential to address directly the deficiency in glucocerebrosidase in the brain in a manner that is not possible with other Gaucher disease treatments that do not cross the blood-brain barrier.
 22


Hemoglobinopathies 
 We are also pursuing treatment of diseases that affect blood cells such as sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia using our AAVHSC vector HR technology. We believe that our potential ability to correct the defective beta globin gene in blood precursor cells may lead to long-term functional cures for affected patients. Sickle cell disease affects over 100,000 individuals and beta thalassemia over 1,000 individuals in the United States.
Ophthalmological Diseases 
 A number of serious, but rare diseases of the eye such as Leber’s congenital amaurosis and Choroideremia, as well as more common diseases such as macular degeneration have been targeted using gene therapy approaches by academic groups as well as the pharmaceutical industry. Certain of our AAVHSCs have shown the unique ability to deliver genes to the eye when administered intravenously. Furthermore, in preclinical studies we conducted at our headquarters in 2017 in a minipig model, we evaluated the ability of our AAVHSCs, containing a vector that expresses a GFP transgene, to transduce retinal cells following localized delivery via subretinal injection to the eye at a dose of 1.3e12vg/kg (N=2). Expression of GFP was seen in all layers of the retina including the retinal pigment epithelium, photoreceptors and the outer nuclear layer out to day 28 and the AAVHSC subretinal treatment was well tolerated. We believe these studies suggest that our AAVHSCs have the potential to be useful as therapeutic vectors for treating retinal diseases in humans based on significant tropism to these target cells. We believe that these vectors have the potential to deliver long-lasting therapeutic benefit to patients that may eliminate the need for the regular and burdensome intravitreal injections that are required for many current treatments. We are collaborating with Novartis, experts in developing and marketing ophthalmic drugs, for select ophthalmology programs. 
Manufacturing 
 As a company committed to curing diseases, the ability to deliver our novel therapeutic vectors to patients is critical. Therefore, we have built strong internal scientific AAV process development and manufacturing capabilities and we have invested in a cGMP manufacturing facility to support our clinical development programs. We have established scalable manufacturing platforms for both gene editing and gene therapy. We view the development of internal manufacturing capacity and expertise as a key competitive advantage as it allows for better control over process development timelines, costs and intellectual property, and allows us to master our unique technology. Our process development and manufacturing teams are composed of industry veterans in the field of AAV and protein technologies, as well as experts in our novel AAVHSCs, with experience in both early development and commercialization of therapeutics. 
 Our process development and manufacturing strategy is to leverage technology platforms for both gene therapy and gene editing that are scalable and facilitate rapid development to the clinic. The gene therapy and gene editing platforms include development from vector design through to drug product manufacture. Expertise and learnings will be leveraged across both platform technologies. 
 Our gene therapy manufacturing strategy initially focuses on utilizing mammalian cells for our AAVHSC vector-based product candidates. Our current production process for the PKU program utilizes HEK293 cells in a serum free suspension bioreactor. The HEK293 is a well-characterized system and commonly used host cell for many clinical stage AAV vector products. Additionally, these cells are familiar to regulatory authorities and commercial raw materials and reagents are readily available. We have established a relationship with a contract manufacturing organization, or CMO, who has expertise in the use of HEK293 gene therapy manufacturing. We have established an external and internal cGMP manufacturing process to supply Phase 1/2 and pivotal trial material for our PKU clinical development program.
 Our gene editing manufacturing strategy is to internally control the process development and manufacturing to safeguard the proprietary nature of our technology, as well as to master all aspects of this technology. Furthermore, as part of our research and development collaboration with Novartis, we have retained process development and manufacturing rights to the gene editing programs included within the collaboration. 
 We have constructed a 25,000 square foot cGMP manufacturing facility that can accommodate both gene therapy and gene editing pipeline programs. Our new manufacturing facility includes multiple bioreactor suites and we expect to process multiple product candidates in parallel. The initial bioreactor scale is 500 liters, with the capability to increase capacity to 2,000 liters. This will give us the ability to produce large scale volumes and support our growing pipeline. Our manufacturing model leverages single use, disposable, closed system operations aligned to our gene therapy and gene editing technology platforms to ensure flexibility, robust quality and cost effectiveness. Our manufacturing facility is expected to be available for cGMP manufacturing of our product candidates in the first half of 2019.

Competition 
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including in the gene therapy and gene editing fields, are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on intellectual property and proprietary products. While we believe that our technology, development experience and scientific knowledge provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies, and public and private research institutions that conduct research, seek patent protection, and establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing, and commercialization. Not only must we compete with other companies that are focused on gene therapy and/or gene editing technologies, any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. 
 We compete in the segments of the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other related markets that utilize technologies encompassing genomic medicines to create therapies, including gene therapy and gene editing. There are additional companies that are working to develop therapies in areas related to our research programs.
 Our platform and product focus is the development of genetic medicines using our proprietary AAVHSCs in vivo either through the gene therapy or nuclease-free gene editing modality. If our current programs are approved for the indications for which we are currently planning clinical trials, they may compete with other products currently under development, including gene editing and gene therapy products or other types of therapies, such as small molecule, antibody or protein therapies. If our PKU treatments are approved, they may compete with therapies from BioMarin, Synlogic, Censa Pharmaceuticals, Rubius Therapeutics, Nestle Health and American Gene Technologies. However, we believe that only gene therapy or gene editing approaches have the potential to restore the normal Phe biochemical pathway with a single administration. As such, the major competition in this space may be limited to BioMarin and American Gene Technologies, both of which are behind our development program according to public filings. If our MLD treatment is approved, it may compete with therapies from Orchard Therapeutics and/or Shire. We believe that our in vivo gene therapy approach for MLD could be used early in the disease progression with the potential for earlier protein expression, offering advantages over Orchard’s ex vivo approach, as well as advantages over chronic, intrathecal enzyme replacement therapies, such as Shire’s approach. There are a number of companies developing nuclease-based gene editing technologies using CRISPR/Cas9, TALENs, meganucleases, Mega-TALs and ZFNs, including bluebird bio, Caribou Biosciences, Cellectis, CRISPR Therapeutics, Editas Medicine, Intellia Therapeutics, Precision BioSciences and Sangamo Therapeutics and non-nuclease-based technology, including LogicBio Therapeutics, however none of these are developing a treatment for PKU or MLD.
 In addition, many of our current or potential competitors, either alone or with their collaboration partners, have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and gene therapy industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our programs are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience and availability of reimbursement. 
 Furthermore, we rely upon a combination of patents and trade secret protection, as well as license and confidentiality agreements to protect the intellectual property related to our proprietary technologies, product candidate development programs and product candidates. Our success depends in large part on our ability to secure and maintain patent protection in the United States and other countries with respect to HMI-102 and any future product candidates. Moreover, our industry is characterized by the existence of large numbers of patents and frequent allegations of patent infringement. If, therefore, we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for our technology and products or if the scope of the patent protection obtained or in-licensed is not sufficiently broad or if the validity of such patent is threatened, we may not be able to compete effectively in our markets, as it could create opportunities for competitors to enter the market or dissuade other companies from collaborating with us to develop products and technology, any of which would hurt our competitive position and could impair our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates in any indication for which they are approved. For more information regarding these competitive risks, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”

Intellectual Property 
 Our success depends in large part upon our ability to secure and maintain proprietary protection for our technologies and products and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others. Our policy is to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing or collaboration with our licensors to file U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also use other forms of protection, such as confidential information and trademark protection, particularly where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable.
 Our patent portfolio consists of a combination of issued patents and pending patent applications that are licensed from third parties. As of December 31, 2018, we have an exclusive license or co-exclusive license under 11 United States issued patents and 35 patent applications, pending in the United States and internationally. 
 For any individual patent, the term depends on the applicable law in the country in which the patent is granted. In most countries where we have filed patent applications or in-licensed patents and patent applications, patents have a term of 20 years from the application filing date or earliest claimed non-provisional priority date. In the United States, the patent term is 20 years but may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over another patent that expires earlier. The term of a U.S. patent may also be lengthened by a patent term adjustment, in order to address administrative delays by the United States Patent and Trademark Office in granting a patent. 
 In the United States, the term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug or biologic may be eligible for patent term extension in order to restore the period of a patent term lost during the premarket FDA regulatory review process. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the natural expiration of the patent. The patent term restoration period is generally equal to the regulatory review period for the approved product which period occurs after the date the patent issued, subject to certain exceptions. Only one patent may be extended for a regulatory review period for any product, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. In the future, we may decide to apply for restoration of patent term for one of our currently owned or licensed patents to extend its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical studies and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant BLA. 
 Licensed Intellectual Property 
 Certain of our issued patents and pending patent applications are exclusively licensed to us in all fields of use from COH. Certain of our issued patents and pending patent applications are co-exclusively licensed to us in all human therapeutic applications with and from the California Institute of Technology, or Caltech. 
The City of Hope Portfolio 
 In April 2016, we exclusively licensed two families of patents and patent applications directed to novel AAV capsids and their manufacture and methods of use, including their use in genome editing from COH. 
 These two families of patents and patent applications together include nine granted patents in the United States and 13 pending applications in the United States, Europe, Canada, Australia and other selected countries in Central America, South America, and Asia. The first family of issued patents and patent applications is material to HMI-102 and relates to our novel AAV capsids and vectors and their use in cellular transduction. The eight issued U.S. patents in this family are expected to expire in 2031, and may be extended by up to five years in certain countries via patent term extension depending on the regulatory pathway of the products covered by such patents. The second family includes one issued U.S. patent and patent applications directed to our AAV capsids, their methods of manufacture, and their use in genome editing. The issued patent in this family is expected to expire in 2035, and may be extended by up to five years in certain countries via patent term extension depending on the regulatory pathway of the products covered by such patents. 
 The Caltech Portfolio 
 In September 2016, we co-exclusively licensed, with another commercial third party, two families of patents and patent applications directed to novel AAV capsids and vectors that demonstrate enhanced blood-brain barrier penetration for the potential treatment of CNS diseases from Caltech. 
 These families of patents and patent applications include two granted patents in the United States and 22 pending applications in the United States, Europe, Canada, Australia and other selected countries in Central America, South America, 
 25


and Asia, and one international patent application under the Patent Cooperation Treaty. The two issued U.S. patents relate to novel AAV capsids and vectors and are expected to expire in 2034. Certain other patent applications directed to novel AAV capsids and vectors, if they were to issue, may have later expirations. 
 We also rely on trade secrets, technical know-how and continuing innovation to develop and maintain our competitive advantage. Our policy requires inventors who are identified on any company-owned patent applications to assign rights to us. We also rely on confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and other advisors to protect our proprietary information. Our policy is to require third parties that receive material confidential information to enter into confidentiality agreements with us. 
 Trademarks 
 Our trademarks Homology Medicines and HMI are pending or registered in the United States and certain international countries. We currently own three pending trademark applications in the United States, approximately 20 registered trademarks around the world, as well as 13 pending trademark applications. This includes our trademarks Homology Medicines, AMEnDR, and HMI, which are pending or registered in the United States and certain other countries. 
Strategic Collaborations 
 Collaboration and License Agreement with the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Inc. 
 In November 2017, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Novartis, pursuant to which we agreed to collaborate on researching, developing, and commercializing novel genome editing products that modulate certain gene targets. 
 Under the terms of the agreement, we and Novartis agreed to collaborate to identify and synthesize gene editing vector candidates that modulate certain ophthalmic gene targets, against which Novartis agreed to develop licensed products. Our obligation to perform research for the targets will continue for five years from the effective date of the agreement. 
 We and Novartis agreed also to collaborate to explore the applicability of our technology with respect to other gene targets. Our obligation to perform such exploratory research concludes in November 2020. 
 In February 2019, Novartis elected to discontinue our collaboration on the sickle cell disease program with an effective date of August 2019. We continue to work with Novartis to identify new targets for the partnership based on the existing exploratory research component of our agreement, and our collaboration on two ophthalmic programs also continues. We have assumed all worldwide rights to the sickle cell disease program, and our efforts to develop an in vivo gene editing approach are ongoing.
 Subject to certain limitations pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Novartis will be responsible for the internal and external costs incurred by us for the research activities as contemplated under the agreement. Novartis will also pay for the development of gene editing vector candidates and licensed products. 
 Subject to the terms of the agreement, we will generally be responsible for manufacturing gene editing vector candidates for certain ophthalmic gene targets for research, and gene editing vector candidates and licensed products for development and commercialization, and Novartis will bear all such manufacturing costs that we incur. 
 Subject to the terms of the agreement, taking into account Novartis’ election to discontinue our collaboration on the sickle cell disease program, we have granted Novartis the following licenses: (i) a worldwide, non-exclusive, sublicensable license under certain of our intellectual property rights to perform Novartis’ responsibilities under the applicable research plan; (ii) a worldwide, sublicensable license under certain of our intellectual property rights to conduct preclinical development activities, which license is co-exclusive (with us) during the research term, and exclusive for the remainder of the term of the agreement; (iii) a worldwide, non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable license, without the right to grant sublicenses, to use certain reagents generated as a result of our exploratory research activities under the agreement solely for Novartis’ internal research purposes; (iv) an exclusive, royalty-bearing, sublicensable license under certain of our intellectual property rights to develop and commercialize certain gene editing vector candidates and licensed products directed to certain ophthalmic gene targets; (v) as of the effective date, a co-exclusive (with us), royalty-bearing, sublicensable, worldwide license under certain of our intellectual property rights to manufacture certain gene editing vector candidates and/or licensed products directed to certain ophthalmic gene targets, which license will be exclusive as of a certain date on which Novartis is permitted to manufacture certain gene editing vector candidates and/or licensed products pursuant to the terms of the agreement; and (vi) a non-
 26


exclusive, royalty-free, fully paid, perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide license under certain of our intellectual property rights in connection with research, development, manufacturing, commercialization or other exploitation of products or services. 
 Subject to the terms of the agreement, Novartis granted to us the following licenses: (i) a worldwide, non-exclusive, sublicensable license under certain of Novartis’ intellectual property rights to perform certain research activities during the research term and (ii) a non-exclusive, royalty-bearing, perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, sublicensable license under certain of Novartis’ intellectual property rights that may arise under the agreement that relate to our manufacturing know-how for our manufacture of gene editing vector candidates and products created using our platform technology. 
 Under the terms of the agreement, we received an upfront payment of $35.0 million and Novartis also purchased shares of our Series B preferred stock for an aggregate purchase price of $15.0 million. Taking into consideration Novartis’ election to discontinue our collaboration on the sickle cell disease program, we are also eligible to receive up to a total of $10.0 million upon completion of certain development candidate selection activities. In addition, we are eligible to receive up to a total of $530.0 million in milestone payments, including up to $180.0 million in development milestone payments, up to $170.0 million in regulatory milestone payments and up to $180.0 million in commercial milestone payments, with respect to the licensed products. We are also eligible to earn tiered royalties on net sales of licensed products by Novartis, its affiliates or sublicensees ranging from mid single-digit to sub-teen double-digit percentages, which royalties are potentially subject to various reductions and offsets. If any of the exploratory research efforts are advanced into formal research and development programs, the parties will negotiate the economics including potential milestone payments for such programs.
 The term of the agreement continues on a target-by-target basis until the expiration of all royalty payment obligations for the licensed products that modulate the applicable target on a country-by-country basis. Our royalty obligations under the agreement continue on a country-by-country and licensed product-by-licensed product basis until the later of (a) 10 years after the first commercial sale of such licensed product in a country, (b) the date on which such licensed product is no longer covered by certain intellectual property rights, and (c) the date on which certain regulatory exclusivity for such product expires. Either party may terminate the agreement on a target-by-target basis for the other party’s material breach with respect to such target, or in the event of the other party’s bankruptcy. Novartis may terminate the agreement for convenience on a target-by-target basis. We may terminate the agreement if Novartis files, or joins a third party in filing or maintaining, a patent challenge against certain of the patent rights we license to Novartis under the terms of the agreement. 
 License Agreement with the California Institute of Technology 
 In September 2016, we entered into a license agreement with Caltech, pursuant to which Caltech granted us a co-exclusive (subject to certain reserved non-commercial rights), sublicensable, and worldwide license under certain AAV-related patents owned by Caltech for human therapeutic applications. Under this agreement, Caltech also granted us a non-exclusive, worldwide license under certain patents and other intellectual property controlled by Caltech to develop, manufacture, commercialize, and otherwise exploit products covered by such intellectual property rights for human therapeutic applications. We may grant sublicenses under the non-exclusive license to third parties to the extent necessary or useful for our, or our sublicensees’, development, manufacturing, or sale of such products. 
 Under the Caltech agreement, we paid Caltech an initial licensing fee of $100,000. We are also required to pay Caltech up to a total of $7.2 million in milestone payments for the first licensed product; royalties, in the low single-digit percentages on net sales of licensed products, subject to a certain annual minimum royalty; and mid to high single-digit percentages of sublicensing revenues. Subject to certain exceptions, our royalty obligations under the agreement continue on a country-by-country and licensed product-by-licensed product basis until the earliest of (a) the date on which such licensed product is no longer covered by certain intellectual property rights, (b) 10 years after the first commercial sale of such licensed product, or (c) 15 years after the effective date of the agreement. As partial consideration for the licenses granted under the agreement, we issued 101,405 shares of our common stock to Caltech. 
 The agreement will expire upon the expiration of the last-to-expire patent that is licensed to us or as long as royalties are due under the agreement, whichever is later. We agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to introduce commercially, and reasonably fulfill market demand for, licensed products as soon as practicable. Either party may terminate the agreement in the event of the other party’s uncured material breach and in the event of the other party’s bankruptcy or insolvency. We may terminate the agreement for convenience. 
 27


City of Hope License Agreement 
 In April 2016, we entered into a license agreement with COH, pursuant to which COH granted us an exclusive, sublicensable, worldwide license to certain AAV vector-related patents and know-how owned by COH to develop, manufacture, use and commercialize products and services covered by such patents and know-how in any and all fields. COH also granted us a non-exclusive, sublicensable, worldwide license to certain background patents owned by COH to develop, manufacture, use and commercialize licensed products and licensed services in any and all fields. 
 Under the agreement, we paid COH an initial licensing fee of $75,000, and made a subsequent payment of $4.5 million representing a percentage of sublicensing revenue. We are also required to pay COH an annual license maintenance fee; up to a total of $3.2 million in potential milestone fees; a royalty in the low single-digit percentages on net sales of licensed products or services, subject to certain reductions in certain circumstances, with a certain annual minimum royalty; and low double-digit percentages of sublicensing revenues. As partial consideration for the licenses granted under the agreement, we issued 154,837 shares of our common stock to COH. 
 The COH agreement will expire on a country-by-country and on a licensed patent-by-licensed patent basis upon the expiration of the last-to-expire valid claim of such patent in such country. We agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize licensed products and licensed services. If we fail to achieve certain diligence milestones, COH may terminate the agreement or convert the exclusive rights under the agreement from exclusive to non-exclusive. Either party may terminate the agreement in the event of the other party’s material breach, subject to an opportunity to cure, and in the event of the other party’s bankruptcy or insolvency. We may terminate the agreement for convenience. 
 Government Regulation and Product Approval 
 Governmental authorities in the U.S., at the federal, state and local level, and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, packaging, promotion, storage, advertising, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting and export and import of products such as those we are developing. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, are extensive and require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. For the purposes of this Section, the term “gene therapy” includes both traditional gene therapy products as well as gene editing and our gene correction product candidates. 
FDA Approval Process 
 We expect our future product candidates to be regulated as biologics. Biological products, including gene therapy products, are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FD&C Act, and the Public Health Service Act, or PHS Act, and other federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations. Both the FD&C Act and the PHS Act and their corresponding regulations govern, among other things, the research, development, safety, testing, packaging, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of biological products. 
 We, along with third-party contractors, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical and commercial approval requirements of the governing 
regulatory agencies of the 
countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval or licensure of our product candidates. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
U.S. Biological Products Development Process 
 The FDA determined that more than minimally manipulated products must be approved by the FDA through the Biologics License Application, or BLA, process before they may be legally marketed in the United States. The process required by the FDA before a biologic may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 

• | completion of extensive nonclinical, sometimes referred to as pre-clinical laboratory tests, and pre-clinical animal trials and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals and formulation studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including good laboratory practices, or GLPs;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND application, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 28


 
• | approval by an independent Institutional Review Board, or IRB, or ethics committee at each clinical site before the trial is commenced;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s regulations commonly referred to as good clinical practices, or GCPs, and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed biological product for its intended use;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of a BLA for marketing approval that includes substantive evidence of safety, purity, potency and efficacy from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biological product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | potential FDA audit of the nonclinical and clinical study sites that generated the data in support of the BLA; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA.
--+---------------------------------------------------

 Before testing any biological product candidate, including a gene therapy product, in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLPs. 
 The clinical study sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing and controls, information about product chemistry, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some preclinical testing, such as reproductive toxicity tests and carcinogenicity in animals, may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, after which human clinical trials may begin unless the FDA places the clinical study on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical study can begin. 
 In addition to the submission of an IND to the FDA before initiation of a clinical trial in the United States, certain human clinical trials involving recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules had historically been subject to the Office of Biotechnology Activities, or OBA, pursuant to the NIH Guideline. On August 17, 2018, the NIH issued a notice in the Federal Register and issued a public statement proposing changes to the oversight framework for gene therapy trials, including changes to the applicable NIH Guidelines to modify the roles and responsibilities of the RAC with respect to human clinical trials of gene therapy products, and requesting public comment on its proposed modifications. During the public comment period, which closed October 16, 2018, the NIH announced that it will no longer accept new human gene transfer protocols for review as a part of the protocol registration process or convene the RAC to review individual clinical protocols. These trials will remain subject to the FDA’s oversight and other clinical trial regulations, and oversight at the local level will continue as set forth in the NIH Guidelines. Specifically, under the NIH Guidelines, supervision of human gene transfer trials includes evaluation and assessment by an institutional biosafety committee, or IBC, a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees research utilizing recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules at that institution. The IBC assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk to public health or the environment, and such review may result in some delay before initiation of a clinical trial. While the NIH Guidelines are not mandatory unless the research in question is being conducted at or sponsored by institutions receiving NIH funding of recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecule research, many companies and other institutions not otherwise subject to the NIH Guidelines voluntarily follow them.
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the biological product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the study sponsor’s control. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical study, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, the efficacy measurements to be evaluated and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical study will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDA’s regulations comprising the GCP requirements, including the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent. Further, each clinical study must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at or servicing each institution at which the clinical study will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of study participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical study subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical study until completed. 
 29


Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined: 
  
• | Phase I. The biological product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase II. The biological product candidate is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase III. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, potency, and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of a biological product. In rare instances, a single Phase 3 trial, together with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient to support a BLA submission. Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase IV clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up. The FDA recommends that sponsors observe subjects for potential gene therapy-related delayed adverse events for a 15-year period, including a minimum of five years of annual examinations followed by ten years of annual queries, either in person or by questionnaire. 
 During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical study investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events, any findings from other trials, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information. Phase I, Phase II and Phase III clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend or permanently discontinue a clinical study at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or the clinical study is not being conducted in accordance with FDA regulations. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical study at its institution if the clinical study is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the biological product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. The FDA and the IRB may also halt, terminate or impose other conditions if either believes the patients are subject to unacceptable risk. 
 There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries. Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including biologics, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information, which is publicly available at www.clinicaltrials.gov. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed until the new product or new indication being studied has been approved. 
 Human gene therapy products based on gene-editing technology are a new category of therapeutics. Because this is a relatively new and expanding area of novel therapeutic interventions, there can be no assurance as to the length of the study period, the number of patients the FDA will require to be enrolled in the trials in order to establish the safety, efficacy, purity and potency of human gene therapy products, or that the data generated in these trials will be acceptable to the FDA to support marketing approval.
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal trials and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biological product candidate as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with use of biological products, the PHS Act emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be 
 30


selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biological product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 U.S. Review and Approval Processes 
 After the completion of clinical trials of a biological product candidate, FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before commercial marketing and distribution of the biological product. The BLA must include results of product development, laboratory and animal trials, human trials, information on the manufacture, pharmacology, chemistry and controls of the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information. In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the biological product candidate for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. 
 The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, requires that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug or biological product that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, within sixty days after an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and FDA. The initial PSP must include, among other things, an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including to the extent practicable study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information, along with any other information specified in FDA regulations. The FDA and the sponsor must reach agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from nonclinical studies, early phase clinical trials, and/or other clinical development programs. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any biological product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. The testing and approval processes require substantial time and effort and there can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the BLA for filing and, even if filed, that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. 
 Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each BLA must be accompanied by a user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. PDUFA also imposes an annual program fee for marketed products. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first human drug application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication. 
 Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews the submitted BLA to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the BLA. Under PDUFA, the FDA has agreed to certain performance goals to complete the review of BLAs. The FDA may give a priority review designation to biological products that offer major advances in treatment, or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. A priority review means that the goal for the FDA to review an application is six months, rather than the standard review of ten months under current PDUFA guidelines. Under the current PDUFA agreement, these six and ten month review periods are measured from the “filing” date rather than the receipt date for original BLAs, which typically adds approximately two months to the timeline for review and decision from the date of submission. 
 The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe, pure and potent, or effective, for its intended use, and has an acceptable purity profile, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP requirements to assure and preserve the product’s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel biological products or biological products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the biological product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, is necessary to assure the safe use of the biological product candidate. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the BLA without a REMS, if required. 
 31


Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND study requirements and GCP requirements. To assure cGMP and GCP compliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production, and quality control. 
 Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval and deny approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. If the agency decides not to approve the BLA in its present form, the FDA will issue a complete response letter that usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the BLA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. Under the current PDUFA guidelines, the FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months of receipt depending on the type of information included.
 If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the BLA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its potential risks. A REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a medicine and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use, and could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. 
 Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved BLA, including changes in indications, product labeling, manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new BLA or BLA supplement before the change can be implemented. A BLA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing BLA supplements as it does in reviewing BLAs. The FDA may require one or more Phase IV post-market studies or surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies. 
 Orphan Drug Designation 
 The FDA may grant Orphan Drug Designation to drugs or biologics intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and marketing the drug or biologic for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from its sales in the United States. Orphan product designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan product designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. 
 In the United States, Orphan Drug Designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and BLA user-fee waivers. In addition, if a product receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which it has orphan designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application, including a full BLA, to market the same drug or biologic for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity or where the manufacturer with orphan exclusivity is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the approved orphan-designated product. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same biological product as defined by the FDA or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. If a drug or biological product designated as 
 32


an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. We have received orphan drug designation for the use of AAVHSC expressing human PAH for the treatment of PKU. There can be no assurance that we will receive orphan drug designation for additional indications or for any additional product candidates. 
 Expedited Development and Review Programs 
 The FDA has a Fast Track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new biological products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new biological products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a new biologic may request that the FDA designate the biologic as a Fast Track product at any time during the clinical development of the product. The FDA must determine if the biologic product candidate qualifies for Fast Track designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request. Unique to a Fast Track product, the FDA may consider for review sections of the marketing application on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the application, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the application and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the application. 
 Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a Fast Track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. Any product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to treat a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new biological product designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. Additionally, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Biological products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may be eligible for accelerated approval, which means that they may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical studies establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a biological product subject to accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing Phase IV clinical studies. Failure to conduct required post-approval trials, or to confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing trials, will allow the FDA to withdraw the approved biologic product from the market on an expedited basis. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. Fast Track designation, priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.
 In addition, under the provisions of FDASIA, enacted in 2012, the FDA established a Breakthrough Therapy Designation which is intended to expedite the development and review of products that treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions. A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the features of Fast Track designation, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance. The Breakthrough Therapy Designation is a distinct status from both accelerated approval and priority review, but these can also be granted to the same product candidate if the relevant criteria are met. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy. All requests for breakthrough therapy designation will be reviewed within 60 days of receipt, and FDA will either grant or deny the request. 
 Fast Track designation, priority review, accelerated approval and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if we receive one or both of these designations for our product candidates, the FDA may later decide that our product candidates no longer meets the conditions for qualification. In addition, receiving these designations may not provide us with a material commercial advantage. 
 33


Post-Approval Requirements 
 Maintaining substantial compliance with applicable federal, state, and local statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Rigorous and extensive FDA regulation of biological products continues after approval, particularly with respect to cGMP requirements. We will rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of any products that we may commercialize. Manufacturers of our products are required to comply with applicable requirements in the cGMP regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. Other post-approval requirements applicable to biological products, include reporting of cGMP deviations that may affect the identity, potency, purity and overall safety of a distributed product, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse effects, reporting updated safety and efficacy information, and complying with electronic record and signature requirements. 
 After a BLA is approved, the product also may be subject to official lot release. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot. The FDA also may perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products, such as viral vaccines, before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of biological products. 
 To help reduce the increased risk of the introduction of adventitious agents, the PHS Act emphasizes the importance of manufacturing controls for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The PHS Act also provides authority to the FDA to immediately suspend biologics licenses in situations where there exists a danger to public health, to prepare or procure products in the event of shortages and critical public health needs, and to authorize the creation and enforcement of regulations to prevent the introduction or spread of communicable diseases within the United States. 
 The FDA may require one or more Phase IV post-market studies or surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies. We also must comply with the FDA’s advertising and promotion requirements, such as those related to direct-to-consumer advertising, the prohibition on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet. Biologics may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. 
 Discovery of previously unknown problems or the failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant or manufacturer to administrative or judicial civil or criminal sanctions and adverse publicity. FDA sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, clinical hold, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, debarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 Biological product manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved biological products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved BLA, including withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process or facility generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval. 
 U.S. Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity 
 Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of the use of our product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent 
 34


restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally equal to the regulatory review period for the approved product which period occurs after the date the patent issued, subject to certain exceptions. Only one patent may be extended for a regulatory review period for any product, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may intend to apply for restoration of patent term for one of our currently owned or licensed patents to extend its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical studies and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant BLA. 
 For patents that might expire during the BLA review phase, the patent owner may request an interim patent term extension. If eligible, an interim patent term extension may be granted for a period of not more than one year. The patent owner may apply for not more than four subsequent interim extensions. Any interim extension granted will not be longer than the maximum period of extension allowed post-approval.
 Biosimilars and Exclusivity 
 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or Affordable Care Act, signed into law on March 23, 2010, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars. 
 Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. However, complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation of the abbreviated approval pathway that are still being worked out by the FDA. 
 Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing the sponsor’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of their product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law. 
 A biological product can also obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study. 
 The BPCIA is complex and continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. In addition, recent government proposals have sought to reduce the 12-year reference product exclusivity period. Other aspects of the BPCIA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of recent litigation. As a result, the ultimate impact, implementation, and meaning of the BPCIA remains subject to significant uncertainty. 
 Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements 
 Pharmaceutical companies are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security and physician sunshine laws and regulations. If their operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply, they may 
 35


be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and individual imprisonment.
 Coverage and Reimbursement 
 Sales of any product depend, in part, on the extent to which such product will be covered by third-party payors, such as federal, state, and foreign government healthcare programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations, and the level of reimbursement for such product by third-party payors. Decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a plan-by-plan basis. These third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for medical products, drugs and services. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit sales of any product. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for any product or a decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician usage and patient demand for the product and also have a material adverse effect on sales. 
Healthcare Reform 
 In March 2010, President Obama signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, each as amended, collectively known as the Affordable Care Act, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly affected the pharmaceutical industry. The Affordable Care Act contains a number of provisions, including those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement adjustments and fraud and abuse changes. Additionally, the Affordable Care Act: 

• | increases the minimum level of Medicaid rebates payable by manufacturers of brand name drugs from 15.1% to 23.1%;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | requires collection of rebates for drugs paid by Medicaid managed care organizations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | requires manufacturers to participate in a coverage gap discount program, under which they must agree to offer 70 percent point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | imposes a non-deductible annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell “branded prescription drugs” to specified federal government programs.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the Affordable Care Act in the future. Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted, including aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year and reduced payments to several types of Medicare providers. Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
 Additional Regulation 
 In addition to the foregoing, state and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservancy and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, affect our business. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological, chemical and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, our operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and that continued compliance therewith will not have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict, however, how changes in these laws may affect our future operations. 
 36


Government Regulation Outside of the United States 
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical studies and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. Because biologically sourced raw materials are subject to unique contamination risks, their use may be restricted in some countries. 
 Whether or not we obtain FDA approval of a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical studies or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical study application, or CTA, much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical studies. In the European Union, for example, a CTA must be submitted to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and the IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical study development may proceed. 
 The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical studies, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical studies are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 
 To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational biological product under European Union regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application. The application used to file the BLA in the United States is similar to that required in the European Union, with the exception of, among other things, country-specific document requirements. The European Union also provides opportunities for market exclusivity. For example, in the European Union, upon receiving marketing authorization, new chemical entities generally receive eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity. If granted, data exclusivity prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic application. During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity. However, there is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the European Union’s regulatory authorities to be a new chemical entity, and products may not qualify for data exclusivity. Products receiving orphan designation in the European Union can receive ten years of market exclusivity, during which time no similar medicinal product for the same indication may be placed on the market. An orphan product can also obtain an additional two years of market exclusivity in the European Union for pediatric studies. No extension to any supplementary protection certificate can be granted on the basis of pediatric studies for orphan indications. 
 The criteria for designating an “orphan medicinal product” in the European Union are similar in principle to those in the United States. Under Article 3 of Regulation (EC) 141/2000, a medicinal product may be designated as orphan if (1) it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition; (2) either (a) such condition affects no more than five in 10,000 persons in the European Union when the application is made, or (b) the product, without the benefits derived from orphan status, would not generate sufficient return in the European Union to justify investment; and (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the European Union, or if such a method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition, as defined in Regulation (EC) 847/2000. Orphan medicinal products are eligible for financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and are, upon grant of a marketing authorization, entitled to ten years of market exclusivity for the approved therapeutic indication. The application for orphan drug designation must be submitted before the application for marketing authorization. The applicant will receive a fee reduction for the marketing authorization application if the orphan drug designation has been granted, but not if the designation is still pending at the time the marketing authorization is submitted. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. 
 The 10-year market exclusivity may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation, for example, if the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Additionally, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar product for the same indication at any time if:

For other countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical studies, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical studies are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 
 If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
