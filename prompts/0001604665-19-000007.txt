Item 1. Business
General
We are a Delaware limited partnership formed by Westlake in March 2014 to operate, acquire and develop ethylene production facilities and related assets. On August 4, 2014, we completed our initial public offering (the "IPO") of 12,937,500 common units representing limited partner interests. In connection with the IPO, we acquired a 10.6% interest in OpCo and a 100% interest in OpCo GP, which is the general partner of OpCo. On April 29, 2015, we purchased an additional 2.7% newly-issued limited partner interest in OpCo, resulting in an aggregate 13.3% limited partner interest in OpCo effective April 1, 2015. Effective August 30, 2017, the subordination period for the 12,686,115 subordinated units owned by Westlake ended and the subordinated units converted into common units on a one-for-one basis and thereafter participate on terms equal with all other common units in distributions of available cash. On September 29, 2017, we completed a secondary offering of 5,175,000 common units at a price of $22.00 per unit and purchased an additional 5.0% newly-issued limited partner interest in OpCo, resulting in an aggregate 18.3% limited partner interest in OpCo, effective as of July 1, 2017.
Our business and operations are conducted through OpCo. Because we own OpCo's general partner, we have control over all of OpCo's assets and operations. As of December 31, 2018, Westlake held an 81.7% limited partner interest in OpCo and held a 43.8% limited partner interest in us (consisting of 14,122,230 common units), our general partner interest and our incentive distribution rights. 
OpCo's assets are comprised of three ethylene production facilities, which primarily convert ethane into ethylene and have an aggregate annual capacity of approximately 3.7 billion pounds, and a 200-mile ethylene pipeline. OpCo derives substantially all of its revenue from these ethylene production facilities. Ethylene is the world's most widely used petrochemical in terms of volume and is a key building block used to produce a number of key derivatives, such as polyethylene ("PE") and polyvinyl chloride ("PVC"), which are used in a wide variety of end markets including packaging, construction and transportation. Westlake's downstream PE and PVC production facilities consume a substantial majority of the ethylene produced by OpCo. OpCo generates revenue primarily by selling ethylene to Westlake and others, as well as through the sale of co-products of ethylene production, including propylene, crude butadiene, pyrolysis gasoline and hydrogen. Our sole revenue generating asset is our 18.3% limited partner interest in OpCo.
Our assets and operations are organized into a single reportable segment and are all located and conducted in the United States. See "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for financial information on our operations and assets; such information is incorporated herein by reference.
Among other agreements entered into in connection with the closing of the IPO, OpCo entered into a 12-year ethylene sales agreement with Westlake, under which Westlake agreed to purchase 95% of OpCo's planned ethylene production each year, on a cost-plus basis that is expected to generate a fixed margin per pound of $0.10 (the "Ethylene Sales Agreement"). Any ethylene not sold to Westlake and all co-products that are produced by OpCo will be sold to third parties on either a spot or contract basis. OpCo also entered into a feedstock supply agreement with Westlake that supplies OpCo with ethane (and any other feedstocks) required for OpCo to produce ethylene under the Ethylene Sales Agreement (the "Feedstock Supply Agreement").
OpCo primarily uses ethane (a component of natural gas liquids, or NGLs) to produce ethylene. OpCo completed an upgrade and capacity expansion of its Petro 1 ethylene unit at its Lake Charles site in 2016. The Petro 1 expansion project increased OpCo's ethylene capacity by approximately 250 million pounds annually. OpCo completed an expansion project to increase the ethylene capacity at its Calvert City facility in 2017. The expansion, along with other initiatives, increased ethylene capacity by approximately 100 million pounds annually.

Our Assets and Operations
Our sole revenue generating asset is our 18.3% limited partner interest in OpCo. We also own the general partner interest of OpCo. OpCo owns:

• | two ethylene production facilities at Westlake's Lake Charles, Louisiana site ("Petro 1" and "Petro 2," collectively referred to as "Lake Charles Olefins"), with an annual combined capacity of approximately 3.0 billion pounds;


• | one ethylene production facility at Westlake's Calvert City, Kentucky site ("Calvert City Olefins"), with an annual capacity of approximately 730 million pounds; and


• | a 200-mile common carrier ethylene pipeline that runs from Mont Belvieu, Texas to the Longview, Texas chemical site, which includes Westlake's Longview PE production facility (the "Longview Pipeline").

As the owner of the general partner interest of OpCo, we control all aspects of the management of OpCo, including its cash distribution policy. See "—OpCo's Assets."
OpCo's Assets
Ethylene Production Facilities. 
OpCo operates three ethylene production facilities that are situated on real property leased to OpCo by Westlake pursuant to two 50-year site lease agreements. See "Our Agreements with Westlake—Site Lease Agreements" for a description of the site leases. Ethylene can be produced from either NGL feedstocks, such as ethane, propane and butane, or from petroleum-derived feedstocks, such as naphtha. Lake Charles Olefins and Calvert City Olefins use primarily ethane as their feedstock. Calvert City Olefins can also use propane as a feedstock and Petro 2 can also use an ethane/propane mix, propane, butane or naphtha as a feedstock.
The following table provides information regarding OpCo's ethylene production facilities as of December 31, 2018:

Plant Location (Description) | Annual Production Capacity (millions of pounds) | | Feedstock | Primary Uses of Ethylene 
Lake Charles, Louisiana (Petro 1) | | 1,500 | | Ethane | PE and PVC
Lake Charles, Louisiana (Petro 2) | | 1,490 | | Ethane, ethane/propane mix, propane, butane or naphtha | PE and PVC
Calvert City, Kentucky (Calvert City Olefins) | | 730 | | Ethane or propane | PVC 
Total | | 3,720 | | | 

Lake Charles Olefins
Two of OpCo's ethylene production facilities, which we refer to as Petro 1 and Petro 2 and, collectively, as Lake Charles Olefins, are located at Westlake's Lake Charles site. The combined capacity of these two ethylene production facilities is approximately 3.0 billion pounds per year. 
Within Westlake's Lake Charles site, Petro 1 and Petro 2 are connected by pipeline systems to Westlake's polyethylene plants. Westlake may use the ethylene it purchases from OpCo at its Lake Charles facilities or transfer it to its Geismar facility or its Longview facility, either through physical transportation or via exchange transactions. Westlake may also use the ethylene it purchases from OpCo with chlorine to produce ethylene dichloride and transport it via barge to Westlake's Calvert City site.
In addition, OpCo produces ethylene co-products including chemical grade propylene, crude butadiene, pyrolysis gasoline and hydrogen. OpCo sells its output of these co-products to external customers.
Calvert City Olefins
One of OpCo's ethylene production facilities is located at Westlake's Calvert City site, which we refer to as Calvert City Olefins. The capacity of Calvert City Olefins is approximately 730 million pounds per year.
3

Pipeline
OpCo owns a 200-mile 10-inch diameter ethylene pipeline system that connects the Equistar Pipeline, the Flint Hills Pipeline and the Lone Star Storage Facility in Mont Belvieu to the Longview, Texas chemical site, which includes Westlake's Longview PE production facility. The system has a capacity of 3.5 million pounds per day of ethylene and is operated as a common carrier pipeline by Buckeye Development & Logistics I LLC. As a common carrier intrastate pipeline in Texas, the system is subject to rate regulation under the Texas Utilities Code, as implemented by the Texas Railroad Commission, or the TRRC, and has a tariff on file with the TRRC.
Technology
OpCo has perpetual and paid-up licenses for steam cracking and process recovery technology used at its ethylene plants.
Our Agreements with Westlake
Except as otherwise indicated, the agreements described below became effective on August 4, 2014, concurrent with the closing of the IPO. 
Ethylene Sales Agreement
OpCo and Westlake are parties to the Ethylene Sales Agreement, which has an initial term through December 31, 2026 and automatic 12-month renewal periods until terminated at the end of the initial term or any renewal term on 12-months' notice. The Ethylene Sales Agreement requires Westlake to purchase OpCo's planned ethylene production each year, subject to certain exceptions and a maximum commitment of 3.8 billion pounds per year, less product sold by OpCo to third parties equal to approximately 5% of the annual output. If OpCo's actual production is in excess of planned ethylene production, Westlake has the option to purchase up to 95% of production in excess of planned production. Westlake's purchase price for ethylene under the Ethylene Sales Agreement includes a $0.10 per pound margin, the total costs incurred by OpCo for the feedstock and natural gas to produce each pound of ethylene (subject to a usage cap and a floor), and estimated operating costs, maintenance capital expenditures and other turnaround expenditures, less net proceeds from co-products sales. This purchase price is not designed to cover capital expenditures for expansion. Variable costs not incurred by OpCo due to a deficiency in takes are rebated to Westlake. Under specified circumstances, unrecovered costs may be carried forward for recovery in subsequent years.
Certain of the pricing components that make up the price for ethylene sold under the Ethylene Sales Agreement are modified to reflect the portion of OpCo's production capacity that is used to process Westlake's purge gas instead of producing ethylene. Costs specific to the processing of Westlake's purge gas are recovered under the Services and Secondment Agreement, and not the Ethylene Sales Agreement. 
On November 1, 2018, OpCo and Westlake entered into an amendment to the Ethylene Sales Agreement that provides OpCo with the option to curtail up to approximately 5% of its ethylene production annually in the event OpCo reasonably determines that its sales of such ethylene to third parties during the relevant period would be uneconomic. 
Feedstock Supply Agreement
OpCo and Westlake are parties to the Feedstock Supply Agreement, which has an initial term through December 31, 2026 and automatic 12-month renewal periods until terminated at the end of the initial term or any renewal term on 12-months' notice. Under the Feedstock Supply Agreement, Westlake sells OpCo ethane and other feedstock in amounts sufficient for OpCo to produce the ethylene to be sold under the Ethylene Sales Agreement. The price at which ethane and feedstock is sold includes an indexed price for spot gas liquids at Mont Belvieu and applicable transportation, storage and other costs.
Services and Secondment Agreement
OpCo and Westlake are parties to the Services and Secondment Agreement, pursuant to which OpCo provides Westlake with various utilities and utility services and in exchange for Westlake providing OpCo with various utility services, comprehensive operating services for OpCo's units, services for the maintenance and operation of the common facilities and seconded employees to perform all services required under the agreement.
4

Site Lease Agreements
OpCo and Westlake are parties to two 50-year site lease agreements (the "Site Leases"). Under the Site Leases, OpCo leases the real property underlying Calvert City Olefins and Lake Charles Olefins and is granted certain use and access right related thereto, for a base rental amount of $1 per year per site. Each of the Site Leases is terminable by the lessor upon the occurrence of certain events of default or by OpCo if Calvert City Olefins or Lake Charles Olefins, as applicable, is destroyed by casualty. Pursuant to the Site Leases, the lessor has the right to restore and repurchase the units for fair market value if OpCo fails to expeditiously restore Calvert City Olefins or Lake Charles Olefins, as applicable, following a casualty loss. Subject to the foregoing repurchase right, OpCo may remove its ethylene production facilities and other related improvements for up to one year after expiration or termination of the applicable Site Lease, so long as such removal can be accomplished without material damage or harm to the lessor's property or operations; provided that any assets that are not timely removed by OpCo will be deemed to have been surrendered to the lessor.
Omnibus Agreement
We, OpCo and Westlake are parties to the Omnibus Agreement, pursuant to which we granted Westlake, among other things, a right of first refusal on any proposed transfer of (1) our equity interests in OpCo, (2) the ethylene production facilities that serve Westlake's other facilities or (3) certain other assets we may acquire from Westlake. The Omnibus Agreement also provides for reimbursement to Westlake for the provision of various administrative services and direct expenses incurred on our behalf and in connection with the operation of our business. Under the Omnibus Agreement, Westlake will indemnify us against certain environmental and other losses, and we will indemnify Westlake against certain environmental and other losses for which Westlake is not otherwise obligated to indemnify us and certain other losses and liabilities to the extent resulting from the provision of services by Westlake to us.
Exchange Agreement
OpCo and Westlake are parties to an exchange agreement, which had an initial term through August 1, 2015 and is continuing year to year thereafter, unless and until terminated by either party. Under the exchange agreement, OpCo may require Westlake to deliver up to 200 million pounds of ethylene for OpCo per year from the Site Leases to an ethylene hub in Mt. Belvieu, Texas, for which OpCo would be required to pay Westlake an exchange fee of $0.006 per pound. 
OpCo Partnership Agreement
We, OpCo GP and Westlake are parties to an agreement of limited partnership for OpCo (the "OpCo LP Agreement"). The OpCo LP Agreement governs the ownership and management of OpCo and designates OpCo GP as the general partner of OpCo. OpCo GP generally has complete authority to manage OpCo's business and affairs. We control OpCo GP, as its sole member, subject to certain approval rights held by Westlake.
Investment Management Agreement
On August 17, 2017, we, OpCo and Westlake executed an Investment Management Agreement that authorizes Westlake to invest the Partnership and OpCo’s excess cash with Westlake for a term of up to a maximum of nine months. Per the terms of the Investment Management Agreement, the Partnership earns a market return plus five basis points and Westlake provides daily availability of the invested cash to meet any liquidity needs of the Partnership or OpCo.
See "Liquidity and Capital Resources" in Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis" for discussions of the Partnership's and OpCo's debt agreements with Westlake and "Interest Rate Risk" in Item 7A. "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk" for the Partnership's interest rate contract with Westlake.
Environmental 
As is common in our industry, we and OpCo are subject to environmental laws and regulations related to the use, storage, handling, generation, transportation, emission, discharge, disposal and remediation of, and exposure to, hazardous and non-hazardous substances and wastes in all of the jurisdictions in which we do business. National, state or provincial and local standards regulating air, water and land quality affect substantially all of our manufacturing locations. Compliance with such laws and regulations has required and will continue to require capital expenditures and increase operating costs. Pursuant to our arrangement with Westlake, Westlake will indemnify us for liabilities that occurred or existed (in connection with compliance with such laws and regulations) prior to August 4, 2014.
5

It is our policy to comply with all environmental, health and safety requirements in the jurisdictions in which we and OpCo operate and to provide safe and environmentally sound workplaces for our employees. In some cases, compliance can be achieved only by incurring capital expenditures. In 2018, OpCo incurred capital expenditures of $1.0 million related to environmental compliance. We estimate that OpCo will make capital expenditures of approximately $3.8 million in 2019 and $2.2 million in 2020, respectively, related to environmental compliance. The expected 2019 and 2020 capital expenditures are relatively higher than the amounts we have spent related to environmental compliance in recent years due to increased capital expenditures related to Environmental Protection Agency (the "EPA") regulations. We anticipate that stringent environmental regulations will continue to be imposed on us and the industry in general. Although we cannot predict with certainty future expenditures, management believes that our current spending trends will continue.
Potential Flare Modifications. For several years, the EPA has been conducting an enforcement initiative against petroleum refineries and petrochemical plants with respect to emissions from flares. On April 21, 2014, Westlake received a Clean Air Act Section 114 Information Request from the EPA which sought information regarding flares at the Calvert City and Lake Charles facilities. The EPA has informed Westlake that the information provided leads the EPA to believe that some of the flares are out of compliance with applicable standards. The EPA has indicated that it is seeking a consent decree that would obligate Westlake to take corrective actions relating to the alleged noncompliance. The Partnership believes the resolution of these matters may require the payment of a monetary sanction in excess of $100,000.
Risk Management Program Investigation. The EPA has conducted inspections and information requests to assess compliance with Risk Management Program requirements under the Clean Air Act at the Calvert City facility. The EPA has identified concerns with the facility’s compliance under the Risk Management Program and Release Prevention regulations in connection with certain emissions release events between 2011 and 2015. Westlake has engaged in communications with the EPA to resolve these concerns. Westlake has reached an agreement in principle with the EPA to resolve all concerns for a penalty of $49,000 and a $184,000 supplemental environmental project involving the purchase of emergency response equipment for Marshall and Livingston Counties. The EPA and Westlake are currently finalizing the settlement documents.
In addition to the matters described above, the Partnership is involved in various legal proceedings incidental to the conduct of its business. The Partnership does not believe that any of these legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
Also, see the discussion of our environmental matters contained in Item 1A. "Risk Factors" and Item 3"—Legal Proceedings" below. 
Employees
Neither we nor OpCo has any employees. Under the Services and Secondment Agreement with Westlake, Westlake seconds employees to OpCo to allow OpCo to operate its facilities. Such seconded employees are under OpCo's control while they work on OpCo's facilities. As of December 31, 2018, 145 employees were seconded to OpCo. Of these, 20 are covered by collective bargaining agreements that expire on November 4, 2019. There have been no strikes, lockouts or work stoppages at OpCo's facilities. We believe that Westlake's relationship with the local union officials and bargaining committees is open and positive.
Legal Proceedings
In the ordinary conduct of our business, we and Westlake and our and Westlake's subsidiaries, including OpCo, are subject to periodic lawsuits, investigations and claims, including environmental claims and employee related matters. Although we cannot predict with certainty the ultimate resolution of lawsuits, investigations and claims asserted against us, we do not believe that any currently pending legal proceeding or proceedings to which we or Westlake or any of our or Westlake's subsidiaries, including OpCo, are a party will have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.
Competition
Due to the Ethylene Sales Agreement and integration with Westlake, OpCo does not directly compete with other ethylene producers for 95% of the planned volumes it produces. It is only on the 5% of planned ethylene volumes not sold to Westlake where OpCo competes with other regional merchant ethylene producers, including LyondellBasell Industries, N.V., Royal Dutch Shell, BASF Corporation and Flint Hills Resources.
