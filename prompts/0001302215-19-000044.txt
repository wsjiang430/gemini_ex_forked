Item 1. | Business

Established in 1972, Houlihan Lokey, Inc., is a leading global independent investment bank with expertise in mergers and acquisitions (M&A), capital markets, financial restructurings and financial advisory services. Through our offices in the United States, Europe, Asia, Australia, and Dubai, we serve a diverse set of clients worldwide including corporations, financial sponsors and government agencies. We provide our financial professionals with an integrated platform that enables them to deliver meaningful and differentiated advice to our clients. We advise our clients on critical strategic and financial decisions, employing a rigorous analytical approach coupled with deep product and industry expertise. We market our services through our product areas, our industry groups and our Financial Sponsors group, serving our clients in three primary business practices: Corporate Finance (encompassing M&A and capital markets advisory), Financial Restructuring (both out-of-court and in formal bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings) and Financial Advisory Services (including financial opinions, and a variety of valuation and financial consulting services).
We are committed to a set of principles that serve as the backbone of our success. Independent advice and intellectual rigor, combined with consistent senior-level involvement, are hallmarks of our commitment to client service. Our entrepreneurial culture engenders our flexibility to collaborate across our business practices to provide world-class solutions for our clients. Our broad-based employee ownership serves to align the interests of employees and shareholders and further encourages a collaborative environment where our Corporate Finance, Financial Restructuring and Financial Advisory Services business practices work together productively and creatively to solve our clients’ most critical financial issues. We enter into businesses or offer services where we believe we can excel based on our expertise, analytical sophistication, industry focus and competitive dynamics. Finally, we remain independent and specialized, focusing on advisory products and market segments where our expertise is both differentiating and less subject to conflicts of interest arising from non-advisory products and services, and where we believe we can be a market leader in a particular segment. We do not lend or engage in any securities sales and trading operations or research which might conflict with our clients’ interests.
As of March 31, 2019, we had a team of 969 financial professionals across 21 offices globally and an additional office through our joint venture in Italy, serving more than 1,000 clients annually over the past several years, ranging from closely held companies to Fortune Global 500 corporations. Information on our segments is set forth in "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."
Our Advisory Services
We provide our financial professionals with an integrated platform that enables them to deliver meaningful and differentiated advice to our clients. We market our services through our three business practices described below, our industry groups and our Financial Sponsors group, who work collaboratively to deliver comprehensive solutions and seamless execution for our clients. This marketing effort is combined with an extensive network of referral relationships with law firms, consulting firms, accounting firms and other professional services firms that have been developed by our financial professionals who maintain those relationships as potential referral sources and direct clients across all of our business practices.

Corporate Finance
As of March 31, 2019, we had 108 Corporate Finance Managing Directors utilizing a collaborative, interdisciplinary approach to provide our clients with extensive industry and product expertise and global reach in a wide variety of M&A and capital markets transactions. We compete with boutique firms focused on particular industries or geographies as well as other global independent investment banks and bulge-bracket firms. A majority of our engagements relate to mid-cap transactions, which we believe is an attractive segment that is underserved by bulge-bracket investment banks. We believe that our deep sector expertise, significant senior banker involvement and attention, strong financial sponsor relationships and global platform provide a compelling value for our clients, engendering long-term relationships and providing a competitive advantage against our peers in this segment of the market.
We believe that through our industry groups we have a meaningful presence in every major industry segment, including: business services; consumer, food & retail; data & analytics; energy; financial institutions; healthcare; industrials; real estate, lodging & leisure; technology: and media & telecommunications. We continue to expand and deepen our specialized industry capabilities through a combination of internal promotion, external hires and acquisitions.  While the majority of our engagements are in the United States, we continue to enhance our presence in other geographies, including Europe, Asia, Australia and Dubai and we believe there will be continued opportunities to grow in regions outside the United States.  
Our Corporate Finance activities are comprised of two significant categories:
Mergers & Acquisitions: We have extensive expertise in mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, and other related advisory services for a broad range of United States and international clients. Our Corporate Finance professionals have relationships with thousands of companies and financial sponsors, providing us with valuable insights into a wide variety of relevant markets.
Our M&A business consists primarily of sell-side and buy-side engagements. In particular, we believe we have developed a reputation in the marketplace as one of the most prolific sell-side advisors, consistently selling more companies under $1 billion than any competitor. We provide advice and services to a diverse set of parties, including public and private company executives, boards of directors, special committees and financial sponsors.
We believe our team of experienced and talented financial professionals is well positioned to provide advice across a wide range of M&A advisory services globally, including sell-side, buy-side, joint ventures, asset sales and divestitures that are less subject to conflicts of interest arising from non-advisory services. Our global industry group model with embedded M&A capabilities brings sector-specific knowledge, experience and relationships to our clients, allowing us to provide differentiated expert advice and connect buyers on a global basis.

Capital Markets Advisory:  We provide global financing solutions and capital-raising advisory services for a broad range of corporate and private equity clients across most industry sectors, from large, publicly-held, multinational corporations to financial sponsors to privately-held companies founded and run by entrepreneurs.

Our Capital Markets Advisory professionals leverage a wide array of longstanding, senior-level lender and investor relationships, including with traditional and non-traditional direct capital providers (such as institutional credit funds, commercial finance companies, business development companies, insurance companies, pension funds, mutual funds, global asset managers, special situations investors and structured equity providers). As the traditional syndicated capital markets have become increasingly complex and more regulated, the private capital markets have developed to provide an alternative source of flexible capital that can be tailored to meet clients’ needs.

We believe we excel in providing our clients with sophisticated and thoughtful advice and access to traditional and non-traditional capital providers in the private and public capital markets. Our objective is to help clients create a capital structure that enables them to achieve their strategic priorities on the best terms available in the market, which often involves raising more than one type of capital.

Financial Restructuring
As of March 31, 2019, we had 44 Financial Restructuring Managing Directors working around the globe, which we believe constitutes one of the largest restructuring groups in the investment banking industry. Our Financial Restructuring group has earned a reputation for being the advisor of choice for many of the largest and most complex restructurings, offering knowledge, experience and creativity to address challenging situations. We operate in all major worldwide markets as debt issuances have increased around the world. Our Financial Restructuring professionals bring to bear deep expertise and experience in restructurings in the United States, Canada, Europe, Asia, Australia, the Middle East, Latin America and Africa. Given the depth and breadth of the team’s expertise and the high barriers to entry for this expertise and experience, international and multi-jurisdictional restructurings represent an attractive opportunity for our Financial Restructuring group.
The group employs an interdisciplinary approach to engagements, calling upon the expertise of our industry groups, Capital Markets Advisory group and Financial Sponsors group, and drawing on the worldwide resources of the Financial Restructuring team as each situation may require. The Financial Restructuring group has deep experience evaluating complex, highly leveraged situations. In addition to comprehensive financial restructurings, we work with distressed companies on changes of control, asset sales and other M&A and capital markets activities, many times involving the sale of a company or its assets quickly, and in contested or litigious settings on expedited timeframes. We advise companies undergoing financial restructuring and creditor constituencies at all levels of the capital structure, in both out-of-court negotiations and in formal bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings. Our experience, geographic diversity and size allow us to provide the immediate attention and staffing required for time-sensitive and mission-critical restructuring assignments, making us a valued partner for our clients.
Our dedicated team is active throughout business cycles. Our Financial Restructuring practice serves as a countercyclical hedge across macroeconomic cycles, with increasing levels of restructuring opportunities often occurring during periods when demand for M&A and capital markets advisory services may be reduced. In robust macro-economic environments, demand for the services of our Financial Restructuring team generally continues due to opportunities arising from secular and cyclical disruptions in certain industries. Our geographic diversity and global market leadership allow our Financial Restructuring group to maintain significant levels of activity even when the U.S. capital markets are vibrant.
Our broad base of clients and our extensive experience allow us to understand the dynamics of each restructuring situation and strengthen our negotiating strategies by providing us insight into the needs, attitudes and positions of all parties-in-interest. Our clients include companies, bondholder groups, financial institutions, banks and other secured creditor groups, trade creditors, official Chapter 11 creditors’ committees, equity holders, acquirers, equity sponsors and other parties-in-interest involved with financially challenged companies.
Our Financial Restructuring professionals work closely with our Corporate Finance and Financial Advisory Services professionals to provide holistic advice and services. In financial restructuring assignments, our team may represent the company, the creditors or other stakeholders. 
Financial Advisory Services
As of March 31, 2019, we had 33 Managing Directors in our Financial Advisory Services group, which we believe represents one of the largest and most respected valuation and financial opinion practices in the United States. We have developed a reputation as a thought-leader in the field of valuation, and our professionals produce influential studies and publications, which are recognized and valued throughout the financial industry. We believe our extensive transaction expertise and leadership in these fields inspire the confidence of the financial executives, boards of directors, special committees, retained counsel, investors and business owners that we serve. We believe that our reputation for delivering an outstanding analytical product that will withstand legal or regulatory scrutiny coupled with our independence makes us the advisor of choice for clients seeking to obtain a complex valuation or transaction opinion.
Our core competencies in our Financial Advisory Services practice are our ability to analyze and value companies, security interests, and different types of assets, including intellectual property and liabilities, as well as our ability to analyze the financial aspects of transactions. We are organized around different service areas as each area has different regulatory or compliance specializations, different valuation guidelines as well as different marketing channels.

Our People
Our goal is to attract, develop and retain the best talent in our industry across all levels. We believe our compensation programs are competitive, offering a portion of compensation in deferred cash and a portion in deferred stock awards to provide incentives for our employees to remain with us. In addition, we strive to foster a collaborative environment to attract and retain employees, and we seek individuals who fit our culture of entrepreneurship, integrity, creativity and commitment to our clients. For over 20 years, we have emphasized broad employee ownership as a way to align the incentives of our employees and shareholders. As of March 31, 2019, we had approximately 565 present and former employee shareholders that collectively owned approximately 38% of our equity with no single employee owning more than 3% of our equity. We believe that a strong emphasis on cultural fit during our recruiting process combined with broad employee ownership results in high retention rates.
Our Managing Directors (other than our executive officers) are compensated based on their ability to deliver profitable revenues on a consistent basis to our firm, the quality of advice and execution provided to our clients, and their collaboration with their colleagues across industries, products and regions. We do not compensate on a commission-based pay model. Our compensation structure for junior financial professionals is based on a system of meritocracy whereby bankers are rewarded for past performance and expectation of future development, and compensation levels are tested against prevailing market compensation for bankers at similar levels.
The primary sources of recruitment for our junior financial professionals are leading undergraduate and graduate programs around the world. Our consistent hiring practices year after year have created partnerships with these institutions and resulted in a steady and high-quality pipeline of junior financial professionals. To supplement this annual class of new hires, we opportunistically and strategically hire professionals with experience and backgrounds relevant to our various businesses. Regardless of title, we place a high degree of emphasis on cultural fit, technical capability and individual character. When we hire junior financial professionals, we hire them directly into one of our business practices to enable them to begin to develop their relevant skill set from day one.
Across our firm, we devote significant time and resources to training and mentoring our employees to ensure every person achieves their highest possible potential. We strive to identify and cultivate future leaders within our firm and are committed to developing our brightest and most ambitious junior professionals into Managing Directors. This philosophy of investing in our people has been and will continue to be core to our culture and organization. As of March 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we employed 1,354, 1,228 and 1,171 people, respectively, worldwide.
Competition
Our competitors are other investment banking and financial advisory firms. We compete on both a global and a regional basis, and on the basis of a number of factors, including industry knowledge, transaction execution skills, strength of client relationships, reputation and price. We believe our primary competitors vary by product and industry expertise and would include the following: for our Corporate Finance practice, Evercore Partners, Jefferies LLC, Lazard Ltd, Moelis & Company, N M Rothschild & Sons Limited, Piper Jaffray Companies, Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Stifel Financial Corp., William Blair & Company, L.L.C., and the bulge-bracket investment banking firms; for our Financial Restructuring practice, Evercore Partners, Lazard Ltd, Moelis & Company, N M Rothschild & Sons Limited and PJT Partners; and for our Financial Advisory Services practice, Duff & Phelps Corp., the “big four” accounting firms, and various global financial advisory firms.
We compete with all of the above as well as with regional and industry-focused boutique firms to attract and retain qualified employees. Our ability to continue to compete effectively in our business will depend upon our ability to attract new employees and retain our existing employees. We may be at a competitive disadvantage in certain situations with regard to certain of our competitors who are able to, and regularly do, provide financing or market making services that are often instrumental in effecting transactions.

Regulation
United States
Our business, as well as the financial services industry generally, is subject to extensive regulation in the United States and across the globe. As a matter of public policy, regulatory bodies in the United States and the rest of the world are charged with safeguarding the integrity of the securities and other financial markets and with protecting the interests of customers participating in those markets. In the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") is the federal agency responsible for the administration of the federal securities laws. Houlihan Lokey Capital, Inc. (“Houlihan Lokey Capital”), our wholly owned subsidiary, through which we conduct our Corporate Finance, Financial Restructuring and transaction opinion businesses in the United States, is registered as a broker-dealer with the SEC. Houlihan Lokey Capital is subject to regulation and oversight by the SEC. In addition, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. ("FINRA"), a self-regulatory organization that is subject to oversight by the SEC, adopts and enforces rules governing the conduct, and examines the activities, of its broker-dealer member firms, including Houlihan Lokey Capital. State securities regulators also have regulatory or oversight authority over Houlihan Lokey Capital in those states in which it does business.
Broker-dealers are subject to regulations that cover all aspects of the securities business, including sales methods, trade practices, the financing of customers’ purchases, capital structure, record-keeping and the conduct and qualifications of directors, officers and employees. In particular, as a registered broker-dealer and member of a self-regulatory organization, we are subject to the SEC’s uniform net capital rule, Rule 15c3-1. Rule 15c3-1 specifies the minimum level of net capital a broker-dealer must maintain and also requires that a significant part of a broker-dealer’s assets be kept in relatively liquid form. The SEC and FINRA impose rules that require notification when net capital falls below certain predefined criteria, limit the ratio of subordinated debt to equity in the regulatory capital composition of a broker-dealer and constrain the ability of a broker-dealer to expand its business under certain circumstances. Additionally, the SEC’s uniform net capital rule imposes certain requirements that may have the effect of prohibiting a broker-dealer from distributing or withdrawing capital and requiring prior notice to the SEC for certain withdrawals of capital.
Houlihan Lokey Financial Advisors, Inc. (“HLFA”), our wholly owned subsidiary, provides valuation services and related financial analyses of various businesses and types of assets which are used by clients in connection with mergers and acquisitions, divestitures, recapitalizations, dispute analysis, and estate, gift and income tax support. In rendering such analyses, HLFA does not: (i) make recommendations or provide advice with respect to the merits of any security or transaction, the suitability of transacting in any security, or any investment decision with respect to any security, or (ii) manage or hold client accounts, securities or funds. In addition to valuation and financial consulting and analytic services, HLFA provides dispute resolution and financial consulting services.
The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 and the Treasury Department’s implementing federal regulations require us, as a “financial institution,” to establish and maintain an anti-money-laundering program. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN’’), a part of the United States Department of the Treasury, is charged with protecting the financial system from illicit use, combating money laundering, and promoting national security through financial intelligence. FinCEN’s customer due diligence rule requires certain financial institutions, including broker-dealers, to obtain, verify, and record certain client information, including, in some cases, beneficial ownership, as well as to maintain adequate internal controls to prevent and detect possible violations of anti-money laundering rules. In addition, in connection with its administration and enforcement of economic and trade sanctions based on United States foreign policy and national security goals, the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) publishes a list of individuals and companies owned or controlled by, or acting for or on behalf of, targeted countries. It also lists individuals, groups and entities, such as terrorists and narcotics traffickers, designated under programs that are not country-specific. Collectively, such individuals and companies are called “Specially Designated Nationals” (“SDNs”). Assets of SDNs are blocked, and we are generally prohibited from dealing with them. In addition, OFAC administers a number of comprehensive sanctions and embargoes that target certain countries, governments and geographic regions. We are generally prohibited from engaging in transactions involving any country, government, entity, or person that is subject to such comprehensive sanctions.

Certain parts of our business are subject to compliance with laws and regulations of United States federal and state governments, non-United States governments, their respective agencies and/or various self-regulatory organizations or exchanges relating to, among other things, the privacy of client information, and any failure to comply with these regulations could expose us to liability and/or reputational damage.
Europe
Our European advisory business is conducted primarily through our subsidiary, Houlihan Lokey EMEA, LLP, a limited liability partnership organized under the laws of England and Wales, with its main office in the United Kingdom and branches in France, Germany, Spain and Croatia.
Houlihan Lokey EMEA, LLP is authorized and regulated by the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority. The current UK regulatory regime is based upon the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (“FSMA”), together with secondary legislation and other rules made under FSMA. These rules govern our financial advisory business in the United Kingdom, including regulated activities, record keeping, approval standards for individuals, anti-money laundering and periodic reporting. 
Houlihan Lokey EMEA, LLP has exercised the appropriate European financial services passport rights to provide cross-border services into all other members of the European Economic Area (the “EEA”) from the United Kingdom and to establish branches in France, Germany, Spain and Croatia. These “passport” rights derive from the pan-European regime established by the EU Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, which regulates the provision of investment services and activities throughout the EEA.  
In June 2016, the United Kingdom voted to withdraw from the European Union (“Brexit”). The Article 50 European Union (EU) exit process was invoked by the UK government on March 2017. This provided for a two-year period at the end of which the United Kingdom was scheduled to leave the EU, and during which time the parties sought to negotiate the terms of their separation (“Exit Deal”). While an Exit Deal has not yet been finally agreed and ratified, the remaining EU27 member states have now agreed with the UK to delay Brexit until October 31, 2019 (at the latest), on the outstanding condition that the UK does not undermine the smooth running of the EU and its institutions. The date on which the UK leaves the EU also could be before October 31, 2019 if the UK and EU ratify an Exit Deal, which might provide for a further transitional period allowing for a managed regulatory realignment between the EU and UK. In order to mitigate the effects of Brexit on our European business, we have incorporated a new European hub entity in Germany, from which we plan to conduct our regulated business in the EU should it no longer be practicable to provide such services cross-border from the UK. We have filed an application with the relevant German regulatory authorities to conduct this business from the new German entity. Brexit may further impact our European business in ways that are unknown at this time and/or may result in costs that are indeterminate at this time.
Since the acquisition of our subsidiary Quayle Munro Limited (now renamed "Houlihan Lokey (Corporate Finance) Limited"), we have continued to operate its business through that entity. It is also authorized and regulated by the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority and has exercised passport rights as referred to above to provide cross-border services into other EEA states where it provides services time to time. In addition to Houlihan Lokey (Corporate Finance) Limited, we provide corporate finance advisory services through other subsidiaries in Germany, the Netherlands and Spain as well as holding a joint venture interest in an entity providing such services in Italy.
Hong Kong
In Hong Kong, the Securities and Futures Commission (the “SFC”) regulates our subsidiary, Houlihan Lokey (China) Limited. The compliance requirements of the SFC include, among other things, various codes of conduct and certain capital requirements. The SFC licenses the activities of the officers, directors, employees of Houlihan Lokey (China) Limited, and requires the registration of such individuals as licensed representatives.
Australia
In July 2017, the Company purchased the remaining interest of Houlihan Lokey (Australia) Pty Limited ("HL Australia") that we did not previous own, which was historically operated as our joint venture in Australia. HL Australia is licensed and subject to regulation by the Australian Securities & Investments Commission and must also comply with applicable provisions of the Corporations Act 2001 and other Australian legal and regulatory requirements, including capital adequacy rules, customer protection rules, and compliance with other applicable trading and investment banking regulations.
7

Singapore
On April 26, 2017, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (“MAS”) acknowledged receipt of the lodgment by our subsidiary, Houlihan Lokey (Singapore) Private Limited, of the relevant form notifying MAS of its commencement of business as a person exempted from the requirement to hold a capital markets services license to carry on business in advising on corporate finance activities, with effect from March 6, 2017.  As a result of such lodgment, Houlihan Lokey (Singapore) Private Limited is able to conduct business in Singapore as an “exempt corporate finance adviser,” subject to compliance with regulation governing such status as applicable from time to time in Singapore.
Dubai
Effective September 25, 2017, the Dubai Financial Services Authority ("DFSA") granted a license under Article 48 of the Regulatory Law 2004 to Houlihan Lokey (MEA Financial Advisory) Limited to carry on business providing certain regulated financial services from its office in the Dubai International Financial Centre. Such entity is subject to DFSA administered law and regulation (most notably as provided in the DFSA Rulebook), and individuals within it carrying out "licensed functions" (essentially senior management roles) are required to be approved by DFSA to so act. 
Other
The United States and non-United States government agencies and self-regulatory organizations, as well as state securities commissions in the United States, are empowered to conduct periodic examinations and initiate administrative proceedings that can result in censure, fines, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders or the suspension or expulsion of a broker-dealer or its directors, officers or employees.
The United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (the “FCPA”), the UK 2010 Bribery Act and similar laws to which we may be subject prohibit the payment of bribes to foreign government officials and political figures. The FCPA has a broad reach, covering all United States companies and citizens doing business abroad, and defining a foreign official to include not only those holding public office but also local citizens acting in an official capacity for or on behalf of foreign government-run or -owned organizations or public international organizations. The FCPA also requires maintenance of appropriate books and records and maintenance of adequate internal controls to prevent and detect possible FCPA violations. Similarly, the UK 2010 Bribery Act prohibits us from bribing, being bribed or making other prohibited payments to government officials or other persons to obtain or retain business or gain some other business advantage.

Organizational Structure
Overview
Houlihan Lokey, Inc. is a holding company that operates our business through its subsidiaries, the primary subsidiaries being Houlihan Lokey Capital, HLFA and Houlihan Lokey EMEA LLP, each of which is described above under “Regulation.”
The diagram below depicts our current organizational structure and the percentages are as of March 31, 2019:
HL Voting Trust Agreement
In connection with the corporate reorganization and the IPO, we entered into the Voting Trust Agreement (the “HL Voting Trust Agreement”) dated as of August 18, 2015 with the HL Holders and the trustees of the HL Voting Trust. Pursuant to the HL Voting Trust Agreement, the trustees have the right to vote the shares of our common stock deposited by any HL Holder, together with any shares of Class B common stock acquired by such HL Holder, in their sole and absolute discretion on any matter, without fiduciary duties of any kind to the HL Holders. As of March 31, 2019, the HL Voting Trust controlled approximately 80.4% of the total voting power of the Company.
9

Lock-Up Agreements
In connection with the corporate reorganization and subsequent grants of Class B common stock, each HL Holder depositing shares of our common stock into the HL Voting Trust also entered into an individual lock-up agreement with the Company. Under these lock-up agreements, shares of our common stock deposited into the HL Voting Trust and beneficially owned by the HL Holders generally were locked up for a period of three years following the effective date of the IPO, after which these shares become transferable in three equal installments on each of the third, fourth and fifth anniversary of the IPO; provided that shares of our common stock held by managing directors and certain senior corporate officers of the Company whose employment with us or any of our subsidiaries terminated prior to the third anniversary of the IPO for reasons other than death or disability generally are subject to transfer restrictions, and are ineligible to participate in any follow-on offerings, in each case, through the seventh anniversary of the IPO. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the lock-up agreements provide that:
•up to 10% of each HL Holder’s shares held through the HL Voting Trust may be transferred for the purpose of charitable gifts and transfers to various family trusts for estate planning purposes, with any shares transferred under this exception reducing the number of shares that become transferable on the next transferability date; and
•our board of directors may authorize sales in underwritten offerings in accordance with the terms of the registration rights agreement entered into between HL and the HL Holders; provided that any shares sold under this exception will reduce the number of shares that become transferable on the next transferability date.
Under the lock-up agreements, our board of directors may consent to exceptions to those transfer restrictions, subject to any limitations or conditions imposed by it.
Stockholders’ Agreement
In connection with the IPO, we entered into the Stockholders' Agreement dated as of August 18, 2015 (the "Stockholders' Agreement") with ORIX USA and the trustees of the HL Voting Trust. Pursuant to the Stockholders' Agreement, our board of directors initially consisted of eleven members, with ORIX USA and the trustees on behalf of the HL Voting Trust each having the right to recommend the nomination of four of the eleven board members. In August 2018, the Post-IPO Percentage Ownership (as defined in the Stockholders' Agreement) of ORIX USA decreased below 10%, as a result of which the number of director nominees that ORIX USA was entitled to recommend pursuant to the Stockholders’ Agreement was reduced to one and the number of director nominees that the trustees of the HL Voting Trust was entitled to recommend was increased to ten.  On October 18, 2018, Ron K. Barger, Robert J.B. Lenhardt and Paul E. Wilson resigned from their positions as directors of the Company, effective as of such date. Each of Messrs. Barger, Lenhardt and Wilson were nominated by ORIX USA and had been elected as directors of the Company in accordance with the Stockholders’ Agreement. Effective immediately following the resignations described above, the remaining members of the Company’s board of directors (i) elected Paul Zuber to serve as an independent Class I director of the Company, until the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and until such time as his successor shall be duly elected and duly qualified or until his earlier death, resignation or removal and (ii) reduced the size of the board from eleven members to nine members.  After the reduction of the number of board members, the trustees of the HL Voting Trust have the right to recommend the nomination of eight members of the Company's board of directors and ORIX USA is entitled to nominate one member of the Company’s board of directors. Hideto Nishitani continues to serve on the Company’s board of directors as a nominee of ORIX USA. In addition, under the Stockholders' Agreement, we have agreed with ORIX USA upon certain standards to be satisfied in order for shares of our common stock subject to individual lock-up agreements to participate in underwritten offerings. 
10

Controlled Company
The HL Voting Trust and ORIX USA control a majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock. As a result, we are a “controlled company” under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange. Under these rules, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by an individual, group or another company is a “controlled company” and may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance standards, including the requirements that (i) a majority of our board of directors consist of independent directors and (ii) that our board of directors have compensation and nominating and corporate governance committees composed entirely of independent directors, as independence is defined in Rule 10A-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") and under the New York Stock Exchange listing standards. We utilize, and intend to continue to utilize, these exemptions. As a result, although we have a fully independent audit committee as required by the New York Stock Exchange, we do not expect that the majority of our directors will be independent for some time. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Class A Common Stock—We are a “controlled company” within the meaning of the New York Stock Exchange listing standards and, as a result, qualify for, and rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements. Holders of Class A common stock do not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to such requirements.” In the event that we cease to be a “controlled company” and our shares continue to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, we will be required to comply with these provisions by the expiration of the applicable transition periods.
