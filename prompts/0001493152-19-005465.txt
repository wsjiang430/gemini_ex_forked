ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Name and Organization
 
Trillion Energy International Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, (“Trillion Energy”, “Company”, “we” or “our”) is headquartered out of Vancouver with operations based primarily from Turkey at Turan Gunes Bulvari, Park Oran Ofis Plaza, 180-y, Daire:54, Kat:16, 06450, Oran, Cankaya, Ankara, Turkey. The Company also has registered offices in Canada and Bulgaria. The Company was incorporated in Delaware in 2015.
General
 
Trillion Energy International Inc. is focused on expanding its portfolio of projects in Southeast Europe, Turkey and countries in the immediate vicinity. The Company’s concentration is on recently acquired oil and gas producing assets in Turkey and a coal bed methane exploration license in Bulgaria.
Turkey
 
On January 18, 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of three oil and gas exploration and production companies operating in Turkey (the “Tiway Companies”). The purchase price for the acquisition of the Tiway Companies from Tiway Oil B.V. was $2.1 million. As a result of the acquisition of the Tiway Companies, The Company now owns interests in a producing oil field, a producing gas field, and a shut in gas field in Turkey, one of which is offshore and the other two are onshore. We have changed the name of the Tiway Companies to include Park Place in the name so hereinafter we will refer to them as the “PPE Turkey Companies”.
 
At December 31, 2018, net production to the PPE Turkey Companies from such fields was 209 barrels of oil equivalent per day or Boe/d; and for the year 2018, net production to the PPE Turkey Companies averaged 215 Boe/d. Due to the acquisition of the PPE Turkey Companies, the Company is now a qualified oil and gas operator in Turkey based in Ankara. With this base of operations in Turkey and its experienced management team, The Company is poised to exploit these assets and for further growth in the region.
 
The primary asset of the PPE Turkey Companies is the Cendere onshore oil field license as well as the offshore production licenses called the South Akcakoca Sub-Basin (“SASB”). The Company owns a 19.6% interest in the Cendere oil field except three wells where the Company owns 9.8% interest. The Company owns a 49% working interest in SASB, 12.5% which was obtained during the year ending December 31, 2018.
 
The Cendere oil field is a long term low decline oil reserve.
 
SASB has four producing fields, each with a production platform plus subsea pipelines that connect the fields to an onshore gas plant. The SASB fields are located off the north coast of Turkey towards the western end of the Black Sea in water depths ranging from 60 to100 meters. Gas is produced from Eocene age sandstone reservoirs at subsea depths ranging from 1100 to1800 meters. The three nearer shore gas fields of Ayazli (discovered in 2004), Dogu Ayazli (discovered 2005) and Akkaya (discovered in 2006) were included in an initial phase of development with first gas production in 2007. The deeper water Akcakoca field (discovered in 2006) was developed later with first gas production in 2011. All the fields are developed using unmanned well head platforms/tripods tied back via an 18 kilometre (“km”) 12-inch pipeline to shared processing and compression facilities onshore at Cayagzi gas plant. The gas plant at Cayagzi is capable of processing up to 75 million cubic feet of gas per day. Sales gas is exported via an 18.6 km long 16-inch onshore pipeline, which ties into the main national gas transmission network operated by BOTAS. Historically, gas has been produced at rates of as high as 30 MMcf/d from SASB; total gross production to date from the four fields is in excess of 40 Bcf. The production license for SASB is covered by a modern 223 square kilometre 3D survey. There are five additional gas discoveries in SASB that have not yet been developed. Also, there are several additional prospects defined by 3D seismic data.

At December 31, 2018, the gross oil production rate for the producing wells in Cendere was 890 bbls/day ; the average daily 2018 gross production rate for the field was 770 bbls/day. At the end of March 2019, oil is currently sold at a price of approximately US$65 per barrel for a netback per barrel of approximately US$35. At year-end 2018, the Cendere field was producing 170 barrels of oil per day, net to the PPE Turkey Companies; and averaged 150 barrels per day during 2018 net to the PPE Turkey Companies.
 
At December 31, 2018, the gross gas production rate for the ten producing wells in SASB was 0.816 MMcfd; the average daily 2018 gross production rate for the field was 1.04 MMcfd. At the end of February 2019, gas is currently sold at a price of approximately US$7.01 per Mcf for a netback per Mcf of approximately minus US$1.66.
 
The Company has identified a number of proved undeveloped locations that can be drilled from the four existing production platforms. The Company envisions the next stage of development in 2018 will include the drilling of additional wells to materially increase the volumes of gas produced through the existing infrastructure.
 
With the acquisition of the PPE Turkey Companies, the Company also acquired another oil and gas asset, a 50% operated interest in the Bakuk gas field located near the Syrian border. The Bakuk field is shut-in with no plans to revive production in the near term.
 
Funds for the acquisition were raised through a combination of private placements and loans. From a private placement that closed in January 2017, along with an earlier placement that closed in early 2016, where the Company raised just over $1.4 million. The remainder of needed funds was obtained through loans. The private placement that closed concurrent with closing of this acquisition raised $1,015,000. We sold units at $0.20 per unit which consisted of one common share and one share warrant at $0.40 exercisable on or before January 17, 2018.
 
Bulgaria License
 
In October of 2010, the Company was awarded an exploration permit for the “Vranino 1-11 Block”, a 98,205 acre oil and gas exploration land located in Dobrudja Basin, Bulgaria, by the Bulgarian Counsel of Ministers. On April 1, 2014, the Company entered into an Agreement for Crude Oil and Natural Gas Prospecting and Exploration in the Vranino 1-11 Block with the Ministry of Economy and Energy of Bulgaria (the “License Agreement”). The initial term of the License Agreement is five years. This five-year period will commence once the Bulgarian regulatory authorities approve of the Company’s work programs for the permit area. The License Agreement (or applicable legislation) provides for possible extension periods for up to five additional years during the exploration phase, as well as the conversion of the License Agreement to an exploitation concession, which can last for up to 35 years. Under the License Agreement, the Company will submit a yearly work program that is subject to the approval of the Bulgarian regulatory authorities.
 
The Company’s commitment is to perform geological and geophysical exploration activities in the first 3 years of the initial term (the “Exploration and Geophysical Work Stage”), followed by drilling activities in years 4 and 5 of the initial term (the “Data Evaluation and Drilling Stage”). The Company is required to drill 10,000 meters (approximately 32,800 feet) of new wellbore (which may be vertical, horizontal or diagonal) and conduct other exploration activities during the initial term.
 
Pursuant to the License Agreement, the Company is obligated to incur minimum costs during the initial term as follows:
 

(i) | $925,000 for the Exploration and Geophysical Work Stage; and 
-----+-----------------------------------------------------------------
(ii) | $3,675,000 for the Data Evaluation and Drilling Stage. 

 
In addition, during the term of the License Agreement, the Company is obligated to pay an annual land rental fee of 15,897 BGN (US $8,584 based on the exchange rate of .54 Lev to Dollar as of March 7, 2017). The Company is permitted to commence limited production during the initial term of the License Agreement. Upon confirmation of a commercial discovery, the Company is entitled to convert the productive area of the license to an exploitation concession that may last for up to 35 years provided that the minimum work commitments are satisfied.

Before the license for the Bulgarian CBM project is “effective”, the Company’s overall work program and first year annual work program must be approved by both the Bulgarian environmental ministry and the energy ministry. On August 26, 2014, the Bulgarian environmental agency approved the Company’s overall work program and first year annual work program. A number of parties appealed the decision of the environmental agency and an appeal proceeding was commenced before a three judge administrative panel. The three judge panel issued a decision on February 3, 2017 in which it ruled that the environmental agency had failed to follow its own regulations in approving the Company’s work programs. Both the environmental agency and the Company have appealed the decision to a five-judge panel whose decision will be final. A final decision was issued in favor of the Company during 2017.
 
The Company has suspended its data gathering, evaluation and planning, pending outcome of the above described proceedings. It has acquired the land for one future well site and has completed an environmental baseline survey of the license area.
 
Patents and Trademarks
 
We do not own, either legally or beneficially, any patent or trademark.
 
Research and Development Expenditures
 
We have not incurred any research or development expenditures since our incorporation.
 
Government Regulation
 
Our current or future operations, including exploration and development activities on our properties, require permits from various governmental authorities, and such operations are and will be governed by laws and regulations of the jurisdiction in which we are conducting business. These laws and regulations concern exploration, development, production, exports, taxes, labor laws and standards, occupational health, waste disposal, toxic substances, land use, environmental protection and other matters. Compliance with these requirements may prove to be difficult and expensive. Due to our international operations, we are subject to the following issues and uncertainties that can affect our operations adversely:

● | the risk of expropriation, nationalization, war, revolution, political instability, border disputes, renegotiation or modification of existing contracts, and import, export and transportation regulations and tariffs; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | laws of foreign governments affecting our ability to fracture stimulate oil or natural gas wells, such as the legislation enacted in Bulgaria in January 2012, discussed in greater detail below; 
● | the risk of not being able to procure residency and work permits for our expatriate personnel; 
● | taxation policies, including royalty and tax increases and retroactive tax claims; 
● | exchange controls, currency fluctuations and other uncertainties arising out of foreign government sovereignty over international operations; 
● | laws and policies of the United States affecting foreign trade, taxation and investment; 
● | the possibility of being subjected to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts in connection with legal disputes and the possible inability to subject foreign persons to the jurisdiction of courts in the United States; and 
● | the possibility of restrictions on repatriation of earnings or capital from foreign countries. 

 
Permits and Licenses. In order to carry out exploration and development of oil and natural gas interests or to place these interests into commercial production, we may require certain licenses and permits from various governmental authorities. There can be no guarantee that we will be able to obtain all necessary licenses and permits that may be required. In addition, such licenses and permits are subject to change and there can be no assurances that any application to renew any existing licenses or permits will be approved.

Repatriation of Earnings. Currently, there are no restrictions on the repatriation of earnings or capital to foreign entities from Bulgaria. In Turkey, funds which are invested in the Turkish entities and which are registered with the Turkish authorities may be repatriated without tax. There is a 10% tax on dividends on profits which are transferred out of Turkey. However, there can be no assurance that any such restrictions on repatriation of earnings or capital from the aforementioned countries or any other country where we may invest will not be imposed, changed or increased in the future.
 
Environmental. The oil and natural gas industry is subject to extensive environmental regulations. Environmental regulations establish standards respecting health, safety and environmental matters and place restrictions and prohibitions on emissions of various substances produced concurrently with oil and natural gas. The regulatory requirements cover the handling and disposal of drilling and production waste products and waste created by water and air pollution control procedures. These regulations may have an impact on the selection of drilling locations and facilities, potentially resulting in increased capital expenditures. In addition, environmental legislation may require those wells and production facilities to be abandoned and sites reclaimed to the satisfaction of local authorities. Such regulation has increased the cost of planning, designing, drilling, operating and, in some instances, abandoning wells. We are committed to complying with environmental and operation legislation wherever we operate.
 
There has been a recent surge in interest among the media, government regulators and private citizens concerning the possible negative environmental and geological effects of fracture stimulation. Some have alleged that fracture stimulation results in the contamination of aquifers and may even contribute to seismic activity. In January 2012, the government of Bulgaria enacted legislation that banned the fracture stimulation of oil and natural gas wells in Bulgaria and imposed large monetary penalties on companies that violate that ban. Such legislation or regulations could impact our ability to drill and complete wells, and could increase the cost of planning, designing, drilling, completing and operating wells. We are committed to complying with legislation and regulations involving fracture stimulation wherever we operate.
 
Such laws and regulations not only expose us to liability for our own negligence but may also expose us to liability for the conduct of others or for our actions that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time those actions were taken. We may incur significant costs as a result of environmental accidents, such as oil spills, natural gas leaks, ruptures, or discharges of hazardous materials into the environment, including clean-up costs and fines or penalties. Additionally, we may incur significant costs in order to comply with environmental laws and regulations and may be forced to pay fines or penalties if we do not comply.
 
Competition
 
Bulgaria imports nearly all of their natural gas requirements; Turkey imports a substantial quantity of the same. Both countries encourage domestic production as a way to reduce imports and increase energy security. In Turkey, natural gas is imported from a number of countries so there is a vibrant market for natural gas produced in the country. In Bulgaria, currently one company, Gazprom, supplies Bulgaria with virtually all of its natural gas being marketed and consumed in Bulgaria through a pipeline that runs through Ukraine from Russia. On a regional level, we compete for license blocks and capital with other oil and gas exploration companies and independent producers who are actively seeking oil and natural gas properties throughout the world, but in particular, in Southeast Europe, Turkey and countries in the immediate vicinity.
 
The principal area of competition is encountered in the financial ability of our Company to acquire acreage positions and drill wells to explore for oil and natural gas, then, if warranted, install production equipment. Competition for the acquisition of oil and gas license areas is high in Europe. Therefore, we may or may not be successful in acquiring additional blocks in the face of this competition. Presently, we are not seeking additional license blocks.

From a general standpoint, we operate in the highly competitive areas of oil and natural gas exploration, development, production and acquisition with a substantial number of other companies, including U.S.-based and international companies doing business in each of the countries in which we operate. We face intense competition from independent, technology-driven companies as well as from both major and other independent oil and natural gas companies in each of the following areas:
 

● | seeking oil and natural gas exploration licenses and production licenses and leases; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | acquiring desirable producing properties or new leases for future exploration; 
● | marketing oil and natural gas production; 
● | integrating new technologies; and 
● | contracting for drilling services and equipment and securing the expertise necessary to develop and operate properties. 

 
Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, managerial, technological and other resources than we do. To the extent competitors are able to pay more for properties than we are paying, we will be at a competitive disadvantage. Further, many of our competitors enjoy technological advantages over us and may be able to implement new technologies more rapidly than we can. Our ability to explore for and produce oil and natural gas prospects and to acquire additional properties in the future will depend upon our ability to successfully conduct operations, implement advanced technologies, evaluate and select suitable properties and consummate transactions in this highly competitive environment.
 
Employees, Officers and Directors
 
As of December 31, 2018, the Company has 10 employees in Turkey, and three in North America. As of December 31, 2018, our business is generally conducted through our officers and directors and through consultants of the Company. A description of officers and directors can be found in Item 10.
