 ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
 Overview 
 We are a wireless communications company focused on developing and commercializing our spectrum assets to enable our targeted critical infrastructure and enterprise customers to deploy private broadband networks, technologies and solutions.  We are the largest holder of licensed spectrum in the 900 MHz band (896-901/935-940 MHz) throughout the contiguous United States, plus Hawaii, Alaska and Puerto Rico. On average, we hold approximately 60% of channels in the 900 MHz band in the top 20 metropolitan market areas in the United States.  We are currently pursuing a regulatory proceeding at the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) that seeks to modernize and realign the 900 MHz band to increase its usability and capacity by allowing it to be utilized for the deployment of broadband networks, technologies and solutions. At the same time, we are pursuing business opportunities with our targeted critical infrastructure and enterprise customers to build awareness and demand for our spectrum assets, assuming we achieve a favorable result with our FCC initiatives.  Our Business Strategy
 Our goal is to become the leading provider of broadband spectrum assets to critical infrastructure and enterprise customers.  Assuming our FCC initiatives are successful, our spectrum assets will enable our customers to deploy broadband networks, technologies and solutions that are private, secure, reliable and cost-effective and at the same time allow them to achieve their modernization objectives and regulatory obligations.  We intend to pursue this goal by pursuing the following business strategies:
 1.Increase the Efficiency and Capacity of Our Spectrum.  Our spectrum is our most valuable asset.  While our current licensed spectrum can support narrowband and wideband wireless services, the most significant business opportunities we have identified require contiguous spectrum that allows for greater bandwidth than allowed by the current configuration of our spectrum.  As a result, our first priority is to continue to pursue our initiatives at the FCC seeking to modernize and realign the 900 MHz band to increase its usability and capacity by allowing it to accommodate the deployment of broadband networks, technologies and solutions.  In March 2019, the FCC unanimously adopted a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (“NPRM”) in WT Docket No. 17-200 (the “900 MHz Proceeding”) that endorses our objective of creating a broadband opportunity in the 900 MHz band for critical infrastructure and other enterprise users.  Please see the section titled “Our FCC Initiatives” below for a discussion of the evolution and status of our FCC initiatives.
 2. Facilitate the Deployment of Private Broadband Networks, Technologies and Solutions. Complementing our regulatory initiatives, we are engaged in a number of business activities to begin commercializing our spectrum assets to our targeted critical infrastructure and enterprise customers, including:
 ﻿
 A.Identify and Evaluate Potential Use Cases and Customers. Our team has engaged in an intensive research and outreach program to identify customers who would value deploying and operating private broadband networks, technologies and solutions utilizing our spectrum assets.  As part of this process, we identified and evaluated possible use cases for these potential customers.  Based on these efforts, we identified the electric utilities industry, and opportunities related to modernization of the utility smart grid, as our first focused customer group.  We are engaged in discussions with electric utility companies who are investigating ways to fulfill their existing and future network and communication needs.  A wide variety of both mobile and fixed use cases, including smart sensors and devices, appear to be well-suited to the coverage, penetration and capacity characteristics of the potential broadband spectrum we are seeking to acquire through our FCC initiatives.  A number of our potential utility customers have put on the record as part of the 900 MHz Proceeding their needs and unique requirements for broadband networks, technologies and solutions that are privately owned, secure, reliable, high-performance and cost-effective.    ﻿
 B.Develop an Effective Business Model. In addition to identifying potential customers and use cases, our team is evaluating the appropriate business model for commercializing our spectrum assets, assuming our FCC initiatives are successful.  Based on our analysis, and discussions with potential customers, we intend to lease our spectrum to customers for 20 year or longer terms.   We also intend for our lease arrangements to include pricing escalators and long-term renewal options. We also expect that our customers will bear the costs of deploying and operating their private broadband networks, technologies and solutions.  We will be responsible for the costs of securing the broadband licenses from the FCC, including the costs of acquiring sufficient spectrum to support broadband use and retuning incumbents to clear the spectrum.  The timing and costs of our spectrum acquisition and retuning activities will be based on the terms of the Report and Order, if any, the FCC adopts in the 900 MHz Proceeding.  We are also exploring opportunities to offer our customers value-added engineering and commercial services.    ﻿
 C.Identify and Evaluate Available Technologies. Our spectrum assets are located within the 3GPP global standard of Band 8 (also known as the E-GSM band, or 880 - 915 MHz paired with 925 - 960 MHz).  Band 8 has been internationally approved and is currently being utilized with Long Term Evolution (“LTE”) broadband networks, technologies and solutions in a number of global regions, including in Japan, Taiwan, Singapore, South Korea, Hong Kong, the Netherlands and Sweden.  As a result, we believe there is an ecosystem of existing LTE broadband devices and network components and solutions that can be adapted for 

 
 Page 2

 
     use on the contiguous spectrum we are seeking to create in the 900 MHz Proceeding.  Based on our test results, a number of these existing devices and network components and solutions would be well suited for the working environment of our targeted critical infrastructure and enterprise customers. In February 2019, we and the Department of Energy (“DOE”) National Renewable Energy Laboratory (the “NREL”) announced a project to analyze the performance of private LTE broadband networks in utility use cases utilizing our spectrum.  The goal of the project is to help accelerate the development and validation of innovative approaches to enhance the resilience of electrical distribution systems.  The DOE awarded the project “high-impact” status, which is awarded to projects that look to accelerate innovation in the private sector and to develop scalable technologies that satisfy the goals of the DOE’s Grid Modernization Initiative.    ﻿
 D.Build and Support the Utility Broadband Alliance (“UBBA”). In February 2019, we announced that we and a diverse group of utility companies, technology innovators and industry leaders had formed UBBA.  UBBA aims to assist its members in planning and deploying secure, reliable and resilient private broadband networks to support the transforming electrical grid.  The founding members of UBBA represent utility industry organizations positioned at the forefront of advancing grid modernization, including Ameren, Burns & McDonnell, Cisco Systems, Inc., Encore Networks, Inc., Ericsson, Inc., Federated Wireless, Inc., General Electric, Motorola Solutions, Inc., Multi-Tech Systems, Inc., National Grid, Sierra Wireless, Inc., and Southern Linc.  As of May 1, 2019, including us, UBBA had 16 members.  We intend to continue to support UBBA, and help it continue to increase its membership and its influence with utilities. 
 ﻿
 E.Build Support with Federal and State Agencies. Our targeted critical infrastructure customers are highly regulated by both federal and state agencies.  Electrical utilities, for example, are regulated by federal agencies ranging from the Department of Energy, the Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the national Institute of Standards and Technologies.  We are working with each of these agencies to educate them about the security, reliability and priority access benefits that private broadband LTE networks, technologies and solutions can offer utilities.   We are also working with a number of state agencies and commissions who regulate electrical utilities, and who have a strong influence over electric utility buying decisions. Our goal with these state agencies and commissions is to gain their support for utilities being allowed to pass the capital costs of leasing our spectrum assets and deploying private broadband LTE networks, technologies and solutions to ratepayers, including at a customary rate of return for the electric utility company. 
 ﻿
 F.Selectively Purchase Additional Spectrum. We have completed, and intend to continue to pursue, a limited number of spectrum acquisitions to support our realignment efforts and to acquire the spectrum assets we will need to obtain broadband licenses from the FCC, assuming our FCC initiatives are successful.  We intend to continue to prioritize our spectrum acquisitions in major metropolitan areas. We also intend to pursue spectrum acquisitions opportunistically and selectively to avoid unduly increasing the cost of the spectrum assets we acquire.    3.Identify and Evaluate New Opportunities. The wireless communications industry is highly competitive, and subject to rapid regulatory, technological and market changes.  A key part of our business strategy is to continually monitor changes in the wireless industry and to evaluate how these changes could enable us to maximize the value of our spectrum assets.  Additionally, although we are initially focusing on the utilities industry, we have identified other customer groups, including ports, railroads, oil and gas facilities and mining operations, where we believe there are both customer demand and a good fit for the private broadband networks, technologies and solutions that our future spectrum assets could support.    4.Leverage the Experience and Relationships of Our Executive Team. Our senior executive team has a long, proven track record in the network and mobile communications industry, including founding and building Nextel into a nationwide wireless carrier before selling it to Sprint for a stand-alone value of approximately $36 billion.  Our executives helped build Nextel by pursuing a number of FCC initiatives to enhance Nextel’s existing spectrum assets and by identifying an underserved market segment, and despite the competition, creating a better solution for potential customers in this market segment.  We intend to leverage the experience of our executive team to achieve our regulatory spectrum goals and to identify and execute on our business strategies and opportunities. 
 Our Spectrum Assets
 We are the largest holder of FCC-licensed spectrum in the 900 MHz band (896-901/935-940 MHz), with a nationwide footprint in the contiguous United States, plus Hawaii, Alaska and Puerto Rico.  In the 900 MHz band, the FCC has allocated approximately 10 MHz of spectrum, sub-divided into 40 10-channel blocks of contiguous channels alternating between blocks designated for the operation of Specialized Mobile Radio (“SMR”) commercial systems and blocks designated for private land mobile systems for business users (“B/ILT”), with the FCC’s rules also enabling B/ILT licenses to be converted to SMR use.  Subsequently, the FCC conducted overlay auctions on the SMR designated blocks that awarded geographic based licenses on a Major Trading Area (“MTA”) basis while affording operational protection to incumbent, site-based licensees in those areas.  Certain MTA licenses were not purchased at auction or have been returned to the FCC. In addition, the FCC has never auctioned the 20 blocks of B/ILT spectrum, and in some parts of the U.S., no users have requested site-based licenses utilizing this spectrum.  As a result, the FCC is currently holding 900 MHz spectrum in inventory in some parts of the U.S. Page 3

 
     We hold, on average, approximately 60% of the 399 channels in the 900 MHz band in the top 20 metropolitan market areas in the United States, which covers approximately 70% of the U.S. population.  Our holdings include almost every 900 MHz SMR MTA geographic license in all but a few markets in the U.S., as well as certain converted B/ILT licenses in most major markets.  We acquired our 900 MHz spectrum and certain related equipment from Sprint in September 2014 for $100 million, which we paid in the form of $90 million in cash and $10 million in shares of our common stock.   Our FCC Initiatives 
 Joint Petition. In November 2014, we and the Enterprise Wireless Alliance (“EWA”) submitted a Joint Petition for Rulemaking (the “Joint Petition”) with the FCC proposing a realignment of a portion of the 900 MHz band to create a 6 MHz broadband authorization, while retaining 4 MHz for continued narrowband operations.  The EWA is a trade association representing the spectrum interests of a broad range of business enterprise, critical infrastructure and commercial service providers.   In response to the Joint Petition, the FCC issued a public notice requesting comments from interested parties and asked a number of questions about the proposal. A number of parties, including several incumbent licensees, filed comments with the FCC expressing their views, including both support and opposition.  In May 2015, we and the EWA filed proposed rules with the FCC related to our Joint Petition recommending procedural and technical operating parameters and processes related to the administration and technical sequencing of the proposed realignment of the 900 MHz band.  Our proposed rules included the requirement for the broadband operator to provide comparable facilities to incumbent licensees, to pay the costs of their realignment, and to utilize available filtering technologies to protect incumbents adjacent to the proposed broadband portion of the 900 MHz band.  The FCC issued a public notice on the proposed rules and received comments from interested parties.  
 Notice of Inquiry. In August 2017, the FCC issued a Notice of Inquiry (“NOI”) announcing that it had commenced a proceeding to examine whether it would be in the public interest to change the existing rules governing the 900 MHz band to increase access to spectrum, improve spectrum efficiency and expand flexibility for a variety of potential uses and applications, including broadband and other advanced technologies and services. The FCC requested interested parties, including us, to comment on a number of questions related to three potential options for the 900 MHz band: (i) retaining the current configuration of the 900 MHz band, but increasing operational flexibility, (ii) reconfiguring a portion or all of the 900 MHz band to support broadband and other advanced technologies and services, or (iii) retaining the current 900 MHz band licensing and eligibility rules.  Because the FCC requested information on multiple options for the 900 MHz band, the NOI effectively superseded the Joint Petition and other pending proposals that involved the 900 MHz band.  We and EWA filed a joint response to the FCC’s NOI in October 2017 and reply comments in November 2017.     Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. On March 14, 2019, the FCC unanimously adopted the NPRM that endorsed our objective of creating a broadband opportunity in the 900 MHz band for critical infrastructure and other enterprise users.  The NPRM generally proposes our recommended band plan concept and technical rules.  Importantly, the proposed technical rules include our recommended equipment specifications that will enable the deployment and use of available, globally standardized broadband LTE networks, technologies and solutions.  
 In the NPRM, the FCC has proposed three criteria for an applicant to secure a broadband license in a particular county within the U.S.: (i) the applicant must hold all 20 blocks of geographic SMR licenses in the county; (ii) the applicant must reach agreement to relocate all incumbents in the broadband segment on a 1:1 voluntary channel exchange or demonstrate that the incumbents will be protected from interference; and (iii) the applicant must agree to return to the FCC all rights to geographic and site-based spectrum in the county in exchange for the broadband license.  
 The FCC requested comments from incumbents and other interested parties on a number of important topics in the NPRM that will have a material impact on the timing and costs of obtaining a broadband license.  As noted above, the broadband applicant must hold all 20 blocks of geographic SMR licenses in the county.  In certain areas, some of the SMR spectrum is being held in inventory by the FCC.  In the NPRM, the FCC requested comments on how a broadband applicant could acquire the FCC’s inventory of geographic SMR allocated spectrum.  Specifically, in considering whether to make its inventory of geographic SMR spectrum available to the broadband applicant, the FCC has asked whether it should do so only if the applicant meets a threshold number of its own geographic SMR licenses.  The FCC also questions how to mitigate a windfall that might thereby be attributed to the broadband applicant by the FCC’s action.  We will need to address this issue, both in this context and in the context of exchanging narrowband for broadband spectrum.  We believe we have identified public interest arguments to justify such an action by the FCC as it will enable critical infrastructure and enterprise customers to deploy broadband networks, technologies and solutions.  
 The NPRM also proposes a market-driven, voluntary exchange process for clearing the broadband spectrum.  An applicant seeking a broadband license for a particular county will need to demonstrate that it has entered into agreements with incumbents or that it can protect their narrowband operations from interference.  All incumbents must be accounted for before the broadband applicant can file an application with the FCC. As the FCC recognized in the NPRM, this requirement, without some mechanism for preventing holdouts, could allow a single incumbent with a license for a single channel to thwart the FCC’s objective of creating a 900 MHz broadband opportunity in any county.     In the NPRM, the FCC has requested comments on different approaches to address the holdout situation.  One approach is based on a “success threshold” whereby once the potential broadband licensee has reached voluntary agreements with incumbents 

 
 Page 4

 
     holding a prescribed percentage of channels in the broadband segment, remaining incumbents would become subject to mandatory relocations. In this and other approaches set forth in the NPRM, the potential broadband licensee would be responsible for providing comparable facilities and paying the reasonable costs of relocation.   The NPRM proposes to exempt from mandatory relocation “complex systems,” those with 65 or more integrated sites.  There are only a small number of complex systems in the country in the broadband segment proposed by the FCC, and all of them are operated by utilities or other critical infrastructure entities.    The Association of American Railroads (“AAR”) holds a nationwide geographic license for six non-contiguous B/ILT channels in the 900 MHz band, three of which are located within the FCC’s proposed broadband segment.  The spectrum is used by freight railroads for Advanced Train Control System (“ATCS”) operations.  We have recognized from the outset the importance of reaching agreement with the railroads about their relocation and have worked with them throughout the FCC process.  We and the AAR are in agreement about the optimal solution.  However, this proposed solution will require an exemption from the relocation rules proposed by the FCC in the NPRM.  We are continuing to coordinate our activities at the FCC with the AAR in support of securing the required exemption from the FCC.  
 The NPRM also seeks comment on several different auction approaches for counties where the broadband segment cannot be cleared of incumbents, including overlay auctions that, again, would trigger mandatory relocation rights for the auction winner with the obligation of providing comparable facilities and paying reasonable relocation costs.  We believe the challenge of any proposed approach is achieving the appropriate balance between protecting incumbents’ rights to a minimally disruptive relocation process, and not preventing the deployment of broadband technologies on a timely and cost-effective basis.  
 While the NPRM proposes a 6 MHz broadband segment, it also asks for comment on a realignment of the entire 900 MHz band to create a 10 MHz broadband channel, citing suggestions from Southern California Edison and Duke Energy that this larger channel would better address their broadband needs.  
 The full text of the NPRM, and the comments and related correspondence filed in the 900 MHz Proceeding, are available on the FCC’s public website at https://www.fcc.gov/document/900-mhz-notice-of-proposed-rule-making. Comments to the NPRM are due on June 3, 2019 and reply comments will be due on July 2, 2019.  At the end of the reply comment period, the FCC’s next step could be the issuance of a Report and Order, a request for additional information, a decision to close the proceeding without further action, or some other action, and the timing of any such next step also remains uncertain.  In addition, the terms of any Report and Order may differ materially from the terms of the NPRM.    We are continuing to work collaboratively with the FCC and all affected parties toward adoption of the Report and Order as promptly as possible.  We have met, and intend to continue to meet, with a number of incumbent licensees, critical infrastructure businesses and other interested parties in the 900 MHz band. The goals of these discussions have been: (i) building consensus and soliciting support for the proposed reconfiguration of the 900 MHz band to support broadband and other advanced technologies and services; (ii) resolving any technology or other concerns raised by incumbent licensees; (iii) educating critical infrastructure and other enterprises on how broadband capabilities could enhance their operations and initiatives and their regulatory obligations; (iv) gaining a better understanding of the size of the operational incumbent base and the nature of the systems they are currently operating; and/or (v) evaluating and  proposing voluntary license relocation opportunities to, or purchase spectrum from, certain incumbent licensees.     Our Broadband Market Opportunity
 We have identified critical infrastructure and enterprise companies as the primary customers for our future broadband spectrum assets, assuming our FCC initiatives are successful.  Our targeted customers have historically built, maintained and operated their own communication networks, including private Land Mobile Radio (“LMR”) networks and supervisory control and data acquisition (“SCADA”) networks, on frequencies licensed exclusively to them by the FCC.  Based on our discussions, these entities commonly express their desire to retain the positive elements of their aging LMR and SCADA networks, namely private ownership, tight control and custom features (such as specialized coverage and priority access), while adding the benefits of broadband and other advanced technologies (such as solving a broader set of use cases, including high-speed data transmission and video services and economies of scale).  However, due to the general unavailability of low band spectrum (i.e., below 1GHz), these entities have had limited opportunities to license or acquire the spectrum required to deploy cost-effective broadband or other advanced technologies on their own.    Without the opportunity to operate their own broadband or advanced systems, some critical infrastructure and enterprise customers are pursuing other options, including considering the services offered by Tier 1 carriers.  The large consumer-focused Tier 1 carriers enjoy clear economies of scale benefits.  However, the networks designed and operated by these carriers primarily address the needs of their consumer customers and may not satisfy the highly specialized wireless communication requirements of large, complex critical infrastructure and enterprise companies.  We believe that security, priority access, latency, redundancy, private ownership and control and unique coverage requirements are just some of the reasons critical infrastructure and large enterprises would be interested in obtaining rights to deploy the broadband networks, technologies and solutions that can be enabled through use of our spectrum.    We have identified the electric utilities industry as our first focused customer group.  According to data published by Edison Electric Institute, annual capital spent by the 150 investor owned utilities (“IOUs”) located in the U.S. was approximately $120 billion dollars in 2017.  The electric utilities industry is undergoing a fundamental transformation.  Grid modernization efforts and the drive 

 
 Page 5

 
     to reduce carbon emissions have hindered the ability of utilities to build new large-scale, centralized facilities.  Today, power is being generated by smaller, more geographically distributed facilities that have the ability to switch from a power producer to a recipient of power generated by a variety of other disparate sources, including wind and solar installations.  Grid architecture must now accommodate end users that are both generators and consumers, converting back and forth rapidly and carrying power in both directions, something the existing grid was not originally designed to handle.  Technological advancements have produced sensors and smart devices to enable the new two-way grid and offer operators the ability to control and run the grid efficiently, safely and reliably.  Utilities, however, need wireless communication networks, technologies and solutions that can move the new large volumes of data generated by sensors and smart devices to their control systems for decision making, analytics and responsiveness to market demand and emergencies.  The legacy communications systems utilized by many utilities cannot handle this new data load, are inefficient and costly to maintain, as well as, in many cases, their associated equipment is approaching end of life.  
 To address the need for grid modernization in the utility industry, in mid-April 2018, we met with the FCC, together with representatives of Ameren Services Company, an affiliate of Ameren Corporation, a holding company for electric and gas utilities located in the Midwestern U.S., to support Ameren’s request for experimental authority from the FCC to test broadband operations utilizing our 900 MHz spectrum in the requested geographic areas.  Following this meeting, the FCC granted Ameren’s request for experimental authority, and we are currently supporting Ameren’s broadband trialing activities utilizing a 1.4 X 1.4 MHz 900 MHz broadband spectrum allocation in geographic areas in several Ameren markets located in Illinois and Missouri.    In contrast to legacy systems, the broadband networks, technologies and solutions that can be utilized with our spectrum assets can address the wireless communication demands of the modern grid, both now and in the future.  Our spectrum assets can serve as the foundational element to allow our critical infrastructure and enterprise customers to move from LTE to 5G.  Recent FCC decisions have created significant opportunities for blocks of shared, unlicensed spectrum, both below 1 GHz to a limited extent and, in very large amounts, above 1 GHz.  While we intend to build our existing and future business strategies around our 900 MHz licensed spectrum, the ability of our critical infrastructure and enterprise customers to combine our licensed 900 MHz spectrum with additional spectrum in one or more unlicensed bands can provide them with an optimal solution, and a path to 5G.  On the one hand, our licensed 900 MHz spectrum offers the assurance of absolute control over access to and use of that spectrum, allowing our spectrum to be utilized to provide customers with guaranteed levels of service and the ability to prescribe and enforce purpose-built “rules of the road” for the provision of those services.  On the other hand, the addition of unlicensed spectrum, particularly in large swaths that support very high-speed services, can enable future 5G networks, technologies and solutions.    Sales and Marketing
 Our sales and marketing organization currently consists of 8 employees.   In connection with our FCC initiatives, we are working to create awareness and demand by our targeted critical infrastructure and enterprise customers of the benefits of deploying private broadband networks, technologies and solutions utilizing our spectrum, assuming we are successful with our FCC initiatives.  Our sales and marketing strategy includes direct customer outreach by our sales organization, and support of industry organizations, like UBBA.  We are also exploring the creation of partnerships with manufacturers and suppliers of LTE networks, technologies and solutions designed to meet the needs of our targeted customers.
 Transfer of Historical Businesses
 Historically, we generated our revenue principally from our pdvConnect and TeamConnect businesses.  pdvConnect is a mobile communication and workforce management solution that enables businesses to locate and communicate with their field workers and improve the documentation of work events and job status.  We historically marketed pdvConnect primarily through two Tier 1 carriers in the United States.  In Fiscal 2016, we began offering a commercial push-to-talk (“PTT”) service, which we marketed as TeamConnect, in seven major metropolitan areas throughout the United States, including Atlanta, Baltimore/Washington, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, New York and Philadelphia.  We developed TeamConnect to address the needs of enterprises that value a tailored PTT solution addressing the management of their mobile workforce. We primarily offered our TeamConnect service to customers indirectly through third-party sales representatives who were primarily selected from Motorola’s nationwide dealer network.    In June 2018, we announced our plan to restructure the business to align and focus our business priorities on the spectrum initiatives aimed at modernizing and realigning the 900 MHz band to increase its usability and capacity, including for the future deployment of broadband and other advanced technologies and services. In December 2018, our board of directors approved the transfer of our TeamConnect and pdvConnect businesses to help reduce our operating costs and to allow our management team and company to focus on our FCC initiatives and future broadband opportunities.  Specifically, we entered into: (i) a Customer Acquisition and Resale Agreement with A BEEP LLC (“A BEEP”) on January 2, 2019, (ii) a Customer Acquisition, Resale and Licensing Agreement with Goosetown Enterprises (“Goosetown”), Inc. on January 2, 2019, and (iii) a memorandum of understanding (“MOU”) with the principals of Goosetown on December 31, 2018.    Under the A BEEP and Goosetown Agreements, we agreed to: (i) transfer our TeamConnect customers located in the Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Houston and Phoenix metropolitan markets to A BEEP, (ii) transfer our TeamConnect customers located in the Baltimore/Washington DC, Philadelphia and New York metropolitan markets to Goosetown, (iii) provide A BEEP and Goosetown with access to our TeamConnect Metro and Campus Systems (the, “MotoTRBO Systems”) and (iv) grant A BEEP and Goosetown the right to resell access to our MotoTRBO Systems pursuant to separate Mobile Virtual Network Operation arrangements for a two-year  Page 6

 
     period.  We also granted Goosetown a license to sell the business applications we developed for our TeamConnect service.    Under these agreements, A BEEP and Goosetown agreed to provide customer care, billing and collection services for their respective acquired customers.  We continued to provide these services through April 1, 2019 to help facilitate the transitioning of the acquired customers. Additionally, we are required to maintain and pay all site lease, backhaul and utility costs required to operate the MotoTRBO Systems for a two-year period.   As part of our efforts to clear the 900 MHz spectrum for broadband use, A BEEP and Goosetown are required to migrate the acquired customers off the MotoTRBO Systems over the two-year period.  In consideration for the customers and rights we transferred, A BEEP and Goosetown are required to pay us a certain portion of the recurring revenues they receive from the acquired customers ranging from 100% to 20% during the terms of the agreements.  Additionally, A BEEP is required to pay us a portion of recurring revenue from customers who utilize A BEEP’s push-to-talk Diga-Talk Plus application service ranging from 35% to 15% for a period of two years.  Goosetown is required to pay us 20% of recurring revenues from the TeamConnect applications we licensed for a period of two years.   As part of our obligations, we will continue operating the TeamConnect networks in the markets in which customers are being transferred and trunked facilities in other markets in which we hold FCC licenses.    Under the terms of the MOU, we agreed to assign the intellectual property rights to our TeamConnect and pdvConnect applications to TeamConnect LLC (the “LLC”), a new entity formed by the principals of Goosetown, in exchange for a 19.5% ownership interest in the LLC upon the April 30, 2019 execution of the LLC’s Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement.  The Goosetown principals have agreed to fund the future operations of the LLC, subject to certain limitations.  The LLC has assumed our software support and maintenance obligations under the Goosetown and A BEEP Agreements.  The LLC has also assumed customer care services related to our pdvConnect application.   We provided transition services to the LLC through April 1, 2019 to facilitate an orderly transition of the customer care services.  
 We are obligated to pay the LLC a monthly service fee for a 24-month period ending on January 7, 2021 for the assumption of the Company’s support obligations under the Goosetown and A BEEP Agreements.  We are also obligated to pay the LLC a certain portion of the billed revenue received by us from the pdvConnect customer for a 48-month period.    ﻿    Our Motorola Lease    In 2014, we entered into an agreement with Motorola to lease a portion of our 900 MHz licenses in exchange for an upfront, fully paid lease fee of $7.5 million.  Additionally, Motorola invested $10 million in our subsidiary, PDV Spectrum Holding Company, LLC, that we formed to hold our 900 MHz spectrum licenses.  Motorola’s ownership interest in our subsidiary is convertible, at the option of either Motorola or us, into shares of our common stock at a price equal to $20.00 per share. Motorola is not entitled to any profits, dividends or other distribution from the operations of our subsidiary. Under the terms of this lease agreement with Motorola, Motorola can use the leased channels to provide narrowband services to certain qualified end-users. The end-users can only use the leased channels for their own internal communication purposes. The end-users cannot sublease the channels to any other end-users or to any commercial radio system operations or carriers. The lease agreement limits the total number of channels that Motorola can lease in any market area. The lease agreement provides us with flexibility regarding the future use and management of our spectrum, including relocation and repurposing policies designed to facilitate any necessary re-alignment of frequencies that may be associated with our efforts to assemble contiguous spectrum for broadband uses.    Motorola cannot enter into contracts with end-users after December 31, 2020 involving new leases of spectrum from us without our consent and the payment of an additional fee. The initial lease period for any end-user cannot last more than seven years, and the lease can only be renewed for up to three years for an aggregate lease period of up to 10 years.  In addition, until December 31, 2020, we agreed that Motorola will have the right to provide the majority of the broadband equipment for any future 900 MHz LTE broadband network we deploy (if any), so long as certain conditions are satisfied, including that the equipment meets our required sourcing criteria.
 Our Intellectual Property
 We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade-secret laws, as well as confidentiality provisions in our contracts, to protect our intellectual property.  We have several trademarks and service marks to protect our current and future corporate name, services offerings, goodwill and brand. There are currently no claims or litigation regarding these trademarks, patents, copyrights, or service marks. We also rely on trade-secret protection of our intellectual property. We enter into confidentiality agreements with third parties, employees and consultants when appropriate. The Regulation of Our Business
 The FCC regulates the licensing, construction, operation and acquisition of our wireless operations and wireless spectrum holdings in the United States.  We hold FCC spectrum licenses in the 900 MHz band as a non-interconnected, SMR service provider.  As such, within the limitations of our spectrum holdings and available technology, we are authorized by the FCC to provide non-interconnected mobile communications services, including two-way radio dispatch, and mobile data and internet services. 
 Licensing. We are entitled to provide our wireless communication services on specified frequencies within specified geographic areas and in doing so must comply with the rules, regulations and policies adopted by the FCC. The FCC issues each 

 
 Page 7

 
     spectrum license for a fixed period of time, typically 10 years in the case of the FCC licenses we currently hold. While the FCC has generally renewed licenses held by operating companies like us, the FCC has authority to both revoke a license for cause and to deny a license renewal if it determines that a license renewal is not in the public interest. Furthermore, we could be subject to fines, forfeitures and other penalties for failure to comply with FCC regulations, even if any such non-compliance is unintentional. The loss of any licenses, or any related fines or forfeitures, could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.    The Communications Act of 1934, as amended, and FCC rules and regulations require us to obtain the FCC’s prior approval before assigning or transferring control of wireless licenses, with limited exceptions.  The FCC’s rules and regulations also govern spectrum lease arrangements for a range of wireless radio service licenses, including the licenses we hold. These same requirements apply to any licenses or leases we may wish to enter into, transfer or acquire as part of our broadband initiatives.  The FCC may prohibit or impose conditions on any proposed acquisitions, sales or other transfers of control of licenses or leases. The FCC engages in a case-by-case review of transactions that involve the consolidation or sale of spectrum licenses or leases and may apply a spectrum “screen” in examining such transactions. Because an FCC license is necessary to lawfully provide the wireless services we plan to enable, if the FCC were to disapprove any such request to acquire, assign or otherwise transfer a license or lease, our business plans would be adversely affected. Approval from the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice, as well as state or local regulatory authorities, also may be required if we sell or acquire spectrum.    FCC Regulations. The FCC does not currently regulate rates for services offered by wireless providers.  However, we may be subject to other FCC regulations that impose obligations on wireless providers, such as federal Universal Service Fund obligations, which require communications providers to contribute to a fund that supports subsidized communications services to underserved areas and users; rules governing billing, subscriber privacy and customer proprietary network information; roaming obligations; rules that require wireless service providers to configure their networks to facilitate electronic surveillance by law enforcement officials; rules governing spam, telemarketing and truth-in-billing; and rules requiring us to offer equipment and services that are accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities, among others. There are also pending proceedings that may affect spectrum aggregation limits and/or adjustment of the FCC’s case-by-case spectrum screens; regulation surrounding the deployment of advanced wireless broadband infrastructure; the imposition of text-to-911 capabilities; and the transition to IP networks, among others. Some of these requirements and pending proceedings (of which the foregoing examples are not an exhaustive list) pose technical and operational challenges to which we, and the industry as a whole, have not yet developed clear solutions. We are unable to predict how these pending or future FCC proceedings may affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our failure to comply with any applicable FCC regulations could subject us to significant fines or forfeitures.    State and Local Regulation. In addition to FCC regulation, we are subject to certain state regulatory requirements. The Communications Act of 1934, as amended, preempts state and local regulation of the entry of, or the rates charged by, any wireless provider. State and local governments, however, are permitted to manage public rights of way and can require fair and reasonable compensation from wireless providers for use of those rights of way so long as the compensation required is publicly disclosed by the government. The siting of base stations also remains subject to some degree of control by state and local jurisdiction. States also may impose competitively neutral requirements that, among other things, are necessary for universal service or to defray the costs of state E911 services programs, to protect the public safety and welfare, and to safeguard the rights of customers.    Tower Siting. Our future customers who deploy broadband networks will be required to comply with various federal, state and local regulations that govern the siting, lighting and construction of transmitter towers and antennas, including requirements imposed by the FCC and the Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”). Federal rules subject certain tower site locations to extensive zoning, environmental and historic preservation requirements and mandate consultation with various parties, including State and Tribal Historic Preservation Offices, which can make it more difficult and expensive to deploy facilities. The FCC antenna structure registration process also imposes public notice requirements when plans are made for construction of, or modification to, antenna structures that require FAA approval, potentially adding to the delays and burdens associated with tower siting, including potential challenges from special interest groups. To the extent governmental agencies continue to impose additional requirements like this on the tower siting process, the time and cost to construct towers could be negatively impacted. The FCC has, however, imposed a tower siting “shot clock” that requires local authorities to address tower applications within a specific timeframe, which can assist carriers in more rapid deployment of towers.  More recently, the FCC also has adopted rules intended to accelerate broadband deployment by removing barriers to infrastructure investment, in particular for “small cell” equipment.  Those rules have been challenged by certain municipalities and tribal nations both at the FCC and in court.
 Electronic Surveillance. Our clients who deploy broadband networks may be required by law to provide certain surveillance capabilities to law enforcement agencies. If required, we intend to deliver the requisite surveillance capabilities to law enforcement with respect to any networks we deploy.
 National Security. National security and disaster recovery issues continue to receive attention at the federal, state and local levels. For example, Congress is expected to again consider cyber security legislation to increase the security and resiliency of the nation’s digital infrastructure. In 2013, the President issued an executive order directing the Department of Homeland Security and other government agencies to take a number of steps to improve the security of the nation’s critical infrastructure. The details surrounding the implementation of this order have not been resolved, however, and we cannot predict the cost or other impacts of such measures. Moreover, the FCC continues to examine issues of network resiliency and reliability and may seek to impose additional regulations designed to reduce the severity and length of disruptions in communications.
