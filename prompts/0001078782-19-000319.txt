History 
 
iQSTEL, formerly known as PureSnax International, Inc., was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on June 24, 2011. PureSnax was previously a wellness brand focused on bringing healthy snacks and foods to consumers. On March 8, 2017, PureSnax exited a previous License Agreement with a Canadian snack food Licensor. From March of 2017 until its recent acquisition of Etelix.com USA, LLC, PureSnax was working to develop its own brand and its own products for manufacture, distribution, sales and marketing of various products within the health foods and snacks industry and to pursue related business opportunities. PureSnax acquired Etelix.com USA, LLC on June 25, 2018, as disclosed in the 8-K the company filed on June 28, 2018 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
 
In August 30, 2018, PureSnax changed its name to “iQSTEL Inc.” and received a new CUSIP number: 46265G107, as well as a new trading symbol “IQST” in order to better resemble its new name. iQSTEL also changed the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC Code) to 4813, Telephone Communications, Except Radiotelephone.
 
PureSnax 
 
PureSnax International Inc. was a wellness brand focused on bringing healthy snacks and foods to consumers. PureSnax planned to offer a wide assortment of sugar free, vegan, peanut free, Kosher, low fat, low sodium and Non-GMO certified products. With new nutritional standards being rolled out through schools in the United States, PureSnax believed to have been poised to capitalize on this new regulation by offering good-for-you, functional foods and snacks that met these new regulatory standards. Product categories include marshmallow squares (Vegan-made and Gelatin free), protein bars, mints, gums and various condiments as well as offering Xylitol, a natural, diabetic-friendly, sweetener. 
 
PureSnax intended to distribute delicious tasting, healthy snack foods meeting the highest of standards and compliance for the US consumers with plans to evolve into an international audience. With a socially responsible mandate supported by education and driven by integrity and sincerity, PureSnax planned to provide people with healthier snack and food choices by utilizing wholesome, natural, high quality ingredients that promote a healthier lifestyles. PureSnax chose to specialize in the development, sourcing, branding and distribution of high quality, healthy food and snack products. It was management’s vision to brand PureSnax International as one of the trusted names in the health food and snack industry.

With major illnesses, such as diabetes, obesity, cancer, and heart disease on the rise, people are looking for ways to minimize the risks of developing these diseases. People are starting to read and understand labels, looking for healthier choices. PureSnax believed that the demand for healthier products is driving a fundamental change in the food and snack markets. PureSnax believed the demand would provide enormous opportunities for PureSnax International to position itself in the healthy food and snack industry. 
 
After exiting a previous License Agreement with a Canadian snack food Licensor, and until its recent acquisition of Etelix.com USA, LLC, Puresnax was working to develop its own brand and its own products for manufacture, distribution, sales and marketing of various products within the health foods and snacks industry and to pursue related business opportunities. PureSnax was working to become pioneers in a dynamic and growing segment of the industry where management believed future demand would be. PureSnax believed that the snack products developed must not only meet healthy product guidelines but also taste good. Its Marshmallow Squares are sugar-free, Gluten-free, vegan, low-salt. kosher, nut free and taste great. PureSnax reported that it was developing and was constantly continuing to work on other recipes for healthier products that meet the highest standards of quality. 
 
During this new product developing stage, the opportunity to acquire Etelix.com USA, LLC, was presented to management and the board of directors of Puresnax International. After certain phone meetings with representatives of management and business plan presentations, management believed that, even though this acquisition represented a departure from the PureSnax’s business plan and core expertise, it was a better opportunity to create shareholder value, not just in the immediate but in the mid and long term than its current business. It was this thought process that Puresnax decided to enter the telecom industry and thus become a Telecommunications Service company. PureSnax acquired Etelix.com USA, LLC on June 25, 2018, and thus in that moment the company left the healthy snacks and foods business to focus on Telecommunications Business.
 
Transaction with Etelix.com USA LLC
 
On June 25, 2018, PureSnax entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement with Etelix.com USA, LLC, a privately held limited liability company incorporated under the laws of Florida (“Etelix”), and the members of Etelix.

Etelix as International Long-Distance voice services (ILD Wholesale) Operator:
 
Etelix provides International Long-Distance voice termination in the ILD Wholesale market through over 200 interconnections with telecommunication carriers, PSTNs, PTTs, Mobile Operators, Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNOs), Long Distance Operators and Long Distance Wholesale Carriers; supplying international connectivity and international call transit among all countries of the world. 
 
Etelix is interconnected to the most important players in the industry, among which it is worth mentioning the following: Verizon, KDDI, PCCW, Hutchinson, Flow Jamaica (Cable and Wireless Caribbean), Cable and Wireless Panama, Millicom (TIGO), Telefonica de España (Movistar), Telecom Italia (TIM), Portugal Telecom (MEU), Optimus (NOS), Belgacom (BICS), Deutsche Telekom, Vodafone India, Airtel, Reliance, Viettel, TATA Communications, iBasis, Orbitel, Entel, China Telecom, among many others.
 
The company provides 24x7 network monitoring through two Network Operation Centers (NOCs), one located in America and another one in Europe, with bilingual staff (English- Spanish). All network platforms (switches, billing platform, router engines, session border controllers, Data Base servers, ERP platform) are located in Miami Downtown, FL, and are accessed remotely from all employees around the world using a secure data connection.
 
The Industry ILD Wholesale
 
The International Long-Distance traffic market size is estimated at $13 Billion in annual revenue, with 552 Billion Minutes exchanged yearly (Note 1) (Note 2). It is estimated that Wholesale Carriers have a 68% total market share, carrying over 375 Billion Minutes per year (Note 1). The number of minutes carried by wholesale carriers has been increasing during the last few years mostly due to retail service providers, such as mobile operators, calling-card providers, and new VoIP-based market entrants, relying heavily on wholesale carriers to transport and terminate their customers’ international calls.
 
Since the year 2013 the market of traditional international long distance calls has been reducing its size in about 2-3% per year (Note 1) (Note 3). This recent decline comes to the hands of over-the-top (OTT) communication and app services. Consumers can choose from a broad range of smartphone based communications apps, including WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, WeChat, Viber, and Apple’s Facetime, among others.
 
However, the market is not experiencing a total migration of users to the new communication solutions; since the numbers reveal that the existence of these new services has increased the total number of international calls. In fact, it is estimated that today OTT applications account for a volume slightly higher than 550 million minutes per year on cross-border communications (Note 1). Which means that the market has doubled its total numbers to the existing ones before the appearance of these new solutions.
 
While average prices have been declining globally, rates to a few destinations particularly mobile in some emerging market countries remain high, strengthening wholesale revenues. A route-by-route comparison of international traffic with international wholesale revenues reveals destinations for which wholesale revenues are disproportionately high. For example, the France to Tunisia route accounts for 1.5% of revenues, but only 0.25% of volume. Similarly, The United States to Cuba route accounts for close to 2.6% of revenues while making up around 0.15% of volume. Africa accounted for approximately 10% of wholesale traffic, but 33% of wholesale revenues (Note 1).

ILD Wholesale Competitors
 
The wholesale industry is full of companies of all sizes and with many different business strategies and focus. We can classify the market in three segments:
Operators: in this segment are allocated the telecom companies with global presence like Verizon, Telefonica of Spain (Movistar), Telecom Italia Mobile (TIM), Vodafone, Orange, British Telecom, Telia, Deutsche Telekom, among few others. These companies are the most important traffic generators. These are the companies that account for most end users (individuals, small and home business, as well as, big corporations). Their main business is not international voice traffic, therefore their wholesale divisions are small business units in their structure. They hold the strongest position in the market, since they own the traffic and the most extended networks, but they do not really complete in the wholesale business, on the contrary, they are the potential customers that all wholesale carries want to be interconnected with.
Big Carriers: here are companies like TATA, iBasis, IDT, BTS, BICS (Belgacom). These are companies with global operations. Their only focus in on the wholesale industry and have no retail business at all or the offer on the retail segment is very limited. These companies have been expanding their commercial offerings including solutions for international roaming, international peering, SMS hubbing. They continue competing in the carrier business, but year after year, the contribution of the carrier business to their revenues is being lower; prioritizing the new business areas.
Medium and Small Carriers: this is the segment where Etelix is. This is the segment where we find the most amount of companies. The majority of these companies have a limited offer in terms of routes and capacity. Most of them work in two or three geographical markets (America and Asia; or Africa and Asia; Europe and America), but not all of them offer global coverage. In this segment we can find companies, like us, with a business strategy focused on becoming carriers with a real global offering, with termination capacity in all countries and commercial presence in every geographical market (America, Europe, Asia, Middle East and Africa).
 
Etelix is very well positioned to compete in the Medium and Small Carriers market segment. The Company is fully interconnected with dozens of Operators that have commercial presence in more than one geographical markets, thus allowing Etelix to offer a truly international and global voice service. Etelix business strategy is benchmarked against the Top 10 Big Carries in order to allow Etelix to grow into this top 10 carriers in next few years.
 
Etelix ILD Wholesale Business Plan
 
Etelix’s current market share is less than 0.1%; consequently, Etelix has space to grow to several times its current size. With a methodical execution of its business plan and an adequate level of capitalization, the company believes that Etelix can maintain a steady growth rate (>45% year over year) well beyond 2018.
 
Etelix has outlined a business plan based on the following lines of actions:
 
Strengthen the commercial position in Latin America where the company has developed deep commercial and personal relationships since its inception. Latin America, including the Caribbean region, concentrates 28% (*) of the termination traffic in the industry. For that reason, the company plans to continue working on keeping a strong presence in the region. 
 

Deepen market presence in Asia and Africa: These are new markets for the company. Africa is currently the market with the highest contribution to operating margins and Asia concentrates one third of the termination traffic in the industry. In 2016 the Company established a new office in Europe (La Coruña, Spain) making this the first move in our strategy to penetrate these two new markets. Estimations show that 56% (Note 4) of the traffic terminating in Africa is originated from customers in Europe, so establishing a commercial point of presence in Europe is designed to put the company closer to the customer traffic. 
 

The new office in Spain is also believed to strengthen the development of the Asian market, since 37% (Note 4) of the traffic that terminates in that region is originated in Europe while 62% (Note 4) is originated from America where company already has a strong presence. 

8


 

Continue working on establishing global recognition to facilitate new markets presence. 


Develop new products associated with the wholesale business. 


Strengthen commercial relations with the main international traffic generators.

Etelix as Submarine Fiber Optic Network capacity provider for 4G and 5G
 
An important milestone in the evolution of Etelix was in 2013, when the company was part of a consortium of major carriers for the upgrade of the Maya-1 submarine cable systems that runs from Hollywood, Florida to the city of Tolu in Colombia. This consortium was led by Orange Telecom and Orbitel, where Etelix participated with 10 Gbps of capacity. The bulk of this contract was sold to Millicom (Tigo Costa Rica). This capacity considerably enhanced Tigo’s ability to deploy world-class 4G services to its customers in Costa Rica. 
 
The growing demand for internet connections in 4G and 5G in Latin America opened the need to increase the connectivity between Latin America and the USA, which is where most of the internet content that users are looking for in Latin America is. This is the reason that Etelix will focus on finding business opportunities to acquire capacity in submarine cables in the region, participating as an Internet provider for 4G and 5G networks deployments in Latin America.
 
Etelix Operational and Commercial Highlights from Jan 2018 to December 2018
 
With the entrance to new technologies as over-the-top (OTT) communication and app services. Consumers can choose from a broad range of smartphone based communications apps, including WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, WeChat, Viber, and Apple’s Facetime, among others, the variety and quality of services of telecommunications companies have increased and profit margins have decreased, therefore, telecommunications companies have been forced in all areas to innovate in their products and how to do business and adapt their organizations creating better and more efficient tools to maintain organizational flexibility and serve to their customers.
 
In the particular case of Etelix we have not been oblivious to the reality of the market and that has forced us to reorganize operationally and commercially to respond more efficiently to the needs of our customers, optimizing our costs, striving for the implementation of modern management tools and obviously innovating in the development of new products; search for new clients and ways of doing business. On that regards we want to highlight the following:
 
i. Evolution in Management Tools:
 
a)
Implementation of the most up-to-date version of the traffic quality monitoring system Arptel, which has allowed us to be more efficient in the quality monitoring of our clients' services. 
 
b)
Definition of internal needs, evaluation of existing tools in the market and selection of a telecommunication voice exchange platform for the management of company's business, which is expected to be implemented in the first half of 2019. The implementation of this new state-of-the-art platform will allow us to integrate most of our technical, commercial, accounting and financial activities, responding in a more efficient and effective way to our clients and reducing in approx. 9% of the company's operating costs. 
 
ii. Operational and Commercial Reorganization:
 
a) Restructuring of the operations team and network management in the sense of optimizing its size, guaranteeing first and foremost the provision of the service 24/7 365 days and providing the necessary backups to operate in case of any contingency.
 
b) Restructuring of the commercial management team in order to ensure faster customer service, adequate support in the pre-sales and after-sales processes, and reducing the communication problems due to time zone location to our customers located in America, and those located into the time zone in Europe, Africa or Asia.
 
c)
Review of the variable compensation systems for the commercial team in such a way that the growth of the businesses is stimulated within the sales force. 

9



iii. New products and customers and innovation in the way of doing business:
 
a)
Review of the schemes to do business with our clients with a clear orientation to the minimization of the portfolio risk, reduction of the rotation times of accounts receivable and stabilization of the rotation times of accounts payable. 
 
b)
Development of new destinations for international long distance traffic in Africa and Asia such as Yemen, Eritrea, UAE, Ghana, Saudi Arabia among others. 
 
c)
Establishment of commercial relationships with important players in the telecommunications market, among which we highlight Vodafone India and Shenglitel, 
 
d)
Reactivation of business relationships with leading global telecommunications operators, among which we highlight the cases of Airtel, Reliance, China Telecom, Hutchinson, with whom business relationships were quite diminished. 
 
e)
Establishment of long distance voice products adjusted to operators that exclusively provide services to call centers. 
 
As a result of the tasks mentioned above and the management developed by the entire Etelix team in 2018, we would like to highlight the following facts:
 
i.
Growth of destinations and volumes of international voice traffic for companies specialized in providing call center services which allowed the growth of our services in countries such as Peru, USA, UK, Canada, China, Hong Kong, Singapore. 
 
ii.
Consolidation of Etelix as a leading player in the international voice transit markets in African destinations such as Eritrea and Madagascar, which were instrumental in growing the company's revenues in 2018. 
 
iii. 
Reduction of almost 50% in the indicator related to billing losses and / or non-recovered portfolio. 
 
Finally, we would like to highlight the company's participation in some important industry events during 2018, such as:
 
i. 
International Telecoms Week, May 2018 at the Hyatt Regency Hotel, Chicago USA. 
 
ii. 
Andicom, October 2018 at the Convention Center Cartagena, Colombia 
 
iQSTEL Blockchain Payment Solution Project (Blockchain PSP)
 
iQSTEL plans to take advantage of the experience Etelix has in the Telecommunications business specifically in ILD Wholesale market to develop a payment platform for the International Long-Distance Telecommunications (ILD Wholesale) Operators through the use of “iQSTEL Token” for payments among Operators reducing the time and costs of payments, settlement and reconciliation for ILD Wholesale voice exchange services, thanks to the use of the Blockchain protocol on-line/real-time, using the iQSTEL Blockchain PSP.
 
In order to be part of the iQSTEL Blockchain PSP ecosystem the Operators need to have the iQSTEL Blockchain PSP installed in connection with its voice exchange switching system and iQSTEL Token wallet with positive balance. Only iQSTEL will process the exchange for the iQSTEL Tokens into US$ and/or Euros.
 
Estimated Benefits of iQSTEL Blockchain PSP
 

Reduction of credit risk, since all sales can be considered as “cash sales”. 
 
Reduction of losses due to bad debts, since the collection is in real time. 
 
Elimination of bank transfer fees, since they disappear with the use of iQSTEL Token. 
 
Elimination of all costs related to the use of trade insurance policies since they are no longer necessary. All sales are “cash sales” on-line/real-time. 
 
Reduction of losses due to disputes, since all sale will be cashed in real time. Potential disputes are detected very early in the settlement process. 
 
10



Blockchain PSP Business Opportunity
 
The total revenue in the ILD Wholesale industry is approximately $13 Billion per year. Our own estimations indicate the industry is spending about 0.7% of revenue ($91 Million per year) on costs associated to bad debt collections, disputes, bank transfer fees, trade insurance policies, among other concepts. The company believes that iQSTEL strategy will be offering the Blockchain PSP providing huge savings, faster process, and secure exchange to the ILD Wholesale industry to get a participation of the $91 Million per year that the ILD Wholesale industry spends. 
 
iQSTEL Blockchain knowledge
 
Management and current staff of the Company do not have all the necessary knowledge to develop the Blockchain PSP on their own. The identified business opportunity has been made based on the operational knowledge of the ILD business that Etelix has and based on conceptual knowledge of blockchain.
 In this sense, for the development of this iQSTEL PSP Project, the Company will require the incorporation of tools, personnel and specific knowledge on blockchain applications; security, transfer and registration of digital assets in blockchain, and smart contracts, among other technical elements.
 
Initially a proof of concept will be developed in order to estimate the necessary time and total costs for the complete development of the project.
 
iQSTEL Blockchain PSP Risks
 
It is appropriate to emphasize that iQSTEL cannot assure the delivery of a Blockchain PSP project fully operational and also cannot assure that potential users of the Blockchain PSP will recognize its usefulness, will trust in it and adopt it.
 
Blockchain PSP Timing
 
iQSTEL plans to begin with the design of the Blockchain PSP by 2Q of 2019.
 
Acquisitions
 
On April 1, 2019, we entered into a Company Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) by and between the our company and the Ralf Kohler (the “Seller”), which agreement provides for the purchase of 51% of the equity and certain assets of SwissLink Carrier AG (“SwissLink”) (www.swisslink-carrier.com), a Swiss corporation, by our company. 
 
The consideration for the acquisition consists of $500,000 USD, payable as follows:
 

$50,000 USD shall be paid in cash upon execution of the Purchase Agreement; and 
 

The balance of $450,000 USD shall be paid at Closing in the form of 187,500 shares of common stock in our company based upon an agreed upon price of $2.40 per share. Additional shares may be payable at Closing, if our stock is valued at less than $2.40 per share, to account for the full $450,000 USD. 
 
Under the Purchase Agreement, the acquisition includes both the 51% equity interest in SwissLink and what are referred to as Additional Assets, which include telecommunications equipment, telecommunications platform software for international long distance voice exchange (VAMP) designed by Swisslink, intellectual rights of the VAMP, receivables, cash in banks, interconnection and service agreements, company information in file and telecommunication license rights for Switzerland.
 
SwissLink is indebted to the Seller in the principal amount of CHF 200,000 (approximately $ 200,514.19 USD) as evidenced by a loan agreement dated December 22th, 2019. Under the Purchase Agreement, SwissLink is to repay the full amount of principal plus interest in two years from execution of the Purchase Agreement. 
 
At the execution of this Purchase Agreement, SwissLink has a debt with the Seller of CHF 1,937,077 (approximately $1,941,893.41 USD) by December 31th 2018. With the acquisition of the 51% of the equity of SwissLink, we are acquiring 51% of the loan for the payment of CHF 0.51 (approximately $ 0.51 USD) to the Seller, meaning that after the execution of this Purchase Agreement, SwissLink owes to the Seller CHF 949,167.73 (approximately $ 951,432.22 USD) that represent the 49% of the debt, and at the same time, Swisslink owes us CHF 987,909.27 (approximately $ 990,236.62 USD) that represent the 51% of this debt.

11



Further under the Purchase Agreement, we have secured an option to, exercisable at 365 days from Closing, to acquire the remaining 49% interest in SwissLink. The Purchase Agreement outlines the purchase price, which is estimated at minimum of $750,000 USD. 
 
The parties to the Purchase Agreement further agreed to extend employment agreements of SwissLink to two individuals at SwissLink for a period of three years, and to Mr. Ralf Kohler (The Seller) for a period of five years as CEO/COO.

Regulations
 
Telecommunications services are subject to extensive government regulation in the United States. Any violations of the regulations may subject us to enforcement actions, including interest and penalties. The FCC has jurisdiction over all telecommunications common carriers to the extent they provide interstate or international communications services, including the use of local networks to originate or terminate such services
Regulation of Telecom by the Federal Communications Commission
 
Telecommunication license
 
Anyone seeking to conduct telecommunications business where the telecommunication services will transpire between the United States and an international destination must obtain a license from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). This particular license is named a Section 214 license, after the section in the Communications Act of 1934.
 
Etelix.com USA, LLC was authorized by the Federal Communications Commission to provide facility-based services in accordance with section 63.18(e)(1) of the Commission’s rules; and also to provide resale services in accordance with section 63.18(e)(2) under license number ITC-214-20090625-00303.
 
Since Etelix has no other network infrastructure outside the United States, no other licenses are required to us to operate as an international carrier service provider.
 
Universal Service and Other Regulatory Fees and Charges
 
In 1997, the FCC issued an order, referred to as the Universal Service Order, which requires all telecommunications carriers providing interstate telecommunications services to contribute to universal service support programs administered by the FCC (known as the Universal Service Fund). These periodic contributions are currently assessed based on a percentage of each contributor’s interstate and international end user telecommunications revenues reported to the FCC. Etelix also contribute to several other regulatory funds and programs, most notably Telecommunications Relay Service and FCC Regulatory Fees (collectively, the Other Funds). Due to the manner in which these contributions are calculated, we cannot be assured that we fully recover from our customers all of our contributions.

In addition, based on the nature of our current business, we receive certain exemptions from federal Universal Service Fund contributions. Changes in our business could eliminate our ability to qualify for some or all of these exemptions. Changes in regulation may also have an impact on the availability of some or all of these exemptions. If even some of these exemptions become unavailable, they could materially increase our federal Universal Service Fund or Other Funds’ contributions and have a material adverse effect on the cost of our operations and, therefore, on our ability to continue to operate profitably, and to develop and grow our business. We cannot be certain of the stability of the contribution factors for the Other Funds. Significant increases in the contribution factor for the Other Funds in general and the Telecommunications Relay Service Fund in particular can impact our profitability. Whether these contribution factors will be stable in the future is unknown, but it is possible that we will be subject to significant increases.
